'''Food safety'''<ref>[http://factsonfile.infobasepublishing.com/BookSearch.asp?pageID=2&bookType2=H&ISBN=0816069689&searchText=satin&parent=&productType=&sortType=&Filter=Desc Satin, M., ''Food Alert: The Ultimate Sourcebook for Food Safety'', Facts on File, Inc., September 2008, 2nd ed.]</ref> is a scientific discipline describing handling, [[food processing|preparation]], and storage of [[food]] in ways that prevent [[foodborne illness]]. This includes a number of routines that should be followed to avoid potentially severe [[health|health hazards]]. [[Food]] can transmit [[disease]] from person to person as well as serve as a growth medium for [[bacterium|bacteria]] that can cause [[food poisoning]]. Debates on genetic food safety include such issues as impact of [[genetically modified food]] on health of further generations and genetic pollution of environment, which can destroy natural biological diversity. In developed countries there are intricate standards for food preparation, whereas in [[lesser developed countries]] the main issue is simply the availability of adequate [[safe water]], which is usually a critical item.<ref>I. A. Shiklomanov, [http://www.bvsde.paho.org/bvsacg/fulltext/worldr.pdf ''Appraisal and Assessment of World Water Resources''], Water International 25(1): 11–32, 2000</ref> In theory food poisoning is 100% preventable.

==Key principles==
===Five key principles===
The five key principles of food hygiene, according to [[WHO]], are:<ref>[http://www.who.int/foodsafety/consumer/5keys/en/index.html WHO | Prevention of foodborne disease: Five keys to safer food]. Who.int. Retrieved on 2010-12-10.</ref>
# Prevent contaminating food with [[pathogens]] spreading from people, pets, and pests.
# Separate raw and cooked foods to prevent contaminating the cooked foods.
# Cook foods for the appropriate length of time and at the appropriate temperature to kill pathogens.
# Store food at the proper temperature.
# Use safe water and raw materials

===ISO 22000===
[[ISO 22000]] is a standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization dealing with food safety. This is a general derivative of [[ISO 9000]].
ISO 22000 standard: The ISO 22000 international standard specifies the requirements for a food safety management system that involves '''interactive communication, system management, prerequisite programs, [[HACCP]] principles.'''

==Incidence==
A 2003 World Health Organization (WHO) report concluded that about 40% of reported [[food poisoning]] outbreaks in the WHO European Region occur in private homes.<ref>[http://www.euro.who.int/eprise/main/who/mediacentre/PR/2003/20031212_2] {{Dead link |date=December 2010}}</ref>  According to the [[WHO]] and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], in the USA alone, annually, there are 76 million cases of foodborne illness leading to 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths.<ref>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs237/en/ WHO | Food safety and foodborne illness]. Who.int. Retrieved on 2010-12-10.</ref>

==Regulatory agencies==
===Australia===
[http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/ Australian Food Authority] is working toward ensuring that all food businesses implement food safety systems to ensure food is safe to consume in a bid to halt the increasing incidence of food poisoning, this includes basic food safety training for at least one person in each business.
Smart business operators know that basic food safety training improves the bottom line, staff take more pride in their work; there is less waste; and customers can have more confidence in the food they consume.
Food Safety training in units of competence from a relevant training package, must be delivered by a Registered Training Organization (RTO) to enable staff to be issued with a nationally-recognised unit of competency code on their certificate. Generally this training can be completed in less than one day.
Training options are available to suit the needs of everyone. Training may be carried out in-house for a group, in a public class, via correspondence or online.
Basic food safety training includes:

*Understanding the hazards associated with the main types of food and the conditions to prevent the growth of bacteria which can cause food poisoning
*The problems associated with product packaging such as leaks in vacuum packs, damage to packaging or pest infestation, as well as problems and diseases spread by pests.
*Safe food handling. This includes safe procedures for each process such as receiving, re-packing, food storage, preparation and cooking, cooling and re-heating, displaying products, handling products when serving customers, packaging, cleaning and sanitizing, pest control, transport and delivery. Also the causes of cross contamination.
*Catering for customers who are particularly at risk of food-borne illness, including allergies and intolerance.
*Correct cleaning and sanitizing procedures, cleaning products and their correct use, and the storage of cleaning items such as brushes, mops and cloths.
*Personal hygiene, hand washing, illness, and protective clothing.

People responsible for serving unsafe food can be liable for heavy fines under this new leglislation, consumers are pleased that industry will be forced to take food safety seriously.

===China===
{{Main|Food safety in the People's Republic of China}}

Food safety is a growing concern in [[Agriculture in China|Chinese agriculture]]. The Chinese government oversees agricultural production as well as the manufacture of food packaging, containers, chemical additives, drug production, and business regulation. In recent years, the Chinese government attempted to consolidate food regulation with the creation of the [[State Food and Drug Administration]] in 2003, and officials have also been under increasing public and international pressure to solve food safety problems. However, it appears that regulations are not well known by the trade. Labels used for "green" food, "organic" food and "pollution-free" food are not well recognized by traders and many are unclear about their meaning. A survey by the World Bank found that supermarket managers had difficulty in obtaining produce that met safety requirements and found that a high percentage of produce did not comply with established standards.<ref>World Bank and China Agriculture Press. 2005. [http://www.worldbank.org.cn/English/Content/Food_Safety_Publication.pdf] China’s Compliance with Food Safety Requirements for Fruits and Vegetables:
Promoting Food Safety, Competitiveness, and Poverty Reduction.</ref>

Traditional marketing systems, whether in China or the rest of Asia, presently provide little motivation or incentive for individual farmers to make improvements to either quality or safety as their produce tends to get grouped together with standard products as it progresses through the marketing channel. Direct linkages between farmer groups and traders or ultimate buyers, such as [[supermarkets]], can help avoid this problem. Governments need to improve the condition of many markets through upgrading management and reinvesting market fees in physical infrastructure. [[Wholesale marketing|Wholesale markets]] need to investigate the feasibility of developing separate sections to handle fruits and vegetables that meet defined safety and quality standards.<ref>Andrew W. Shepherd, 2006. [http://www.fao.org/ag/ags/subjects/en/agmarket/docs/agsfop11.pdf] Quality and safety in the traditional horticultural marketing chains of Asia. FAO, Rome</ref>

===European Union===
The parliament of the [[European Union]] (EU) makes legislation in the form of directives and regulations, many of which are mandatory for member states and which therefore must be incorporated into individual countries' national legislation.  As a very large organisation that exists to remove barriers to trade between member states, and into which individual member states have only a proportional influence, the outcome is often seen as an excessively bureaucratic 'one size fits all' approach.  However, in relation to food safety the tendency to err on the side of maximum protection for the consumer may be seen as a positive benefit.  The EU parliament is informed on food safety matters by the [[European Food Safety Authority]].

Individual member states may also have other legislation and controls in respect of food safety, provided that they do not prevent trade with other states, and can differ considerably in their internal structures and approaches to the regulatory control of food safety.

===Germany===
The [[Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection]] (BMELV)<ref>{{cite web |title=German Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection |url=http://www.bmelv.de/}}</ref> is a Federal Ministry of the Federal Republic of Germany. 
'''History''': Founded as Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Foresting in 1949, this name did not change until 2001. Then the name changed to Federal Ministry of Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture. At the 22nd of November 2005, the name got changed again to its current state: Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection. The reason for this last change was that all the resorts should get equal ranking which was achieved by sorting the resorts alphabetically.
'''Vision''': A balanced and healthy diet with safe food, distinct consumer rights and consumer information for various areas of life, and a strong and sustainable agriculture as well as perspectives for our rural areas are important goals of the Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (BMELV).
The Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety is under the control of the Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection. It exercises several duties, with which it contributes to safer food and thereby intensifies health-based consumer protection in Germany. Food can be manufactured and sold within Germany without a special permission, as long as it does not cause any damage on consumers’ health and meets the general standards set by the legislation. However, manufacturers, carriers, importers and retailers are responsible for the food they pass into circulation. They are obliged to ensure and document the safety and quality of their food with the use of in-house control mechanisms.

===Hong Kong===
In [[Hong Kong SAR]], the [[Centre for Food Safety]] is in charge of ensuring food sold is safe and fit for consumption.

===Pakistan===
Pakistan does not have an integrated legal framework but has a set of laws, which deals with various aspects of food safety. These laws, despite the fact that they were enacted long time ago, have tremendous capacity to achieve at least minimum level of food safety. However, like many other laws, these laws remain very poorly enforced. There are four laws that specifically deal with food safety. Three of these laws directly focus issues related to food safety, while the fourth one namely Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority Act, is indirectly relevant to food safety. The Pure Food Ordinance, 1960 consolidates and amends the law in relation to the preparation and the sale of foods. All provinces and some northern areas have adopted this law with certain amendments. Its aim is to ensure purity of food being supplied to people in the market and, therefore, provides for preventing adulteration. The Pure Food Ordinance 1960 does not apply to cantonment areas. There is separate law for cantonments called "The Cantonment Pure Food Act, 1966". There is no substantial difference between the Pure Food Ordinance 1960 and The Cantonment Pure Food Act. Even the rules of operation are very much similar. Pakistan Hotels and Restaurant Act, 1976 applies to all hotels and restaurants in Pakistan and seeks to control and regulate the rates and standard of service(s) by hotels and restaurants. In addition to other provisions, under section 22(2), the sale of food or beverages that are contaminated, not prepared hygienically or served in utensils that are not hygienic or clean is an offense. There are no express provisions for consumer complaints in the Pakistan Restaurants Act, 1976, Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 and Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority Act, 1996. However, the laws do not prevent citizens from lodging complaints with the concerned government officials. However, the consideration and handling of complaints is a matter of discretion of the officials.<ref>Mazhar Siraj, 2004,http://www.crcp.org.pk/doc_files/Food%20Safety%20Legislation%20in%20Pakistan.doc, Consumer Rights Commission of Pakistan.</ref>

===South Korea===
====Korea Food & Drug Administration====
[[Korea Food & Drug Administration]] (KFDA)<ref>{{cite web |title=Korea Food & Drug Administration |url=http://www.kfda.go.kr/}}</ref> is working for food safety since 1945. It is part of the [[Government of South Korea]].

IOAS<ref>{{cite web |title=Feb 14 IFOAM Accr list.pdf |url=http://eng.kfda.go.kr/admin_content/kfda/libs/download.php?av_id=ENG_RULE&savename=20080219_14_1.pdf&filename=Feb%2014%20IFOAM%20Accr%20list.pdf}}</ref>-Organic Certification Bodies Registered in KFDA: "Organic" or related claims can be labelled on food products when organic certificates are considered as valid by KFDA. KFDA admits organic certificates which can be issued by 1) IFOAM (International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movement) accredited certification bodies 2) Government accredited certification bodies - 328 bodies in 29 countries have been registered in KFDA.

Food Import Report: According to Food Import Report<ref>{{cite web |title=Foods Import Report Guide |url=http://eng.kfda.go.kr/admin_content/kfda/libs/download.php?av_id=ENG_RULE&savename=20101022_18_1.pdf&filename=Foods%20Import%20Report%20Guide.pdf}}</ref>, it is supposed to report or register what you import. Competent authority is as followed:
 * Imported Agricultural Products, Processed Foods, Food Additives, Utensils, Containers & Packages or Health Functional Foods
   → KFDA (Korea Food and Drug Administration)
 * Imported Livestock, Livestock products (including Dairy products)
   → NVRQS (National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service) -
   Packaged meat, milk & dairy products (butter, cheese), hamburger patties, meat ball and other processed products
   which are stipulated by Livestock Sanitation Management Act
 * Imported Marine products
   → NFIS (National Fisheries Products Quality Inspection Service) -
   Fresh, chilled, frozen, salted, dehydrated, eviscerated marine produce which can be recognized its characteristics

====National Institute of Food and Drug Safety Evaluation====
National Institute of Food and Drug Safety Evaluation (NIFDS)<ref>{{cite web |title=National Institute of Food and Drug Safety Evaluation |url=http://www.nifds.go.kr/}}</ref> is functioning as well.
The National Institute of Food and Drug Safety Evaluation is a national organization for toxicological tests and research. Under the Korea Food & Drug Administration, the Institute performs research on toxicology, pharmacology, and risk analysis of foods, drugs, and their additives. The Institute strives primarily to understand important biological triggering mechanisms and improve assessment methods of human exposure, sensitivities, and risk by (1) conducting basic, applied, and policy research that closely examines biologically triggering harmful effects on the regulated products such as foods, food additives, and drugs, and (2) operating the national toxicology program for the toxicological test development and inspection of hazardous chemical ubstances assessments. The Institute ensures safety by (1) investigation and research on safety by its own researchers, (2) contract research by external academicians and research centers.

===United States===
{{tasks
|expand= [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Food_safety#Changing_USA_Regulations USA regulations]
}}
The US food system is regulated by numerous federal, state and local officials.  Although the US food safety system is one of the best in the world, it is lacking in "organization, regulatory tools, and resources to address food borne illness."<ref>Becker, Geoffrey, The Federal Food Safety System: A primer, Congressional Research Service, 4/10/10</ref>

==== Federal level regulation ====
The [[Food and Drug Administration]] publishes the Food Code, a model set of guidelines and procedures that assists food control jurisdictions by providing a scientifically sound technical and legal basis for regulating the retail and food service industries, including [[restaurants]], [[grocery stores]] and institutional foodservice providers such as [[nursing homes]]. Regulatory agencies at all levels of government in the United States use the FDA Food Code to develop or update food safety rules in their jurisdictions that are consistent with national food regulatory policy. According to the FDA, 48 of 56 [[US State|states]] and [[US Territories|territories]], representing 79% of the U.S. population, have adopted food codes patterned after one of the five versions of the Food Code, beginning with the 1993 edition.<ref name=>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/foodcode.html#intro |title=FDA Food Code |author= |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]] |date=2007-10-05 |accessdate=2008-09-01 |quote=}}</ref>

In the United States, federal regulations governing food safety are fragmented and complicated, according to a February 2007 report from the Government Accountability Office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d07449t.pdf|title=GAO-07-449T, Federal Oversight of Food Safety|format=PDF}}</ref> There are 15 agencies sharing oversight responsibilities in the food safety system, although the two primary agencies are the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]] (FSIS), which is responsible for the safety of meat, poultry, and processed egg products, and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), which is responsible for virtually all other foods.

The Food Safety and Inspection Service has approximately 7,800 inspection program personnel working in nearly 6,200 federally inspected meat, poultry and processed egg establishments. FSIS is charged with administering and enforcing the Federal [[Meat Inspection Act]], the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Egg Products Inspection Act, portions of the [[Agricultural Marketing Act]], the [[Humane Slaughter Act]], and the regulations that implement these laws. FSIS inspection program personnel inspect every animal before slaughter, and each carcass after slaughter to ensure public health requirements are met.  In fiscal year (FY) 2008, this included about 50 billion pounds of livestock carcasses, about 59 billion pounds of poultry carcasses, and about 4.3 billion pounds of processed egg products. At U.S. borders, they also inspected 3.3 billion pounds of imported meat and poultry products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/PDF/Testimony_Petersen_031109.pdf|title=FSIS Testimony, March 11, 2009|format=PDF}}</ref>

=====Industry pressure=====
There have been concerns over the efficacy of safety practices and food industry pressure on U.S. regulators. A study reported by Reuters found that "the food industry is jeopardizing U.S. public health by withholding information from food safety investigators or pressuring regulators to withdraw or alter policy designed to protect consumers". A survey found that 25% of U.S. government inspectors and scientists surveyed have experienced during the past year corporate interests forcing their food safety agency to withdraw or to modify agency policy or action that protects consumers. Scientists have observed that management undercuts field inspectors who stand up for food safety against industry pressure. According to Dr. Dean Wyatt, a USDA veterinarian who oversees federal slaughter house inspectors, "Upper level management does not adequately support field inspectors and the actions they take to protect the food supply. Not only is there lack of support, but there's outright obstruction, retaliation and abuse of power."<ref>Reuters, 14 September 2010, "Industry Has Sway Over Food Safety System: U.S. Study," http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE68C39320100913 free archived version at: http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2010/09/14-1</ref>

====State and local regulation====
A number of U.S. [[States of the United States|states]] have their own meat inspection programs that substitute for USDA inspection for meats that are sold only in-state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/regulations_&_policies/state_inspection_programs/index.asp|title=FSIS State Inspection Programs}}</ref> Certain state programs have been criticized for undue leniency to bad practices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerfed.org/pdfs/CFA_stmt_on_OIG_report_state_inspected_meat_9.28.06.pdf|title=USDA Allowed State Meat Inspection Programs To Operate Even After Finding Cutting Boards Contaminated With Old Meat And Soot-Like Residues On Swine Carcasses.|format=PDF}}</ref>

However, other state food safety programs supplement, rather than replace, Federal inspections, generally with the goal of increasing consumer confidence in the state's produce. For example, state health departments have a role in investigating outbreaks of food-borne disease bacteria, as in the case of the 2006 outbreak of [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|''Escherichia coli'' O157:H7]] (bad ''E. coli'' bacteria) from processed spinach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.applications.dhs.ca.gov/pressreleases/store/pressreleases/06-76.html|title=State Health Department announces test results: Match genetic fingerprints to E. coli outbreak, Press Release, ben 0987, 8765.}}</ref> Health departments also promote better food processing practices to eliminate these threats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhs.ca.gov/fdb/HTML/food/Education%20Unit/ETU%20Info%20Page/ETU%20Homepage.htm|title=CDHS Education Training Unit}}</ref>

In addition to the [[US Food and Drug Administration]], several states that are major producers of fresh fruits and vegetables (including [[California]], [[Arizona]] and [[Florida]]) have their own state programs to test produce for [[pesticide]] residues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/dept/factshts/residu2.pdf|title=Pesticides and food: How we test for safety. California Department of Pesticide Regulation, June 2003.|format=PDF}}</ref>

[[Restaurants]] and other retail food establishments fall under state law and are regulated by state or local health departments. Typically these regulations require official inspections of specific design features, best food-handling practices, and certification of food handlers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/rii/index.shtml|title=New York Restaurant Inspection Information}}</ref> In some places a letter grade or numerical score must be prominently posted following each inspection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthylivingnyc.com/article/26|title=NYC Health Dept. Launches Restaurant Cleanliness Certificate}}</ref> In some localities, inspection deficiencies and remedial action are posted on the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthspace.ca/Clients/VDH/Fairfax/Fairfax_Website.nsf/food-frameset|title=A Guide to Food Safety Practices in Virginia Restaurants}}</ref>

==Manufacturing control==
===HACCP guidelines===
<!-- Moved from Sterilization (microbiology) article -->
{{Main|Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points}}

The [[Food Standards Agency|UK Food Standards Agency]] publishes recommendations as part of its Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points ([[Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points|HACCP]]) programme. The relevant guidelines<ref>[http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/csctcooking.pdf Cooking]</ref> state that:

<blockquote>
"'''Cooking food until the CORE TEMPERATURE is 75 °C or above will ensure that harmful bacteria are destroyed.'''<br />
However, lower cooking temperatures are acceptable provided that the '''CORE''' '''TEMPERATURE''' '''is maintained for a specified period of time''' as follows :<br />
* 60 °C for a minimum of 45 minutes
* 65 °C for a minimum of 10 minutes
* 70 °C for a minimum of 2 minutes"
</blockquote>

Previous guidance from a leaflet produced by the UK Department Of Health “Handling Cooked Meats Safely A Ten Point Plan” also allowed for:
<blockquote>
*"75 °C for a minimum of 30 seconds
* 80 °C for a minimum of 6 seconds"
</blockquote>
as well as the above. Secondary references for the above may be found at<ref> [http://www.rushcliffe.gov.uk/doc.asp?cat=8455 Handling Cooked Meats]</ref>
<ref>[http://www.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/fs1694b.pdf ]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.wiganmbc.gov.uk/pub/ehcp/eh/commlflt/cookmeat.pdf] This document states that: "This publication may be freely reproduced, except for advertising, endorsement or likely that, in the interests of good customer relations they will be commercial purposes.

Note that recommended cooking conditions are only appropriate if initial bacterial numbers in the uncooked food are small. Cooking does not overcome poor hygiene.

==Consumer labeling==
=== United Kingdom ===
Food stuffs in the UK have one of two labels to indicate the nature of the deterioration of the product and any subsequent health issues.  EHO Food Hygiene certification is required to prepare and distribute food.  While there is no specified expiry date of such a qualification the changes in legislation it is suggested to update every five years.

'''[[Shelf life|Best before]]''' indicates a future date beyond which the food product ''may'' lose quality in terms of taste or texture amongst others, but does not imply any serious health problems if food is consumed beyond this date (within reasonable limits).

'''Use by''' indicates a legal date beyond which it is not permissible to sell a food product (usually one that deteriorates fairly rapidly after production) due to the potential serious nature of consumption of pathogens. Leeway is sometimes provided by producers in stating '''display until''' dates so that products are not at their limit of safe consumption on the actual date stated (this latter is voluntary and not subject to regulatory control). This allows for the variability in production, storage and display methods.

===United States===
With the exception of infant formula and baby foods which must be withdrawn by their expiration date, Federal law does not require expiration dates. For all other foods, except dairy products in some states, freshness dating is strictly voluntary on the part of manufacturers. In response to consumer demand, perishable foods are typically labeled with a '''Sell by''' date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homecooking.about.com/library/weekly/aa102102a.htm|title= Expiration, Use-by, and Sell-by Dates, Part 1: Expiration dating is not federally required on all products}}</ref> It is up to the consumer to decide how long after the Sell by date a package is usable. Other common dating statements are '''Best if used by''', '''Use-by date''', '''Expiration date''', '''Guaranteed fresh <date>''', and '''Pack date'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homecooking.about.com/library/weekly/aa102102b.htm|title= Expiration, Use-by, and Sell-by Dates, Part 2: Deciphering food expiration codes can be tricky.}}</ref>

===Australia and New Zealand===
Guide to Food Labelling and Other Information Requirements: This guide provides background information on the general labelling requirements in the Code. The information in this guide applies both to food for retail sale and to food for catering purposes. Foods for catering purposes means those foods for use in restaurants, canteens, schools, caterers or self-catering institutions, where food is offered for immediate consumption. Labelling and information requirements in the new Code apply both to food sold or prepared for sale in Australia and New Zealand and food imported into Australia and New Zealand.

==Issues associated with sell by / use by dates==
According to the UK's [[Waste & Resources Action Programme]], 33% percent of all food produced is wasted along the chill chain or at the consumer.<ref>{{cite web |title=Reducing food waste through the
chill chain |url=http://www.wrap.org.uk/downloads/Reducing_food_waste_through_the_chill_chain.bfd0cd6b.9600.pdf}}</ref> At the same time, a large number of people get sick every year due to spoiled food.

===UK government to replace sell by / use by dates?===
According to the UK minister [[Hilary Benn]] the use by date and sell by dates are old technologies that are outdated and should be replaced by other solutions or disposed of altogether.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/green-living/kitchen-bin-war-tackling-the-food-waste-mountain-1698753.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Kitchen bin war: tackling the food waste mountain | first=Rachel | last=Shields | date=2009-06-07 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref>

===How to enhance food safety===
There is a number of ways to enhance sell by and use by dates. These include better education of consumers on how to use, transport, and store fresh food products, but also by enhancing the use by and sell by dates by adding to the package smart indicators such as TTIs (Time Temperature Indicators). These show through a visible color change whether the product is still fresh. TTIs are already in use by retailers and food producers in France ([[Monoprix]] and [[Carrefour]]), Switzerland (Kneuss), and other countries in western Europe.<ref>[http://www.onvu.com/_en/media_highlights.asp?25729ddc-6b63-48c7-8341-38dddd59b5fd Highlights].
