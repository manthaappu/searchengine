<html> <head> <title>Closed linear span</title></head><body>In [[functional analysis]], a branch of mathematics, the '''closed linear span''' of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[vector space|vectors]] is the minimal closed set which contains the [[linear span]] of that set.

==Definition==

Suppose that ''X'' is a normed vector space and let ''E'' be any non-empty subset of ''X''. The '''closed linear span''' of ''E'', denoted by <math>\overline{\operatorname{Sp}}(E)</math> or <math>\overline{\operatorname{Span}}(E)</math>, is the intersection of all the closed linear subspaces of ''X'' which contain ''E''.

One mathematical formulation of this is

:<math>\overline{\operatorname{Sp}}(E)=\{u\in X | \forall\epsilon>0\,\exists x\in\operatorname{Sp}(E) : \|x-u\|<\epsilon\}.</math>

==Notes==

The linear span of a set is dense in the closed linear span. Moreover, as stated in the below lemma, the closed linear span is indeed the [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] of the linear span.

Closed linear spans are important when dealing with closed linear subspaces (which are themselves highly important, consider [[Riesz's lemma]]).

==A useful lemma==

Let ''X'' be a normed space and let ''E'' be any non-empty subset of ''X''. Then

(a) <math>\overline{\operatorname{Sp}}(E)</math> is a closed linear subspace of ''X'' which contains ''E'',

(b) <math>\overline{\operatorname{Sp}}(E)=\overline{\operatorname{Sp}(E)}</math>, viz. <math>\overline{\operatorname{Sp}}(E)</math> is the closure of <math>\operatorname{Sp}(E)</math>,

(c) <math>E^\perp=(\operatorname{Sp}(E))^\perp=(\overline{\operatorname{Sp}(E)})^\perp.</math>

(So the usual way to find the closed linear span is to find the linear span first, and then the closure of that linear span.)
