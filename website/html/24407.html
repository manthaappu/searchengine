'''Microdose''' refers to a category of [[Medical_imaging|radiology modalities]] providing a very low [[R%C3%B6ntgen|radiation dose]]. These modalities are typically based on a photon-counting detector for capturing the image.

==Photon-counting Detector==
A photon-counting detector utilizes the discrete nature of [[X-rays]], as it counts individual [[photon]]s when they are captured in a detector medium. This is in contrast to “pseudo-digital” detectors that [[Integral|integrates]] photon energy over time, thus in practice measuring an [[analog signal]] that in turn is [[Analog-to-digital_converter|digitized]]. While the conversion steps from analog to digital signal in a traditional detector introduces [[thermal noise]], [[Quantization_error|quantization errors]] and loss of information during signal processing, a truly digital detector suffers from none of these weaknesses. A photon-counting detector is capable of capturing close to all information in the signal. This way it is possible to lower the radiation dose to a minimum while preserving or even improving image quality.

==Uses==
There are today very few commercially available Microdose modalities. The first to hit the market was a [[mammography]] system from Medical imaging supplier [[Sectra]], mainly targeted for intense breast [[screening]] programs. Breast examinations is one of the most demanding with respect to image quality, as early detection of cancerous changes relies on finding [[Dystrophic_calcification|micro-calcifications]] in the breast tissue. These tiny structures can be perceived by a trained eye, but only as far as the image quality allows. At the same time, the significance of low dose comes particularly apparent in screening programs, as a large part of a population is targeted. 

The Sectra system uses [[silicon]] as detector medium, where a large array of very thin silicon sticks constitutes the [[pixel]]s in the photon-counting detector. Another mammography system under development by [[XCounter]] uses [[noble gas]] contained in thin glass tubes as detector medium.
