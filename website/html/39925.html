[[File:Web 2.0 Map.svg|thumb|300px|A [[tag cloud]] (a typical Web 2.0 phenomenon in itself) presenting Web 2.0 themes]]
The term '''Web 2.0''' is  associated with web applications that facilitate interactive [[systemic bias]]es, [[interoperability]], [[user-centered design]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.techpluto.com/web-20-services/|title=Core Characteristics of Web 2.0 Services}}</ref> and [[web development|developing]] the [[World Wide Web]]. A Web 2.0 site allows users to interact and collaborate with each other in a [[social media]] dialogue as consumers of [[user-generated content]] in a [[virtual community]], in contrast to websites where users ([[prosumer]]s) are limited to the active viewing of [[Content (media and publishing)|content]] that they created and controlled. Examples of Web 2.0 include [[social networking site]]s, [[blog]]s, [[wiki]]s, [[video sharing]] sites, [[Web service|hosted services]], [[web application]]s, [[mashup (web application hybrid)|mashups]] and [[folksonomies]].

The term is closely associated with [[Tim O'Reilly]] because of the [[O'Reilly Media]] Web 2.0 conference in 2004.<ref name="graham">{{cite web|url=http://www.paulgraham.com/web20.html |title=Web 2.0 |author=Paul Graham |authorlink=Paul Graham (computer programmer) |month=November |year=2005 |accessdate=2006-08-02 |quote=I first heard the phrase 'Web 2.0' in the name of the Web 2.0 conference in 2004.}}</ref><ref name="oreilly">{{cite web|url=http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html |title=What Is Web 2.0 |publisher=O'Reilly Network |author=Tim O'Reilly |authorlink=Tim O'Reilly |date=2005-09-30 |accessdate=2006-08-06}}</ref> Although the term suggests a new version of the [[World Wide Web]], it does not refer to an update to any technical specification, but rather to cumulative changes in the ways [[software developer]]s and [[end-user (computer science)|end-users]] use the Web. Whether Web 2.0 is qualitatively different from prior web technologies has been challenged by World Wide Web inventor [[Tim Berners-Lee]], who called the term a "piece of jargon",<ref name="developerWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee"/> precisely because he intended the Web in his vision as "a collaborative medium, a place where we [could] all meet and read and write". He called it the "Read/Write Web".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4132752.stm BBC: Berners-Lee on the read/write web]</ref>

==History==
The term "Web 2.0" was coined in 1999 by Darcy DiNucci, a consultant on electronic information design ([[information architecture]]). In her article, "Fragmented Future", DiNucci writes:<ref>{{cite journal

{{quote|The Web we know now, which loads into a [[browser window]] in essentially static screenfulls, is only an [[embryo]] of the Web to come. The first glimmerings of Web 2.0 are beginning to appear, and we are just starting to see how that embryo might develop.  The Web will be understood not as screenfulls of text and graphics but as a transport mechanism, the ether through which interactivity happens. It will [...] appear on your computer screen,  [...] on your TV set [...] your car dashboard [...] your cell phone [...] hand-held game machines [...] maybe even your microwave oven.
}}
Her use of the term deals mainly with Web design, aesthetics, and the interconnection of everyday objects with the Internet; she argues that the Web is "fragmenting" due to the widespread use of portable Web-ready devices. Her article is aimed at designers, reminding them to code for an ever-increasing variety of hardware. As such, her use of the term hints at, but does not directly relate to, the current uses of the term.

The term Web 2.0 did not resurface until 2003.<ref>Idehen, Kingsley. 2003. RSS: INJAN (It's not just about news). Blog. Blog Data Space. August 21 [http://www.openlinksw.com/dataspace/kidehen@openlinksw.com/weblog/kidehen@openlinksw.com%27s%20BLOG%20%5B127%5D/241 OpenLinksW.com]</ref><ref>Idehen, Kingsley. 2003.

CIO, December 15.</ref><ref name="jrobb.mindplex.org">http://jrobb.mindplex.org/2003/08/16.html</ref> These authors focus on the concepts currently associated with the term where, as Scott Dietzen puts it, "the Web becomes a universal, standards-based integration platform".<ref name="Knorr, Eric 2003"/> John Robb wrote: "What is Web 2.0? It is a system that breaks with the old model of centralized Web sites and moves the power of the Web/Internet to the desktop."<ref name="jrobb.mindplex.org"/>

In 2004, the term began its rise in popularity when O'Reilly Media and MediaLive hosted the first Web 2.0 conference. In their opening remarks, [[John Battelle]] and [[Tim O'Reilly]] outlined their definition of the "Web as Platform", where software applications are built upon the Web as opposed to upon the desktop. The unique aspect of this migration, they argued, is that "customers are building your business for you".<ref>O'Reilly, Tim, and John Battelle. 2004. Opening Welcome: State of the Internet Industry. In . San Francisco, California, October 5.</ref> They argued that the activities of users generating content (in the form of ideas, text, videos, or pictures) could be "harnessed" to create value.
O'Reilly and Battelle contrasted Web 2.0 with what they called "Web 1.0". They associated Web 1.0 with the business models of [[Netscape]] and the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]. For example,
{{bquote|Netscape framed "the web as platform" in terms of the old software paradigm: their flagship product was the web browser, a desktop application, and their strategy was to use their dominance in the browser market to establish a market for high-priced server products. Control over standards for displaying content and applications in the browser would, in theory, give Netscape the kind of market power enjoyed by Microsoft in the PC market. Much like the "horseless carriage" framed the automobile as an extension of the familiar, Netscape promoted a "webtop" to replace the desktop, and planned to populate that webtop with information updates and applets pushed to the webtop by information providers who would purchase Netscape servers.<ref>O’Reilly, T., 2005.</ref>}} In short, Netscape focused on creating software, updating it on occasion, and distributing it to the end users. O'Reilly contrasted this with [[Google]], a company which did not at the time focus on producing software, such as a browser, but instead focused on providing a service based on data such as the links Web page authors make between sites. Google exploits this user-generated content to offer Web search based on reputation through its "page rank" [[algorithm]]. Unlike software, which undergoes scheduled releases, such services are constantly updated, a process called "the perpetual beta". A similar difference can be seen between the Encyclopædia Britannica Online and [[Wikipedia]]: while the Britannica relies upon experts to create articles and releases them periodically in publications, Wikipedia relies on trust in anonymous users to constantly and quickly build content. Wikipedia is not based on expertise but rather an adaptation of the [[open source]] software adage [[Linus' Law|"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"]], and it produces and updates articles constantly. O'Reilly's Web 2.0 conferences have been held every year since 2004, attracting entrepreneurs, large companies, and technology reporters.

In terms of the lay public, the term Web 2.0 was largely championed by bloggers and by technology journalists, culminating in the [[You (Time Person of the Year)|2006 ''TIME magazine'' Person of The Year]] (''You'').<ref>Grossman, Lev. 2006. Person of the Year: You. December 25. [http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20061225,00.html Time.com]</ref> That is, ''[[Time magazine|TIME]]'' selected the masses of users who were participating in content creation on [[social network]]s, blogs, wikis, and media sharing sites.
In the cover story, Lev Grossman explains:
{{bquote|It's a story about community and collaboration on a scale never seen before. It's about the cosmic compendium of knowledge Wikipedia and the million-channel people's network [[YouTube]] and the online metropolis [[MySpace]]. It's about the many wresting power from the few and helping one another for nothing and how that will not only change the world, but also change the way the world changes.It's a story about community and collaboration on a scale never seen before.}}

Since that time, Web 2.0 has found a place in the lexicon; in 2009 [[Global Language Monitor]] declared it to be the one-millionth [[English language|English]] word.<ref>"'Millionth English Word' declared". [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8092549.stm NEWS.BBC.co.uk]</ref>

==Characteristics==
[[Image:Flickr-screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flickr]], a Web 2.0 web site that allows its users to upload and share photos]]
Web 2.0 websites allow users to do more than just retrieve information. By increasing what was already possible in "[[Web 1.0]]", they provide the user with more user-interface, software and storage facilities, all through their browser. This has been called [[Web operating system|"Network as platform"]] computing.<ref name="oreilly"/> Users can provide the data that is on a Web 2.0 site and exercise some control over that data.<ref name="oreilly" /><ref name="hinchcliffe">{{

</ref> and collective intelligence<ref>O’Reilly, T., 2005. What is Web 2.0. Design Patterns and Business Models for the Next Generation of Software, 30, p.2005</ref> by way of user participation, can also be viewed as essential attributes of Web 2.0.

==Technologies==
The [[client-side]]/web browser technologies used in Web 2.0 development are [[JavaScript|Asynchronous JavaScript]] and XML ([[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]]), [[Adobe Flash]] and the [[Adobe Flex]] framework, and [[JavaScript]]/Ajax frameworks such as [[Yahoo! UI Library]], [[Dojo Toolkit]], [[MooTools]], and [[jQuery]].  Ajax programming uses JavaScript to upload and download new data from the web server without undergoing a full page reload.

To allow users to continue to interact with the page, communications such as data requests going to the server are separated from data coming back to the page (asynchronously).  Otherwise, the user would have to routinely wait for the data to come back before they can do anything else on that page, just as a user has to wait for a page to complete the reload.  This also increases overall performance of the site, as the sending of requests can complete quicker independent of blocking and queueing required to send data back to the client.

The data fetched by an Ajax request is typically formatted in [[XML]] or [[JSON]] (JavaScript Object Notation) format, two widely used structured data formats. Since both of these formats are natively understood by JavaScript, a programmer can easily use them to transmit structured data in their web application. When this data is received via Ajax, the JavaScript program then uses the [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) to dynamically update the web page based on the new data, allowing for a rapid and interactive user experience. In short, using these techniques, Web designers can make their pages function like desktop applications. For example, [[Google Docs]] uses this technique to create a Web-based word processor.

[[Adobe Flex]] is another technology often used in Web 2.0 applications. Compared to JavaScript libraries like [[jQuery]], Flex makes it easier for programmers to populate large data grids, charts, and other heavy user interactions.<ref>[http://maraksquires.com/articles/2009/11/16/javascript-jquery-versus-actionscript-flex-take-1/ Maraksquires.com]</ref> Applications programmed in Flex, are compiled and displayed as [[Adobe Flash Player|Flash]] within the browser. As a widely available plugin independent of [[W3C]] (World Wide Web Consortium, the governing body of web standards and protocols), standards, Flash is capable of doing many things which were not possible pre [[HTML]] 5, the language used to construct web pages. Of Flash's many capabilities, the most commonly used in Web 2.0 is its ability to play audio and video files. This has allowed for the creation of Web 2.0 sites where video media is seamlessly integrated with standard [[HTML]].

In addition to Flash and Ajax, JavaScript/Ajax frameworks have recently become a very popular means of creating Web 2.0 sites. At their core, these frameworks do not use technology any different from JavaScript, Ajax, and the DOM. What frameworks do is smooth over inconsistencies between web browsers and extend the functionality available to developers. Many of them also come with customizable, prefabricated '[[widget]]s' that accomplish such common tasks as picking a date from a calendar, displaying a data chart, or making a tabbed panel.

On the server side, Web 2.0 uses many of the same technologies as Web 1.0. New languages such as [[PHP]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[ColdFusion]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Java Server Pages|JSP]] and [[Active Server Pages|ASP]] are used by developers to dynamically output data using information from files and databases. What has begun to change in Web 2.0 is the way this data is formatted. In the early days of the Internet, there was little need for different websites to communicate with each other and share data. In the new "participatory web", however, sharing data between sites has become an essential capability. To share its data with other sites, a web site must be able to generate output in machine-readable formats such as [[XML]], [[RSS]], and [[JSON]]. When a site's data is available in one of these formats, another website can use it to integrate a portion of that site's functionality into itself, linking the two together. When this design pattern is implemented, it ultimately leads to data that is both easier to find and more thoroughly categorized, a hallmark of the philosophy behind the Web 2.0 movement.

In brief, AJAX is a key technology used to build Web 2.0 because it provides rich user experience and works any browser whether it is Firefox or Internet Explorer.  Then, a language with very good web services support should be used to build Web 2.0 applications.  In addition, the language used should be iterative meaning that it will help easy and fast the addition and deployment of features.

==Concepts==
Web 2.0 can be described in 3 parts which are as follows:
* Rich Internet Application (RIA) - It defines the experience brought from desktop to browser whether it is from a graphical point of view or usability point of view.  Some buzz words related to RIA are AJAX and Flash.
* Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) - It is a key piece in Web 2.0 which defines how Web 2.0 applications expose its functionality so that other applications can leverage and integrate the functionality providing a set of much richer applications (Examples are: Feeds, RSS, Web Services, Mash-ups)
* Social Web - It defines how Web 2.0 tend to interact much more with the end user and making the end user an integral part.

As such, Web 2.0 draws together the capabilities of [[client (computing)|client]]- and [[server (computing)|server]]-side software, [[content syndication]] and the use of [[List of network protocols|network protocols]]. Standards-oriented [[web browser]]s may use [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]s and software extensions to handle the content and the user interactions. Web 2.0 sites provide users with [[Computer data storage|information storage]], creation, and dissemination capabilities that were not possible in the environment now known as "Web 1.0".

Web 2.0 websites include the following features and techniques: Andrew McAfee used the acronym [[SLATES]] to refer to them:<ref>McAfee, A. (2006). Enterprise 2.0: The Dawn of Emergent Collaboration. MIT Sloan Management review. Vol. 47, No. 3, p. 21&ndash;28.</ref>

; Search
: Finding information through keyword search.
; Links
: Connects information together into a meaningful information ecosystem using the model of the Web, and provides low-barrier social tools.
; Authoring
: The ability to create and update content leads to the collaborative work of many rather than just a few web authors. In wikis, users may extend, undo and redo each other's work. In blogs, posts and the comments of individuals build up over time.
; Tags
: Categorization of content by users adding "tags" - short, usually one-word descriptions - to facilitate searching, without dependence on pre-made categories. Collections of tags created by many users within a single system may be referred to as "[[folksonomy|folksonomies]]" (i.e., [[Folk#Etymology|folk]] [[taxonomy|taxonomies]]).
; Extensions
: Software that makes the Web an application platform as well as a document server. These include software like Adobe Reader, Adobe Flash player, Microsoft Silverlight, ActiveX, Oracle Java, Quicktime, Windows Media, etc.
; Signals
: The use of syndication technology such as [[RSS]] to notify users of content changes.

While SLATES forms the basic framework of Enterprise 2.0, it does not contradict all of the higher level Web 2.0 design patterns and business models.  In this way, a new Web 2.0 report from O'Reilly is quite effective and diligent in interweaving the story of Web 2.0 with the specific aspects of Enterprise 2.0.  It includes discussions of self-service IT, the long tail of enterprise IT demand, and many other consequences of the Web 2.0 era in the enterprise.  The report also makes many sensible recommendations around starting small with pilot projects and measuring results, among a fairly long list.<ref>[http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=71 Blogs.ZDnet.com]</ref>

==Usage==

A third important part of Web 2.0 is the Social Web which is a fundamental shift in the way we communicate.  The social web consists of a number of online tools and platforms where people share their perspectives, opinions, thoughts and experiences. Web 2.0 Applications tend to interact much more with the end user.  As such, the end user is not only a user of the application but also a participant by:

: [[Podcasting]]
: [[Blogging]]
: [[Tagging]]
: [[Contributing to RSS]]
: [[Social bookmarking]]
: [[Social networking]]

The popularity of the term Web 2.0, along with the increasing use of blogs, wikis, and social networking technologies, has led many in academia and business to coin a flurry of 2.0s,<ref>Schick, S., 2005. I second that emotion. IT Business.ca (Canada).

}}</ref> Many of these 2.0s refer to Web 2.0 technologies as the source of the new version in their respective disciplines and areas. For example, in the Talis white paper "Library 2.0: The Challenge of Disruptive Innovation", Paul Miller argues

<blockquote>Blogs, wikis and RSS are often held up as exemplary manifestations of Web 2.0. A reader of a blog or a wiki is provided with tools to add a comment or even, in the case of the wiki, to edit the content. This is what we call the Read/Write web. Talis believes that [[Library 2.0]] means harnessing this type of participation so that libraries can benefit from increasingly rich collaborative cataloguing efforts, such as including contributions from partner libraries as well as adding rich enhancements, such as book jackets or movie files, to records from publishers and others.<ref>Miller 10&ndash;11</ref></blockquote>

Here, Miller links Web 2.0 technologies and the culture of participation that they engender to the field of library science, supporting his claim that there is now a "Library 2.0". Many of the other proponents of new 2.0s mentioned here use similar methods.

The meaning of web 2.0 is role dependent, as Dennis D. McDonalds noted. For example, some use Web 2.0 to establish and maintain relationships through social networks, while some marketing managers might use this promising technology to "end-run traditionally unresponsive I.T. department[s]."<ref>http://web2.sys-con.com/node/207411</ref>

There is a debate over the use of Web 2.0 technologies in mainstream education. Issues under consideration include the understanding of students' different learning modes; the conflicts between ideas entrenched in informal on-line communities and educational establishments' views on the production and authentication of 'formal' knowledge; and questions about privacy, plagiarism, shared authorship and the ownership of knowledge and information produced and/or published on line.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.108.9995&rep=rep1&type=pdf | title=What is Web 2.0?

; Marketing

: For marketers, Web 2.0 offers an opportunity to engage consumers. A growing number of marketers are using Web 2.0 tools to collaborate with consumers on product development, service enhancement and promotion. Companies can use Web 2.0 tools to improve collaboration with both its business partners and consumers.  Among other things, company employees have created wikis -- Web sites that allow users to add, delete and edit content -- to list answers to frequently asked questions about each product, and consumers have added significant contributions.  Another marketing Web 2.0 lure is to make sure consumers can use the online community to network among themselves on topics of their own choosing.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122884677205091919.html | title=The Secrets of Marketing in a Web 2.0 World | last=Parise | first=Salvatore | year=2008 | journal=The Wall Street Journal

: Mainstream media usage of web 2.0 is increasing. Saturating media hubs - like [[New York Times]], [[PC Magazine]] and [[Business Week]] - with links to popular new web sites and services, is critical to achieving the threshold for mass adoption of those services.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/mainstream_media_web20.php | title=Mainstream Media Usage of Web 2.0 Services is Increasing | last=MacManus | first=Richard | year=2007 | journal=Read Write Web

: Web 2.0 offers financial institutions abundant opportunities to engage with customers. Networks such as [[Twitter]], [[Yelp]] and [[Facebook]] are now becoming common elements of multichannel and customer loyalty strategies,{{Buzz}} and banks are beginning to use these sites proactively to spread their messages. In a recent article for [[Bank Technology News]], Shane Kite describes how Citigroup's Global Transaction Services unit monitors [[social media]] outlets to address customer issues and improve products. Furthermore, the FI uses [[Twitter]] to release "breaking news" and upcoming events, and [[YouTube]] to disseminate videos that feature executives speaking about market news.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.pntmarketingservices.com/newsfeed/article/Banks_use_Web_2_0_to_increase_customer_retention-800226524.html | title=Banks use Web 2.0 to increase customer retention | year=2010 | journal=PNT Marketing Services}}</ref>

: Small businesses have become more competitive by using Web 2.0 marketing strategies to compete with larger companies.  As new businesses grow and develop, new technology is used to decrease the gap between businesses and customers. [[Social networks]] have become more intuitive and user friendly to provide information that is easily reached by the end user. For example, Companies use [[Twitter]] to offer customers coupons and discounts for products and services.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2010/10/25/prwebprweb4693214.DTL | title=

According to Google Timeline, the term Web 2.0 was discussed and indexed most frequently in 2005, 2007 and 2008. Its average use is continuously declining by 2-4% per quarter since April 2008.

</ref> Although coined as such, many of these services function less like a traditional operating system and more as an application platform. They mimic the user experience of desktop operating-systems, offering features and applications similar to a PC environment, and are able to run within any modern browser. However, these operating systems do not directly control the hardware on the client's computer.

Numerous web-based application services appeared during the [[dot-com bubble]] of 1997–2001 and then vanished, having failed to gain a critical mass of customers. In 2005, [[WebEx]] acquired one of the better-known of these, [[Intranets.com]], for $45 million.<ref>

===Internet applications===
[[Rich Internet application|Rich Internet Applications (RIAs)]] are web 2.0 applications that have many of the characteristics of desktop applications and are typically delivered via a browser.

==Distribution of Media==
===XML and RSS===
Many regard syndication of site content as a Web 2.0 feature. Syndication uses standardized protocols to permit end-users to make use of a site's data in another context (such as another website, a browser plugin, or a separate desktop application). Protocols which permit syndication include [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] (really simple syndication, also known as web syndication), [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] (as in RSS 1.1), and [[Atom (standard)|Atom]], all of them [[XML]]-based formats. Observers have started to refer to these technologies as [[web feed]]s.

Specialized protocols such as [[FOAF (software)|FOAF]] and [[XHTML Friends Network|XFN]] (both for social networking) extend the functionality of sites or permit end-users to interact without centralized websites.

===Web APIs===
Web 2.0 often uses machine-based interactions such as [[Representational State Transfer|REST]] and [[SOAP]]. Servers often expose proprietary [[API]]s (Application Programming Interfaces), but standard APIs (for example, for posting to a blog or notifying a blog update) have also come into use. Most communications through APIs involve XML or [[JSON]] payloads.

REST APIs, through their use of self-descriptive messages and [[HATEOAS|hypermedia as the engine of application state]], should be self describing once an entry [[URI]] is known. [[Web Services Description Language]] (WSDL) is the standard way of publishing a SOAP API and there are [[List of web service specifications|a range of web service specifications]]. [[EMML]], or Enterprise Mashup Markup Language by the [[Open Mashup Alliance]], is an XML markup language for creating enterprise mashups.

==Criticism==
Critics of the term claim that "Web 2.0" does not represent a new version of the [[World Wide Web]] at all, but merely continues to use so-called "Web 1.0" technologies and concepts. First, techniques such as [[AJAX (programming)|AJAX]] do not replace underlying protocols like [[HTTP]], but add an additional layer of abstraction on top of them. Second, many of the ideas of Web 2.0 had already been featured in implementations on networked systems well before the term "Web 2.0" emerged. [[Amazon.com]], for instance, has allowed users to write reviews and consumer guides since its launch in 1995, in a form of self-publishing. Amazon also opened its API to outside developers in 2002.<ref>{{

}}</ref> Previous developments also came from research in [[Computer Supported Collaborative Learning|computer-supported collaborative learning]] and [[CSCW|computer-supported cooperative work]] and from established products like [[Lotus Notes]] and [[Lotus Domino]], all phenomena which precede Web 2.0.

But perhaps the most common criticism is that the term is unclear or simply a [[buzzword]]. For example, in a podcast interview,<ref name="developerWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee">
{{cite web |url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/podcast/dwi/cm-int082206txt.html |title=DeveloperWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee
|date=2006-07-28 |accessdate=2007-02-07 }}</ref> [[Tim Berners-Lee]] described the term "Web 2.0" as a "piece of jargon": <blockquote>"Nobody really knows what it means...If Web 2.0 for you is blogs and wikis, then that is people to people. But that was what the Web was supposed to be all along."<ref name="developerWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee" /></blockquote>

Other critics labeled Web 2.0 "a second bubble" (referring to the [[Dot-com bubble]] of circa 1995–2001), suggesting that too many Web 2.0 companies attempt to develop the same product with a lack of business models. For example, ''[[The Economist]]'' has dubbed the mid- to late-2000s focus on Web companies "Bubble 2.0".<ref>{{cite web |title=Bubble 2.0 |work=The Economist |url=http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_QQNVDDS |date=2005-12-22 |accessdate=2006-12-20 }}</ref> [[Venture capital]]ist [[Josh Kopelman]] noted that Web 2.0 had excited only 53,651 people (the number of subscribers at that time to [[TechCrunch]], a Weblog covering Web 2.0 startups and technology news), too few users to make them an economically viable target for consumer applications.<ref>{{cite web |title=53,651 |author=[[Josh Kopelman]] |work=Redeye VC |url=http://redeye.firstround.com/2006/05/53651.html |date=2006-05-11 |accessdate=2006-12-21 }}</ref> Although [[Bruce Sterling]] reports he's a fan of Web 2.0, he thinks it is now dead as a rallying concept.{{Clarify|date=December 2009}}<ref>{{cite web |title= Bruce Sterling presenta il web 2.0 |work="LASTAMPA.it" |url= http://www.lastampa.it/multimedia/multimedia.asp?p=1&IDmsezione=29&IDalbum=8558&tipo=VIDEO#mpos}}</ref>

Critics have cited the language used to describe the hype cycle of Web 2.0<ref>{{cite web |title= Gartner 2006 Emerging Technologies Hype Cycle |url=http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=495475}}</ref> as an example of [[Techno-utopianism|Techno-utopianist]] rhetoric.<ref>{{cite web |title="Critical Perspectives on Web 2.0", Special issue of ''[[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]]'', 13(3), 2008.

In terms of Web 2.0's social impact, critics such as [[Andrew Keen]] argue that Web 2.0 has created a cult of digital [[narcissism]] and amateurism, which undermines the notion of expertise by allowing anybody, anywhere to share and place undue value upon their own opinions about any subject and post any kind of content, regardless of their particular talents, knowledge, credentials, biases or possible hidden agendas. Keen's 2007 book, [[Cult of the Amateur]], argues that the core assumption of Web 2.0, that all opinions and user-generated content are equally valuable and relevant, is misguided.  Additionally, Sunday Times reviewer John Flintoff has characterized Web 2.0 as "creating an endless digital forest of mediocrity: uninformed political commentary, unseemly home videos, embarrassingly amateurish music, unreadable poems, essays and novels", and also asserted that [[Wikipedia]] is full of "mistakes, half truths and misunderstandings".<ref>{{cite news |title= Thinking is so over|url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/personal_tech/article1874668.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first=JohnPaul | last=Flintoff | date=2007-06-03}}</ref>

==Web 3.0==
{{See also|Semantic Web}}
<!-- FYI:  [[Web 3.0]] redirects to here via #Redirect[[Web 2.0#Web 3.0]] .  -->
Definitions of Web 3.0 vary greatly. Amit Agrawal states that Web 3.0 is, among other things, about the [[Semantic Web]] and [[personalization]].<ref>Agarwal, Amit. "Web 3.0 concepts explained in plain English". [http://www.labnol.org/internet/web-3-concepts-explained/8908/ Labnol.org]</ref> Focusing on the computer elements, [[Conrad Wolfram]] has argued that Web 3.0 is where "the computer is generating new information", rather than humans.<ref>[http://www.itpro.co.uk/621535/q-a-conrad-wolfram-on-communicating-with-apps-in-web-3-0 Conrad Wolfram on Communicating with apps in web 3.0] IT PRO, 17 Mar 2010</ref>

Andrew Keen, author of ''The Cult of the Amateur'', considers the Semantic Web an "unrealisable abstraction" and sees Web 3.0 as the return of experts and authorities to the Web. For example, he points to Bertelsmann's deal with the [[German Wikipedia]] to produce an edited print version of that encyclopedia. [[CNN Money]]'s Jessi Hempel expects Web 3.0 to emerge from new and innovative Web 2.0 services with a profitable business model.<ref>Hempel, Jessi. "Web 2.0 is so over. Welcome to Web 3.0." CNN Money. [http://money.cnn.com/2009/01/07/technology/hempel_threepointo.fortune/index.htm CNN.com]</ref> Others still such as Manoj Sharma, an organization strategist, in the keynote "A Brave New World Of Web 3.0" proposes that Web 3.0 will be a "Totally Integrated World" - cradle-to-grave experience of being always plugged onto the net.<ref>Keen, Andrew. "Web 1.0 + Web 2.0 = Web 3.0." [http://andrewkeen.typepad.com/the_great_seduction/2008/04/web-10-web-20-w.html TypePad.com]</ref>

Futurist [[John Smart (futurist)|John Smart]], lead author of the Metaverse Roadmap<ref>[http://www.metaverseroadmap.org/MetaverseRoadmapOverview.pdf Smart, John. 2006. "Metaverse Roadmap: Pathways to the 3D Web."]</ref> echoes Sharma's perspective, defining Web 3.0 as the first-generation [[Metaverse]] (convergence of the virtual and physical world), a web development layer that includes TV-quality open video, 3D simulations, augmented reality, human-constructed semantic standards, and pervasive broadband, wireless, and sensors. Web 3.0's early geosocial (Foursquare, etc.) and augmented reality (Layar, etc.) webs are an extension of Web 2.0's participatory technologies and social networks (Facebook, etc.) into 3D space. Of all its metaverse-like developments, Smart suggests Web 3.0's most defining characteristic will be the mass diffusion of NTSC-or-better quality [http://openvideoalliance.org/about/?l=en open video] to TVs, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices, a time when "the internet swallows the television."<ref>Smart, John. 2010. "The Television Will Be Revolutionized: The iPad, Internet TV, and Web 3.0."[http://www.accelerating.org/articles/televisionwillberevolutionized.html]</ref> Smart considers Web 4.0 to be the [[Semantic Web]] and in particular, the rise of statistical, machine-constructed semantic tags and algorithms, driven by broad collective use of conversational interfaces, perhaps circa 2020.<ref>[http://www.accelerationwatch.com/lui.html Smart, John. 2003. "The Conversational Interface."]</ref> David Siegel's perspective in ''Pull: The Power of the Semantic Web'', 2009, is consonant with this, proposing that the growth of human-constructed semantic standards and data will be a slow, industry-specific incremental process for years to come, perhaps unlikely to tip into broad social utility until after 2020.
