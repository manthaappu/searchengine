'''Semiconductor memory''' is an electronic [[data storage device]], often used as [[computer memory]], implemented on a [[semiconductor]]-based [[integrated circuit]]. Examples of semiconductor memory include [[non-volatile memory]] such as [[Read-only memory]] (ROM), [[magnetoresistive random access memory]] (MRAM), and [[flash memory]]. It also includes [[volatile memory]] such as [[static random access memory]] (SRAM), which relies on several [[transistors]] forming a digital [[flip-flop]] to store one bit, and [[dynamic random access memory]] (DRAM), which uses one [[capacitor]] and one transistor to store each [[bit]]s. [[Shift register]]s, [[processor register]]s, [[data buffer]]s and other small digital registers that have no [[address decoder|memory address decoding mechanism]] are not considered as memory.  

Data is accessed by means of a binary [[memory address]] to the memory. If the memory address consists of ''M'' bits, the address area consists of two raised by ''M'' addresses per chip. Semiconductor memory are manufactured with a certain [[word length]] (number of 1-bit cells sharing the same memory address) that  power of two, typically ''M''=1, 2, 4 or 8 bit per chip. Consequently, the amount of data stored in each chip is <math>MN^2</math> bits. Possible figures are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 [[bit]], [[kbit]], [[Mbit]], [[Gbit]] and [[Tbit]], here defined by [[binary prefix]]es. By combining several integrated circuits, memory can be arranged for a larger word length and/or address space than what is offered by each chip, often but not necessarily a [[power of two]].
