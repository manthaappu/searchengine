'''Nashville''' was the [[codename]] for a cancelled release of [[Microsoft Windows]] scheduled to be released in 1996, between "Chicago" ([[Windows 95]]) and "Memphis" ([[Windows 98]], at the time scheduled for release in 1997),<ref>Comes v. Microsoft 3208</ref> causing it to be referred to as '''Windows 96''' by the public. The release intended to focus on a tighter integration between Windows and [[Internet Explorer]], in order to better compete with [[Netscape Navigator]].<ref>Comes v. Microsoft 5735</ref>

Microsoft claimed that Nashville would add [[Internet]] integration features to the Windows 95 and NT 4.0 [[desktop metaphor|desktop]], building on the new features in the [[Internet Explorer]] 3.0 [[web browser]] (due for release a few months before Nashville). Touted features included a combined [[file manager]] and web browser, the ability to seamlessly open [[Microsoft Office]] documents from within Internet Explorer using [[ActiveX]] technology and a way to place dynamic [[webpages]] directly on the desktop in place of the regular static [[computer wallpaper]].

A leaked build had version number 4.10.999 (compare to Windows 95's 4.00.950, Windows 95 OSR2's 4.00.1111, and Windows 98's 4.10.1998). The project was eventually cancelled as a full release of Windows, Windows 95 OSR2 ("Detroit") being shipped as an interim release instead. The codename "Nashville" was reused for the [[Windows Desktop Update]] that shipped with Internet Explorer 4.0 and delivered most of the features promised for Nashville. The Athena PIM application would be released as [[Microsoft Internet Mail and News]], later renamed to [[Outlook Express]].

"Cleveland" was an earlier codename for "Nashville".<ref>Comes v. Microsoft 3208</ref> Chicago is the largest city in [[Illinois]], Memphis is the largest city in [[Tennessee]]. Nashville and Cleveland are both cities in Tennessee, as well as villages in Illinois. Cleveland is also the most populous city of [[Ohio]]. Detroit is the largest city of [[Michigan]], as well as a village in Illinois.
