The '''Everyman kernel''' is a minimalistic [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] designed to support hard [[Real-time computing|real-time]] applications. The kernel is built from three parts: scheduling, resource access, and communication. Each part is implemented with an algorithm that does not lead to blocking. The removal of any blocking leads to predictable execution times and it is this which makes the kernel suitable for hard [[Real-time computing|real-time]] systems development.

Furthermore, the use of this algorithm also means that all of the processes can share the same stack which reduces the system's memory footprint.
Inter-process communication is implemented with Cyclical Asynchronous Buffers<ref name="clark1989">{{cite journal

The kernel is designed to be simple enough that a single programmer can understand the entire system. The kernel is effectively one file containing 22 C functions. Most kernel code is written in C and is in places 32-bit specific. To port the kernel to a new platform requires the implementation of at least five functions in assembly language. The Everyman kernel can be run in Unix user space and, along with POSIX.1b real-time scheduling, the kernel can be used to implement a [[Real-time computing|real-time]] threads package.
