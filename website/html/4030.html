'''BlackBerry Messenger''' (BBM) is a proprietary [[Instant Messenger]] application included on [[BlackBerry]] devices.

It was developed by [[Research In Motion]] (RIM), maker of the BlackBerry device. Messages sent via Blackberry Messenger are sent over the [[Blackberry_PIN#BlackBerry_PIN|BlackBerry PIN]] system; thus, communication is only possible between two BlackBerry devices. Exchanging messages is also possible via dedicated discussion or chat groups, which allow multiple BlackBerry devices to communicate in a single session. In addition to offering text-based instant messages, BlackBerry Messenger also allows users to send pictures, voicenotes (audio recordings), files, location on a map, and a wide selection of [[emoticons]] (also known as "smileys") over the Blackberry network.

Blackberry messenger allows you easy access to keeping in touch with friends by instant messaging, and you can create a profile that can be updated as much as you want sort of like a social network on your mobile phone. With the release of BlackBerry Messenger 5.0, BlackBerry allows users to use a [[QR Code]] barcode to add each other to their respective friends lists rather than using only numeric PIN identification or an email address associated with the user's BlackBerry.
