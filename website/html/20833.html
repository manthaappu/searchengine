'''Kororaa''' was a binary installation method for [[Gentoo Linux]] which aimed for easy installation of a Gentoo system by using install scripts instead of manual configuration. The name is an alternate spelling for the [[Māori language|Māori]] word,  "kororā" - the [[Little Penguin]].  Kororaa was pre-configured for [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] capable processors.

==History==
Kororaa was started by [[Chris Smart|Christopher Smart]] as a method to quickly reproduce a [[Gentoo Linux]] installation on multiple desktop machines.  Chris also intended that Kororaa be used to quickly demonstrate the power of [[Gentoo Linux]] to users critical of 'compile times.'  On November 7, 2007, Chris announced that he was discontinuing his work on the project, and that there would be no new versions of Kororaa.

The introduction of the Kororaa XGL Live CD was intended to demonstrate the capabilities of [[Novell]]'s  [[Xgl]] and [[Compiz]].

In March 2006, a Kororaa based [[Live CD]] was released, preconfigured with [[Xgl]] capabilities. The live CD supports NVIDIA, ATI and Intel graphics cards, and the latest version (0.3) comes with both [[KDE]] and [[GNOME]].

== Kororaa XGL Live CD and the GPL ==
In May 2006 an unnamed kernel developer sent an email to Christopher Smart, Kororaa's leader, suggesting that packaging the proprietary [[NVIDIA]] and [[ATI Technologies|fglrx]] drivers was a violation of the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] as they take GPL code from the kernel and build it into a non-GPL kernel module, qualifying as a derived work. This caused Smart to temporarily remove the CD image from his website in August 2006 [http://kororaa.org/static.php?page=gpl].

Two months later, version (0.3) was released, and all proprietary drivers were removed by request. Because of this, only limited ATI and NVIDIA graphics card support was included.

== Development ended ==
On November 7, 2007, Smart announced that development on Kororaa would be ended, and no further versions would be released;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kororaa.org/comments.php?y=07&m=11&entry=entry071107-225645|title=Kororaa Project - No more Kororaa|accessdate=9 November 2007|archivedate=9 November 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071109171217/http://kororaa.org/comments.php?y=07&m=11&entry=entry071107-225645}}</ref> reasons given were that 
* [[Sabayon Linux]] already serves a purpose as a binary Gentoo distribution
* Gentoo already comes with a GUI installer
* Compiz is already installed on most desktop distributions by default
* Kororaa couldn't compete with other distributions which include non-free drivers by default.
* the weight of the project was too much for a single developer.

==Version History==
* Beta 2 R1, December 12, 2005
* XGL Live CD 0.1, March 8, 2006 
* XGL Live CD 0.2, April 6, 2006
