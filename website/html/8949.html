'''DDObjects''' is a [[remoting framework]] for [[Borland Delphi]] and [[C++ Builder]]. A main goal while developing DDObjects has not been only to keep the [[code]] one has to implement in order to utilize DDObjects as simple as possible but also very close to Delphi's usual style of [[event-driven]] [[programming]].

DDObjects supports [[remote method calls]], [[server callbacks]], [[asynchronous calls]], [[asynchronous callbacks]], stateful and -less objects and other features. DDObjects doesn't mimic other implementations as [[DCOM]] or [[CORBA]], which are generalized to a least common denominator, but makes use of Delphi's rich type system including Objects, Exceptions, Records, Sets and Enumerations.

DDObjects uses plain [[XML]] and [[HTTP]] as [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]], contains a [[broker component]], a [[sourcecode]] [[Code generation|generator]] as well as some new [[visual]] controls. DDObjects supports Delphi 5 to 7, 2005-2009 as well as C++ Builder 6, 2006 and 2009.
