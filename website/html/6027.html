<html> <head> <title>Chemical WorkBench</title></head><body>'''Chemical WorkBench''' is a [[simulation software]] tool aimed at the reactor scale kinetic modeling of homogeneous gas-phase and [[Stochastic process|heterogeneous processes]] and [[Enzyme kinetics|kinetic mechanism]] development. It can be effectively used for the modeling, optimization, and design of a wide range of industrially and environmentally important chemistry-loaded processes. Chemical WorkBench is a modeling environment based on advanced scientific approaches, complementary databases, and accurate solution methods.

==Chemical WorkBench models==
Chemical WorkBench has an extensive library of [[Physical chemistry|physicochemical]] models:
*Thermodynamic Models
*Gas-Phase Kinetic Models
*Flame model
*Heterogeneous Kinetic Models
*Non-Equilibrium Plasma Models
*Detonation and Aerodynamic Models
*Membrane Separation Models
*Mechanism Analysis and Reduction

==Fields of application==
Chemical WorkBench can be used by researchers and engineers working in the following fields:
*General [[chemical kinetics]] and [[thermodynamics]]
*Kinetic mechanisms development
*[[Thin film]]s growth for [[microelectronics]]
*[[Nanotechnology]] 
*[[Catalysis]] and [[chemical engineering]] 
*[[Combustion]], [[detonation]] and [[pollution]] control 
*[[Waste treatment]] and recovering 
*[[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] light sources and plasma chemistry 
*High-temperature chemistry 
*[[Education]]
*Combustion and detonation, clean [[Electricity generation|power-generation]] technologies, safety analysis, CVD, heterogeneous and catalytic reactions and processes, and processes in non-equilibrium plasmas are the main areas of interest.
