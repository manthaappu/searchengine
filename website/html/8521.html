<html> <head> <title>Cross-cutting concern</title></head><body>In [[computer science]], '''cross-cutting concerns''' are aspects of a [[computer program|program]] which affect other [[Concern (computer science)|concerns]].
These concerns often cannot be cleanly [[Modularity (programming)|decomposed]] from the rest of the system in both the design and implementation, and can result in either ''scattering'' ([[source code|code]] duplication), ''tangling'' (significant dependencies between systems), or both.

For instance, if writing an [[application software|application]] for handling medical records, the bookkeeping and indexing of such records is a [[core concern]], while [[Data logging|logging]] a history of changes to the record database or user database, or an authentication system, would be cross-cutting concerns since they touch more parts of the program.

==Background==
Cross-cutting concerns are parts of a program which rely on or must affect many other parts of the system. They form the basis for the development of [[aspect (computer science)|aspects]].<ref name="Patent 4">U.S. Patent 6467086, p.4</ref> Such cross-cutting concerns do not fit cleanly into [[object-oriented programming]] or [[procedural programming]].<ref name="Seminal 1">Kiczales, p.1</ref> 

Cross-cutting concerns can be directly responsible for ''tangling'', or system interdependencies, within a [[computer program|program]]. Because procedural and [[functional language]]s' constructs consist entirely of procedure calling, there is no semantic through which two goals (the capability to be implemented and the related cross-cutting concern) can be addressed simultaneously.<ref name="Seminal 6">Kiczales, p.6</ref> As a result, the code addressing the cross-cutting concern must be ''scattered'', or duplicated, across the various related locations, resulting in a loss of [[modularity (programming)|modularity]]. <ref name="Seminal 1" />

[[Aspect-oriented programming]] aims to [[encapsulation (computer science)|encapsulate]] cross-cutting concerns into [[aspect (computer science)|aspects]] to retain modularity. This allows for the clean isolation and reuse of code addressing the cross-cutting concern.<ref name="Seminal 2">Kiczales, p.2</ref> By basing designs on cross-cutting concerns, [[software engineering]] benefits are affected, including modularity and simplified maintenance.<ref name="Li 1">Li, p.1</ref>
