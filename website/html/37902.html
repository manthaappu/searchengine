<html> <head> <title>ToolTalk</title></head><body>'''ToolTalk''' is an [[interapplication communication]]s system developed by [[Sun Microsystems]] (SunSoft) in order to allow applications to communicate with each other at runtime. Applications supporting ToolTalk can construct "high-level" messages and hand them off to the system's ToolTalk server, which determines the proper recipients and (after applying permission checks) forwards the message to them. Although originally available only on [[SunOS]] and [[Solaris Operating System|Solaris]], ToolTalk was chosen as the application framework for the [[Common Desktop Environment]] and thus became part of a number of [[Unix]] distributions as well as [[OpenVMS]].

While ToolTalk had "object oriented" and "procedural" messages and a complex "pattern" structure which allowed dispatch of messages to processes based on object names, message names, and parameter types, actual desktop protocols never took full advantage of its power.<ref>Julienne, Astrid M. and Holtz, Brian ''ToolTalk and Open Protocols: Inter-Application Communication'' (1994)</ref>  Simpler pattern-matching systems like [[Apple Computer]]'s [[AppleScript]] system did just as well.

The [[D-Bus]] standard has superseded ToolTalk in [[Unix]]-like desktop environments.
