<html> <head> <title>True self and false self</title></head><body>'''True self''' and '''false self''' are terms introduced into psychoanalysis by [[D. W. Winnicott]] in 1960. Winnicott 'contrasts a basic True Self with a False Self, the latter a self-protective mechanism....The true self feeling involves a sense of all out personal aliveness...feeling ''real'' '.<ref>[[Salman Akhtar]], ''Good Feelings'' (London 2009) p. 128</ref>

'Winnicott conceives of a "false self" that an infant develops in despairing defence against the trauma of inadequate maternal care; the analytic task is to give the "true self", which can feel and is cowering behind the "false self", which cannot, the strength to emerge'.<ref>Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 135</ref>

== Before Winnicott==
There was much in psychoanalytic theory on which Winnicott could draw for his concept of the False Self. [[Helene Deutsch]] had described the "as if" personalities who have 'succeeded in substituting "pseudo contacts" of manifold kinds for a real feeling contact with other people: they behave "as if" they have feeling contacts with people'.<ref>Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 445</ref> Winnicott's own analyst, [[Joan Riviere]], had memorably explored the concept of the masquerade - of 'the mask of the narcissist..."the trait of ''deceptiveness'', the mask, which conceals this subtle reservation of all control under intellectual rationalizations, or under feigned compliance and superficial politeness"'.<ref>Mary Jacobus, ''The Poetics of Psychoanalysis: In the Wake of Klein'' (Oxford 2005) p. 37</ref> [[Freud]] himself, with his late theory of 'the ego as constituted in its nucleus by a series of alienating identifications',<ref>Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 128</ref> had produced a theory of 'the Ego, which does bear some comparison with the False Self'.<ref>Adam Phillips, ''Winnicott'' (Harvard 1988) p. 136</ref>

==Winnicott==
Despite its many antecedents, it would be wrong to underestimate the quiet conceptual revolution offered by Winnicott's 1960 article, which offered a fresh and compelling, clinically-rooted picture of the human mind. 

For Winnicott, in the False Self, 'Other people's expectations can become of overriding importance, overlaying or contradicting the original sense of self, the one connected to the very roots of one's being'.<ref>Winnicott, quoted in Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others'' (London 1994) p. 241</ref> The danger is that 'through this False Self, the infant builds up a false set of relationships, and by means of introjections even attains a show of being real'.<ref>Winnicott, quoted in Klein, p. 365</ref> The result can be a 'child whose potential aliveness and creativity has gone unnoticed...concealing an empty, barren internal world behind a mask of independence'.<ref>Rosalind Minsky, ''Psychoanalysis and Gender'' (London 1996) p. 119-20</ref> Yet at the same time the 'Winnicottian False Self is the ultimate defence against the unthinkable "exploitation of the True Self, which would result in its annihilation"'.<ref>Mary Jacobus, ''The Poetics of Psychoanalysis'' (Oxford 2005) p. 160</ref>

By contrast, the True Self is rooted in, and '"does no more than collect together the details of the experience of aliveness" - this means the body's life-sustaining functions, "including the heart's action and breathing"'.<ref>Winnicott, in Jacobus, p. 160</ref> Out of this the baby creates the experience of [[reality]]: a sense that '"Life is worth the trouble of living". In the baby's nonverbal gesture which '... expresses a spontaneous [[instinct]]',<ref>D. W. Winnicott, "Ego Distortion in Terms of True and False Self ', in ''The Maturational Process and the Facilitating Environment'' (London 1965) p. 121</ref> the true self potential can be communicated to, and affirmed by, the motherer.

'The False Self in its pathological guise prevents and inhibits what Winnicott calls the "spontaneous gesture" of the True Self. Compliance and imitation are the costly results'.<ref>Jacobus, p. 160</ref> Some would indeed consider that 'the idea of ''compliance'' is central to Winnicott's theory of the false self',<ref>Minsky, p. 118</ref> and add, paradoxically, that 'concern for an object is easily a compliant act'.<ref>Adam Phillips, ''On Kissing, Tickling and Being Bored'' (London 1994) p. 30</ref> Where the motherer is not responsive to the baby's spontaneity, where instead 'a mother's expectations are too insistent, they can eventually result in compliant behaviour and an impaired autonomy',<ref>Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1990) p. 160</ref> as the baby has 'to manage a prematurely important object....The False Self enacts a kind of dissociated regard or recognition of the object; the object is taken seriously, is shown concern, but not by a person'.<ref>Phillips, p. 31</ref>

It has been suggested that 'in pathology, Winnicott's distinction between "true and false selves" corresponds to [[Michael Balint|Balint]]'s "basic fault" and to [[Ronald Fairbairn|Fairbairn]]'s "compromised ego"'.<ref>J. H. Padel, "Freudianism: Later Developmemts", in Richard Gregory ed., ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (Oxford 1987) p. 273</ref>

==Further Developments==

The last half-century have seen Winnicott's ideas extended and applied in a variety of contexts, both in psychoanalysis and beyond.

===Kohut===

It has been suggested that '[[Heinz Kohut|Kohut]] offers essentially the same program' as Winnicott in his descriptions of 'the narcissistic disorders in which he specializes....Like Winnicott's "false-self" patients, these patients develop a shoddy armor (of a "defensive" or "compensatory" character) around their maimed inner core'.<ref>Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 136</ref> Kohut himself 'has noted that his work "overlaps" with Winnicott's investigations', and others have 'regarded Kohut's contribution to psychoanalysis to be an extension of Winnicott's work'.<ref>Eugene M. DeRobertis, ''Humanizing Child Development Theories'' (2008) p. 38</ref>

Thus Kohut emphasises that 'to be...the maintenance of even the diseased remnants of the self is preferable to not being, that is, to accept the takeover of another's personality rather than his actively elicited responsiveness'.<ref>Heinz Kohut, ''How Does Analysis Cure?'' (London 1984) p. 142</ref> Similarly, he stressed that 'there is a decisive difference between the support of selfobjects that are sought after and chosen by a self in harmony with its innermost ideals...and the abandoning of oneself to a foreign self, through which one gains borrowed cohesion at the price of genuine initiative and creative participation in life'.<ref>Kohut, p. 167</ref>

===Lowen===
[[Alexander Lowen]] identified narcissists as having a true and a false, or superficial, self. The false self rests on the surface, as the self presented to the world. It stands in contrast to the true self, which resides behind the facade or image. This true self is the feeling self, but it is a self that must be hidden and denied. Since the superficial self represents submission and conformity, the inner or true self is rebellious and angry. This underlying rebellion and anger can never be fully suppressed since it is an expression of the life force in that person. But because of the [[denial]], it cannot be expressed directly. Instead it shows up in the narcissist's [[acting out]]. And it can become a perverse force.<ref>Alexander Lowen ''Narcissism: Denial of the True Self'' (1984)</ref>

===Masterson===
[[James F. Masterson]] argued all the [[personality disorders]] crucially involve the conflict between a person’s two “selves”: the false self, which the very young child constructs to please the mother, and the true self. The psychotherapy of personality disorders, is an attempt is to put people back in touch with their real selves.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2010/04/20/dr_james_masterson_expert_on_personality_disorders_at_84/ Dr. James Masterson, expert on personality disorders; at 84]</ref>

===Symington===

[[C. G. Jung|Jungians]] have explored how 'the narcissistic  longings of mothers (or fathers) to amass reflected glory through their children' can result in a situation where 'in place of autonomy, the adult...would come to obey an internal source that the psychoanalyst Neville Symington calls the "discordant source"'.<ref>Polly Young-Eisandrath, ''Women and Desire'' (London 2000) p. 198 and p. 112</ref> Symington contrasted 'two poles: one in which I am the source of my own action, where I have a creative capacity that comes from my own source of action, and the other in which an inner figure opposed to myself is the source of action.<ref>Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) p. 115</ref> He termed the twin 'sources of action the "autonomous source" and the "discordant source"', and acknowledged that 'although the formulation is different, it is along the lines of what Winnicott talks about - the true self and the false self'.<ref>Symington, p. 115 and p. 36</ref>

His main criticism of Winnicott concerned the initial ''adoption'' or internalisation of the discordant source - wanting 'to stress that an intentional identification is what brings about the donning of the false self. Winnicott leaves out this intentional aspect in his description of its origins'.<ref>Symington, p. 104</ref>

===Vaknin===

As part of what has been described as 'a personal mission by self-confessed narcissist and author [[Sam Vaknin]] to raise the profile of the condition',<ref>Simon Crompton, ''All about Me: Loving a Narcissist'' (London 2007) p. 7</ref> Vaknin has highlighted the role of the false self in narcissism. 'The False Self replaces the narcissist's True Self and is intended to shield him from hurt and [[narcissistic injury]] by self-imputing omnipotence....The narcissist pretends that his False Self is real and demands that others affirm this confabulation',<ref>Vaknin S [http://samvak.tripod.com/faq48.html The Dual Role of the Narcissist's False Self]</ref> meanwhile keeping his real imperfect true self under wraps.

For Vaknin, 'the False Self is by far more important to the narcissist than his dilapidated, dysfunctional True Self'; and in contrast to the psychoanalysts he 'do[es] not believe in the ability to "resuscitate it [TS]" through therapy'.<ref>Samuel Vaknin/Lidija Rangelovska ''Malignant Self-Love'' (2003) p. 187-8</ref>

==Persona and false self==

Jungians have explored 'to what extent [[Jung]]'s concept of the [[Persona (psychology)|persona]] overlaps with Winnicott's concept of the False Self' - noting the way 'the antecedents of such persona-identification in the individual's life-history are usually quite similar to those of the False Self'.<ref>Mario Jacoby, ''Shame and the Origins of Self-Esteem'' (1996) p. 59-60</ref> However most would agree that it is only 'when the persona is excessively rigid or defensive...[that] the persona then develops into a pathological false self'.<ref>Polly Young-Eisendrath/James Albert Hall, ''Jung's Self Psychology'' (1991) p. 29</ref>

==Stern's tripartite self==

In ''[[The Interpersonal World of the Infant]]'', [[Daniel Stern (psychologist)|Daniel Stern]] considered 'the sense of physical cohesion (..."going on being", in Winnicott's term)' as essential to what he called the Core Self - providing 'an affective core to the prerepresentational self'.<ref>Daniel Stern, ''The Interpersonal World of the Child'' (1985) p. 7 and p. 93</ref> He also explored how selective maternal attunement could create 'two versions of reality....Language becomes available to ratify the split and confer the privileged status of verbal representation upon the false self', so that 'the true self becomes a congloberate of disavowed experiences of self which cannot be linguistically coded'.<ref>Stern, p. 227</ref>

However 'in place of true self and false self, Stern suggests the adoption of a tri-partite vocabulary: the social self, the private self and the disavoyed self'.<ref>Michael Jacobs, ''D. W. Winnicott'' (1995) p. 129</ref>

==Criticism==

One persistent criticism of Winnicott's theory of true/false selves is that it was not theoretically integrated. 'Most clinicians...when they have a clinical insight, they simply paste it onto existing theory....Winnicott did the same with the true and false self: he did not ask himself how the theory fitted with [[Id, ego, and super-ego|ego and id]]'.<ref>Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) p. 97</ref>

Similarly [[Jean-Bertrand Pontalis]] and [[Maud Mannoni]] are very reserved about the theoretical implication of Winnicott's true/false self distinction, but they acknowledge the justice of his clinical observations.
