<html> <head> <title>Windows refund</title></head><body>The "'''Windows refund'''" is a [[refund]] claimed by a user after purchasing a computer with the [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]] pre-installed on it. The refund is issued by the computer manufacturer, or occasionally the retailer, for the copy of Microsoft Windows alone, rather than the whole computer. Microsoft's dominance in desktop computing operating systems and a frequent lack of understanding on the manufacturer's or retailer's part often makes this refund difficult (but not impossible) to obtain.

==The "Windows tax"==
A common complaint<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bestpricecomputers.ltd.uk/products/nowindows.htm |title=Buying without Windows-Don't want Windows? |publisher=Best Price Computers Ltd |date=February 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/121046/computing_without_windows.html |title=Computing Without Windows |author=Desmond, Michael |publisher=PC World Communications, Inc. |date=May 31, 2005}}</ref> comes from those who want to purchase a computer without a copy of Windows pre-installed and without paying extra for the license either so that another operating system can be used or because a license was already acquired elsewhere, such as through the [[MSDN Academic Alliance]] program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.racketware.info/msdnaa/call-on-students|title=Call on students | date=September 27, 2009}}</ref> Because [[Free software|free]] operating systems are an increasingly viable alternative to Windows, Microsoft attempts to convince [[original equipment manufacturer]]s to supply all of their computers with Windows pre-installed by presenting their dominance in computer sales<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lists.essential.org/info-policy-notes/msg00005.html |title=why PC manufacturers don't sell non MS products? |date=February 1999}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2001/10/23/13219/110 |title=Microsoft's Dirty OEM-Secret | date=October 23, 2001}}</ref> and engaging in private agreements,<ref name="fof">{{Cite web| url=http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/f3800/msjudgex.htm |title=U.S. v. Microsoft: Court's Findings of Fact}}</ref> maximizing the number of copies of Windows sold to OEMs but making it harder for the customer to receive his refund: because the price of the license varies depending on discounts given to the OEM and because there is no similar computer that the OEM offers without Windows, there is no immediate way to find the size of the refund.

While many computer manufacturers have begun to offer specific product ranges with [[Linux]] pre-installed (these include [[HP]], [[Lenovo]], [[Dell]], [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Micro-Star International|MSI]], [[Intel]], [[List of Linux devices#Personal computers|and others]]), they typically strongly lack in this selection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://shop.lenovo.com/ISS_Static/WW/AG/merchandising/US/popups/hmd/popup_helpme_os_reload.html |title=Lenovo: Help Me Decide. Operating system.}} (Lack of no OS or free OS selection for ThinkPad and ThinkCentre)</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shopping/popups/moreInfo.jsp?category=SOFTWARE_OS&catUid=m_c_0 |title=HP Home & Home Office Store - More Info: Operating system}} (Lack of no OS or free OS selection)</ref> Their models are mostly limited to high-end [[workstation]]s and [[Enterprise architecture|enterprise]] servers or budget domestic models. Dell sells Linux pre-installed on home systems on a limited number of models and configurations, and they have in the past warned prospective buyers that "The main thing to note is that when you choose open source you don't get a Windows operating system".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dell.com/ubuntu/ |title=Dell Home & Home Office {{!}} Ubuntu}}</ref>

Formally, computers with free operating systems can be obtained,<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://marc.merlins.org/linux/refundday/dear-valued-customer.html |title=Microsoft official "valued customer" statement}}</ref> but practically most large computer vendors continue to [[Product bundling|bundle]] Microsoft Windows with the majority of the personal computers in their ranges. The Findings of Fact in the [[United States v. Microsoft|United States Microsoft antitrust case of 1998]] established that "One of the ways Microsoft combats piracy is by advising OEMs that they will be charged a higher price for Windows unless they drastically limit the number of PCs that they sell without an operating system pre-installed. In 1998, all major OEMs agreed to this restriction."<ref name="fof"/> This has been called the "Windows tax" or "Microsoft tax" by opposing computer users.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070525-windows-tax-is-50-according-to-dell-linux-pc-pricing.html |title=Dell goes Ubuntu; "Windows tax" is $50 according to pricing |author=Jeremy Reimer |date=May 25, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/159/1017159/cost-of-windows-tax-calculated |title=Cost of Windows tax calculated |author=Charlie Demerjian |date=3 March 2007}}</ref>

The "Windows tax" can altogether be avoided by experienced users, albeit with more effort and time, by assembling a computer from individually purchased parts, thus not buying it from an OEM. Even to the most advanced of users, however, this is difficult if the computer to be built is a [[laptop]]. Personally assembled "[[White box (computer hardware)|white box]]" machines can be sold casually through small vendors or between friends or on the Internet.

Some smaller OEMs and larger retail chains such as [[System76]] have taken specializing in Linux-based systems to their advantage from major suppliers' paucity of non-Windows offerings. Some Linux distributors also run 'partnership' programs to endorse suppliers of machines with their system preinstalled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://webapps.ubuntu.com/partners/system/ |title=Find Ubuntu partners around the world |work=Ubuntu Partners |publisher=Canonical Ltd}}</ref>

==License refund policy==
According to Microsoft's [[Software license agreement|End User License Agreement]], the end user can return Windows for a refund by refusing the terms of the license:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://download.microsoft.com/Documents/UseTerms/Windows%20Vista_Home%20Premium_English_b6fbe7e6-f312-4692-8aee-f5b3d60987b4.pdf |title=Microsoft software license terms for Windows Vista Home Basic, Home Premium and Ultimate versions}}</ref> {{quote|'''By using the software, you accept these terms. If you do not accept them, do not use the software. Instead, contact the manufacturer or installer to determine their return policy for a refund or credit.'''}} Vendors, however, are allowed by Microsoft to avoid this refund by requiring that the computer be returned altogether, despite this being a violation of consumer protection law in many countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6538 |title=Antitrust Tying and Computer Hardware Manufacturers |author=Walt Pennington |date=January 5, 2003}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://library.findlaw.com/1999/Jan/1/241454.html |title=Executive Summary Of The Antitrust Laws: Tying arrangements |author= Richard M. Steuer |date=1999}}</ref>
Microsoft clarified the EULA with the release of Windows 7:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://download.microsoft.com/Documents/UseTerms/Windows%207_Professional_English_b7a7153f-1a6c-498c-9350-c86926bb1aa9.pdf |title=Microsoft Software License Terms: Windows 7 Professional}}</ref>{{quote|'''By using the software, you accept these terms. If you do not accept them, do not use the software. Instead, contact the manufacturer or installer to determine its return policy. You must comply with that policy, which might limit your rights or require you to return the entire system on which the software is installed.'''}} Acer has a policy of charging for the provision of the refund such that the balance received by the customer is as low as €30.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/465/1020465/man-wins-damages-from-acer-over-voleware-refund |title=Man wins damages from Acer over Voleware refund |date=September 22, 2007}}</ref> In other cases, vendors were trying to enforce [[non-disclosure agreement]]s on the customers who requested refunds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://osor.eu/news/cz-lenovo-fails-to-silence-gnu-linux-user-on-windows-refund |title=CZ: Lenovo fails to silence GNU/Linux user on Windows refund |author=Gijs Hillenius |date=October 1, 2008}}</ref><ref name=ynetnews>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3632861,00.html |title=Dell customer awarded Windows refund |author=Niv Lillian |date=December 3, 2008}}</ref>

==License refund cases==
===Toshiba===
* In 1998, Geoffrey Bennett purchased a [[Toshiba]] Notebook with Windows preinstalled, and after much struggle, Geoffrey received a AU$110 check from [[Toshiba]] as a refund.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://b4.vu/g/toshiba.html|title=Toshiba/Microsoft Saga |author=Geoffrey D. Bennett |date=12 August 1998}}</ref>

* In 2010, Thanasis Boudalis received €50 from the Toshiba dealership in Greece, for a Toshiba Satellite laptop with preinstalled Windows 7 Home Premium. After consulation with Toshiba Europe, the dealership immediately agreed to pay that amount. The whole process required 5-6 emails which did not concern whether or not the refund was to be paid, but how the dealership would verify that copy's S/N: the client objected their request of having to visit their offices in person and also to having his PC inspected. In less than two months the money was delivered in cash, with a receipt mentioning "Refund based on European directive".<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.ardin.gr/node/3893|title=How I got a "Windows tax" refund (in Greek) |author=Thanasis Boudalis |date=20 November 2010}}</ref>

===Dell===
* In 2006, a British man, Dave Mitchell, purchased a [[Dell Inspiron]] 640m laptop bundled with Microsoft Windows XP Home SP2 preinstalled, but did not accept Microsoft's [[Software license agreement|End User License Agreement (EULA)]]. Within one week of requesting a refund from [[Dell]], the customer received a "goodwill" refund of [[Pound sterling|GBP]] £47 (£55.23 including [[VAT]]) from [[Dell]] for a "no Windows" option, as the copy of the system was an "unused product" according to the software license agreement. Dell had not asked for the installation medium to be returned and commented that although it doesn't have a Windows refund program, giving a refund in an individual case isn't forbidden either.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6144782.stm|title=User refund for no Windows option |author=Mark Ward |date=14 November 2006 | work=BBC News | accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.linuxworld.com/news/2006/110806-dell-windows-refund.html |title=Dell: Windows refund yes, Windows refund policy no |author=Don Marti |date=8 November 2006}}</ref>

* In the same period, a Swiss man received a refund of about [[Swiss Francs|CHF]] 150 from Dell. The laptop model and refund procedure was the same.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://punto-informatico.it/1708714/PI/Lettere/portatili-dell-rimborsi-windows.aspx|title=Portatili Dell e rimborsi di Windows|author=Punto Informatico|date=20 October 2006}}</ref>

* According to [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]], a German Dell customer replaced the preinstalled Windows with Linux and was credited the amount of €78 for the operating system and a further unspecified Microsoft program.<ref name=heise /> According to [[ynetnews]], an Israeli Dell customer received a refund of $137 for an unused Windows Vista, after filing a small court claim. As it was reported<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dgtlife.blogspot.com/2009/02/fas-will-help-return-money-for-pre.html |title=FAS will help return the money for pre-Windows |date=February 12, 2009}}</ref> a Russian customer received a refund of $73.90 from BenQ for an unused preinstalled copy of Microsoft Windows Vista. It took him approximately 4 months.

* In October 2009, after two months and 14 e-mails of negotiations with Dell representatives, Graeme Cobbett received £70 ($115) refund from Dell for rejected Windows Vista Home Premium license, as he intended to use [[Linux Mint]] on his Dell Studio 1555 laptop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gwa.tumblr.com/post/213975024/get-a-refund-for-your-microsoft-windows-license |title=GWA - Get a refund for your Microsoft Windows license |date=October 15, 2009 }}</ref>

* Acer UK appear to have a procedure in place, the value of Windows 7 starter being £20 {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.

===HP===
* In a civil suit an Italian court rejected [[HP]]'s argument that the licensing conditions had been set unilaterally by Microsoft and ordered HP to reimburse a customer the amount of €90 for an unused copy of Windows XP bundled with a [[Compaq]] notebook.<ref name=heise>{{Cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/98106 |title=HP must reimburse Italian PC buyer the amount paid for Microsoft software |date=October 29, 2007}}</ref> The court was of the opinion that HP had to know about the conditions, because they most likely constituted part of the agreement between them and Microsoft. It also found the fact that computers without an operating system are available on the market to be irrelevant.

* In July 2008, an American HP customer from Hawaii was able to receive a $200 refund from HP for unused Windows Vista, after going through a lot of time consuming interactions with HP representatives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://equiliberate.org/node/3 |title=How I got a Windows Vista refund from HP |date=20 July 2008}}</ref>

===Lenovo===
* While in general Lenovo tries to deny the availability of Windows tax refund,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lnv.lithium.com/t5/General-Discussion/Windows-Refund/m-p/162351|title=Lenovo community: Windows Refund |date=01 October, 2009}}</ref> in 2008 a customer of an official German Lenovo dealer claimed and received €30 from Lenovo Germany for preinstalled Windows XP Tablet Edition bundled to the Lenovo X60 laptop which he bought.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.phoronix.com/forums/showthread.php?p=25443#post25443|title=Successfull refund of "Windows-Tax" |date=21 February 2008}}</ref>

* In August 2008, Mr. Kamil Páral, Lenovo ČR customer, tried in accordance with the EULA of the Windows Vista Business OEM software, to exercise his right to return the license for using the preinstalled operating system from Microsoft because he wanted to use Linux on his computer. In accordance with the terms of the EULA he contacted Lenovo ČR for refund, and after some lengthy negotiations with representatives of Lenovo ČR's technical support and management, he was offered financial compensation for returning the license in the amount of CZK 1950 ($130, €78), pending his acceptance of the non-disclosure agreement. Mr. Páral decided not to accept the offer under such conditions, and forgo the offered compensation. He published an account of his experiences on http://abclinuxu.cz. The editors of the website decided to reward Mr. Páral for publishing the article by paying him an author's royalty in the same amount as was the offered compensation for returning the license.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abclinuxu.cz/clanky/pr/abclinuxu.cz-vyplatil-nahradu-za-licenci-ms-windows-misto-lenovo-cr?page=1 |title=AbcLinuxu.cz Reimbursed User for MS Windows License from Lenovo ČR |date=20 August 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Paul |first=Ryan |title=Lenovo won't refund the Windows tax without an NDA |publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |date=2008-08-31 |url= http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080831-lenovo-wont-refund-the-windows-tax-without-an-nda.html |accessdate=2009-11-20}}</ref>

* In August 2009, Danish programmer [[Poul-Henning Kamp]] asked Lenovo for a refund of a Windows Vista licence preinstalled on a newly purchased laptop. [[Lenovo]] refused the claim.

* In March 2010, Otto Teixeira was refunded [[R$]] 229,00 for a Windows XP Home OEM preinstalled on his netbook. Lenovo Brasil first claimed that an OEM license couldn't be refunded as it was part of the computer, but agreed to refund him about a month later. Teixeira took advice from customer rights' organizations during the process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://info.abril.com.br/noticias/tecnologia-pessoal/ele-rejeitou-o-windows-e-foi-reembolsado-24032010-34.shl|title=Ele rejeitou o Windows e foi reembolsado (in Portuguese)|date=24 March 2010}}</ref>

===Other Microsoft products===
* Those who were forced to pay for [[Windows Home Server]] can also be eligible for a refund if they have not used the software before removing it from their systems. This version of Windows usually comes bundled with [[Headless system|headless]] servers, which are capable of running many other operating systems. Nevertheless it is often hard or impossible to acquire this hardware without a bundled copy of Windows Home Server. In one example of such a refund the owner of a [[Fujitsu Siemens]] [http://ss4200.pbworks.com/ Scaleo Home Server] was refunded $68 <ref>{{Cite web

==Public response==
The difficulties associated with getting a Windows refund from OEMs have evoked a strong response from the public. Websites have been created for the specific purpose of spreading information about the issue and educating others on their options for getting a refund<ref>{{Cite web| title=AFUL Racketware.info|url=http://www.racketware.info | accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref>. In the past, public events (such as the Windows refund day in 1999<ref>{{Cite web| title=Windows refund day|url=http://marc.merlins.org/linux/refundday| accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref> which gained significant media attention<ref>{{Cite news| title=ABC News: Windows refund day video| date=February 15, 1999| url=http://marc.merlins.org/linux/refundday/videos/abc.avi}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| title=BBC News: Sci/Tech: Windows refund day| date=February 16, 1999| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/279926.stm | accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| title=Slashdot: A tiny protest makes a big noise| date=February 17, 1999| url=http://slashdot.org/articles/99/02/16/1732211.shtml | accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| title=The New York Times: Self-Proclaimed Computer Geeks Hold 'Windows Refund Day'| date=February 16, 1999| url=http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/02/biztech/articles/16windows.html | accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| title=The San Francisco Chronicle: They Don't Do Windows / Protestors at Microsoft demand refunds| date=February 16, 1999| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1999/02/16/BU71327.DTL | accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref>) have also been organised, with people expressing their displeasure towards Microsoft and computer OEMs for the bundling of Windows with new computers. The overall goal of such events has been to get OEMs to expand their selection of computers without a copy of Windows pre-installed, with the additional goal of getting them to revise and improve their refund policies while the first goal has not been met.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Windows Refund Day II: Next Steps - Linux Journal| url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6968 | accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref>
