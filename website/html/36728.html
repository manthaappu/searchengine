'''TSS-8''' was a little time-sharing [[operating system]] co-written by Don Witcraft and John Everett at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] in [[1967]]. The operating system ran on the [[12-bit]] [[PDP-8]] computer and was released in [[1968]].

<blockquote>"Don Witcraft wrote the TSS-8 scheduler, command decoder and UUO (Unimplemented User Operations) handler.  John Everett wrote the disk handler, file system, TTY (teletypewriter) handler and  680-I service routine for TSS-8"

"Roger Pyle and John Everett wrote the [[PDP-8]] Disk Monitor System, and John Everett adapted PAL-III to make PAL-D for DMS.  Bob Bowering, author of MACRO for the [[PDP-6]] and [[PDP-10]], wrote an expanded version, PAL-X, for TSS-8."

This timesharing system:

<blockquote>"was based on a protection architecture proposed by Adrian Van Der Goor, a grad student of [[Gordon Bell]]'s at [[Carnegie-Mellon]].  It requires a minimum of 12K words of memory and a swapping device; on a 24K word machine, it could give good support for 17 users."

"Each user gets a virtual 4K PDP-8; many of the utilities users ran on these virtual machines were only slightly modified versions of utilities from the Disk Monitor System or paper-tape environments.  Internally, TSS-8 consists of RMON, the resident monitor, DMON, the disk monitor (file system), and KMON, the keyboard monitor (command shell). BASIC was well supported, while restricted (4K) versions of FORTRAN D and Algol were available."

The [[RSTS/E|RSTS-11]] [[operating system]] is a descendant of TSS-8.
