<html> <head> <title>Computational Center for Nanotechnology Innovations</title></head><body>The '''Computational Center for Nanotechnology Innovations''' (CCNI) is a [[supercomputing]] center located at the Rensselaer Technology Park on the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] campus in [[Troy, New York|Troy]], [[New York]].

==Motivation==
The center is the result of a $100 Million collaboration between [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|RPI]], [[IBM]], and [[New York State]] to further [[nanotechnology]] innovations. The center's main focus is on reducing the cost associated with the development of nanoscale materials and devices, such as used in the [[semiconductor]] industry. The university has also stated the center will also be used for interdisciplinary research in [[biotechnology]], [[medicine]], [[energy]], and other fields.

==Computer Specs==
At the release of the [[TOP500]] supercomputer rankings in June 2010 the CCNI was ranked the 80th most powerful supercomputer in the world, with a peak processing power of 91.75 [[FLOPS|Teraflops]] or 91.75 trillion floating point operations per second.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.top500.org/list/2010/06/100 |title=TOP500 List - June 2010 (1-100) | TOP500 Supercomputing Sites |publisher=[[TOP500]] |accessdate=2010-05-31 |year=2010 |month=May}}</ref> When finished, all of the systems at the center will have a combined power surpassing 100 teraflops.

===Hardware===
The main supercomputer consists of a series of IBM [[BlueGene/L]] systems which contain a total of 32,768 PowerPC 440 700 MHz processors. In addition there is also a heterogeneous array of Power-based Linux machines and [[AMD]] Opteron processor-based clusters running on a common file system with the main supercomputer. Together, these systems will create over 100 [[TeraFLOPS]] of computational power with associated high-speed networking and storage. The CCNI connects to the Rensselaer Troy campus and the [[NYSERNet]] optical research infrastructure, enabling gigabit/second connections to the [[Internet]] and [[Internet2]], [[National LambdaRail]] (NLR), and most of the research networks in the world through a [[peering point]] in Manhattan.
