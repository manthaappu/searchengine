It is available as commercial and non-commercial software. [[Borland]] (later handing on the IDE business to [[Embarcadero Technologies]]) has included a standard version of TeeChart as an integral part of the toolbox palette in most [[Borland Delphi]] and [[C++ Builder]] [[Integrated development environment]] (IDEs) since 1997<ref name = "DrBob">{{Cite web

==History==
The first version of TeeChart was authored in 1995 by David Berneda, co-founder of Steema, using the [[Borland Delphi]] [[Visual Component Library]] programming environment<ref name = "SteemaHist" /> and TeeChart was first released as a shareware version and made available via [[Compuserve]] in the same year.<ref name="keydates">{{Cite web
  | author = Steema Software SL
  | title = Key dates and build history
  | url =http://www.steema.com/company/keyevents
  | accessdate = June 2010 }}</ref> It was written in the first version of Delphi VCL, as a 16bit Charting Library named TeeChart version 1.<ref name="keydates"/> The next version of TeeChart was released as a 32bit library (Delphi 2 supported 32bit compilation<ref name = "DelphiHist">{{Cite web

  | title = Delphi Version History

  | issn = 0199-6649 }}</ref> It has been on the Delphi/C++ Builder toolbox palette ever since, current version being Embarcadero RAD Studio 2010.<ref name = "RADStudio2010"/>

TeeChart's first [[ActiveX]] version named 'version 3' too, to match the VCL version's nomenclature, was released in 1998.<ref name="keydates"/> The version was optimised to work with [[Microsoft]]'s [[Visual Studio]] v97 and v6.0 developer suites that include [[Visual Basic]] and [[Microsoft Visual C++]] programming languages. Support for new programming environments followed with TeeChart's first native C# version for [[Microsoft Visual Studio .NET]] released in 2002<ref name="keydates"/> and TeeChart.Lite for .NET, a free charting component, released for Visual Studio.NET in 2003<ref name="keydates"/> and supporting too, [[Mono (programming)]]. Steema Software released the first native TeeChart [[Java (programming language)]] version in 2006<ref name="keydates"/> and TeeChart's first native [[PHP]] version was released in 2009 and published as [[open-source]] in June 2010.<ref name="keydates"/>

==Usage==
TeeChart is a general purpose charting component designed for use in differing ambits, offering a wide range of aesthetics to chart data. Generally TeeCharts published in the field, in areas where large amounts of data require to be interpreted regularly, remain by designer choice in their simplest form to minimise the "data-ink ratio".<ref>{{Citation

The SDSS chart authors choose to represent data using TeeChart's standard 2D line display. Speed is also a factor when choosing how to most effectively plot data. Realtime data, at frequencies of up to tens or hundreds of data points or more per second, require the most processor economic approach to charting. Computer processing time dedicated to the plotting of data needs to be as lightweight as possible, freeing-up computer tasks "to achieve real-time data acquisition, display and analysis".<ref>{{Citation

An important and stated aspect of many data visualisation applications is the ability to offer interactivity to the user; [[NASA]]'s document, the Orbital Debris Engineering Model ORDEM2008(Beta version), 2009, states that "The graphs may be zoomed, panned, copied to the clipboard, and exported to various file types" <ref>, {{Citation

Charting applications have become increasingly 'onlined', made available either to a wider public or to a territorially remote userbase via networked applications. The [[World wide web]] (the Web) has become "by far, the most popular Internet protocol"<ref>{{Cite web
  | title = History
  | accessdate = May 2010
  | work = World Wide Web
  | url = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web#History}}</ref> to disseminate online applications. Most major IDEs now offer environments for web application developed aimed at browser hosted applications. Charting components, TeeChart among them, have adapted to provide models that work within a browser environment, often using static images and scripted layering techniques such as [[Ajax (programming)]] to offer a level of interactivity, improve response times and hide apparent delay from the user. Options to enrich client, browser-side processing flexibility are exploited by TeeChart libraries via modules that offer 'micro-environments' within the browser, such as the long established [[ActiveX]] technology, [[Adobe Flash]], Microsoft [[Silverlight]] or Java [[Applets]]. Serverside environments offer too, a means to interact with browser based script to dynamically respond to charting requests. [[Joomla]] and [[CodeIgniter]] are host environments for TeeChart PHP and an example of an Embarcadero [[IntraWeb VCL]] designed application using TeeChart, is documented here.<ref>{{Citation
