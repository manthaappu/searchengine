'''xconfig''' is short for the <code>'xconfig'</code> target for the [[Linux Kernel|Linux]] [[Makefile]]. It is a graphical Linux compilation utility, which uses [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]]. The xconfig utility is invoked by running <code>'make xconfig'</code> in the base Linux source directory.

Qt has only been used in Kernel 2.6. Kernel 2.4 uses a [[Tcl]]/[[Tk (computing)|Tk]] configuration interface. A [[GTK+]] interface is also available for Kernel 2.6.
