'''Interactive C''' is a program which uses a modified version of [[ANSI C]] with several libraries and features that allow hobbyists to program small robotics platforms.

==Version by Newton Research Labs==
Newton Research Labs developed Interactive C as a compiling environment for robots using the [[Freescale 68HC11|Motorola 6811]] processor. The MIT LEGO Robot Design Contest (6.270) was the original purpose for the software<ref>[http://spacecats.mit.edu/ MIT's Autonomous Robot Design Competition]</ref>. It became popular, however, due to its ability to compile [[on the fly]] rather than taking time to compile beforehand as other languages had done. The programming environment's newest version is IC Version 8.0.2, which supports these [[operating system]]s:
*[[Microsoft Windows]] [[Windows XP|XP]], [[Windows 2000|2000]], [[Windows Vista|Vista]]
*[[Macintosh]]
*[[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]]: [[IRIX]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[SunOS]]; [[Linux]]

The screenshot to the right shows Interactive C running on a Windows [[operating system]]. The program features an ''Interaction Window'' where one-line C commands can be sent to the connected controller as well as an editing window, here titled ''main.c'', where a program file is being edited and can be sent to the attached controller.

Here is the basic "Hello World" example for IC programming:
<source lang="c">
void main()
 {
      printf("Hello World");
 }
</source>
Here is another example using motor ports 1 and 3:
<source lang="c">
void main()
 {
      motor(1,100);
      motor(3,100);
      sleep(2.0);
      ao();
 }
</source>
<source lang="c">
void main
{
while(1)
{
beep();
}
}
 </source>
a basic [[infinite loop]] that will beep for ever. 

Interactive C is used by [[The Ohio State University]] to program [[Handy Board|MIT Handy Board]]s in its Fundamentals of Engineering for Honors Program. [http://feh.osu.edu/Lectures/192wi06/Lecture%2026%20-%20Handy%20Board%20-%2006.ppt#263,11,Interactive_C|1]

==Version by KISS Institute for Practical Robotics==
KISS Institute for Practical Robotics developed a third-party alternative to the Newton Labs version of Interactive C for their [[Botball]] Educational Robotics Program.

The latest version of Interactive C by KISS Institute for Practical Robotics is IC 8.0.2, which supports these operating systems:
*Windows 2000, XP, Vista
*[[Mac OS X]] 10.3, 10.4, 10.5
*Linux (with gcc 3.3)

IC8 supports the following robotics controllers:
*Xport Botball Controller ([[XBC]]) versions 1, 2, and 3
*Xport Botball Controller ([[XBC]]) with iRobot Create
*MIT [[Handy Board]] with [[Expansion card|Expansion Board]]
*[[Lego_Mindstorms#RCX| Lego RCX]] using the serial IR tower
