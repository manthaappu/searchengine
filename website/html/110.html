The '''3Com Ergo Audrey''' is a discontinued [[internet appliance]] from [[3Com]]. It was released to the public on October 17, 2000 for [[United States dollar|USD]]499 as the first (and only) device in the company's "Ergo" initiative to hit the market.<ref>{{cite web | title=3Com lets Audrey out the door | work=News.com | url= | accessdate=2010-01-15}}</ref> Once connected to an appropriate provider, users could access the [[internet]], send and receive [[e-mail]], play audio and video, and synchronize with up to two [[Palm OS]]-based devices.  

''Audrey'' was the brainchild of Don Fotsch (formerly of Apple Computer and U.S. Robotics) and Ray Winninger. Don and Ray had a vision for a family of appliances, each designed for a specific room in the house. The brand ''Ergo'' was meant to convey that intent, as in "it's in the kitchen, ''[[ergo]]'' it's designed that way"<ref name="ReferenceA">Direct Knowledge - I was there at the time that it was said. - Rob Hudson</ref>. There were plans to serve other rooms in the house as well. They considered the kitchen to be the heart of the home and the control room for the home manager. Don coined the phrase "Internet Snacking" to describe the lightweight web browsing done in this environment<ref name="ReferenceA"/>. 

The name ''Audrey'' was given to this first product to honor [[Audrey Hepburn]]. It was meant to deliver the elegance that she exuded. The project codename was "[[Kojak]]", named after the [[Telly Savalas]] character. The follow-on product targeted for the family room was code named "[[Mannix]]".

3Com discontinued the product on June 1, 2001, in the wake of the [[Dot-com bubble|dot.com crash]], after only seven and a half months on the market. 3Com customers received full refunds for the product and accessories.  The remaining Audrey hardware was liquidated and embraced by the [[hardware hacker]] community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Audrey's life cut short|work=News.com|url=http://news.com.com/2100-1040-254497.html|accessdate=2010-01-15}}</ref>

==Hardware==
The Audrey is a [[touchscreen]], passive matrix LCD device and came equipped with a [[Stylus (computing)|stylus]].  All applications were touch-enabled.  Since the standard [[infrared]] keyboard was only needed for typing tasks, it could be hung out of the way on the rear of the unit.  The stylus was to be placed in a receptacle on the top of the screen with an [[light-emitting diode|LED]] that flashed when email arrived.  Buttons on the right side of the screen were used to access the web browser, email application, and calendar, and a wheel knob at the bottom selected different "channels" of [[push technology|push]] content.

The 3Com Audrey is powered by a 200 [[Megahertz|MHz]] [[Geode (processor)|Geode]] GX 1 [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]], with 16 [[Megabyte|MB]] of [[flash ROM]] and 32 MB of [[Random access memory|RAM]]. It measures 9 x 11.8 x 3.0 inches (22.86 x 29.97 x 7.62 cm), and weighs 4.1 pounds (1.86 kg). It is powered by the [[QNX]] [[operating system]].  The Audrey is equipped with a [[modem]], two [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] ports, and a [[CompactFlash]] socket.  A USB [[Ethernet]] adapter was commonly used for [[broadband]] subscribers.

The Audrey was also available in such shades as "linen" (off-white), "meadow" (green), "ocean" (blue), "slate" (grey), and "sunshine" (light yellow).

==Hacking==
After the demise of official support, the Audrey drew the attention of computer enthusiasts.  They quickly discovered an [[exploit (computer security)|exploit]] to launch a [[pterm]] session.  Using [[privilege escalation]] techniques, the [[superuser|root]] password in the [[Passwd (file)|passwd]] file could be edited, opening the box to further experimentation.

Many of the tools for the [[QNX]] operating system development platform were quickly adapted for use in the Audrey, including an updated web browser ([[Voyager (web browser)|Voyager]]), an MP3 player, digital rotating photoframe, and other applications.<ref>{{cite web|title=3Com Ergo Audrey|work=PC Magazine|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,34321,00.asp|accessdate=2010-01-15}}</ref>

The CompactFlash slot was also investigated.  Although it could not be used for storage expansion, the Audrey was set to flash its operating system from the slot.  Soon, a variety of replacement OS images were distributed among enthusiasts.  As the device could utilize an optional Ethernet connection, it was an easy task to mount a remote disk drive served up by a neighboring desktop system, thus allowing for virtually unlimited storage capability.
