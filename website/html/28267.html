<html> <head> <title>Packet drop attack</title></head><body>In [[computer networking]], a '''packet drop attack''' or '''blackhole attack''' is a type of [[denial-of-service attack]] accomplished by dropping [[packet (information technology)|packet]]s. The attack can be accomplished either selectively (e.g. by dropping packets for a particular network destination, a packet every ''n'' packets or every ''t'' seconds, or a randomly selected portion of the packets, which is called "Gray hole attack") or in bulk (by dropping all packets).
