'''Sir Karl Raimund Popper''', CH, FRS, FBA (28 July 1902 – 17 September 1994) was an Austro-British<ref>Watkins, J. Obituary of Karl Popper, 1902–1994.

Popper is known for his attempt to repudiate the classical observationalist / [[Inductivism|inductivist]] account of [[scientific method]] by advancing [[Falsifiability|empirical falsification]] instead; for his opposition to the classical [[justificationism|justificationist]] account of knowledge which he replaced with critical rationalism, "the first ''non justificational philosophy of criticism'' in the history of philosophy";<ref>[[William W. Bartley]]: [http://web.archive.org/web/20070928020520/http://www.the-rathouse.com/files/Bartley__1964__limits_of_criticism.doc Rationality versus the Theory of Rationality], In Mario Bunge: ''The Critical Approach to Science and Philosophy'' (The Free Press of Glencoe, 1964), section IX.</ref> and for his vigorous defense of [[liberal democracy]] and the principles of [[social criticism]] that he came to believe made a flourishing "open society" possible.

== Life ==
Karl Popper was born in [[Vienna]] (then in [[Austria-Hungary]]) in 1902, to [[upper middle-class]] parents of [[assimilated Jew]]ish origins, both of whom had converted to [[Christianity]]. Karl's father Simon Siegmund Carl Popper was a lawyer from [[Bohemia]], and mother Jenny Schiff was of [[Silesians|Silesian]] and [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] descent.  After establishing themselves in Vienna, the Poppers made a rapid social climb in Viennese society: Simon Siegmund Carl became a legal partner of Vienna's liberal mayor Raimond Grübl and, after his death in 1898, took over the firm (Karl received his middle name from the mayor).<ref name=TheFormativeYears>Malachi Haim Hacohen.

Popper received a [[Lutheran]] upbringing and was educated at the [[University of Vienna]].<ref name=MageeStoryPhilosophy>[[Bryan Magee|Magee, Bryan]]. ''The Story of Philosophy.'' New York: [[DK Publishing]], 2001. p. 221, ISBN 0-7894-3511-X</ref>  His father was a doctor of law at the Vienna University and a [[bibliophile]] who had 12,000–14,000 volumes in his personal library.<ref name="bibliophile">Raphael, F.

In 1919, Popper became attracted by [[Marxism]] and subsequently joined the Association of Socialist School Students.  He also became a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria]], which was at that time a party that fully adopted the Marxist ideology.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/ Stephen Thornton, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]</ref>  He soon became disillusioned by what he saw to be the philosophical restraints imposed by the [[historical materialism]] of Marx, abandoned the ideology and remained a supporter of [[social liberalism]] throughout his life.

In 1928, he earned a doctorate in Philosophy and then, from 1930 to 1936, taught secondary school.  Popper published his first book, ''Logik der Forschung'' (''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''), in 1934. Here, he criticised [[psychologism]], [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], [[inductionism]], and [[logical positivism]], and put forth his theory of potential [[falsifiability]] as the criterion demarcating science from non-science.

<!-- [[File:popper 1.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Gravesite of Sir Karl Popper in Lainzer Friedhof, Vienna, Austria.]] -->
In 1937, the rise of [[Nazism]] and the threat of the [[Anschluss]] led Popper to emigrate to New Zealand, where he became lecturer in philosophy at [[University of Canterbury|Canterbury University College]] [[University of New Zealand|New Zealand]] (at [[Christchurch, New Zealand|Christchurch]]). In 1946, he moved to England to
become [[reader (academic rank)|reader]] in [[logic]] and [[scientific method]] at the [[London School of Economics]]. Three years later, he was appointed as professor of logic and scientific method at the University of London in 1949. Popper was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1958 to 1959. He was [[British honours system|knighted]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1965, and was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1976. He retired from academic life in 1969, though he remained intellectually active for the rest of his life. He was invested with the Insignia of a [[Order of the Companions of Honour|Companion of Honour]] in 1982. Popper was a member of the [[Academy of Humanism]] and described himself as an [[agnosticism|agnostic]], showing respect for the moral teachings of Judaism and Christianity.

Popper won many awards and honours in his field, including the Lippincott Award of the [[American Political Science Association]], the [[Sonning Prize]], and fellowships in the Royal Society, [[British Academy]], London School of Economics, [[King's College London]], [[Darwin College, Cambridge|Darwin College]] [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and [[Charles University in Prague|Charles University, Prague]]. Austria awarded him the Grand [[Decoration for Services to the Republic of Austria]] in Gold.

Popper died in [[Croydon]], UK at the age of 92 on 17 September 1994. After cremation, his ashes were taken to Vienna and buried at Lainzer cemetery adjacent to the [[ORF]] Centre, where his wife Josefine Anna Henninger, who had died in Austria several years before, had already been buried.

== Popper's philosophy ==
=== Philosophy of science ===
{{Refimprove|section|date=August 2010}} 
Popper coined the term ''[[critical rationalism]]'' to describe his philosophy. The term indicates his rejection of classical [[empiricism]], and of ''the classical [[inductivism|observationalist-inductivist]] account of science'' that had grown out of it. Popper argued strongly against the latter, holding that [[scientific theories]] are abstract in nature, and can be tested only indirectly, by reference to their implications. He also held that scientific theory, and human knowledge generally, is irreducibly conjectural or hypothetical, and is generated by the creative imagination in order to solve problems that have arisen in specific historio-cultural settings. Logically, no number of positive outcomes at the level of experimental testing can confirm a scientific theory, but a single counterexample is logically decisive: it shows the theory, from which the implication is derived, to be false. The term "falsifiable" does not mean something is false; rather, that if it is false, then this can be shown by observation or experiment. Popper's account of the logical asymmetry between [[Verification theory|verification]] and [[falsifiability]] lies at the heart of his philosophy of science. It also inspired him to take falsifiability as his criterion of [[Demarcation problem|demarcation]] between what is and is not genuinely scientific: a theory should be considered scientific if and only if it is falsifiable. This led him to attack the claims of both [[psychoanalysis]] and contemporary [[Marxism]] to scientific status, on the basis that their theories are not falsifiable. Popper also wrote extensively against the famous [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]. He strongly disagreed with [[Niels Bohr]]'s [[instrumentalism]] and supported [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[scientific realism|realist]] approach to scientific theories about the universe. Popper's falsifiability resembles [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]]'s nineteenth century [[fallibilism]]. In ''Of Clocks and Clouds'' (1966), Popper remarked that he wished he had known of Peirce's work earlier.

In ''All Life is Problem Solving'', Popper sought to explain the apparent progress of scientific knowledge&mdash;how it is that our understanding of the universe seems to improve over time. This problem arises from his position that the truth content of our theories, even the best of them, cannot be verified by scientific testing, but can only be falsified.  Again, in this context the word 'falsified' does not refer to something being 'fake'; rather, that something can be (i.e., is ''capable'' of being) shown to be false by observation or experiment.  Some things simply do not lend themselves to being shown to be false, and therefore are not falsifiable.  If so, then how is it that the growth of science appears to result in a growth in knowledge? In Popper's view, the advance of scientific knowledge is an ''evolutionary'' process characterized by his formula:

: <math>PS_1 \rightarrow TT_1 \rightarrow EE_1 \rightarrow PS_2. \, </math>

In response to a given problem situation (<math>PS_1</math>), a number of competing conjectures, or tentative theories (<math>TT</math>), are systematically subjected to the most rigorous attempts at falsification possible. This process, error elimination (<math>EE</math>), performs a similar function for science that [[natural selection]] performs for [[biological evolution]]. Theories that better survive the process of refutation are not more true, but rather, more "fit"&mdash;in other words, more applicable to the problem situation at hand (<math>PS_1</math>). Consequently, just as a species' biological fitness does not ensure continued survival, neither does rigorous testing protect a scientific theory from refutation in the future. Yet, as it appears that the engine of biological evolution has produced, over time, adaptive traits equipped to deal with more and more complex problems of survival, likewise, the evolution of theories through the scientific method may, in Popper's view, reflect a certain type of progress: toward more and more ''interesting problems'' (<math>PS_2</math>). For Popper, it is in the interplay between the tentative theories (conjectures) and error elimination (refutation) that scientific knowledge advances toward greater and greater problems; in a process very much akin to the interplay between genetic variation and natural selection.

Where does "truth" fit into all this? As early as 1934 Popper wrote of the search for truth as "''one of the strongest motives for scientific discovery.''" Still, he describes in ''Objective Knowledge'' (1972) early concerns about the much-criticized notion of [[Correspondence theory of truth|truth as correspondence]]. Then came the [[semantic theory of truth]] formulated by the logician [[Alfred Tarski]] and published in 1933. Popper writes of learning in 1935 of the consequences of Tarski's theory, to his intense joy. The theory met critical objections to [[truth]] as correspondence and thereby rehabilitated it. The theory also seemed, in Popper's eyes, to support [[metaphysical realism]] and the ''regulative'' idea of a search for truth.

According to this theory, the conditions for the truth of a sentence as well as the sentences themselves are part of a [[metalanguage]]. So, for example, the sentence "Snow is white" is true if and only if snow is white. Although many philosophers have interpreted, and continue to interpret, Tarski's theory as a [[Deflationary theory of truth|deflationary theory]], Popper refers to it as a theory in which "is true" is replaced with "[[correspondence theory|corresponds to the facts]]". He bases this interpretation on the fact that examples such as the one described above refer to two things: assertions and ''the facts'' to which they refer. He identifies Tarski's formulation of the truth conditions of sentences as the introduction of a "metalinguistic predicate" and distinguishes the following cases:

# "John called" is true.
# "It is true that John called."

The first case belongs to the metalanguage whereas the second is more likely to belong to the object language. Hence, "it is true that" possesses the logical status of a redundancy. "Is true", on the other hand, is a predicate necessary for making general observations such as "John was telling the truth about Phillip."

Upon this basis, along with that of the logical content of assertions (where logical content is inversely proportional to probability), Popper went on to develop his important notion of [[verisimilitude]] or "truthlikeness".

The intuitive idea behind verisimilitude is that the assertions or hypotheses of scientific theories can be objectively measured with respect to the amount of truth and falsity that they imply. And, in this way, one theory can be evaluated as more or less true than another on a quantitative basis which, Popper emphasizes forcefully, has nothing to do with "subjective probabilities" or other merely "epistemic" considerations.

The simplest mathematical formulation that Popper gives of this concept can be found in the tenth chapter of ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]''. Here he defines it as:

: <math>Vs(a)=CT_v(a)-CT_f(a) \,</math>

where <math>Vs(a)</math> is the verisimilitude of ''a'', <math>CT_v(a)</math> is a measure of the content of truth of ''a'', and <math>CT_f(a)</math> is a measure of the content of the falsity of ''a''.

Knowledge, for Popper, was ''objective'', both in the sense that it is objectively true (or truthlike), and also in the sense that knowledge has an ontological status (i.e., knowledge as object) independent of the knowing subject (''Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach'', 1972). He proposed three worlds (see [[Popperian cosmology]]): World One, being the physical world, or physical states; World Two, being the world of mind, or mental states, ideas, and perceptions; and World Three, being the body of human knowledge expressed in its manifold forms, or the products of the second world made manifest in the materials of the first world (i.e.&ndash;books, papers, paintings, symphonies, and all the products of the human mind). World Three, he argued, was the product of individual human beings in exactly the same sense that an animal path is the product of individual animals, and that, as such, has an existence and evolution independent of any individual knowing subjects. The influence of World Three, in his view, on the individual human mind (World Two) is at least as strong as the influence of World One. In other words, the knowledge held by a given individual mind owes at least as much to the total accumulated wealth of human knowledge, made manifest, as to the world of direct experience. As such, the growth of human knowledge could be said to be a function of the independent evolution of World Three. Many contemporary philosophers have not embraced Popper's Three World conjecture, due mostly, it seems, to its resemblance to [[Cartesian dualism]].

=== Political philosophy ===
{{Liberalism sidebar}}
In ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' and ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'', Popper developed a critique of [[historicism]] and a defence of the 'Open Society'. Popper considered historicism to be the theory that history develops inexorably and necessarily according to knowable general laws towards a determinate end. He argued that this view is the principal theoretical presupposition underpinning most forms of [[authoritarianism]] and [[totalitarianism]]. He argued that historicism is founded upon mistaken assumptions regarding the nature of scientific law and prediction. Since the growth of human knowledge is a causal factor in the evolution of human history, and since "no society can predict, scientifically, its own future states of knowledge", it follows, he argued, that there can be no predictive science of human history. For Popper, metaphysical and historical indeterminism go hand in hand. In ''[[After The Open Society]]'', which was published posthumously, a large collection of his previously unpublished and uncollected essays on social and political topics was assembled.  In this, one can trace his ideas from material that pre-dated ''The Open Society and Its Enemies'' to something that was completed just as he died.

In a 1992 lecture, Popper explained the connection between his political philosophy and his philosophy of science. As he stated, he was in his early years impressed by communism and also active in the Austrian Communist party. What had a profound effect on him was an event that happened in 1918: during a riot, caused by the Communists, the police shot several people, including some of Popper's friends. When Popper later told the leaders of the Communist party about this, they responded by stating that this loss of life was necessary in working towards the inevitable workers' revolution. This statement did not convince Popper and he started to think about what kind of reasoning would justify such a statement. He later concluded that there could not be any justification for it, and this was the start of his later criticism of historicism.

In 1947, Popper founded with [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Ludwig von Mises]] and others the [[Mont Pelerin Society]] to defend [[classical liberalism]], in the spirit of the Open Society.

====The paradox of tolerance====
Although Popper was an advocate of toleration, he opined that even a tolerant person cannot always accept another's intolerance.<br>
For, if tolerance allowed intolerance to succeed completely, tolerance itself would be threatened. In ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies|The Open Society and Its Enemies: The Spell of Plato]]'', he argued that: <blockquote>Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. </blockquote>The utterence of intolerant philosophies should not always be suppressed, "as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion." However, <blockquote>we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive , and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. </blockquote>Furthermore, in support of [[human rights]] legislation in the second half of the 20th century, he stated:<blockquote>
We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.<ref>''The Open Society and Its Enemies: The Spell of Plato'', by Karl Raimund Popper, Princeton University Press, 1971, ISBN 0-691-01968-1, pg 265</ref></blockquote>

=== Problem of induction ===
Among his contributions to philosophy is his attempt to answer the philosophical [[problem of induction]] as emphasized strongly by [[David Hume]]. The problem, in basic terms, can be understood by example: given that the sun has risen every day for as long as anyone can remember, what is the rational proof that it will rise tomorrow? How can one rationally prove that past events will continue to repeat in the future, just because they have repeated in the past?

Popper claims to have found a solution to the problem of induction. His reply is characteristic, and ties in with his criterion of falsifiability. He states that while there is no way to prove that the sun will rise, it is possible to formulate the theory that every day the sun will rise—if it does not rise on some particular day, the theory will be falsified and will have to be replaced by a different one. Until that day, there is no need to reject the assumption that the theory is true. Neither is it rational according to Popper to instead make the more complex assumption that the sun will rise until a given day, but will stop doing so the day after, or similar statements with additional conditions.

Such a theory would be true with higher probability, because it cannot be attacked so easily: To falsify the first one, it is sufficient to find that sun has stopped rising; to falsify the second one, one additionally needs the assumption that the given day has not yet been reached. Popper held that it is the least likely, or most easily falsifiable, or simplest theory (attributes which he all identified as the same thing) that explains known facts that one should rationally prefer. His opposition to positivism, which held that it is the theory most likely to be true that one should prefer, here becomes very apparent. It is impossible, Popper argues, to ensure a theory to be true (but not fatal, since even false theories may have true consequence); it is more important that they can be eliminated and corrected as easily as possible if false.

Popper and Hume agreed that there is often a psychological belief that the sun will rise tomorrow, but both denied that there is logical justification for the supposition that it will, simply because it always has in the past. Popper writes: <blockquote>"I approached the problem of induction through Hume. Hume, I felt, was perfectly right in pointing out that induction cannot be logically justified." (''Conjectures and Refutations'', p. 55)</blockquote>

To Popper, who was an anti-[[justificationism|justificationist]], traditional philosophy is misled by the false [[principle of sufficient reason]]. He thinks that no assumption can ever be or needs ever to be justified, so a lack of justification is not a justification for doubt. Instead, theories should be tested and scrutinized. It is not the goal to bless theories with claims of certainty or justification, but to eliminate errors in them:
<blockquote>"there ''are'' no such things as good positive reasons; nor do we need such things [...] But [philosophers] obviously cannot quite bring [themselves] to believe that this is my opinion, let alone that it is right" (''The Philosophy of Karl Popper'', p. 1043)</blockquote>

===Free will===
Popper and [[John Eccles (neurophysiologist)|John Eccles]] speculated on the problem of [[free will]] for many years generally agreeing on an [[Interactionist dualism|interactionist dualist]] theory of mind. However, although Popper was a body-mind dualist, he did not think that the mind is a substance separate from the body: he thought that mental or psychological properties or aspects of people are distinct from physical ones.<ref>Popper, K. R. “Of Clouds and Clocks,” in his Objective Knowledge, corrected edition, pp. 206-55, Oxford, Oxford University Press (1973), p. 231 footnote 43, & p. 252; also Popper, K. R. ‘‘[http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/popper/natural_selection_and_the_emergence_of_mind.html “Natural Selection and the Emergence of Mind”]’’1977.</ref>

When he gave the first [[Arthur Holly Compton]] Memorial Lecture in 1955, Popper revisited the idea of [[quantum indeterminacy]] as a source of human freedom. Eccles had suggested that "critically poised neurons" might be influenced by the mind to assist in a decision. Popper criticized Compton's idea of amplified quantum events affecting the decision. He wrote
<blockquote>
"The idea that the only alternative to determinism is just sheer chance was taken over by [[Moritz Schlick|Schlick]], together with many of his views on the subject, from [[David Hume|Hume]], who asserted that 'the removal' of what he called 'physical necessity' must always result in
<blockquote>
    'the same thing with chance. As objects must either be conjoin'd or not, . . . 'tis impossible to admit of any medium betwixt chance and an absolute necessity'.<ref>Popper's Hume quote is from Treatise on Human Understanding, (see note 8) Book I, Part I, Section XIV, p.171</ref>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"I shall later argue against this important doctrine according to which the alternative to determinism is sheer chance. Yet I must admit that the doctrine seems to hold good for the quantum-theoretical models which have been designed to explain, or at least to illustrate, the possibility of human freedom. This seems to be the reason why these models are so very unsatisfactory.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"Hume's and Schlick's ontological thesis that there cannot exist anything intermediate between chance and determinism seems to me not only highly dogmatic (not to say doctrinaire) but clearly absurd; and it is understandable only on the assumption that they believed in a complete determinism in which chance has no status except as a symptom of our ignorance."<ref>"Of Clouds and Clocks," in ''Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach'', Oxford (1972) p. 227ff.</ref>
</blockquote>

Popper called not for something ''between'' chance and necessity but for a combination of randomness and control to explain freedom, though not yet explicitly in two stages with random chance before the controlled decision.
<blockquote>
  "freedom is not just chance but, rather, the result of a subtle interplay between something almost random or haphazard, and something like a restrictive or selective control."<ref>''ibid'', p.232</ref>
</blockquote>

Then in his 1977 book with John Eccles, ''The Self and its Brain'', Popper finally formulates the two-stage model in a temporal sequence. And he compares free will to Darwinian evolution and natural selection,
<blockquote>
"New ideas have a striking similarity to genetic mutations. Now, let us look for a moment at genetic mutations. Mutations are, it seems, brought about by quantum theoretical indeterminacy (including radiation effects). Accordingly, they are also probabilistic and not in themselves originally selected or adequate, but on them there subsequently operates natural selection which eliminates inappropriate mutations. Now we could conceive of a similar process with respect to new ideas and to free-will decisions, and similar things.
<p/>
"That is to say, a range of possibilities is brought about by a probabilistic and quantum mechanically characterized set of proposals, as it were - of possibilities brought forward by the brain. On these there then operates a kind of selective procedure which eliminates those proposals and those possibilities which are not acceptable to the mind."<ref>Eccles, John C. and Karl Popper. ''The Self and Its Brain: An Argument for Interactionism,'' Routledge (1984)</ref>
</blockquote>

Other thinkers who have formulated a two-stage model for free will include [[William James]], [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Arthur Compton]], [[Henry Margenau]], and [[Daniel Dennett]].

== Issue of Darwinism ==
Karl Popper famously stated "[[Darwinism]] is not a testable scientific theory, but a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] research program." He continued:{{quote|And yet, the theory is invaluable. I do not see how, without it, our knowledge could have grown as it has done since Darwin. In trying to explain experiments with bacteria which become adapted to, say, penicillin, it is quite clear that we are greatly helped by the theory of natural selection. Although it is metaphysical, it sheds much light upon very concrete and very practical researches. It allows us to study adaptation to a new environment (such as a penicillin-infested environment) in a rational way: it suggests the existence of a mechanism of adaptation, and it allows us even to study in detail the mechanism at work.<ref> ''Unended Quest'' ch. 37 - see Bibliography</ref>}} 
He also noted that [[theism]] presented as explaining adaptation "was worse than an open admission of failure, for it created the impression that an ultimate explanation had been reached."<ref name="popper_on_natural_selection">

</ref>
He later said {{quote|When speaking here of Darwinism, I shall speak always of today's theory - that is Darwin's own theory of natural selection supported by the Mendelian theory of heredity, by the theory of the mutation and recombination of genes in a gene pool, and by the decoded genetic code. This is an immensely impressive and powerful theory. The claim that it completely explains evolution is of course a bold claim, and very far from being established. All scientific theories are conjectures, even those that have successfully passed many severe and varied tests. The Mendelian underpinning of modern Darwinism has been well tested, and so has the theory of evolution which says that all terrestrial life has evolved from a few primitive unicellular organisms, possibly even from one single organism.<ref name="popper_on_natural_selection"/>}}

He explained that the difficulty of testing had led some people to describe natural selection as a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]], and that he too had in the past described the theory as 'almost tautological', and had tried to explain how the theory could be untestable (as is a tautology) and yet of great scientific interest. His {{quote|solution was that the doctrine of natural selection is a most successful metaphysical research programme. It raises detailed problems in many fields, and it tells us what we would expect of an acceptable solution of these problems. I still believe that natural selection works in this way as a research programme. Nevertheless, I have changed my mind about the testability and logical status of the theory of natural selection; and I am glad to have an opportunity to make a recantation.<ref name="popper_on_natural_selection"/>}}
Popper summarized his new view as follows: {{quote|The theory of natural selection may be so formulated that it is far from tautological. In this case it is not only testable, but it turns out to be not strictly universally true. There seem to be exceptions, as with so many biological theories; and considering the random character of the variations on which natural selection operates, the occurrence of exceptions is not surprising. Thus not all phenomena of evolution are explained by natural selection alone. Yet in every particular case it is a challenging research program to show how far natural selection can possibly be held responsible for the evolution of a particular organ or behavioral program.<ref> Karl Popper in ''Evolutionary epistemology, rationality, and the sociology of knowledge'' by Radnitzky, Bartley and Popper, pp. 144-145, accessible at [http://books.google.com/books?id=QnFiTrCzg5oC&pg=PA145&dq=The+theory+of+natural+selection+may+so+be+formulated+that+is+far+from+tautological.+In+this+case+it+is+not+only+testable,+but+it+turns+out+to+be+not+strictly+universally+true.+There+seems+to+be+exceptions&hl=en&ei=6I8kTZOgEIPCcfHx6LkB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=The%20theory%20of%20natural%20selection%20may%20so%20be%20formulated%20that%20is%20far%20from%20tautological.%20In%20this%20case%20it%20is%20not%20only%20testable%2C%20but%20it%20turns%20out%20to%20be%20not%20strictly%20universally%20true.%20There%20seems%20to%20be%20exceptions&f=false]</ref>

== Influence ==
[[File:Karl Popper2.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Karl Popper in 1990.]]
Popper played a vital role in establishing the [[philosophy of science]] as a vigorous, autonomous discipline within [[analytic philosophy]], through his own prolific and influential works, and also through his influence on his own contemporaries and students. Popper founded in 1946 the Department of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method at the [[London School of Economics]] and there lectured and influenced both [[Imre Lakatos]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]], two of the foremost philosophers of science in the next generation of philosophy of science. (Lakatos significantly modified Popper's position, and Feyerabend repudiated it entirely, but the work of both is deeply influenced by Popper and engaged with many of the problems that Popper set.)

While there is some dispute as to the matter of influence, Popper had a long-standing and close friendship with economist [[Friedrich Hayek]], who was also brought to the London School of Economics from Vienna. Each found support and similarities in each other's work, citing each other often, though not without qualification. In a letter to Hayek in 1944, Popper stated, "I think I have learnt more from you than from any other living thinker, except perhaps [[Alfred Tarski]]."<ref>Hacohen, 2000</ref> Popper dedicated his ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]'' to Hayek. For his part, Hayek dedicated a collection of papers, ''Studies in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics'', to Popper, and in 1982 said, "...ever since his ''Logik der Forschung'' first came out in 1934, I have been a complete adherent to his general theory of methodology."<ref>Weimer and Palermo, 1982</ref>

Popper also had long and mutually influential friendships with art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]], biologist [[Peter Medawar]], and neuro-scientist [[John Carew Eccles]].

Popper's influence, both through his work in philosophy of science and through his political philosophy, has also extended beyond the academy. Among Popper's students and advocates at the London School of Economics is the billionaire investor [[George Soros]], who says his investment strategies are modelled on Popper's understanding of the advancement of knowledge through the distinctly [[Hegelian]] idea of [[falsifiability|falsification]]. Among Soros's [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] foundations is the [[Open Society Institute]], a think-tank named in honour of Popper's ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', which Soros founded to advance the Popperian defense of the [[open society]] against [[authoritarianism]] and [[totalitarianism]].

Popperian philosophy also inspired the creation of [[Taking Children Seriously]], a libertarian movement which noticed that Popper's general theory of knowledge creation does not differentiate between adults and children.

== Criticism ==
=== Criticism of his philosophy of science ===
Most criticisms of Popper's philosophy are of the falsification, or error elimination, element in his account of problem solving. In interpreting these, it is important to bear in mind the aims of his idea. It is intended as an ideal, practical method of effective human problem solving; as such, the current conclusions of science are stronger than pseudo-sciences or non-sciences, insofar as they have survived this particularly vigorous selection method. He does not argue that any such conclusions are therefore true, or that this describes the actual methods of any particular scientist.

Rather, it is a recommended ideal method that, if enacted by a system or community, will over time lead to slow but steady progress of a sort (relative to how well the system or community enacts the method). It has been suggested that Popper's ideas are often mistaken for a hard logical account of truth because of the historical co-incidence of their appearing at the same time as [[logical positivism]], the followers of which mistook his aims for their own.<ref>Bryan Magee 1973: Popper (Modern Masters series)</ref>

The [[confirmation holism|Quine-Duhem thesis]] argues that it's impossible to test a single hypothesis on its own, since each one comes as part of an environment of theories. Thus we can only say that the whole package of relevant theories has been collectively falsified, but cannot conclusively say which element of the package must be replaced. An example of this is given by the discovery of the planet [[Neptune]]: when the motion of [[Uranus]] was found not to match the predictions of Newton's laws, the theory "There are seven planets in the solar system" was rejected, and not Newton's laws themselves. Popper discussed this critique of [[Falsifiability#Naïve|naïve falsificationism]] in Chapters 3 & 4 of ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''. For Popper, theories are accepted or rejected via a sort of selection process. Theories that say more about the way things appear are to be preferred over those that do not; the more generally applicable a theory is, the greater its value. Thus Newton’s laws, with their wide general application, are to be preferred over the much more specific “the solar system has seven planets”.{{Dubious|date=February 2010|reason=I just rechecked the mentioned chapters 3-4 of 'Logic of Scientific Discovery', and they don't appear to say any of this, or its equivalent -- quotations, please, if that is disagreed -- see talk.}}

[[Thomas Kuhn]]’s influential book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' argued that scientists work in a series of [[paradigm]]s, and that falsificationist methodologies would make science impossible. {{quote|"No theory ever solves all the puzzles with which it is confronted at a given time; nor are the solutions already achieved often perfect. On the contrary, it is just the incompleteness and imperfection of the existing data-theory fit that, at any given time, define many of the puzzles that characterize normal science. If any and every failure to fit were ground for theory rejection, all theories ought to be rejected at all times. On the other hand, if only severe failure to fit justifies theory rejection, then the Popperians will require some criterion of 'improbability' or of 'degree of falsification.' In developing one they will almost certainly encounter the same network of difficulties that has haunted the advocates of the various probabilistic verification theories [that the evaluative theory cannot itself be legitimated without appeal to another evaluative theory, leading to regress]"---''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''. pp. 145-6.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Kuhn, Thomas | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions | year=1970 | publisher=University of Chicago Press | location=Chicago  | isbn= }}
</ref>|}}  Popper's student [[Imre Lakatos]] attempted to reconcile Kuhn’s work with [[falsificationism]] by arguing that science progresses by the falsification of ''research programs'' rather than the more specific [[universal quantification|universal statements]] of naïve falsificationism. Another of Popper’s students [[Paul Feyerabend]] ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology, and argued that the only universal method characterizing scientific progress was ''anything goes''.

Popper claimed to have recognized already in the 1934 version of his ''Logic of Discovery'' a fact later stressed by Kuhn, "that scientists necessarily develop their ideas within a definite theoretical framework", and to that extent to have anticipated Kuhn's central point about 'normal science'.<ref>'K R Popper (1970)', "Normal Science and its Dangers", pages 51-58 in [[#refcgk1970|I Lakatos & A Musgrave (eds.) (1970)]], at [http://books.google.com/books?id=Vutfm5n6LKYC&pg=PA51 page 51].</ref> (But Popper criticised what he saw as Kuhn's relativism.<ref>'K R Popper (1970)', in I Lakatos & A Musgrave (eds.) (1970), at [http://books.google.com/books?id=Vutfm5n6LKYC&pg=PA56 page 56].</ref>) Also, in his collection ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'' (Harper & Row, 1963), Popper writes, "Science must begin with myths, and with the criticism of myths; neither with the collection of observations, nor with the invention of experiments, but with the critical discussion of myths, and of magical techniques and practices. The scientific tradition is distinguished from the pre-scientific tradition in having two layers. Like the latter, it passes on its theories; but it also passes on a critical attitude towards them. The theories are passed on, not as dogmas, but rather with the challenge to discuss them and improve upon them."

Another objection is that it is not always possible to demonstrate falsehood definitively, especially if one is using [[statistical significance|statistical]] criteria to evaluate a [[null hypothesis]]. More generally it is not always clear, if evidence contradicts a hypothesis, that this is a sign of flaws in the hypothesis rather than of flaws in the evidence. However, this is a misunderstanding of what Popper's philosophy of science sets out to do. Rather than offering a set of instructions that merely need to be followed diligently to achieve science, Popper makes it clear in ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' that his belief is that the resolution of conflicts between hypotheses and observations can only be a matter of the collective judgment of scientists, in each individual case.<ref name="LdF">Popper, Karl, (1934) ''Logik der Forschung'', Springer. Vienna. Amplified English edition, Popper (1959), ISBN 0-415-27844-9</ref>

Popper's falsificationism can be questioned logically: it is not clear how Popper would deal with a statement like "for every metal, there is a temperature at which it will melt." The hypothesis cannot be falsified by any possible observation, for there will always be a higher temperature than tested at which the metal may in fact melt, yet it seems to be a valid scientific hypothesis. These examples were pointed out by [[Carl Gustav Hempel]]. Hempel came to acknowledge that Logical Positivism's verificationism was untenable, but argued that falsificationism was equally untenable on logical grounds alone. The simplest response to this is that, because Popper describes how theories attain, maintain and lose scientific status, individual consequences of currently accepted scientific theories are scientific in the sense of being part of tentative scientific knowledge, and both of Hempel's examples fall under this category. For instance, [[atomic theory]] implies that all metals melt at some temperature.

An early adversary of so-called critical rationalism, [[Karl-Otto Apel]] attempted a comprehensive refutation of Popper's philosophy. In ''Transformation der Philosophie'' (1973), Apel charged Popper with being guilty of, amongst other things, a pragmatic contradiction.<ref>See: "Apel, Karl-Otto," ''La philosophie de A a Z'', by Elizabeth Clement, Chantal Demonque, Laurence Hansen-Love, and Pierre Kahn, Paris, 1994, Hatier, 19-20. See Also: ''Towards a Transformation of Philosophy (Marquette Studies in Philosophy, No 20)'', by Karl-Otto Apel, trans., Glyn Adey and David Fisby, Milwaukee, 1998, Marquette University Press.</ref>

=== Other criticism ===
It has been argued that Popper's student [[Imre Lakatos]] transformed Popper's philosophy using historicism and updated Hegelian historiographic ideas.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hacking, Ian|title=Imre Lakatos' Philosophy of Science|journal=British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|issue=30|year=1979|pages=381–410|volume=30|doi=10.1093/bjps/30.4.381}}</ref><ref name=GuisesOfReason>John Kadvany. ''Imre Lakatos and the Guises of Reason.'' Durham: Duke University Press, 2001. ISBN 0-58223-2659-0</ref>

[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] was accused of brandishing a poker at Popper during a meeting of the [[Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club|Cambridge Moral Sciences Club]], when they argued about whether issues in philosophy were real or just linguistic puzzles. Wittgenstein's friends say he was merely handling a poker, but Popper used the situation to make a joke at Wittgenstein's expense.<ref>[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article6806419.ece "Professor Paul Krugman at war with Niall Ferguson over inflation"]</ref><ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/mar/31/artsandhumanities.highereducation When "Ludwig met Karl..."]

[[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] accuses Popper of exploiting his worldwide fame as an [[epistemologist]] to diminish the importance of philosophers of the 20th century [[continental philosophy|continental tradition]]. According to Taylor, Popper's criticisms are completely baseless, but they are received with an attention and respect that Popper's "intrinsic worth hardly merits".<ref>
Taylor, Charles, "Overcoming Epistemology", in ''Philosophical Arguments'', Harvard University Press, 1995, ISBN 0-674-66477-9</ref> William W. Bartley defended Popper against such allegations: "Sir Karl Popper is not really a participant in the contemporary professional philosophical dialogue; quite the contrary, he has ruined that dialogue. If he is on the right track, then the majority of professional philosophers the world over has wasted or is wasting their intellectual careers. The gulf between Popper's way of doing philosophy and that of the bulk of professional philosophers is as great as that between astronomy and astrology."<ref>[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=12846597 Philosophia. Philosophical Quarterly of Israel], William W. Bartley: The Philosophy of Karl Popper, Part I: Biology and Evolutionary Epistemology, ''Philosophia'' '''Vol 6''' (1976), pp. 463–494.<br />(deposit account required)</ref>

In 2004, [[philosopher]] and [[psychologist]] Michel ter Hark ([[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], The Netherlands) published a book, called ''Popper, Otto Selz and the rise of evolutionary epistemology'', ISBN 0-521-83074-5, in which he claimed that Popper took some of his ideas from his tutor, the German psychologist [[Otto Selz]]. Selz himself never published his ideas, partly because of the rise of [[Nazism]] which forced him to quit his work in 1933, and the prohibition of referring to Selz' work. Popper, the historian of ideas and his scholarship, is criticized in some academic quarters, for his rejection of Plato, Hegel and Marx.<ref>See: "Popper is committing a serious historical error in attributing the organic theory of the state to Plato and accusing him of all the fallacies of post-Hegelian and Marxist historicism--the theory that history is controlled by the inexorable laws governing the behavior of superindividual social entities of which human beings and their free choices are merely subordinate manifestations." ''Plato's Modern Enemies and the Theory of Natural Law'', by John Wild, Chicago, 1964, The University of Chicago Press, 23. See Also: "In spite of the high rating one must accord his initial intention of fairness, his hatred for the enemies of the 'open society,' his zeal to destroy whatever seems to him destructive of the welfare of mankind, has led him into the extensive use of what may be called terminological counterpropaganda ..." and "With a few exceptions in Popper's favor, however, it is noticeable that reviewers possessed of special competence in particular fields--and here Lindsay is again to be included--have objected to Popper's conclusions in those very fields ..." and "Social scientists and social philosophers have deplored his radical denial of historical causation, together with his espousal of Hayek's systematic distrust of larger programs of social reform; historical students of philosophy have protested his violent polemical handling of Plato, Aristotle, and particularly Hegel; ethicists have found contradictions in the ethical theory ('critical dualism') upon which his polemic is largely based." ''In Defense of Plato'', by Ronald B. Levinson, New York, 1970, Russell and Russell, 20.</ref>

According to Karl Popper, a theory is scientific only in so far as it is falsifiable, and should be given up as soon as it is falsified.<ref>Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge, 1963</ref> By applying Popper's account of scientific method, John Gray's ''Straw Dogs'' states that this would have killed the theories of Darwin and Einstein at birth. When they were first advanced, each of them was at odds with some available evidence; only later did evidence become available that gave them crucial support.<ref>John Gray, Straw Dogs, Granta Books, London, 2002</ref>
