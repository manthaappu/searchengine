In the [[formal semantics of programming languages]], two [[term (mathematics)|term]]s ''M'' and ''N'' are '''observationally equivalent''' if and only if, in all contexts ''C''[...] where ''C''[''M''] is a valid term, it is the case that ''C''[''N''] is also a valid term with the same value. Thus it is not possible, within the system, to distinguish between the two terms. This definition can be made precise only with respect to a particular calculus, one that comes with its own specific definitions of ''term'', ''context'', and the ''value of a term''.
