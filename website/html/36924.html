<html> <head> <title>Technical informatics</title></head><body>'''Technical Informatics (TI)''' is a subclass of [[computer engineering]] that combines general [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] with technology. Particularly in the field of [[electrical engineering]] it has numerous correlations with the engineering sciences. However, the perspective of TI is not marked by the technical disciplines alone but the focus is rather on giving special emphasis to typical aspects of informatics in order to find more general and universal solutions.<ref>[http://www.international-office.fh-koeln.de/english/faculties/overview/f10/courses/u/01602.php Technical Informatics (diploma) description]</ref>.

This discipline is usually taught at [[vocational university]]s up to a Master degree level<ref>[http://intoffice.fh-wedel.de/masterdegrees/masters-course-computer-science/focus-computer-engineering/modules-technical-informatics-master/ Modules Technical Informatics Master]</ref>.
