<html> <head> <title>XSIL</title></head><body>'''XSIL''' (Extensible Scientific Interchange Language) is an [[XML]]-based transport language for scientific data, supporting the inclusion of both in-file data and [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]]. The language comes with an extensible [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[Object (computer science)|object]] model. The language's elementary objects include Param (arbitrary association between a [[keyword (computer programming)|keyword]] and a value), Array, Table (a set of column headings followed by a set of records), and Stream, which enables one to either encapsulate [[data]] inside the XSIL [[Computer file|file]] or point to an external data source.

[[Binary Format Description language|BFD]] is an XML dialect based on XSIL.
