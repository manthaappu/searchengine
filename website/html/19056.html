<html> <head> <title>International Student/Young Pugwash</title></head><body>'''International Student/Young Pugwash''' ('''ISYP''') is an [[international organization]] that promotes awareness and action among students and young professionals in relation to [[ethics|ethical]] implications of science and technology [[science policy|policy]], particularly matters of [[international security]] and [[weapons of mass destruction]]. It developed from the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]].

==History==
Students have been invited as participants in Pugwash Conferences since the early 1970s. Following interest to create a forum specifically for students, student/young Pugwash groups started to form in the late 70s, [[Student Pugwash USA]] doing so in 1979. International collaboration among the groups began in 1988 in the [[Netherlands]] for the first jointly organized IS/YP conference. Student pre-conferences to the annual Pugwash Conferences began at the 1997 Pugwash Conference held in [[Norway]].

==Organization==
ISYP's members comprise national groups, which themselves may comprise loose or formal collections of [[school]] or [[university]] chapters. National entities include [[Student Pugwash USA]] (SPUSA), the largest, and Student Pugwash UK (SPUK) among others.
