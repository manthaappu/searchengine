==Examples==

Physical laws that are described by [[differential equations]] represent deterministic systems, even though the state of the system at a given point in time may be difficult to describe explicitly.

In [[quantum mechanics]], the [[Schrödinger equation]], which describes the continuous [[time evolution]] of a system's [[wave function]], is deterministic. However, the relationship between a system's wave function and the [[observable]] properties of the system appears to be non-deterministic.

The systems studied in [[chaos theory]] are deterministic. If the initial state were known exactly, then the future state of such a system could be predicted. However, in practice, knowledge about the future state is limited by the precision with which the initial state can be measured.

[[Markov chain]]s and other [[random walk]]s are not deterministic systems, because their development depends on random choices.

A [[finite state machine]] may be either [[Deterministic finite-state machine|deterministic]] or [[Nondeterministic finite-state machine|non-deterministic]].

A [[pseudorandom number generator]] is a deterministic algorithm, although its evolution is deliberately made hard to predict; a [[hardware random number generator]], however, may be non-deterministic.
