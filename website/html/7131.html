<html> <head> <title>Comparative case</title></head><body>The '''comparative case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''comp'''}}) is a [[Declension|grammatical case]] used in the [[Mari language]] to mark a likeness to something. It is marked with the suffix -ла ('-la')  For example, if something were to taste like fish (кол - 'kol'), the form used would be колла - 'kolla').

It is also used in regard to languages, when denoting the language a person is speaking, writing, or hearing. In this case, however, the accentuation varies slightly from the standard case - usually, the suffix is not stressed. When used with languages, however, it is stressed.

It is not to be confused with the [[comparison (grammar)|comparative degree]], a much more widely used paradigm used to signify heightening of [[adjectives]] and [[adverbs]].
