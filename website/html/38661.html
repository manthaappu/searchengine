In a [[quantum field theory]], one may calculate an effective
or [[running coupling constant]] that defines the
coupling of the theory measured at a given momentum scale.  
One example of such a coupling constant
is the [[electric charge]].  In 
approximate calculations in several
quantum field theories, notably [[quantum electrodynamics]]
and theories of the [[Higgs particle]], the running coupling 
appears to become infinite at a finite momentum scale.
This is
sometimes called the [[Landau pole]] problem.  It is not
known whether the appearance of these inconsistencies is
an artifact of the approximation, or a real fundamental 
problem in the theory.  However, the problem can be avoided
if an ultraviolet or '''UV fixed point''' appears in the theory.
A quantum field theory has a UV fixed point if its [[renormalization group flow]] approaches a [[fixed point]] in the ultraviolet (i.e. short length scale/large energy) limit.  This is related to zeroes of the [[beta-function]] in
the [[Callan-Symanzik equation]].

The large length scale/small energy limit counterpart is the [[infrared fixed point]].
 
==Specific cases and details==
Among other things, it means that a theory possessing a
UV fixed point may not be an [[effective field theory]], because it is well-defined at arbitrarily small distance scales. At the UV fixed point itself, the theory can behave as a [[conformal field theory]].

The converse statement, that any [[quantum field theory|QFT]] which is valid at all distance scales (i.e. isn't an effective field theory) has a UV fixed point is false. See, for example, [[cascading gauge theory]].

[[noncommutative quantum field theory|Noncommutative quantum field theories]] have a UV cutoff even though they are not effective field theories.

If the UV fixed point is [[trivial fixed point|trivial]] (aka Gaussian), we say that we have [[asymptotic freedom]].

If the UV fixed point is nontrivial, we say that we have "asymptotic safety". Theories with asymptotic safety may be well defined at all scales despite being [[nonrenormalizable]] in perturbative sense (according to the [[classical scaling dimension]]s).
