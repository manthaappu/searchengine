In this position, he launched the United States’ first course on international outsourcing <ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2004/03/11/news/companies/mit_outsourcing/index.htm "New MBA course: Outsourcing "], http://money.cnn.com/ article cites course ''URL retrieved on March 4, 2007.''</ref>
with the help of Professor [[Lester Thurow]], eminent economist and former Dean of the MIT Sloan School of Management.

Amar Gupta has developed patented technology and has made innovations in several areas including databases, imaging, healthcare, education, and outsourcing.

==Contributions and Innovations==
Amar Gupta has contributed to the following areas through mentoring of students, personal research, scientific discoveries resulting in patents<ref>[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&d=PALL&RefSrch=yes&Query=PN%2F5633954 "United States Patent"],''URL retrieved on March 4, 2007.''</ref>
, and contributing ideas that have influenced research in these disciplines.

===Imaging===
Gupta served as chief scientist and vice president for the development of [[VCN ExecuVision]], the first presentation graphics program. This program changed the manner that presentations were given, first in the academic community before making its way to the business community. The company, Visual Communications Network also pioneered the development of [[clip art]] for the IBM personal computer.

At [[MIT]], Gupta led a team of researchers to develop technology to automatically read handwritten information on checks and proposed a nationwide check clearance system, allowing the electronic clearance of printed, typed, and handwritten checks.<ref>[http://mitsloan.mit.edu/newsroom/2002-gupta.php "Gupta eyes paperless check clearance "], [[MIT Sloan School of Management|MIT Sloan]] Newsroom ''URL retrieved on March 4, 2007.''</ref> This innovation is manifested in the [[Check 21]] in the U.S. and in similar approaches in Singapore, and Brazil. Gupta and his colleagues also developed the first microcomputer-based image database management system.

===Education===
Amar Gupta, created the first course on outsourcing of professional services, with [[Lester Thurow]], and taught it at [[MIT]] in 2004.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/outsourcing/ "Course description"], [[MIT]] ''URL retrieved on March 6, 2007.''</ref> The aim of the course neither to praise the benefits nor discuss the horror stories of outsourcing. The course discussed both the reasons outsourcing in more common in the business place and bring in CEO’s and economic leaders to discuss their experiences with this movement<ref>[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/475952.cms "India the big topic in B-schools abroad"], [[The Economic Times]] ''URL retrieved on March 4, 2007.''</ref> This pioneer course has been replicated at several other leading universities in the U.S. and abroad. 

Gupta launched the first academic program that leads to two graduate degrees and a certificate in entrepreneurship.  This involves a management degree from the [[University of Arizona]]’s [[Eller College of Management]], and a second graduate degree in optics science, engineering, agriculture, or medicine.

===Outsourcing===
The concept of the [24-Hour Knowledge Factory] was developed by Amar Gupta. This concept allows for multiple professionals in different geographical locations to work together to perform a single task or project. Research is being conducted to utilize this model in a variety of industries. In 2007, Gupta was awarded an IBM faculty award for this vision. 

In early 1980, Amar Gupta proposed to Citibank to do software development work in India. This idea turned into Citibank overseas Software Limited, the pioneer example of a large multinational bank doing such work in India.
