{{lowercase|preload (software)}}
'''preload''' is a [[Free software|Free]] [[Linux]] program written by [[Behdad Esfahbod]] which runs as a [[daemon]] and records statistics about usage of programs using [[Markov chain]]s; files of more frequently-used programs are, during a computer's spare time, loaded into [[Primary storage|memory]].<ref name="thesis">[http://behdad.org/preload.pdf Preload â€” An Adaptive Prefetching Daemon], [[Behdad Esfahbod]], 2006.</ref> This results in faster [[software application|application]] startup times as less data needs to be fetched from disk. preload is often paired with [[prelink]].
