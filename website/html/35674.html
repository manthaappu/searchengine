<html> <head> <title>Stavros Fasoulas</title></head><body>'''Stavros Fasoulas''' is one of the most famous [[Finland|Finnish]] [[game programmer]]s in the late 1980s. He is mostly known as the designer and developer of the [[Commodore 64]] games ''[[Sanxion]]'', ''[[Delta (computer game)|Delta]]'' and ''[[Quedex]]''. The games were published by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[publisher]] [[Thalamus (publisher)|Thalamus]].

''Sanxion'' (1986) and ''Delta'' (1987) were pretty much standard-issue [[shoot 'em up]]s. ''Sanxion'' had a [[split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]] which allowed the action to be presented from two different viewpoints. The music in ''Sanxion'' and ''Delta'' has been composed by the famous [[video game music]] [[composer]] [[Rob Hubbard]]. ''Quedex'' (1987) was a game with an original idea, where the player steered a [[ball]] in a [[maze]]. Fasoulas's promising career as a game programmer was cut short when he was drafted into the [[Finnish Defence Forces]].

For the [[Amiga]] Fasoulas made a game called ''Galactic'', slightly resembling ''[[Bubble Bobble]]''. The Finnish [[computer magazine]] ''[[Pelit]]'' gave the game a fairly good review. Fasoulas never found a publisher for the game, and it was finally published as a slightly unfinished [[Christmas]] edition as a [[cover disk]] in the British computer magazine ''[[The One (magazine)|The One]]''.

In the 1990s Fasoulas and [[Ilari Kuittinen]] founded the company [[Terramarque]] which is currently known as [[Housemarque]] after its fusion with [[Bloodhouse]]. 

Fasoulas is currently living in [[San Francisco]] and has no ties with the computer industry. It is rumoured that he has only ever surfed the [[Internet]] once and does not even have an [[e-mail]] account.<ref>[http://www.c64.com/articles/thalamus_history.html Thalamus History]</ref>
