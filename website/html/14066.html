A '''fractal''' is "a rough or fragmented [[Shape|geometric shape]] that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole,"<ref>{{Cite book

Roots of mathematically rigorous treatment of fractals can be traced back to functions studied by  [[Karl Weierstrass]], [[Georg Cantor]] and [[Felix Hausdorff]] in studying functions that were [[Continuous function|continuous]] but not [[differentiable]]; however, the term ''[[wikt:fractal|fractal]]'' was coined by [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] in 1975 and was derived from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:fractus|fractus]]'' meaning "broken" or "fractured." A mathematical fractal is based on an [[equation]] that undergoes [[iteration]], a form of [[feedback]] based on [[recursion]].<ref name=patterns>{{Cite book |title=Fractals:The Patterns of Chaos |last=Briggs |first=John |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1992|publisher= London : Thames and Hudson, 1992.|location= |isbn=0500276935, 0500276935 |page=148 }}</ref>

* It has a fine structure at arbitrarily small scales.
* It is too irregular to be easily described in traditional [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean geometric]] language.
* It is [[self-similarity|self-similar]] (at least approximately or [[stochastic]]ally).
* It has a [[Hausdorff dimension]] which is greater than its [[Lebesgue covering dimension|topological dimension]] (although this requirement is not met by [[space-filling curve]]s such as the [[Hilbert curve]]).<ref>The Hilbert curve map is not a homeomorhpism, so it does not preserve topological dimension. The topological dimension and Hausdorff dimension of the image of the Hilbert map in '''R'''<sup>2</sup> are both 2. Note, however, that the topological dimension of the ''graph'' of the Hilbert map (a set in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>) is 1.</ref>
* It has a simple and [[recursive definition]].

Because they appear similar at all levels of magnification, fractals are often considered to be infinitely complex (in informal terms). Natural objects that are approximated by fractals to a degree include clouds, mountain ranges, lightning bolts, coastlines, snow flakes, various vegetables (cauliflower and broccoli), and animal coloration patterns. However, not all self-similar objects are fractals—for example, the [[real line]] (a straight [[Line (geometry)|Euclidean]] line) is formally self-similar but fails to have other fractal characteristics; for instance, it is regular enough to be described in Euclidean terms.

Images of fractals can be created using [[fractal-generating software]]. Images produced by such software are normally referred to as being fractals even if they do not have the above characteristics, such as when it is possible to zoom into a region of the fractal that does not exhibit any fractal properties. Also, these may include calculation or display [[Artifact (error)| artifacts]] which are not characteristics of true fractals.

==History==
<!--[[Image:animated construction of Sierpinski Triangle.gif|left|thumb|Animated construction of a [[Sierpiński Triangle]], only going nine generations of [[infinity|infinite]]—click for larger image.]] -->

[[Image:Von Koch curve.gif|right|thumbnail|250px|To create a [[Koch snowflake]], one begins with an equilateral triangle and then replaces the middle third of every line segment with a pair of line segments that form an equilateral "bump." One then performs the same replacement on every line segment of the resulting shape, ad infinitum. With every [[iteration]], the perimeter of this shape increases by one third of the previous length. After any finite number of iterations, the perimeter will be finite and the area will be finite. If the iterations are extended infinitely, the perimeter will have an infinite length, encompassing a finite area. For this reason, the Koch snowflake and similar constructions were sometimes called "monster curves."<!-- This is ''not'' merely a matter of "approaching infinity but never reaching it".  The actual length of the boundary of the union is infinite. [[User:Michael Hardy]] -->]]

The [[mathematics]] behind fractals began to take shape in the 17th century when mathematician and  philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] considered [[recursion|recursive]] self-similarity (although he made the mistake of thinking that only the straight line was self-similar in this sense).

It was not until 1872 that a function appeared whose [[Graph of a function|graph]] would today be considered fractal, when [[Karl Weierstrass]] gave an [[Weierstrass function|example]] of a function with the non-[[intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] property of being everywhere [[continuous function|continuous]] but [[nowhere differentiable]]. In 1904, [[Helge von Koch]], dissatisfied with Weierstrass's abstract and analytic definition, gave a more geometric definition of a similar function, which is now called the [[Koch curve]]. (The image at right is three Koch curves put together to form what is commonly called the [[Koch snowflake]].) [[Wacław Sierpiński]] constructed his [[Sierpinski triangle|triangle]] in 1915 and, one year later, his [[Sierpinski carpet|carpet]]. Originally these geometric fractals were described as curves, rather than the 2D shapes that they are known as in their modern constructions. The idea of self-similar curves was taken further by [[Paul Pierre Lévy]], who, in his 1938 paper ''Plane or Space Curves and Surfaces Consisting of Parts Similar to the Whole'' described a new fractal curve, the [[Lévy C curve]]. [[Georg Cantor]] also gave examples of [[subset]]s of the real line with unusual properties—these [[Cantor set]]s are also now recognized as fractals.

Iterated functions in the [[complex plane]] were investigated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Felix Klein]], [[Pierre Fatou]] and [[Gaston Julia]]. Without the aid of modern computer graphics, however, they lacked the means to visualize the beauty of many of the objects that they had discovered.

In the 1960s, [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] started investigating self-similarity in papers such as ''[[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension]]'', which built on earlier work by [[Lewis Fry Richardson]]. Finally, in 1975 Mandelbrot coined the word "fractal" to denote an object whose [[Hausdorff dimension|Hausdorff–Besicovitch dimension]] is greater than its [[topological dimension]]. He illustrated this mathematical definition with striking computer-constructed visualizations. These images captured the popular imagination; many of them were based on recursion, leading to the popular meaning of the term "fractal".

==Examples==
[[Image:Julia set (indigo).png|thumb|A [[Julia set]], a fractal related to the Mandelbrot set]]

A class of examples is given by the [[Cantor set]]s, [[Sierpinski triangle]] and [[Sierpinski carpet|carpet]], [[Menger sponge]], [[dragon curve]], [[space-filling curve]], and [[Koch snowflake|Koch curve]]. Additional examples of fractals include the [[Lyapunov fractal]] and the limit sets of [[Kleinian group]]s.  Fractals can be [[deterministic]] (all the above) or [[stochastic]] (that is, non-deterministic). For example, the trajectories of the [[Brownian motion]] in the plane have a Hausdorff dimension of 2.

[[Chaos theory|Chaotic dynamical systems]] are sometimes associated with fractals. Objects in the [[phase space]] of a [[dynamical system]] can be fractals (see [[attractor]]). Objects in the [[parameter space]] for a family of systems may be fractal as well. An interesting example is the [[Mandelbrot set]]. This set contains whole discs, so it has a Hausdorff dimension equal to its topological dimension of 2—but what is truly surprising is that the [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the Mandelbrot set also has a Hausdorff dimension of 2 (while the topological dimension of 1), a result proved by [[Mitsuhiro Shishikura]] in 1991. A closely related fractal is the [[Julia set]].

==Generating fractals==

Four common techniques for generating fractals are:

* '''Escape-time fractals''' – (also known as "orbits" fractals) These are defined by a [[formula]] or [[recurrence relation]] at each point in a space (such as the [[complex plane]]). Examples of this type are the [[Mandelbrot set]], [[Julia set]], the [[Burning Ship fractal]], the [[Nova fractal]] and the [[Lyapunov fractal]]. The 2d vector fields that are generated by one or two iterations of escape-time formulae also give rise to a fractal form when points (or pixel data) are passed through this field repeatedly.
* '''[[Iterated function system]]s''' – These have a fixed  geometric replacement rule. [[Cantor set]], [[Sierpinski carpet]], [[Sierpinski gasket]], [[Peano curve]], [[Koch snowflake]], [[dragon curve|Harter-Highway dragon curve]], [[T-Square (fractal)|T-Square]], [[Menger sponge]], are some examples of such fractals.
* '''Random fractals''' – Generated by stochastic rather than deterministic processes, for example, trajectories of the [[Brownian motion]], [[Lévy flight]], [[fractal landscapes]] and the [[Brownian tree]]. The latter yields so-called mass- or dendritic fractals, for example, [[diffusion-limited aggregation]] or [[reaction-limited aggregation]] clusters.
* '''Strange attractors''' – Generated by iteration of a map or the solution of a system of initial-value differential equations that exhibit chaos.

==Classification==
Fractals can also be classified according to their self-similarity. There are three types of self-similarity found in fractals:

* '''Exact self-similarity''' – This is the strongest type of self-similarity; the fractal appears identical at different scales. Fractals defined by [[iterated function]] systems often display exact self-similarity. For example, the [[Sierpinski triangle]] and [[Koch snowflake]] exhibit exact self-similarity.
* '''Quasi-self-similarity''' – This is a looser form of self-similarity; the fractal appears approximately (but not exactly) identical at different scales. Quasi-self-similar fractals contain small copies of the entire fractal in distorted and degenerate forms. Fractals defined by [[recurrence relation]]s are usually quasi-self-similar but not exactly self-similar. The [[Mandelbrot set]] is quasi-self-similar, as the satellites are approximations of the entire set, but not exact copies.
* '''Statistical self-similarity''' – This is the weakest type of self-similarity; the fractal has numerical or statistical measures which are preserved across scales. Most reasonable definitions of "fractal" trivially imply some form of statistical self-similarity. ([[Fractal dimension]] itself is a numerical measure which is preserved across scales.) Random fractals are examples of fractals which are statistically self-similar, but neither exactly nor quasi-self-similar. The coastline of Britain is another example; one cannot expect to find microscopic Britains (even distorted ones) by looking at a small section of the coast with a magnifying glass.

Possessing self-similarity is not the sole criterion for an object to be termed a fractal. Examples of self-similar objects that are not fractals include the logarithmic spiral and straight lines, which do contain copies of themselves at increasingly small scales. These do not qualify, since they have the same [[Hausdorff dimension]] as [[topological dimension]].

==In nature==

Approximate fractals are easily found in nature. These objects display self-similar structure over an extended, but finite, scale range. Examples include clouds, [[snow|snow flakes]], [[crystal]]s, [[mountain|mountain range]]s, [[lightning]], [[river|river networks]], [[cauliflower]] or [[broccoli]], and systems of [[blood vessel]]s and [[pulmonary vessels]].  [[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension|Coastlines]] may be loosely considered fractal in nature.

Trees and ferns are fractal in nature and can be modeled on a computer by using a recursive [[algorithm]]. This recursive nature is obvious in these examples—a branch from a tree or a [[frond]] from a fern is a miniature replica of the whole: not identical, but similar in nature. The connection between fractals and leaves is currently being used to determine how much carbon is contained in trees.<ref>"Hunting the Hidden Dimension." ''Nova''. PBS. WPMB-Maryland. 28 October 2008.</ref>

In 1999, certain self similar fractal shapes were shown to have a property of "frequency invariance"—the same electromagnetic properties no matter what the frequency—from [[Maxwell's equations]] (see [[fractal antenna]]).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hohlfeld R, Cohen N |title=Self-similarity and the geometric requirements for frequency independence in Antennae |journal=Fractals |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=79–84 |year=1999 |doi=10.1142/S0218348X99000098}}</ref>

==In creative works==
{{See|Fractal art}}
Fractal patterns have been found in the paintings of American artist [[Jackson Pollock]].  While Pollock's paintings appear to be composed of chaotic dripping and splattering, computer analysis has found fractal patterns in his work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/PHYSICS_!/FRACTAL_EXPRESSIONISM/fractal_taylor.html |title=Richard Taylor, Adam P. Micolich and David Jonas. '&#39;Fractal Expressionism : Can Science Be Used To Further Our Understanding Of Art?'&#39; |publisher=Phys.unsw.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2010-10-17}}</ref>

[[Decalcomania]], a technique used by artists such as [[Max Ernst]], can produce fractal-like patterns.<ref>[http://classes.yale.edu/Fractals/Panorama/ A Panorama of Fractals and Their Uses] by Michael Frame and Benoît B. Mandelbrot</ref> It involves pressing paint between two surfaces and pulling them apart.

Cyberneticist [[Ron Eglash]] has suggested that fractal-like structures are prevalent in [[African art]] and architecture. Circular houses appear in circles of circles, rectangular houses in rectangles of rectangles, and so on. Such scaling patterns can also be found in African textiles, sculpture, and even cornrow hairstyles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpi.edu/~eglash/eglash.dir/afractal/afractal.htm |title=Ron Eglash.

In a 1996 interview with [[Michael Silverblatt]], [[David Foster Wallace]] admitted that the structure of the first draft of ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' he gave to his editor Michael Pietsch  was inspired by fractals, specifically the [[Sierpinski triangle]] (aka Sierpinski gasket) but that the edited novel is "more like a lopsided Sierpinsky Gasket".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/bw/bw960411david_foster_wallace |title=David Foster Wallace - Bookworm on KCRW |publisher=Kcrw.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-17}}</ref>
