'''Windows Media Video''' ('''WMV''') is a video [[Data compression|compression]] [[format]] for several [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[codecs]] developed by [[Microsoft]]. The original video format, known as ''WMV'', was originally designed for Internet streaming applications, as a competitor to [[RealVideo]]. The other formats, such as ''WMV Screen'' and ''WMV Image'', cater for specialized content. Through standardization from the [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers]] (SMPTE),<ref name="mssmpte">[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/apr06/04-24VC1PR.mspx SMPTE VC-1 Receiving Industrywide Support]</ref><ref name="netanewssmpte">[http://www.betanews.com/article/Microsoft_VC1_Codec_Now_a_Standard/1144097224 Microsoft VC-1 Codec Now a Standard]</ref> WMV 9 has gained adoption for physical-delivery formats such as [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]].<ref name="bluray">[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2004/sep04/09-01BluRayDiscPR.mspx Blu-ray Disc BD-ROM Specification Adds Microsoft's VC-1 Advanced Video Codec]</ref><ref name="hddvd">[http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2007/jan07/01-08HDDVDMomentumPR.mspx Microsoft Technology Brings HD DVD to the Mainstream]</ref>

==History==

In 2003, Microsoft drafted a video codec specification based on its WMV 9 codec and submitted it to SMPTE for standardization. The standard was officially approved in March 2006 as SMPTE 421M, better known as [[VC-1]], thus making the WMV 9 format an open standard. Since then, VC-1 has become one of the three mandatory video formats for the [[BD-ROM]] specifications.<ref name="bluray" /><ref name="hddvd" />

==Container format==
{{Main|Advanced Systems Format}}
A ''WMV file'' is in most circumstances [[data encapsulation|encapsulated]] in the [[Advanced Systems Format]] (ASF) [[Container format (digital)|container format]].<ref name="asfwma">[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/284094 MSDN: The Difference Between ASF and WMV/WMA Files]</ref> The [[file extension]] <tt>.WMV</tt> typically describes ASF files that use Windows Media Video codecs. The audio codec used in conjunction with Windows Media Video is typically some version of [[Windows Media Audio]], or in rarer cases, the deprecated Sipro [[ACELP|ACELP.net]] audio codec. Microsoft recommends that ASF files containing non-Windows Media codecs use the generic <tt>.ASF</tt> file extension.

The ASF container can optionally support [[digital rights management]] using a combination of [[elliptic curve cryptography]] key exchange, [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] block cipher, a custom block cipher, [[RC4 cipher|RC4]] stream cipher and the [[SHA-1]] hashing function.

Although WMV is generally packed into the ASF container format, it can also be put into the [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]] or [[Matroska]] container format. The resulting files have the <tt>.AVI</tt> and <tt>.MKV</tt> file extensions, respectively. WMV can be stored in an AVI file when using the WMV 9 [[Video for Windows|Video Compression Manager (VCM)]] codec implementation.<ref>Microsoft Corporation (2003-07-07) [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0c99c648-5800-4aa3-a2fe-3de948689db8&DisplayLang=en Windows Media Video 9 VCM], Retrieved on 2009-08-07</ref><ref name="vcm">[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/forpros/codecs/video.aspx#WindowsMediaVideo9VCM Windows Media Video 9 Series Codecs: Windows Media Video 9 VCM]</ref> Another common way to store WMV in an AVI file is to use the [[VirtualDub]] encoder.

==Video compression formats==
===Windows Media Video===
[[Image:Common Video Resolutions 2.svg|thumb|Diagram illustrating the relative frame sizes of several common video resolutions targeted by Windows Media Video 9 Professional, starting with [[480p]].]]
Windows Media Video (WMV) is the most recognized [[video format]] within the WMV family. Usage of the term ''WMV'' often refers to the Microsoft Windows Media Video [[codec]] only. Its main competitors are [[MPEG-4 AVC]], [[Audio Video Standard|AVS]], [[RealVideo]], and [[MPEG-4 Part 2|MPEG-4 ASP]]. The first version of the codec, WMV 7, was introduced in 1999, and was built upon Microsoft's implementation of [[MPEG-4 Part 2]].<ref name="mpeg4wmv"> [http://digitalcontentproducer.com/mag/video_mpeg_makes_scene/ MPEG-4 makes the scene]</ref> Continued proprietary development led to newer versions of the codec, but the [[bit stream]] syntax was not frozen until WMV 9.<ref name="wmav9series">[http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/f/c/6fc03c60-5d5b-42c0-bcce-5e184fa56741/2_Audio_Video.ppt Windows Media Audio & Video 9 Series]</ref> While all versions of WMV support [[variable bit rate]], [[average bit rate]], and [[constant bit rate]], WMV 9 introduced several important features including native support for [[interlaced video]], non-square [[pixels]], and frame interpolation.<ref name="videoquality">[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/demos/video_quality_demos.aspx Microsoft Windows Media - Demos Video Quality]</ref> WMV 9 also introduced a new profile titled ''Windows Media Video 9 Professional'',<ref name="elimsrevguide">[http://www.elims.org/downloads/sample_content/9Series_RevGuide.pdf Windows Media 9 Series Beta Reviewer's Guide]</ref> which is activated automatically whenever the video resolution exceeds 300,000 pixels (e.g., 528x576, 640×480 or 768x432 and beyond) and the bitrate 1000 kbit/s{{Citation needed|reason=where did this info come from, and why such a wierd example rez originally? it's not anywhere in the linked document(s)|date=July 2009}}. It is targeted towards high-definition video content, at resolutions such as [[720p]] and [[1080p]]2.

The ''Simple'' and ''Main'' profile levels in WMV 9 are compliant with the same profile levels in the [[VC-1]] specification.<ref name="advancedprofile">[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/howto/articles/codecadvancedsettings.aspx Using the Advanced Settings of the Windows Media Video 9 Advanced Profile Codec]</ref> The ''Advanced Profile'' in VC-1 is implemented in a new WMV codec called ''Windows Media Video 9 Advanced Profile''. It improves compressions efficiency for interlaced content and is made transport-independent, making it able to be encapsulated in an [[MPEG transport stream]] or [[Real-time Transport Protocol|RTP]] packet format. The codec is not compatible with previous WMV 9 codecs, however.<ref name="streamingmedia">[http://www.streamingmedia.com/article.asp?id=9510&page=2&c=4 streamingmedia.com Best Practices for Windows Media Encoding]</ref>

WMV is a mandatory video codec for [[PlaysForSure]]-certified online stores and devices, as well as [[Portable Media Center]] devices. The [[Microsoft Zune]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Windows Mobile]]-powered devices with Windows Media Player, as well as many uncertified devices, support the codec.<ref name="winmobilefaq">[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/windowsmobile/faq.aspx Windows Media Player Mobile FAQ]</ref> [[WMV HD]] mandates the use of WMV 9 for its certification program, at quality levels specified by Microsoft.<ref name="wmvhd">[http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=41932 WMV HD DVD Encoding Profile Guidelines]</ref> WMV used to be the only supported video codec for the [[Microsoft Silverlight]] platform, but H.264 codec is now also supported starting with version 3.<ref name="silverlightfaq">[http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/faq.aspx Microsoft Silverlight Developer Server Audio Video Streaming FAQ]</ref>

===Windows Media Video Screen===
Windows Media Video Screen (WMV Screen) is a [[screencast]] codec. It can capture live screen content, or convert video from third-party screen-capture programs into WMV 9 Screen files. It works best when the source material is mainly static and contains a small [[color palette]].<ref name="screen">[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/forpros/codecs/video.aspx#WindowsMediaVideo9Screen Windows Media Video 9 Series Codecs: Windows Media Video 9 Screen]</ref> Depending on the complexity of the source material, the codec may switch between [[Lossy data compression|lossy]] and [[Lossless data compression|lossless]] encoding to enhance compression efficiency.<ref name="screen"/>

One of the uses for the codec is computer step-by-step demonstration videos. The first version of the codec was WMV 7 Screen, The second and current version, WMV 9 Screen, supports VBR encoding in addition to CBR.<ref name="screen" />

===Windows Media Video Image===
<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Photo Story 3 for Windows.jpg|thumb|Screenshot of Photo Story 3 for Windows, one of the programs that encode video using the Windows Media Video 9.1 Image codec.]] -->
Windows Media Video Image (WMV Image) is a video [[slideshow]] codec. The codec works by applying timing, [[panning (camera)|panning]] and transition effects to a series of images during playback.<ref name="image">[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/forpros/codecs/video.aspx#WindowsMediaVideo9ImageVersion2 Windows Media Video 9 Series Codecs: Windows Media Video 9 Image Version 2]</ref> The codec achieves a higher compression ratio and image quality than WMV 9 for still images as files encoded with WMV Image store static images rather than full-motion video.

Since the codec relies on the decoder (player) to generate video frames in real-time, playing WMV Image files even at moderate resolutions (e.g. 30 [[frames per second]] at 1024 × 768 resolution) requires heavy computer processing. The latest version of the codec, WMV 9.1 Image, used by [[Photo Story]] 3, features additional transformation effects, but is not compatible with the original WMV 9 Image codec.<ref name="image" />

Hardware support for WMV Image is available from Portable Media Centers, [[Windows Mobile]]-powered devices with Windows Media Player 10 Mobile.<ref name="winmobilefaq" />

Since no known domestic DVD player supports this format, users of Photo Story 3 wishing to generate material capable of being played in a DVD player will first have to convert to [[MPEG-2]] before burning a DVD (average file sizes in MPEG-2 are 5 to 6 times the .wmv file).

==Video quality==
Microsoft claims that WMV 9 provides a compression ratio that is two times better than MPEG-4, and three times better than <ref>ebu.ch/en/technical/trev/trev_301-samviq.pdf Subjective quality of internet video codecs - Phase 2 evaluations using SAMVIQ]</ref>  Many 3rd party WMV compilers have had worse performance than [[Windows Movie Maker]].

==Players==
Software that can play WMV files include [[Windows Media Player]], [[RealPlayer]], [[MPlayer]], [[The KMPlayer]], [[Media Player Classic]] and [[VLC Media Player]]. The Microsoft Zune media management software supports the WMV codec, but uses a Zune-specific variation of [[Windows Media DRM]] which is used by PlaysForSure. Many third-party players exist for various platforms such as [[Linux]] that use the [[FFmpeg]] implementation of the WMV codecs.

On the [[Macintosh]] platform, Microsoft released a [[PowerPC]] version of Windows Media Player for [[Mac OS X]] in 2003,<ref name="wmp9mac">[http://www.microsoft.com/mac/downloads.aspx?pid=download&location=/mac/download/misc/winmp_osx.xml&secid=80&ssid=8&flgnosysreq=True Windows Media Player 9 for Mac OS X ]</ref> but further development of the software has ceased. Microsoft currently endorses the 3rd party [[Flip4Mac]] WMV, a [[QuickTime]] Component which allows Macintosh users to play WMV files in any player that uses the QuickTime framework.<ref name="flip4mac">[http://www.microsoft.com/mac/otherproducts/otherproducts.aspx?pid=windowsmedia Important information for Windows Media Player for Mac users]</ref> The WMV installer is bundled with Microsoft Silverlight by default, installation without Silverlight can be accomplished with a "Custom" install. According to the Flip4Mac website, WMV files with DRM encryption are not compatible with the component.

==Decoders / Transcoders==

[[Linux]] users can rely on [[FFmpeg]] based software like [[MPlayer]], [[MEncoder]].

For [[Macintosh|Mac]] or [[Windows]] users who wish to convert non-DRM WMV to [[MP4]], [[HandBrake]] is [[Free Software]] that will do the job.

==Encoders==
Software that exports video in WMV format include [[Avid]] (PC Version),
[[Windows Movie Maker]], [[Windows Media Encoder]], [[Microsoft Expression Encoder]],
[[Sorenson Squeeze]],<ref name="premiere">[http://sorensonmedia.com Sorenson Media<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Sony Vegas Pro]],<ref name="vegas pro">[http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/products/product.asp?PID=457&PageID=107 Sony Creative Software - Vegas Pro 8 - Technical Specifications<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Adobe Premiere Pro]], [[Adobe After Effects]], [[Telestream Episode]], [[Total video converter]] and [[Telestream FlipFactory]].<ref name="premiere">[http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=332612 Supported file formats in Adobe Premiere Pro 2.0]</ref><ref name="Easy Ingest">[http://www.easymediasuite.com <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Programs that encode using the WMV Image codec include [[Windows Media Encoder]] and [[Photo Story]].

==Digital rights management==
{{Main|Windows Media DRM}}
While none of the WMV codecs themselves contain any [[digital rights management]] facilities, the ASF container format, in which a WMV stream may be encapsulated, can. Windows Media DRM, which can be used in conjunction with WMV, supports time-limited subscription video services such as those offered by [[CinemaNow]].<ref name="cinemanow">[http://www.playsforsure.com/ItemDetail.aspx?id=26 PlaysForSure: CinemaNow]</ref> Windows Media DRM, a component of PlaysForSure and [[Windows Media Connect]], is supported on many modern portable video devices and streaming media clients such as the Xbox 360.

==Criticism==
WMV has been the subject of numerous complaints from users and the press. Users dislike the digital rights management system which is sometimes attached to WMV files.<ref name="inquirerrights">[http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=34523 Microsoft Media Player shreds your rights]</ref> The loss of the ability to restore licenses for WMV files in the Windows Media Player 11 was not positively received.<ref name="inquirerrights" /> In addition, the Microsoft Zune does not support the standard Windows Media DRM system, rendering protected WMV files unplayable.<ref name="inquirerzune">[http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=34478 Zune won't play MS DRM infected files]</ref>
