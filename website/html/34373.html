<html> <head> <title>Signorini problem</title></head><body>The '''Signorini problem''' is an [[Linear_elasticity#Elastostatics|elastostatics]] problem in [[linear elasticity]]: it consists in finding the [[Linear elasticity#Elastostatics|elastic equilibrium]] [[Continuum mechanics#Mathematical modeling of a continuum|configuration]] of a [[Anisotropy#Material science and engineering|anisotropic]] [[Homogeneous media|non-homogeneous]] [[Physical body|elastic body]], resting on a [[Rigid body|rigid]] [[friction]]less [[surface]] and subject only to its [[Weight|mass force]]s. The name was coined by [[Gaetano Fichera]] to honour his teacher Signorini: the original name coined by him is '''problem with ambiguous [[Boundary value problem|boundary conditions]]'''.

== History ==
[[Image:Classical Signorini problem.svg|thumb|left|400px|The classical Signorini problem: what will be the [[Linear elasticity#Elastostatics|equilibrium]] [[Continuum mechanics#Mathematical modeling of a continuum|configuration]] of the orange spherically shaped [[Physical body|elastic body]] resting on the blue [[Rigid body|rigid]] [[friction]]less [[Plane (geometry)|plane]]?]]
The problem was posed by [[Antonio Signorini]] during a course of lessons taught at the [[Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica]] in 1959, later published as the paper {{Harv|Signorini|1959}}, expanding a previous short exposition he gave in a note published in 1933. As stated in {{Harv|Signorini|1959|p=128}}, he called it ''problem with ambiguous [[Boundary value problem|boundary conditions]]'' i.e. ''problema con ambigue condizioni al contorno'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], since there are two alternative sets of [[Boundary value problem|boundary conditions]] involving not only [[equality|equalities]] ''but also [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]]'' the solution ''must satisfy'' on any given [[Contact (mechanics)|contact point]], but ''it is not [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] known what of the two sets is satisfied for each point'': he posed the question if the problem was or not well posed in a physical sense, i.e. if its solution exist and is unique or not, inviting young [[mathematical analysis|analysts]] to study the problem<ref>As [[Antonio Signorini]] himself writes in {{Harv|Signorini|1959|p=129}}.</ref>. [[Gaetano Fichera]] and [[Mauro Picone]] attended the lessons and Fichera started to investigate the existence and uniqueness of the solutions: since there were no references to a similar problem in the theory of [[boundary value problem]]s<ref> See {{Harvnb|Fichera|1995|p=49}}.</ref>, he decided to deal with it by starting from the [[virtual work principle]]. While the problem was under investigation, Signorini began to suffer serious health problems: nevertheless, he desidered to know the answer to his question before his death. Picone, being tied by a strong friendship with Signorini, began to chase Fichera to find a solution, who, being himself tied to Signorini by similar feelings, perceived the last months of 1962 as worrying days<ref>This dramatic situation is well described by {{Harv|Fichera|1995|p=51}}</ref>. Finally, on the first days of January 1963, Fichera was able to give a complete proof of the existence and uniqueness of a solution for the problem with ambiguous boundary condition, which he called "Signorini problem" to honour his teacher. The preliminary note later published as {{Harv|Fichera|1963}} was written up and submitted to Signorini exactly a week before his death: He was very satisfied to see a positive answer to his question. A few days later, he told his [[Family doctor|family Doctor]] Damiano Aprile<ref>[[Gaetano Fichera]] reports the episode in reference {{Harv|Fichera|1995|p=53}}, following  the report of [[Mauro Picone]]: see the article about [[Antonio Signorini]] for further details.</ref>:-"Il mio discepolo Fichera mi ha dato una grande soddisfazione (My disciple Fichera gave me a great contentment)."-"Ma Lei ne ha avute tante, Professore, durante la Sua vita (But you had many, Professor, during your life)"- replied Doctor Aprile, but also Signorini replied:-"Ma questa è la più grande (But this is the greatest one)"-. And those were his last words. According to {{Harvtxt|Antman|1983|p=282}} the solution of the Signorini problem coincides with the birth of the field of [[Variational inequality|variational inequalities]].

== Formal statement of the problem ==
The content of this section and the following subsections follows closely the treatment of [[Gaetano Fichera]] in {{Harv|Fichera|1963}}, {{Harv|Fichera|1964b}} and also {{Harv|Fichera|1995}}: his derivation of the problem is different from [[Antonio Signorini|Signorini]]'s one in that he does not consider only [[incopressible body|incompressible bodies]] and a plane rest [[surface]], as Signorini does<ref> See {{Harvnb|Signorini|1959|p=127}}) for the original approach.</ref>. The problem consist in finding the [[displacement vector]] from the [[Continuum mechanics#Mathematical modeling of a continuum|natural configuration]] <math>\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x})=\left(u_1(\boldsymbol{x}),u_2(\boldsymbol{x}),u_3(\boldsymbol{x})\right)</math> of a [[Anisotropy#Material science and engineering|anisotropic]] [[Homogeneous media|non-homogeneous]] [[Physical body|elastic body]] that lies in a [[subset]] <math>A</math> of the three-[[dimension]]al [[euclidean space]] whose [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] is <math>\scriptstyle\partial A</math> and whose [[interior normal]] is the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] '''''<math>n</math>''''', resting on a [[Rigid body|rigid]] [[frictionless]] [[surface]] whose [[Contact (mechanics)|contact]] [[surface]] (or more generally contact [[set (mathematics)|set]]) is <math>\Sigma</math> and subject only to its [[body force]]s <math>\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{x})=\left(f_1(\boldsymbol{x}),f_2(\boldsymbol{x}),f_3(\boldsymbol{x})\right)</math>, and [[surface force]]s <math>\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{g}(\boldsymbol{x})=\left(g_1(\boldsymbol{x}),g_2(\boldsymbol{x}),g_3(\boldsymbol{x})\right)</math> applied on the free (i.e. not in contact with the rest surface) surface <math>\scriptstyle\partial A\setminus\Sigma </math>: the set <math>A</math> and the contact surface <math>\Sigma</math> characterize the natural configuration of the body and are known a priori. Therefore the body has to satisfy the general [[Stress (mechanics)#Equilibrium equations and symmetry of the stress tensor|equilibrium equations]]

:{{EquationRef|1|(1){{spaces|5}}}}<math>\qquad\frac{\partial\sigma_{ik}}{\partial x_k}- f_i= 0\qquad\text{for } i=1,2,3</math>

written using the [[Einstein notation]] as all in the following development, the ordinary [[Boundary value problem|boundary conditions]] on <math>\scriptstyle\partial A\setminus\Sigma</math>

:{{EquationRef|2|(2){{spaces|5}}}}<math>\qquad\sigma_{ik}n_k-g_i=0\qquad\text{for } i=1,2,3</math>

and the following two sets of [[Boundary value problem|boundary conditions]] on <math>\Sigma</math>, where '''<math>\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{\sigma} = \boldsymbol{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{u})</math>''' is the [[Cauchy stress tensor]]. Obviously, the body forces and surface forces cannot be given in arbitrary way but they must satisfy a condition in order for the body to reach an equilibrium configuration: this condition will be deduced and analized in the following development.

=== The ambiguous boundary conditions ===
If '''''<math>\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{\tau}=(\tau_1,\tau_2,\tau_3)</math>''''' is any [[tangent vector]] to the [[Contact (mechanics)|contact]] [[set (mathematics)|set]] <math>\Sigma</math>, then the ambiguous boundary condition in each [[Point (geometry)|point]] of this set are expressed by the following two systems of [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]]

:{{EquationRef|3|(3){{spaces|5}}}}<math>
\quad
\begin{cases}
u_i n_i & = 0 \\
\sigma_{ik} n_i n_k & \geq 0\\
\sigma_{ik} n_i \tau_k & = 0
\end{cases}
</math>{{spaces|5}}or{{spaces|5}}{{EquationRef|4|(4){{spaces|5}}}}<math>
\begin{cases}
u_i n_i & > 0 \\
\sigma_{ik} n_i n_k & = 0 \\
\sigma_{ik} n_i \tau_k & = 0
\end{cases}
</math>

Let's analyze their meaning: 
*Each [[set (mathematics)|set]] of conditions consists of three [[Binary relation|relations]], [[Equality (mathematics)|equalities]] or [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]], and all the second members are the [[Zero function#Other uses of zero in_mathematics|zero function]].
*The [[quantity|quantities]] at first member of each first relation are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] of the [[vector component|component]] of the [[displacement vector]] directed along the [[normal vector]] '''<math>n</math>'''.
*The quantities at first member of each second relation are proportional to the norm of the component of the [[Stress (mechanics)#Relationship stress_vector - stress_tensor|tension vector]] directed along the [[normal vector]] '''<math>n</math>''', 
*The quantities at the first member of each third relation are proportional to the norm of the component of the tension vector along any [[Euclidean vector|vector]] '''<math>\tau</math>''' [[Tangent vector|tangent]] in the given [[Point (geometry)|point]] to the [[Contact (mechanics)|contact]] [[set (mathematics)|set]] <math>\Sigma</math>.
*The quantities at the first member of each of the three relations are [[Positive number|positive]] if they have the same [[Euclidean vector|sense]] of the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] they are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to, while they are [[negative number|negative]] if not, therefore the [[Proportionality (mathematics)|constants of proportionality]] are respectively <math>\scriptstyle +1</math> and  <math>\scriptstyle -1</math>.
Knowing these facts, the set of conditions {{EquationNote|3|(3)}} applies to [[Point (geometry)|point]]s of the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the body which ''do not'' leave the [[Contact (mechanics)|contact]] set <math>\Sigma</math> in the [[Linear elasticity#Elastostatics|equilibrium configuration]], since, according to the first [[Binary relation|relation]], the [[displacement vector]] '''<math>u</math>''' ''has no [[vector component|component]]s'' directed as the [[normal vector]] '''<math>n</math>''', while, according to the second relation, the [[Stress (mechanics)#Relationship stress_vector - stress_tensor|tension vector]] ''may have a component'' directed as the normal vector '''<math>n</math>''' and having the same [[Euclidean vector|sense]]. In an analogous way, the set of conditions {{EquationNote|4|(4)}} applies to points of the boundary of the body which ''leave'' that set in the equilibrium configuration, since displacement vector '''<math>u</math>''' ''has a component'' directed as the normal vector '''<math>n</math>''', while the [[Stress (mechanics)#Relationship stress vector - stress tensor|tension vector]] ''has no components'' directed as the normal vector '''<math>n</math>'''. For both sets of conditions, the tension vector has no tangent component to the [[Contact (mechanics)|contact]] set, according to the [[hypothesis]] that the body rests on a rigid ''frictionless'' surface.

Each system expresses a '''unilateral constraint''', in the sense that they express the physical impossibility of the [[Physical body|elastic body]] to penetrate into the surface where it rests: the ambiguity is not only in the unknown values non-[[zero]] quantities must satisfy on the [[Contact (mechanics)|contact]] set but also in the fact that it is not a priori known if a point belonging to that set satisfies the system of boundary conditions {{EquationNote|3|(3)}} or {{EquationNote|4|(4)}}. The set of points where {{EquationNote|3|(3)}} is satisfied is called the '''area of support''' of the elastic body on <math>\Sigma</math>, while its [[Complement (set theory)#Relative complement|complement respect to <math>\Sigma</math>]] is called the '''area of separation'''. 

The above formulation is ''general'' since the [[stress tensor]] i.e. the [[constitutive equation]] of the [[Physical body|elastic body]] has not been made explicit: it is equally valid assuming the [[hypothesis]] of [[linear elasticity]] or the ones of [[Finite strain theory|nonlinear elasticity]]. However, as it would be clear from the following developments, the problem is inherently [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear]], therefore ''assuming a [[Linear elasticity#Mathematical formulation|linear stress tensor]] does not simplify the problem''.

=== The form of the stress tensor in the formulation of Signorini and Fichera ===
The form assumed by [[Antonio Signorini|Signorini]] and [[Gaetano Fichera|Fichera]] for the [[elastic potential energy]] is the following one (as in the previous developments, the [[Einstein notation]] is adopted)

:<math>W(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon})=a_{ikjh}(\boldsymbol{x})\varepsilon_{ik}\varepsilon_{ik}</math>

where 
*<math>\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{a}(\boldsymbol{x})=\left(a_{ikjh}(\boldsymbol{x})\right)</math> is the [[elasticity tensor]]
*<math>\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}=\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{u})=\left(\varepsilon_{ik}(\boldsymbol{u})\right)=\left(\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_k} + \frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_i} \right)\right)</math> is the [[Infinitesimal strain#Infinitesimal strain tensor|infinitesimal strain tensor]]
The [[Cauchy stress tensor]] has therefore the following form

:{{EquationRef|5|(5){{spaces|5}}}}<math>\sigma_{ik}= - \frac{\partial W}{\partial \varepsilon_{ik}} \qquad\text{for } i,k=1,2,3</math>

and it is ''[[Linear map|linear]]'' with respect to the components of the infinitesimal strain tensor; however, it is not [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] nor [[Isotropy|isotropic]].

== Solution of the problem ==
As for the section on the formal statement of the Signorini problem, the contents of this section and the included subsections follow closely the treatment of [[Gaetano Fichera]] in {{Harv|Fichera|1963}}, {{Harv|Fichera|1964b}}, {{Harv|Fichera|1972}} and also {{Harv|Fichera|1995}}: obviously, the exposition focuses on the basics steps of the proof of the existence and uniqueness for the solution of problem {{EquationNote|1|(1)}}, {{EquationNote|2|(2)}}, {{EquationNote|3|(3)}}, {{EquationNote|4|(4)}} and {{EquationNote|5|(5)}}, rather than the technical details. 

=== The potential energy ===
The first step of the analysis of Fichera as well as the first step of the analysis of [[Antonio Signorini]] in {{Harv|Signorini|1959|}} is the analysis of the '''potential energy''', i.e. the following [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]]

:{{EquationRef|6|(6){{spaces|6}}}}<math>I(\boldsymbol{u})=\int_A W(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{\varepsilon})\mathrm{d}x - \int_A u_i f_i\mathrm{d}x - \int_{\partial A\setminus\Sigma}\!\!\!\!\! u_i g_i \mathrm{d}\sigma</math>

where '''<math>u</math>''' belongs to the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of '''admissible displacements''' <math>\scriptstyle\mathcal{U}_\Sigma</math> i.e. the set of [[displacement vector]]s satisfying the system of [[boundary value problem|boundary conditions]] {{EquationNote|3|(3)}} or {{EquationNote|4|(4)}}. The meaning of each of the three terms is the following 
*the first one is the total [[elastic potential energy]] of the [[Physical body|elastic body]]
*the second one is the total [[potential energy]] due to the [[body force]]s, for example the [[gravitational force]]
*the third one is the potential energy due to [[surface force]]s, for example the [[Force (physics)|force]]s exerted by the [[atmospheric pressure]]
{{Harvtxt|Signorini|1959|pp=129–133}} was able to prove that the admissible displacement '''<math>u</math>''' which [[minimum|minimize]] the integral '''<math>I(u)</math>''' is a solution of the problem with ambiguous boundary conditions {{EquationNote|1|(1)}}, {{EquationNote|2|(2)}}, {{EquationNote|3|(3)}}, {{EquationNote|4|(4)}} and {{EquationNote|5|(5)}}, provided it is a [[smooth function|<math>C^1</math> function]] [[Distribution (mathematics)#Support of a distribution|supported]] on the [[Closure (topology)|closure]] <math>\scriptstyle \bar A</math> of the set <math>A</math>: however [[Gaetano Fichera]] gave a class of [[counterexample]]s in {{Harv|Fichera|1964b|pp=619–620}} showing that in general, admissible displacements are 
not [[smooth function]]s of these class. Therefore Fichera tries to minimize the [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]] {{EquationNote|6|(6)}} in a wider [[function space]]: in doing so, he first calculates the [[first variation]] (or [[functional derivative]]) of the given functional in the [[Neighbourhood (topology)|neighbourhood]] of the sought minimizing admissible displacement <math>\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{u} \in \mathcal{U}_\Sigma</math>, and then requires it to be greather or equal to [[zero]]

:<math>\left. \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} I( \boldsymbol{u} + t \boldsymbol{v}) \right\vert_{t=0} = -\int_A \sigma_{ik}(\boldsymbol{u})\varepsilon_{ik}(\boldsymbol{v})\mathrm{d}x - \int_A v_i f_i\mathrm{d}x - \int_{\partial A\setminus\Sigma}\!\!\!\!\! v_i g_i \mathrm{d}\sigma \geq 0 \qquad \forall \boldsymbol{v} \in \mathcal{U}_\Sigma</math>

Defining the following functionals 

:<math>B(\boldsymbol{u},\boldsymbol{v}) = -\int_A \sigma_{ik}(\boldsymbol{u})\varepsilon_{ik}(\boldsymbol{v})\mathrm{d}x \qquad \boldsymbol{u},\boldsymbol{v} \in \mathcal{U}_\Sigma</math>

and 

:<math>F(\boldsymbol{v}) = \int_A v_i f_i\mathrm{d}x + \int_{\partial A\setminus\Sigma}\!\!\!\!\! v_i g_i \mathrm{d}\sigma\qquad \boldsymbol{v} \in \mathcal{U}_\Sigma</math>

the preceding [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] is can be written as 

:{{EquationRef|7|(7){{spaces|6}}}}<math>B(\boldsymbol{u},\boldsymbol{v}) - F(\boldsymbol{v}) \geq 0 \qquad \forall \boldsymbol{v} \in \mathcal{U}_\Sigma </math>

This inequality is the '''[[variational inequality]] for the Signorini problem'''.
