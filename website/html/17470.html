'''IEEE-488''' is a short-range digital communications [[computer bus|bus]] specification. It was created for use with [[automated test equipment]] in the late 1960s, and is still in use for that purpose.  IEEE-488 was created as '''HP-IB''' ('''Hewlett-Packard Interface Bus'''), and is commonly called '''GPIB''' ('''General Purpose Interface Bus''').  It has been the subject of [[#Standards|several standards]].

== Characteristics ==

IEEE-488 is an [[8-bit]], electrically [[parallel communication|parallel]] bus.  The bus employs sixteen signal lines — eight used for bi-directional data transfer, three for handshake, and five for bus management — plus eight ground return lines.

Every device on the bus has a unique 5-bit primary [[Physical address|address]], in the range from 0 to 30 (31 total possible addresses).<ref name="NI-488.2">{{Cite book

The standard allows up to 15 devices to share a single physical bus of up to 20 meters total cable length.  The physical topology can be linear or star (forked).<ref>{{Cite web

Control and data transfer functions are logically separated; a controller can address one device as a “talker” and one or more devices as “listeners” without having to participate in the data transfer.  It is possible for multiple controllers to share the same bus; but only one can be the "Controller In Charge" at a time.<ref>{{Cite book

IEEE-488 specifies a 24-pin [[Amphenol]]-designed [[micro ribbon]] connector.  Micro ribbon connectors have a D-shaped metal shell, but are larger than [[D-subminiature]] connectors.  They are sometimes called "Centronics connectors" after the 36-pin [[micro ribbon]] connector [[Centronics]] used for their printers.

One unusual feature of IEEE-488 connectors is they commonly use a "double-headed" design, with male on one side, and female on the other (at both ends of the cable).  This allows stacking connectors for easy [[daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy-chaining]].  Mechanical considerations limit the number of stacked connectors to four or fewer, although a possible workaround involving physically supporting the connectors can expand this.

They are held in place by screws, either [[Unified Thread Standard|UTS]] (now largely obsolete) or [[ISO metric screw thread|metric]] M3.5×0.6 [[screw thread|thread]]s.  By convention, metric screws are colored black, as the two threads do not mate.

===IEC-60625===

The IEC-60625 standard prescribes the use of 25-pin [[D-subminiature]] connectors (the same as used for the [[parallel port]] on [[IBM PC compatible|IBM-PC]]s).  This connector did not gain significant market acceptance against the established 24-pin connector.

==Origins==

In the late 1960s, [[Hewlett-Packard|Hewlett-Packard (HP)]]<ref>This part of HP was later spun off as [[Agilent Technologies]].</ref> was manufacturing various automated test and measurement instruments, such as digital [[multimeter]]s and [[logic analyzer]]s.  They developed the ''HP Interface Bus (HP-IB)'' to enable easier interconnection between instruments and controllers (computers and other instruments).

The bus was relatively easy to implement using the technology at the time, using a simple parallel [[electrical bus]] and several individual control lines.  For example, the HP 59501 Power Supply Programmer and HP 59306A Relay Actuator were both relatively simple HP-IB peripherals implemented only in [[Transistor–transistor logic|TTL]] logic, using no microprocessor.

Other manufacturers copied HP-IB, calling their implementation the General Purpose Interface Bus (GPIB), and it became a [[de facto standard]] for automated and industrial instrument control.  As GPIB became popular, it was formalized by various [[standards organization]]s.

==Standards==

In 1975, the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] standardized the bus as ''Standard Digital Interface for Programmable Instrumentation'', '''IEEE-488''' (now IEEE-488.1).  It formalized the mechanical, electrical, and basic protocol parameters of GPIB, but said nothing about the format of commands or data.

In 1987, IEEE introduced ''Standard Codes, Formats, Protocols, and Common Commands'', '''IEEE-488.2''', re-designating the previous specification as '''IEEE-488.1'''.  IEEE-488.2 provided for basic syntax and format conventions, as well as device-independent commands, data structures, error protocols, and the like.  IEEE-488.2 built on -488.1 without superseding it; equipment can conform to -488.1 without following -488.2.

While IEEE-488.1 defined the hardware, and IEEE-488.2 defined the protocol, there was still no standard for instrument-specific commands.  Commands to control the same class of instrument (e.g., multimeters) would vary between manufacturers and even models.

The Air Force<ref>Project Mate in 1985</ref> and later Hewlett-Packard recognized this problem. In 1989, HP developed their TML language<ref>{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-02-06
}}</ref>  SCPI added standard generic commands, and a series of instrument classes with corresponding class-specific commands.  SCPI mandated the IEEE-488.2 syntax, but allowed other (non-IEEE-488.1) physical transports.

The [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] developed their own standards in parallel with the IEEE, with '''IEC-60625-1''' and '''IEC-60625-2''', later replaced by IEC-60488.

[[National Instruments]] introduced a backwards-compatible extension to IEEE-488.1, originally known as '''HS-488'''.  It increased the maximum data rate to 8 [[megabyte|Mbyte]]/s, although the rate decreases as more devices are connected to the bus.  This was incorporated into the standard in 2003 (IEEE-488.1-2003),<ref>{{Cite web

==Use as a computer interface==
{{Refimprove|section|date=February 2010}}

HP's designers did not specifically plan for IEEE-488 to be a peripheral interface for general-purpose computers; the focus was on instrumentation.  But when HP's early [[microcomputer]]s needed an interface for peripherals ([[disk drive]]s, [[tape drive]]s, [[computer printer|printers]], [[plotter]]s, etc.), HP-IB was readily available and easily adapted to the purpose.

HP computer products which used HP-IB included the [[HP series 80]], [[HP 9800 series desktop computers|HP 9800 series]],<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>  Some of HP's advanced pocket calculators of the 1980s, such as the [[HP-41]] and [[HP-71B]] series, also had IEEE-488 capabilities, via an optional [[HP-IL]]/HP-IB interface module.

Other manufacturers adopted GPIB for their computers as well, such as with the [[Tektronix 405x]] line.

The [[Commodore PET]] (introduced 1977) range of personal computers connected their peripherals using the IEEE-488 bus, but with a non-standard card edge connector.  Commodore's following 8-bit machines, including the [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]], [[Commodore 64|C-64]], and [[Commodore 128|C-128]], utilized an unrelated, proprietary serial interface, using a round [[DIN connector]], for which they retained the IEEE-488 programming interface and terminology, however.

Eventually, faster, more complete standards such as [[SCSI]] superseded IEEE-488 for peripheral access.
