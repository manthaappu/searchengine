The '''Mark 1, and later the Mark 1A, Fire Control Computer''' was a component of the [[Gun Fire Control Systems#MK 37 Gun Fire Control System (GFCS)|Mark 37 Gun Fire Control System]] deployed by the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]] and up to 1969. It was used on a variety of ships, ranging from [[destroyer]]s (one per ship) to [[battleship]]s (four per ship). The Mark 37 system used [[tachymetric]] target motion prediction to compute a fire control solution. Weighing more than 3000 pounds (1363 kilograms), the Mark 1 itself was installed in the plotting room, a water tight compartment that was located deep inside the ship's hull to provide as much protection against [[battle damage]] as was possible.

Essentially an [[electromechanical]] [[analog computer]], the Mark 1 was electrically linked to the [[gun turret]]s and the Mark 37 [[director (military)|gun director]], the latter mounted as high on the superstructure as possible to afford maximum visual and radar range. The gun director was equipped with both optical and radar range finding, and was able to rotate on a small [[barbette]]-like structure. Using the range finders, the director was able to produce a continuously varying set of outputs, referred to as line-of-sight (LOS) data, that were electrically relayed to the Mark 1 via [[synchro|synchro motors]]. The LOS data provided the target's present range, bearing, and in the case of aerial targets, altitude. Additional inputs to the Mark 1 were continuously generated from the [[stable vertical]], a [[gyroscopic]] device that reacted to the roll and pitch of the ship, the [[pitometer log]], which measured the ship's speed through the water, and an [[anemometer]], which provided wind speed and direction.

In "Plot" (the plotting room), a team of [[sailor]]s stood around the {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} Mark 1 and continuously monitored its operation. They would also be responsible for calculating and entering the average [[muzzle velocity]] of the [[projectile]]s to be fired before action started. This calculation was based on the type of [[propellant]] to be used and its temperature, the projectile type and weight, and the number of rounds fired through the guns to date.

Given these inputs, the Mark 1 automatically computed the lead angles to the future position of the target at the end of the projectile's time of flight, adding in corrections for gravity, relative wind, the [[magnus effect]] of the spinning projectile, and [[parallax]], the latter compensation necessary due to the fact that the guns themselves were widely displaced along the length of the ship. Lead angles and corrections were added to the LOS data to generate the line-of-fire (LOF) data. The LOF data, bearing and elevation, as well as the projectile's fuze time, was sent to the turrets by synchro motors, whose motion actuated hydraulic machinery to aim the guns.

Once the system was "locked" on the target, it produced a continuous fire control solution. While these fire control systems greatly improved the long-range accuracy of ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore gunfire, especially on [[heavy cruiser]]s and battleships, it was in the [[anti-aircraft warfare]] mode that the Mark 1 made the greatest contribution. However, the anti-aircraft value of analog computers such as the Mark 1 was greatly reduced with the introduction of [[jet aircraft]], where the [[relative motion]] of the target became such that the computer's mechanism could not react quickly enough to produce accurate results.

The design of the post war Mark 1A may have been influenced by the Bell Labs [[Mark 8, Fire Control Computer]] which was developed as an all electrical computer, incorporating technology from the M9 [[gun data computer]] as a safeguard to ensure adequate supplies of fire control computers for the USN during WW2. Surviving Mark 1 computers were upgraded to the Mark 1A standard after World war Two ended.

Digital fire control computers were not introduced until the age of minicomputers in the mid-1970s.
