<html> <head> <title>Social television</title></head><body>'''Social Television''' is a general term for technology that supports communication and social interaction in either the context of watching [[television]], or related to TV content. It also includes the study of television-related social behavior, devices and networks. Social television systems can for example integrate voice communication, text chat, presence and context awareness, TV recommendations, ratings, or video-conferencing with the TV content either directly on the screen or by using ancillary devices. Social television is very active area of research and development that is also generating new services as TV operators and content producers are looking for new sources of revenue. While a number of existing social television systems are still at a conceptual stage, or exist as lab prototypes, beta or pilot versions recent systems like Tunerfish or Boxee are available commercially. Tunerfish and FanTalkTV are examples of direct-to-consumer offerings, while white-labeled social TV platforms have also emerged (such as LiveHive Systems) which allow TV networks and operators to offer branded social TV applications.  Social TV was named one of the 10 most important emerging technologies by the MIT [[Technology Review]] [http://www.technologyreview.com/communications/25084/?a=f] in 2010.


== Description ==

The concept of socializing around TV content is not new. But Social TV is creating the cyber-living-room and cyber-bar to enable increased interactivity around shared programming both live and time-shifted. In an attempt to recapture the social aspects of television lost since the advent of multiple-screen households, which discourage gatherings to watch television together, social television aims to connect viewers with their friends and families even when they are not watching the same screen. As a concept, social television is not linked to a specific architecture such as [[cable television|cable]], [[IPTV]], [[peer-to-peer]] delivery, or [[internet television]] (over the top or OTT). Nor is it necessarily limited to a traditional television screen, but could also be presented on a [[computer]] or handheld device such as a [[cell phone]] or [[netbook]].

Social TV started in the early 2000s with limited success as the creation of the shared connections was cumbersome with a remote control and the User Interface (UI) design made the interaction disruptive to the TV experience. But [[social network service|social networking]] has made Social TV suddenly feasible, since it already encourages constant connection between members of the network and the creation of likely minded groups. The shared content and activities often relate to TV content.

The market for Social TV is growing fast and multiple startups have recently appeared in the field. According to a Parks Associates Industry Report [http://www.parksassociates.com/research/reports/tocs/2009/socialmedia.htm], over one-fourth of users ages 18-24 are interested in having more social features integrated into their TV-experience. The most desired social experience was in multiplayer games, though a close second was
to chat with others who were watching the same program. [[Generation Y]], those currently 18-28 years old, have been found [http://www.marketingcharts.com/television/forrester-technographics-benchmark-survey-gen-y-a-generation-apart-5344/] to actually access the internet more often than they watch television. The same research shows that 42% of the members of this generation access an Internet video at least monthly. And the industry is taking note: popular video sites are now more and more allowing viewers to interact.

The main research areas include the creation of a simple user experience across multiple platforms that encompasses aspects of development platforms, devices and networks. Also necessary are easy ways to filter casual acquaintances their social network from "real" friends or affinity circle members, with whom an individual would actually want to share thoughts or comments in a more private environment. Also because of the multiplicity of platforms recent work has also addressed the networking fundamentals behind Social TV. The [[MIT Media Lab|MIT Media Laboratory]] has held a graduate class on Social TV since 2009. Other research organizations active in Social TV include [[British Telecom]], [[Motorola]] Research and [[Microsoft]] Research.
