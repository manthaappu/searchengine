<html> <head> <title>JHDL</title></head><body>'''JHDL''' (Just-Another Hardware Description Language) is a low-level structural [[hardware description language]], focused primarily on building circuits via an [[Object-oriented programming|Object Oriented]] approach that bundles collections of gates into Java objects. Implemented as a toolset and class library on top of the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]], its primary use is for the design of digital circuits for implementation in [[FPGA|field-programmable gate arrays]] (FPGAs). Particular attention was paid to supporting the [[Xilinx]] series of chips. 

When the design is ready to be placed in a fabric, the developer simply generates an [[EDIF|Electronic Design Interchange Format]] (EDIF) [[netlist]] and imports it into his favorite toolkit. Once imported, the developer should be able to transfer the circuit via a [[JTAG|Joint Test Action Group]] (JTAG) cable. EDIF netlisting is supported for the XC4000, Virtex, and Virtex-II series of [[FPGA]]s. 

JHDL was developed at [[Brigham Young University|BYU]] in the [[Configurable Computing Laboratory]], the project initiated in 1997.<ref>Brent E.

== Features ==

The JHDL language features include:

* Structural hardware design 
* Flexible module generators 
* Table-generated finite state machines
* A graphical "Workbench" toolkit

Behavioral synthesis is not yet fully supported.

The integrated JHDL Workbench environment is designed to allow developers to graphically test and trace their circuit designs. This tool includes:

* A graphical schematic viewer
* A multiclock cycle-based simulator
* A command line interface
* A complete list of all wires and gates
* A complete status of all values passing through the circuit

== Naming ==

Originally, the '''J''' in "JHDL" stood for "Java". However, to prevent trademark issues, the name has been [[backronym]]ed to stand for '''J'''ust-Another '''H'''ardware '''D'''escription '''L'''anguage.
