A '''feral cat''' is a descendant of a domesticated [[cat]] that has returned to the wild. It is distinguished from a stray cat, which is a pet cat that has been lost or abandoned, while feral cats are born in the wild; however, the offspring of a stray cat can be considered feral if born in the wild.<ref name="Wild">{{cite web|url=http://www.banderasnews.com/0706/nb-saveacat.htm|title=Wild Things? An Introduction To Feral Cats|author=Holton, Louise|date=June 2007|publisher=Bandaras News|accessdate=21 November 2010}}</ref>

In many parts of the world, feral cats are descendants of domestic cats that were left behind by travelers.  Because cats are not native to all parts of the world, feral cats can cause harm to local environments by [[predation|preying]] on local species. This is especially true on [[island]]s where feral cats have sometimes had a substantial and deleterious effect on the local fauna.

== Behavior of "feral" cats ==
=== Feral versus stray ===
[[File:Feral cat.jpg|thumb|left|A feral cat showing typical aggressive behavior]]

The term ''feral'' is sometimes used to refer to an animal that does not appear friendly when approached by humans, but the term can apply to any domesticated animal without human contact.<ref name="Wild"/> Hissing and growling are self-defense behaviors, which, over time, may change as the animal (whether "feral" or "stray") begins to trust humans that provide food, water, and care.<ref name="taming">{{cite web | url=http://www.feralcat.com/taming.html | title = Taming Feral Kittens | author = Feral Cat Coalition / Ray Savage |date=November 2009}}</ref><ref>http://cats.about.com/od/behaviortraining/qt/catbehavior101.htm</ref>

Feral cats that are born and living outdoors, without any human contact or care, have been shown to be adoptable and can be tamed by humans.<ref name="taming"/><ref>http://www.petplace.com/cats/how-to-turn-a-stray-cat-into-a-pet/page1.aspx</ref>

=== Life span and survival ===
Because of the dependency on human influence, domestic animals (such as cats and dogs) cannot properly fend for themselves for any significant length of time.<ref name="feralcat.com">http://www.feralcat.com/</ref>  Thus, the [[Life expectancy|average life span]] of a feral cat that survives beyond [[kitten]]hood is about two years for independent cats and five years for cats in a cat colony. In contrast, a cat that lives indoors under proper human care has a life expectancy of 15–22 years.<ref>http://www.petplace.com/cats/life-expectancy-in-cats/page1.aspx</ref> Almost all cats that are left to survive outdoors will succumb to starvation, thirst, disease, parasites or predation.<ref>http://www.havahart.com/advice/critter-library/feral-cat-control</ref>

Another threat to the life of a feral cat is weather. Cats are sensitive to conditions of cold and heat.<ref name="vetinfo.com">{{cite web | url=http://www.vetinfo.com/heat-stroke-in-cats.html | title = Heat Stroke in Cats | author = VetInfo}}</ref> A cat’s normal body temperature is between 100.5 and 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit (38.2 and 39.2 Celsius). Cats do not sweat as humans do, and they regulate their body temperature through panting and licking their fur in hot weather.<ref name="vetinfo.com"/> Numerous cats living outdoors, whether feral or tame, die each year due to [[hyperthermia]] or [[hypothermia]].

==History==
During the [[Age of Discovery]], ships released rabbits onto islands to provide a future food source for other travelers. They eventually multiplied out of control and cats were introduced to keep their numbers, and that of mice and rats, down. The cats tended to favor local species as they were ecologically naive and easier to hunt. Their numbers too increased dramatically and soon they colonised many areas and were seen as pests too.

Historical records date the arrival of feral cats in Australia at around 1824.<ref name="Abbot">Abbot, I. (2002) "Origin and spread of the cat, Felis catus, on mainland Australia, with a discussion of the magnitude of its early impact on native fauna" ''Wildlife Research'' '''29'''(1): 51-74 [http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/WR01011.htm abstract]</ref> Despite that, it has been suggested that feral cats have been present in [[Australia]] since before [[European ethnic groups|European]] settlement, and may have arrived with [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[shipwreck]]s in the 17th century, or even before that, arriving from present-day [[Indonesia]] with [[Macassan contact with Australia|Macassan]] fisherman and [[trepanging|trepang]]ers who frequented Australia's shores.<ref name=dc>Dickman, C. (1996) [http://www.deh.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/cat-impacts/pubs/impacts-feral-cats.pdf "Overview of the Impact of Feral Cats on Australian Fauna"] Australian Nature Conservation Agency ISBN 0-642-21379-8</ref>
<!-- Not currently relevant since no argument for early predation is presented
Evidence for early predation by cats having caused major and widespread declines in native fauna is circumstantial and anecdotal and its credibility and significance is debated (Abbot 2002, Dickman 1996)
-->

==Diet and predators ==
Feral cats in Australia [[prey]] on a variety of wildlife. In arid and semi-arid environments, they eat mostly [[introduced species|introduced]] [[European Rabbit|European rabbit]]s and [[House Mouse|house mice]]; in forests and urbanised areas, they eat mostly native [[marsupial]] prey (based on 22 studies summarised in Dickman 1996). In arid environments where rabbits do not occur, native rodents are taken. [[Birds]] and [[reptiles]] form a smaller part of the diet.

Feral cats may be [[apex predator]]s in some local ecosystems. In others, they may be preyed on by [[Dog|feral dogs]], [[coyote]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], [[bear]]s, [[cougar]]s, [[bobcat]]s, [[lynx]], [[Fisher (animal)|fisher]]s, [[crocodilian]]s, [[snake]]s, and [[birds of prey]].

==Effects on wildlife==
[[File:Domestic cat eating bird on lawn-8.jpg|thumb|Feral cats can be effective hunters of small animals]]
The impact of domestic cats on wildlife is a century old debate. In a 1916 report for the Massachusetts State Board of Agriculture titled ''The Domestic Cat: Bird Killer, Mouser and Destroyer of Wildlife'', noted [[ornithologist]] [[Edward Howe Forbush]] stated in the preface:
<blockquote>
Questions regarding the value or inutility of the domestic cat, and problems connected with limiting its more or less unwelcome outdoor activities, are causing much dissension. The discussion has reached an acute stage. Medical men, game protectors and bird lovers call on legislators to enact restrictive laws. Then ardent cat lovers rouse themselves for combat. In the excitement of partisanship many loose and ill-considered statements are made.<ref>Forbush, Edward Howe (1916). [http://www.archive.org/details/domesticcatbirdk00forbrich The Domestic Cat: Bird Killer, Mouser and Destroyer of Wildlife.]</ref>
</blockquote>

The report referred to [[Extinct Birds (Rothschild book)|''Extinct Birds'']], published in 1905 by zoologist [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Walter Rothschild]], who stated, "man and his satellites, cats, rats, dogs, and pigs are the worst and in fact the only important agents of
destruction of the native avifaunas wherever they go."<ref>Rothschild, Walter (1905). [http://www.archive.org/details/extinctbirdsatte00roth Extinct Birds].</ref> Rothschild gave several examples of cats causing the extermination of some bird species on islands.

Feral cats are seen as vermin to many farmers and gamekeepers. The feral cats will catch and eat the ground nesting birds eg: pheasants and partrige. Gamekeepers often set traps and shoot the feral cats as part of pest control on their estate as a way of protecting their birds{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}.

===Australia===
Numerous Australian environmentalists claim the feral cat has been an ecological disaster in Australia, inhabiting most ecosystems except dense [[rainforest]], and being implicated in the [[extinction]] of several [[marsupial]] and [[placental]] mammal [[species]].<ref name=re>Robley, A., Reddiex, B., Arthur T., Pech R., and Forsyth, D., (2004). "Interactions between feral cats, foxes, native carnivores, and rabbits in Australia". [[Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research]], Department of Sustainability and Environment, Melbourne.</ref> But scientific evidence supporting this view has been hard to come by, and some researchers disagree with it (Abbot 2002). There is little sound evidence that feral cats significantly affect native wildlife throughout the mainland (Jones 1989; Wilson et al. 1992).<ref name=dc/> Difficulties in separating the effects of cats from that of [[fox]]es (also introduced) and environmental effects have hindered research into this. Cats have co-existed with all mammal species in Tasmania for nearly 200 years.<ref name="Abbot" /> The Western Shield program in Western Australia, involving broad-scale poisoning of foxes, has resulted in rapid recoveries of many species of native mammals in spite of the presence of feral cats throughout the baited area.<ref name="Abbot" /> In 2005, however, a study was published which for the first time found proof of feral cats causing declines in native mammals.<ref>Risbey, Danielle A. ; Calver, Michael C. ; Short, Jeff ; Bradley J. Stuart and Ian W. Wright (2005). [http://publish.csiro.au/nid/144/paper/WR98092.htm The impact of cats and foxes on the small vertebrate fauna of Heirisson Prong, Western Australia. II. A field experiment]  ''Wildlife Research'' '''27'''(3): 223-235</ref> An [[experiment]] conducted in Heirisson Prong (Western Australia) compared small mammal populations in areas cleared of both foxes and cats, of foxes only, and a control plot. Researchers found mammal populations were lower in areas cleared of foxes only and in the control plots.

Cats may also play a further role in Australia's human altered ecosystems; with foxes they may be controlling introduced [[rabbit]]s, particularly in arid areas, which themselves cause ecological damage.<ref name=re/> Cats are not believed to have been a factor in the extinction of the only mainland [[bird]] species to be lost since European settlement, the [[paradise parrot]].

Australian folklore holds that some feral cats in Australia have grown so large as to cause inexperienced observers to claim sightings of other species such as [[Cougar|puma]] etc. This folklore is being shown to be more fact than fiction, with the recent shooting of an enormous feline,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wherelightmeetsdark.com/index.php?module=wiki&page=EngelGippslandBigCat |title=Engel Gippsland big cat |accessdate= 2008-05-02}}</ref> in the [[Gippsland]] area of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Subsequent [[DNA test]] showed the feline to be ''[[Felis silvestris catus]]''.<ref>[http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2007/03/australias_new_feral_mega_cats.php#more "Feral Mega Cats"]</ref> Subsequent news of large feral cat sightings appear almost monthly in Australia, and the evidence is very good to suggest a breeding population of these enormous felines in the south-eastern states Victoria and [[New South Wales]].<ref>[http://www.strangenation.com.au/Articles/paulclacher.htm The Big Cat Files]</ref>

===New Zealand===
The fauna of [[New Zealand]] has evolved in isolation for millions of years without the presence of mammals (apart from a few bat species). Consequently, birds dominated the niches occupied by mammals and many became flightless. The introduction of mammals after settlement by [[Māori]] from about the 12th century had a huge effect on the indigenous [[biodiversity]]. [[Europe]]an explorers and settlers brought cats on their ships and the presence of feral cats were recorded from the latter decades of the 19th century.<ref>King, Carolyn; (1984) Immigrant Killers. Auckland: Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-558121-0</ref>
It is estimated that feral cats have been responsible for the extinction of six endemic bird species and over 70 localised
subspecies as well as depleting bird and lizard species.<ref>{{Cite conference | coauthors = Charles T. Eason, David R. Morgan, B.

===Islands===
====Consequences of introduction====
[[File:Xenicus lyalli.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Stephens Island Wren]] became extinct within two years of the introduction of cats to [[Stephens Island, New Zealand|Stephens Island]]]]

Many islands host [[island tameness|ecologically naive]] animal species; that is, animals that do not have predator responses for dealing with predators such as cats.<ref name="Moors">Moors, P.J.; Atkinson, I.A.E. (1984). "Predation on seabirds by introduced animals, and factors affecting its severity.". In ''Status and Conservation of the World's Seabirds''. Cambridge: ICBP. ISBN 0-946888-03-5.</ref> Feral cats [[introduced species|introduced]] to such islands have had a devastating impact on these islands' [[biodiversity]]. They have been implicated in the extinction of several species and local extinctions, such as the [[hutia]]s from the [[Caribbean]], the [[Guadalupe Storm-petrel|Guadalupe storm-petrel]] from [[Pacific]] [[Mexico]], the [[Stephens Island Wren|Stephens Island wren]]; in a statistical study, they were a significant cause for the extinction of 40% of the species studied.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/magazine/02cats-v--birds-t.html?em&ex=1196830800&en=4328122ab745ee4d&ei=5087%0A | work=The New York Times | title=Kill the Cat That Kills the Bird? | first=Bruce | last=Barcott | date=2007-12-02}}</ref> Moors and Atkinson wrote, in 1984, "No other alien predator has had such a universally damaging effect."<ref name="Moors"/>

Feral cats, along with rabbits, some sea birds, and [[sheep]], form the entire large animal population of the remote [[Kerguelen Islands]] in the southern [[Indian Ocean]].

====Restoration====
Because of the damage cats cause in islands and some ecosystems, many conservationists working in the field of [[island restoration]] have worked to remove feral cats. (Island restoration involves the removal of introduced species and reintroducing native species). As of 2004, 48 islands have had their feral cat populations removed, including [[New Zealand]]'s network of offshore island bird reserves,<ref>Nogales, Manuel ''et al.'' (2004). http://www.issg.org/database/species/reference_files/felcat/Nogales et al. 2004.pdf "A review of feral cat eradication on islands". ''Conservation Biology''. '''18''' (2): 310-319.</ref> and Australia's [[Macquarie Island]]. Larger projects have also been undertaken, including their complete removal from [[Ascension Island]]. The cats, introduced in the 19th century, caused a collapse in populations of nesting [[seabird]]s. The project to remove them from the island began in 2002, and the island was cleared of cats by 2004. Since then, seven species of seabird that had not nested on the island for 100 years have returned.<ref>http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2005/07/ascension.html Stamps celebrate seabird return. Birdlife.org. July 27, 2005.</ref>

In some cases, the removal of cats had unintended consequences. An example is [[Macquarie Island]] (off the coast of [[Tasmania]]), where the removal of cats caused an explosion in the number of rabbits, rats, and mice that harm native seabirds.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/environment/up-against-rats-rabbits-and-costs/2007/04/11/1175971183257.html?page=fullpage | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Up against rats, rabbits and costs | date=2007-04-12}}</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200607/s1687413.htm ABC News online - Fears for sub-antarctic island plagued by rabbits]</ref><ref>[http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=718505 Nine News - Cat kill devastates Macquarie Island]</ref> The removal of the rats and rabbits was scheduled for 2007 and it could take up to seven years and cost $24 million.<ref>[http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/macquarie/rabbitsfaq.html Parks and Wildlife Service, Tasmania - Plan for the Eradication of Rabbits and Rodents on Macquarie Island]</ref>

===Hybridisation with wild felids===
Feral cats have interbred with [[wildcat]]s to various extents throughout the world, the first reported case occurring more than 200 years ago. The significance of hybridisation is disputed and hinges on whether the domestic cat is classified as [[conspecific]] with the wildcat or a [[Cat#Etymology_and_taxonomic_history|separate species]].<ref name="IUCN"/>(see [[Genetic pollution]]) In some locations, high levels of hybridisation has led to difficulties in distinguishing a "true" wildcat from feral domestic and domestic hybrid cats, which can complicate conservation efforts.<ref>[http://www.arkive.org/european-wildcat/felis-silvestris-grampia/info.html European wildcat (Felis silvestris grampia)] Arkive.org</ref> Some researchers argue that "pure" wildcats do not exist anymore, but this is disputed by others.<ref name="IUCN">[http://www.catsg.org/catsgportal/cat-website/catfolk/wilder07.htm European wildcat species account] IUCN Species Survival Commission. Cat Specialist Group</ref> One study in Scotland suggests that while "true" Scottish wildcats are unlikely to exist, the current wildcat population is distinct enough from domestic cats to be worth protecting.<ref>[http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu/publications/wildcats.pdf Genetic diversity and introgression in the Scottish wildcat]. ''Molecular Ecology'' (2001) '''10''': 319–336.</ref>

==Zoonotic risk==
There is concern about the role of feral cat colonies, [[Dog|wild dogs]], and other native mammals, as a vector of diseases, particularly [[toxoplasmosis]], [[giardiasis]] (esp. from beavers), [[rabies]] (e.g. raccoons), ''[[Campylobacter]]'', [[Parvovirus]] and other diseases and parasites that can infect both humans and animals. Felids such as cougars and cats, the mammals they feed on, and undercooked meat and chicken are a source of ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', which causes toxoplasmosis.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/toxoplasmosis/]</ref> <!-- Article reference does not back up this speculative statement. The [[sea otter]] population on the [[California]] coast have decreased, and many of these dead otters are found to have [[toxoplasmosis]] infections. Researchers speculate that infected fecal waste from feral cats could enter local watersheds through [[surface runoff]] or domestic cat feces through the [[sewage system]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/07/04/BA178597.DTL&type=science | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Cat waste may cause sea otters' infection / Parasite could wash off land to coastal waters | first=Jane | last=Kay | date=2010-09-05}}</ref><ref>[http://surfermag.com/features/oneworld/otter/index.html Otterly Kelpless]</ref> However, researchers have said there is currently no direct link to between cats and the increase in toxoplasmosis among otters. -->

==Colonies==
===Population===
[[Image:DLH.jpg|thumb|Feral cat]]
A '''feral cat colony''' is a population (or "clowder") of feral cats. The term is used primarily when a noticeable population of feral cats live together in a specific location and use a common food source. The term is not typically applied to solitary cats passing through an area. A colony can range from 3-5 cats to about 100 cats. Their locations vary, some hiding in alleyways or in large parks.

Members consist of adult females, their young, and some adult males. Unneutered males in a colony fight each other for turf and for females. Some will be driven out to find another place to live.

Feral cats who have been trapped in many warm areas where fleas exist are usually found to have a large number of fleas, causing them to be anemic. Both the fleas, and the food source, if limited to garbage and rodents, cause the cats to have intestinal microorganisms (such as coccidia or giardia) and other parasites (commonly known as roundworms, tapeworms, and hookworms), which lead to diarrhea and subsequent dehydration. They also can have ear mites, ringworm, and upper respiratory infections. Others are wounded in mating-fights and die from the infected wounds. Still others eventually contract [[feline immunodeficiency virus]] or [[feline leukemia]] due to the constant transmission of blood and bodily fluids via fighting and sexual activity.

While all of these illnesses are quite treatable, there must be humans to intervene to stop these illnesses from becoming fatal. Due to the number of health problems to which they are subjected, and their fragile immune systems, kittens in the colony sometimes do not survive.

===Control and management===

[[File:Herd of Cats.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A colony of feral cats]]
In [[Trap-Neuter-Return]] (TNR), volunteers trap feral cats, [[Sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilize]] them through [[neutering|spaying or neutering]], and then release them, though some do keep kittens or cats which are more tame.  Variations of the program include testing and [[Feline vaccination|inoculation]] against [[rabies]] and other viruses and sometimes long-lasting [[flea treatment]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saveacat.org/faq.html#9|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=saveacat.org|accessdate=21 November 2010}}</ref> TNR programs are only now being introduced in some urban and suburban areas, such as [[Adelaide]]. More recently, such programs have been introduced in [[Sydney]] by the "World League for Protection of Animals".

On islands, on which the vacuum effect does not apply, eradication methods include hunting, trapping, poison baiting and biological controls. For example on [[Prince Edward Islands|Marion Island]] cats were infected with the [[feline panleukopenia]] virus, which drastically reduced their population within six years. The remaining cats were killed by shooting.

Feral cats can also be controlled by larger native predators like [[coyote]]s or [[dingo]]es, because cats are too small to defend themselves against larger predators.

The multiple, managed, feral colonies at the [[Colosseum]] in [[Rome]] exceed 250 cats. Other notable colonies include the [[Canadian Parliamentary Cats]], and the cats of Jerusalem <ref>{{Cite web| last = Hamilton| first = Jill| title = Blair and the stray cats of Jerusalem| work = JPost.com| accessdate = 2009-08-25| date = 2007-07-30| url = http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1185379025278}}</ref>
