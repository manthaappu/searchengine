'''Foton-M''' is series of [[robotic spacecraft]] used by [[Russia]] and the [[European Space Agency]] for research conducted in the [[microgravity]] environment of Earth [[orbit]]. The Foton-M design is based on the design of the [[Foton]], with several improvements including a new [[telemetry]] and [[telecommand]] unit for increased data flow rate, increased [[battery (electricity)|battery]] capacity, and a better thermal control system. It is produced by [[Progress State Research and Production Rocket Space Center|TsSKB-Progress]] in [[Samara, Russia|Samara]].

The first launch, of Foton-M1, failed because of a malfunction of the [[Soyuz-U]] [[launcher]]. The second launch, of Foton-M2, was however a success.<ref>
