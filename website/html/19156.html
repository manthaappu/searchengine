<html> <head> <title>Internet spelling</title></head><body>'''Internet spelling''' is a term to describe the use of words in an official [[Internet]]-related context (like an [[Request for Comments|RFC]] specification), but are [[misspelled]] to such a point that a large number of people use the alternative [[spelling]]. Probably one of the most common words that has an Internet spelling is the word referrer, which was misspelled in the [http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.0/draft-ietf-http-spec.html HTTP 1.0 specification] and has caught on as a spelling of the word as a result.

The Internet spelling of a word does not necessarily mean that every instance of its use on the Internet is in the Internet Spelling, it just means that the spelling of the word came into being in an Internet context. The differences between original spellings and Internet spellings are comparable to those between [[American and British English spelling differences|American Spellings and British spellings]].
