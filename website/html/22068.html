<html> <head> <title>List of computer size categories</title></head><body>{{unreferenced|date=July 2008}}
This '''list of computer size categories''' attempts to list commonly used categories of [[computer]] by size, in descending order of size. Of course, one generation's "supercomputer" is the next generation's "mainframe", and a "PDA" doesn't have the same set of functions as a "laptop", but the list should have some recognition value. It also ranks some more obscure computer sizes.

=====Unclassified=====
* Microsoft Sphere

== Distinctive marks ==
The classes above are not rigid; there are "edge devices" in most of them. For instance, the "subnotebook" category can usually be distinguished from the "PDA" category because a subnotebook has a keyboard and a PDA has not; however, tablet PCs may be larger than subnotebooks (making it seemingly correct to classify them as laptops) and also lack a keyboard, while devices such as the Handspring [[Treo 600]] have something that might charitably be called a keyboard, but are still definitely in the "smartphone" category.

In the higher end of the spectrum, this informal rule might help:

* You can throw a laptop
* You can lift a workstation
* You can tilt a minicomputer
* You can't move a mainframe
