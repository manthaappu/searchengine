In [[cryptography]], the '''IDEA NXT''' algorithm (previously known as '''FOX''') is a [[block cipher]] designed by [[Pascal Junod]] and [[Serge Vaudenay]] of [[EPFL]] ([[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]]). It was conceived between 2001 and 2003, the project was originally named '''FOX''' and was published in 2003. In May 2005 it was announced by MediaCrypt under the name '''IDEA NXT'''. IDEA NXT is the successor of the [[IDEA (cipher)|IDEA]] algorithm and it uses an extended ''Lai-Massey'' scheme known for its robustness to cryptanalysis. It was mandated by ''MediaCrypt'', a Swiss company owner of the distribution rights on IDEA and the patents of IDEA NXT. The IDEA NXT cipher is a family of different sub-ciphers with various blocks and keys size : Standard NXT64 (block of 64 bits, key of 128 bits, 16 rounds) and Standard NXT128 (block of 128 bits, key of 256 bits, 16 rounds). Variations of the Standard versions can be built (key of 0-256 bits, round numbers from 2-255). Also individual tables (sbox, permutation matrix) can be loaded, replacing the Standard table.

Mediacrypt states that IDEA NXT has two U.S. [[patent]] applications pending. ''(See links below.)''. The applications appear directed to key generation for the cipher.

The fact that IDEA NXT is patented and requires a license may influence the extent of its adoption, particularly given that there are viable alternatives (eg [[Rijndael|AES]], [[Serpent_%28cipher%29|Serpent]] and the [[Twofish]] algorithm) in the public domain which have no restrictions on them whatsoever.
