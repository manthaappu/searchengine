<html> <head> <title>Filtration (mathematics)</title></head><body>In [[mathematics]], a '''filtration''' is an [[indexed set]] ''S<sub>i</sub>'' of [[subobject]]s of a given [[algebraic structure]] ''S'', with the index ''i'' running over some [[index set]] ''I'' that is a [[totally ordered set]], subject to the condition that if ''i'' ≤ ''j'' in ''I'' then ''S<sub>i</sub>'' ⊆ ''S<sub>j</sub>''. The concept [[Dual (category theory)|dual]] to a filtration is called a ''cofiltration''.

Sometimes, as in a [[filtered algebra]], there is instead the requirement that the <math>S_i</math> be subobjects{{Clarify|date=February 2010}} with respect to certain operations (say, vector addition), but with respect to other operations (say, multiplication), they instead satisfy <math>S_i \cdot S_j \subset S_{i+j}</math>, where here the index set is the natural numbers; this is by analogy with a [[graded algebra]].

Filtrations are widely used in [[abstract algebra]], [[homological algebra]] (where they are related in an important way to [[spectral sequence]]s), and in [[measure theory]] and [[probability theory]] for nested sequences of [[sigma algebra|σ-algebras]]. In [[functional analysis]] and [[numerical analysis]], other terminology is usually used, such as [[scale of spaces]] or [[nested spaces]].

In algebra, filtrations are ordinarily indexed by '''N''', the set of natural numbers. A ''filtration'' of a group ''G'', is then a nested sequence ''G''<sub>''n''</sub> of [[normal subgroup]]s of ''G'' (that is, for any ''n'' we have ''G''<sub>''n''+1</sub> ⊆ ''G''<sub>''n''</sub>).

Given a group ''G'' and a filtration ''G''<sub>''n''</sub>, there is a natural way to define a topology on ''G'', said to be ''associated'' to the filtration. A basis for this topology is the set of all translates of subgroups appearing in the filtration, that is, a subset of ''G'' is defined to be open if it is a union of sets of the form ''aG''<sub>''n''</sub>, where ''a''∈''G'' and ''n'' is a natural number.

The topology associated to a filtration on a group ''G'' makes ''G'' into a [[topological group]]. 

The topology associated to a filtration ''G''<sub>''n''</sub> on a group ''G'' is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] if and only if ∩''G''<sub>''n''</sub> = {1}.

If two filtrations ''G''<sub>''n''</sub> and ''G&prime;''<sub>''n''</sub> are defined on a group ''G'', then the identity map from ''G'' to ''G'', where the first copy of ''G'' is given the ''G''<sub>''n''</sub>-topology and the second the ''G&prime;''<sub>''n''</sub>-topology, is continuous if and only if for any ''n'' there is an ''m'' such that ''G''<sub>''m''</sub> ⊆''G&prime;''<sub>''n''</sub>, that is, if and only if the identity map is continuous at 1. In particular, the two filtrations define the same topology if and only if for any subgroup appearing in one there is a smaller or equal one appearing in the other.

====Rings and modules====

Given a ring ''R'' and an ''R''-module ''M'', a ''filtration'' of ''M'' is a decreasing sequence of submodules ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>. This is therefore a special case of the notion for groups, with the additional condition that the subgroups be submodules. The associated topology is defined as for groups.

An important special case is known as the ''I''-adic topology (or ''J''-adic, etc.) Let ''R'' be a commutative ring, and ''I'' an ideal of ''R''. 

Given an ''R''-module ''M'', the sequence ''I<sup>n</sup>M'' of submodules of ''M'' forms a filtration of ''M''. The ''I-adic topology'' on ''M'' is then the topology associated to this filtration. If ''M'' is just the ring ''R'' itself, we have defined the ''I-adic topology'' on ''R''.

When ''R'' is given the ''I''-adic topology, ''R'' becomes a [[topological ring]]. If an ''R''-module ''M'' is then given the ''I''-adic topology, it becomes a [[topological module|topological ''R''-module]], relative to the topology given on ''R''.

====Vector spaces====
{{Main|Flag (linear algebra)}}
A filtration of a vector space is called a [[Flag (linear algebra)|flag]].

====Sets====
A maximal filtration of a set is equivalent to an ordering (a [[permutation]]) of the set. For instance, the filtration <math>\{0\} \subset \{0,1\} \subset \{0,1,2\}</math> corresponds to the ordering <math>(0,1,2)</math>. From the point of view of the [[field with one element]], an ordering on a set corresponds to a maximal [[Flag (linear algebra)|flag]] (a filtration on a vector space), considering a set to be a vector space over the field with one element.

===Measure theory===
In [[measure theory]], in particular in [[martingale theory]] and the theory of [[stochastic process]]es, a filtration is an increasing [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]] of [[sigma algebra|''&sigma;''-algebras]] on a [[measurable space]]. That is, given a measurable space <math>(\Omega, \mathcal{F})</math>, a filtration is a sequence of ''σ''-algebras <math>\{ \mathcal{F}_{t} \}_{t \geq 0}</math> with <math>\mathcal{F}_{t} \subseteq \mathcal{F}</math> for each ''t'' and

:<math>t_{1} \leq t_{2} \implies \mathcal{F}_{t_{1}} \subseteq \mathcal{F}_{t_{2}}.</math>

The exact range of the "times" ''t'' will usually depend on context: the set of values for ''t'' might be [[discrete set|discrete]] or continuous, [[bounded set|bounded]] or unbounded. For example,

:<math>t \in \{ 0, 1, \dots, N \}, \mathbb{N}_{0}, [0, T] \mbox{ or } [0, + \infty).</math>

Similarly, a '''filtered probability space''' (also known as a '''stochastic basis''') is a [[probability space]] with a filtration of its σ-algebra.

It is also useful (in the case of an unbounded index set) to define <math>\mathcal{F}_{\infty}</math> as the ''σ''-algebra generated by the infinite union of the <math>\mathcal{F}_{t}</math>'s, which is contained in <math>\mathcal{F}</math>:

:<math>\mathcal{F}_{\infty} = \sigma\left(\bigcup_{t \geq 0} \mathcal{F}_{t}\right) \subseteq \mathcal{F}.</math>

A ''σ''-algebra defines the set of events that can be measured, which in a [[probability]] context is equivalent to events that can be discriminated, or "questions that can be answered at time ''t''". Therefore a filtration is often used to represent the change in the set of events that can be measured, through gain or loss of [[information]]. A typical example is in [[mathematical finance]], where a filtration represents the information available at each time ''t'', and is more and more precise (the set of measurable events is staying the same or increasing) as information from the present becomes available.
