In [[mathematics]], '''genus''' (plural '''genera''') has a few different, but closely related, meanings:

==[[Topology]]==
===Orientable surface===<!-- This section is linked from [[Complex plane]] -->
The '''genus''' of a connected, [[orientability|orientable]] [[surface]] is an [[integer]] representing the maximum number of cuttings along non-intersecting closed simple [[curve]]s without rendering the resultant [[manifold]] disconnected. It is equal to the number of [[Handle (mathematics)|handles]] on it. Alternatively, it can be defined in terms of the [[Euler characteristic]] ''χ'', via the relationship ''χ'' = 2 − 2''g'' for closed surfaces, where ''g'' is the genus. For surfaces with ''b'' boundary components, the equation reads ''χ'' = 2 − 2''g'' − ''b''.

For instance:
* The [[sphere]] '''''S''<sup>''2''</sup>''' and a [[disk (mathematics)|disc]] both have genus zero.
* A [[torus]] has genus one, as does the surface of a coffee mug with a handle. This is the source of the joke that "a topologist is someone who can't tell their donut apart from their coffee mug."

An explicit construction of surfaces of genus ''g'' is given in the article on the [[fundamental polygon]].

In simpler terms, the value of an orientable surface's genus is equal to the number of "holes" it has.<ref>http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Genus.html</ref>

===Non-orientable surfaces===
The '''[[orientability|non-orientable]] genus''', '''demigenus''', or '''Euler genus''' of a connected, non-orientable closed [[surface]] is a positive [[integer]] representing the number of [[cross-cap]]s attached to a [[sphere]]. Alternatively, it can be defined for a closed surface in terms of the [[Euler characteristic]] χ, via the relationship χ = 2 − ''k'', where ''k'' is the non-orientable genus.

For instance:
* A [[projective plane]] has non-orientable genus one.
* A [[Klein bottle]] has non-orientable genus two.

===Knot===
The '''[[genus of a knot|genus]]''' of a [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] ''K'' is defined as the minimal genus of all [[Seifert surface]]s for ''K''. A Seifert surface of a knot is however a [[manifold with boundary]] the boundary being the knot, i.e.
homeomorphic to the unit circle. The genus of such a surface is defined to be the genus of the two-manifold, which is obtained by gluing the unit disk along the boundary.

===Handlebody===
The '''genus''' of a 3-dimensional [[handlebody]] is an integer representing the maximum number of cuttings along embedded [[Disk (mathematics)|disks]] without rendering the resultant manifold disconnected. It is equal to the number of handles on it.

For instance:
* A [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] has genus zero.
* A solid torus <math>D^2\times S^1</math> has genus one.

===Graph theory===
{{Main|Graph embedding}}
The '''genus''' of a [[graph (mathematics)|graph]] is the minimal integer ''n'' such that the graph can be drawn without crossing itself on a sphere with ''n'' handles (i.e. an oriented surface of genus ''n''). Thus, a [[planar graph]] has genus 0, because it can be drawn on a sphere without self-crossing.

The '''non-orientable genus''' of a [[graph (mathematics)|graph]] is the minimal integer ''n'' such that the graph can be drawn without crossing itself on a sphere with ''n'' cross-caps (i.e. a non-orientable surface of (non-orientable) genus ''n'').  (This number is also called the '''Euler genus''' and the '''demigenus'''.)

In [[topological graph theory]] there are several definitions of the genus of a [[Group (mathematics)|group]]. [[Arthur T. White]] introduced the following concept. The [[genus of a group]] <math>G</math> is the minimum genus of a (connected, undirected) [[Cayley graph]] for <math>G</math>.

The graph genus problem is NP-complete (Thomassen 1989).

==Algebraic geometry==
There are two related definitions of '''genus''' of any projective algebraic [[Scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] ''X'': the [[arithmetic genus]] and the [[geometric genus]].  When ''X'' is an [[algebraic curve]] with field of definition the [[complex number]]s, and if ''X'' has no [[tangent space|singular points]], then both of these definitions agree and coincide with the topological definition applied to the [[Riemann surface]] of ''X'' (its [[manifold]] of complex points). The definition of [[elliptic curve]] from algebraic geometry is ''non-singular curve of genus 1 with a given point on it''.
