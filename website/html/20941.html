'''LGA 1356''', also known as Socket B2, is an unreleased [[Intel]] [[microprocessor]] compatible [[CPU socket|socket]] which supports future Intel [[Sandy Bridge (microarchitecture)|Sandy Bridge]] microprocessor. LGA is short for [[Land Grid Array]].

LGA 1356 is designed as a replacement for the [[LGA 1366]] (known as ''Socket B''). LGA 1356 has 1356 protruding pins to make contact with the pads on the processor. Processors of LGA 1356 and LGA 1366 sockets are not compatible with each other since they have different socket notches.

The main difference between [[LGA 2011]] and LGA 1356 is 2 [[QPI]] connections on the LGA 2011 and 1 QPI connection on the LGA 1356.
Other noticeable difference include 2 more Gen 3 [[PCI-e]] connections on the LGA 2011 and supports one more channel of DDR3, each of its DDR3 channel can support one more [[DIMM]] (only applicable to DDR3 and not DDR3-L) <ref>http://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/video/pcw/docs/360/112/6.pdf</ref>
