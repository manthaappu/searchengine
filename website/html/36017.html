'''StyleCop''' is an open source [[static code analysis]] tool from [[Microsoft]] that checks [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] code for conformance to StyleCop's recommended coding styles and a subset of Microsoft's .NET Framework Design Guidelines. StyleCop analyzes the [[source code]], allowing it to enforce a different set of rules from [[FxCop]]. The rules are classified into the following categories:

* Documentation
* Layout
* Maintainability
* Naming
* Ordering
* Readability
* Spacing

StyleCop includes both [[GUI]] and command line versions of the tool. It is possible to create new rules to be used.

StyleCop was re-released as an open source project in April of 2010, at http://stylecop.codeplex.com.
