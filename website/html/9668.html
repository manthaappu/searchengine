In [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] mathematics, a '''De Bruijn torus''', named after [[Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn]], is an [[matrix (mathematics)|array]] of symbols from an alphabet (often just 0 and 1) that contains every ''m''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] exactly once.  It is a [[torus]] because the edges are considered wraparound for the purpose of finding matrices. Its name comes from the [[De Bruijn sequence]], which can be considered a special case where ''n'' is 1 (one dimension).

One of the main open questions regarding De Bruijn tori is whether a De Bruijn torus for a particular alphabet size can be constructed for a given ''m'' and ''n''.  It is known that these always exist when ''n'' = 1, since then we simply get the De Bruijn sequences, which always exist. It is also known that "square" tori exist whenever ''m'' = ''n''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Research problems on Gray codes and universal cycles|author1=Jackson|first1=Brad|last2=Stevens|first2=Brett|last3=Hurlbert|first3=Glenn|journal=Discrete Mathematics|volume=309|issue=17|date=Sept. 2009|pages=5341â€“5348|doi=10.1016/j.disc.2009.04.002}}</ref>
