<html> <head> <title>Hypercomputation</title></head><body>'''Hypercomputation''' refers to non-Turing computation. This includes various hypothetical methods for the [[computation]] of non-[[Computable function|Turing-computable function]]s, following [[super-recursive algorithm]]s (see also [[supertask]]).  It also includes other forms of computation, such as [[interactive computation]]. The term was first introduced in 1999 by [[Jack Copeland]] and [[Diane Proudfoot]].<ref>Copeland and Proudfoot, ''[http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&ARTICLEID_CHAR=94B166BF-E481-47FA-80C8-112C6BAF404 Alan Turing's forgotten ideas in computer science]''. [[Scientific American]], April 1999.</ref> A similar term is super-Turing computation. Hypercomputation may have the additional connotation of entertaining the possibility that such a device could be physically realizable.  Some models have been proposed.

==History==
A model more powerful than Turing machines was introduced by [[Alan Turing]] in his 1939 paper ''Systems of logic based on ordinals''. This paper investigated mathematical systems in which an [[Oracle machine|oracle]] was available, which could compute a single arbitrary (non-recursive) function from [[Natural number|naturals]] to naturals. He used this device to prove that even in those more powerful systems, [[Undecidable problem|undecidability]] is still present. Turing's writing made it clear that oracle machines were only mathematical abstractions, and were not thought of as physically realizable.<ref>"Let us suppose that we are supplied with some unspecified means of solving number-theoretic problems; a kind of oracle as it were. We shall not go any further into the nature of this oracle apart from saying that it cannot be a machine" (Undecidable p. 167, a reprint of Turing's paper ''Systems of Logic Based On Ordinals'')</ref>

==Hypercomputation vs. The Church-Turing Thesis==
The [[Church-Turing Thesis]] states that anything that is computable can be computed by a Turing machine. Hypercomputers can theoretically compute functions that a Turing machine cannot. So, if machines capable of performing hypercomputational supertasks are taken to be physically realizable, they may be considered pragmatic counterexamples to the thesis. This would push the limit of what is physically computable to a point much further beyond what has been generally accepted for decades.  

An example of a problem that a hypercomputer can solve that a Turing machine cannot is the [[Halting problem]]. A Turing machine cannot decide if an arbitrary program halts or runs forever. A hypercomputer, though, can run a program for an infinite amount of time and tell the user whether or not the program halted. If a solution is found, it gives the user the solution. If it runs for an eternity and finds no solution, it can tell the user that it never halted.

==Hypercomputer proposals==
*A Turing machine that can ''complete'' infinitely many steps. Simply being able to run for an unbounded number of steps forever, (i.e. potential infinity) does not suffice. One proposed approach is the [[Zeno machine]] (inspired by [[Zeno's paradox]]), a purely mathematical model.  The Zeno machine performs its first computation step in (say) 1 minute, the second step in ½ minute, the third step in ¼ minute, etc.  By summing the infinite [[geometric series]] 1+½+¼+... we see that the machine performs infinitely many steps in a total of 2 minutes. However, some people claim that, following the reasoning from [[Zeno's paradox]], Zeno machines are not just physically impossible, but logically impossible.<ref>These models have been independently developed by many different authors, including {{cite book|author=[[Hermann Weyl]]|  year=1927 | title=Philosophie der Mathematik und Naturwissenschaft}}; the model is discussed in {{cite journal

|volume=317}}</ref> Another example uses [[time dilation]] to allow a computer to spend an infinite amount of time performing a computation while a finite amount of time passes for an observer (it would require an infinite amount of energy to perform this calculation—see [[Malament-Hogarth spacetime]]). 
*Turing's original oracle machines, defined in Turing, 1939.
*A [[real computer]] (a sort of idealized [[analog computer]]) might be able to perform hypercomputation<ref>[[Arnold Schönhage]], "On the power of random access machines", in ''Proc. Intl. Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming (ICALP), pages 520-529, 1979.  Source of citation: [[Scott Aaronson]], "NP-complete Problems and Physical Reality"[http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/npcomplete.pdf] p. 12</ref> if physics admits general [[real number|real]] variables (not just [[computable number|computable reals]]), and these are in some way "harnessable" for computation.  This might require quite bizarre laws of physics (for example, a measurable [[physical constant]] with an oracular value, such as [[Chaitin's constant]]), and would at minimum require the ability to measure a real-valued physical value to arbitrary precision despite [[thermal noise]] and [[quantum mechanics|quantum effects]].
* A technique known as [[fair nondeterminism]] or [[unbounded nondeterminism]] may allow the computation of noncomputable functions.<ref>{{cite journal|authors=Edith Spaan, Leen Torenvliet and Peter van Emde Boas|title=Nondeterminism, Fairness and a Fundamental Analogy|journal=EATCS bulletin|volume=37|pages=186–193|year=1989}}</ref> There is dispute in the literature over whether this technique is coherent, and whether it actually allows noncomputable functions to be "computed".
*The use of [[closed timelike curve]]s (CTC), contrary to the beliefs of some, do not appear to permit hypercomputation, since they do not provide the unbounded amount of storage that an infinite computation would require.  However, access to a CTC may allow the rapid solution to [[PSPACE-complete]] problems, a complexity class which while Turing-decidable is generally considered computationally intractable.<ref>Todd A. Brun, ''Computers with closed timelike curves can solve hard problems'', Found.Phys.Lett. 16 (2003) 245-253.[http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0209061]</ref><ref>[[Scott Aaronson|S. Aaronson]] and J. Watrous. Closed Timelike Curves Make Quantum and Classical Computing Equivalent [http://scottaaronson.com/papers/ctc.pdf]</ref>
* According to a 1992 paper,<ref>Hogarth, M., 1992, ‘Does General Relativity Allow an Observer to View an Eternity in a Finite Time?’, Foundations of Physics Letters, 5, 173&ndash;181.</ref> a computer operating in a [[Malament-Hogarth spacetime]] in orbit around a [[black hole]] could theoretically perform non-Turing computations.<ref>Etesi, G., and Nemeti, I., 2002  'Non-Turing computations via Malament-Hogarth space-times', Int.J.Theor.Phys. 41 (2002) 341&ndash;370,  [http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0104023 Non-Turing Computations via Malament-Hogarth Space-Times:].</ref><ref>Earman, J. and Norton, J., 1993,  ‘Forever is a Day: Supertasks in Pitowsky and Malament-Hogarth Spacetimes’, Philosophy of Science, 5, 22&ndash;42.</ref>
*In 1994, [[Hava Siegelmann]] proved that her new (1991) computational model, the Artificial Recurrent Neural Network (ARNN), could perform hypercomputation (using infinite precision real weights for the synapses).  It is based on evolving an artificial neural network through a discrete, infinite succession of states.<ref>[http://www.cs.math.ist.utl.pt/ftp/pub/CostaJF/01-RCS-iwann.pdf Verifying Properties of Neural Networks] p.6</ref>
*The '''infinite time Turing machine''' is a generalization of the Zeno machine, that can perform infinitely long computations whose steps are enumerated by potentially transfinite [[ordinal number]]s.  It models an otherwise-ordinary Turing machine for which non-halting computations are completed by entering a special state reserved for reaching a [[limit ordinal]] and to which the results of the preceding infinite computation are available.<ref>[[Joel David Hamkins]] and [[Andy Lewis (mathematician)|Andy Lewis]], Infinite time Turing machines, ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'', 65(2):567-604, 2000.[http://jdh.hamkins.org/Publications/2000e]</ref>
*A [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] system which somehow uses (for example) an infinite superposition of states to compute a non-[[computable function]].<ref>There have been some claims to this effect; see {{cite journal | author = Tien Kieu | title = Quantum Algorithm for the [[Hilbert problems|Hilbert's Tenth Problem]] | journal = Int. J. Theor. Phys. | year = 2003 | volume = 42 | url = http://www.arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0110136 | pages = 1461–1478 | doi = 10.1023/A:1025780028846}}. & the ensuing literature.
