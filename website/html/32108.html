<html> <head> <title>Rigid origami</title></head><body>'''Rigid origami''' is a branch of [[origami]] which is concerned with folding structures using flat rigid sheets joined by hinges. It is a part of the study of the [[mathematics of paper folding]], it can be considered as a type of [[Linkage (mechanical)|mechanical linkage]], and has great practical utility. For instance it was used in the construction of large [[solar panel]] arrays that have to be folded before deployment. There is no requirement that the structure start as a flat sheet &mdash; for instance [[shopping bag]]s with flat bottoms and [[airbag]]s are studied as part of rigid origami.

==Mathematics==

The number of standard origami bases that can be folded using rigid origami is restricted by its rules.

Rigid origami does not have to follow the [[Huzita–Hatori axioms]], the fold lines can be calculated rather than having to be constructed from existing lines and points. However [[Kawasaki's Theorem]] and [[Maekawa's Theorem]] are still applicable.

The [[Bellows conjecture|Bellows theorem]] says that a [[flexible polyhedron]] has constant volume when flexed.

The [[napkin folding problem]] asks whether it is possible to fold a square so the perimeter of the resulting flat figure is increased. That this can be solved within rigid origami was proved by A.S. Tarasov in  2004.

==Applications==

The [[Miura fold]] is a rigid fold that has been used to deploy large solar panel arrays for space satellites.

[[Robert J. Lang]] has applied origami to the problem of folding [[airbag]]s

and to folding a space telescope.

Folding paper [[shopping bag]]s is a problem where the rigidity requirement means the classic solution does not work.

==Recreational uses==

[[Martin Gardner]] has popularised [[flexagon]]s which are a form of rigid origami and the flexatube.
