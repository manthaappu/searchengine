<html> <head> <title>Interstellar communication</title></head><body>'''Interstellar communication''' is the transmission of signals between [[planetary system]]s. Sending of the [[Interstellar messages]] is potentially much easier than [[interstellar travel]], being possible with technologies and equipment which are currently available. However, successful communication requires someone at the other end to communicate ''with'', and in that regard it is currently not known whether interstellar communication is possible.

== Radio ==
The [[SETI]] project has for the past several decades been conducting a search for signals being transmitted by [[extraterrestrial life]] located outside the [[solar system]], primarily in the [[radio]] frequencies of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. Special attention has been given to the [[Water Hole]], the frequency of one of neutral [[hydrogen]]'s absorption lines, due to the low background noise at this frequency and its symbolic association with the basis for what is likely to be the most common system of [[biochemistry]] (see [[Alternative biochemistry]]).

The regular radio pulses emitted by [[pulsar]]s were briefly thought to be potential intelligent signals; the first pulsar to be discovered was originally designated "LGM-1", for "Little Green Men." They were quickly determined to be of natural origin, however.

Several attempts have been made to transmit signals to other stars as well, see "Realized projects" at [[Active SETI]] and [http://www.cplire.ru/html/ra&sr/irm/index.html Interstellar Radio Messages]. One of the earliest and most famous was the 1974 radio message sent from the largest radio telescope in the world, [[Arecibo]], in Puerto Rico. An extremely simple message was aimed at a [[globular cluster|globular cluster of stars]] known as [[Messier 13|M13]] in the [[Milky Way Galaxy]] and at a distance of 30,000 [[light year]]s from our [[solar system]]. These efforts have been more symbolic than anything else, however. Further, a possible answer needs double the [[travel time]], i.e. tens of years (near stars) or 60,000 years (M13). Sending Interstellar Radio Messages between stars may prove to be optimal for many applications.<ref>{{cite journal

==Other methods==
It has also been proposed that higher frequency signals, such as [[laser]]s operating at [[visible light]] frequencies, may prove to be a fruitful method of interstellar communication; at a given frequency it takes surprisingly small energy output for a laser emitter to outshine its local [[star]] from the perspective of its target{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}.

Other more exotic methods of communication have been proposed, such as modulated [[neutrino]] or [[gravitational wave]] emissions. These would have the advantage of being essentially immune to interference by intervening matter, but are very difficult to generate or detect with current technology.

Sending physical mail packets between stars may prove to be optimal for many applications.<ref name="probes">{{cite journal

The possibility of using interstellar messenger probes for interstellar communication &mdash; known as [[Bracewell probe]]s &mdash; was first suggested by [[Ronald N. Bracewell]] in 1960, and the technical feasibility of this approach was demonstrated by the British Interplanetary Society's starship study [[Project Daedalus]] in 1978.  Starting in 1979, [[Robert Freitas]] advanced arguments<ref name="probes"/>
