'''ISO/IEC 18014''' ''Information technology &mdash; Security techniques &mdash; Time-stamping services'' is an [[international standard]] that specifies time-stamping techniques. It comprises three parts:
*[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50678 Part 1: Framework ]
*[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=34387 Part 2: Mechanisms producing independent tokens]
*[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=34388 Part 3: Mechanisms producing linked tokens]

== Part 1: Framework ==

In this first part of ISO/IEC 18014, several things are explained and developed:
* The identification of the objectives of a time authority.
* The description of a general model on which time stamping services are based.
* The definition of time stamping services.
* The definition of the basic protocols of time stamping.
* The specifications of the protocols between the involved entities.

'''Key words''': audit, non-repudiation, security, time-stamp

== Part 2: Mechanisms producing independent tokens ==

A time-stamping service provides evidence that a data item existed before a certain point in time. Time-stamp services produce time-stamp tokens, which are data structures containing a verifiable cryptographic binding between a data item's representation and a time-value. This part of ISO/IEC 18014 defines time-stamping mechanisms that produce independent tokens, which can be verified one by one.

== Part 3: Mechanisms producing linked tokens ==

This part of ISO/IEC 18014:
* Describes a general model for time-stamping services producing linked tokens.
* Describes the basic components used to construct a time-stamping service of this type.
* Defines the data structures used to interact with a time-stamping service of this type.
* Describes specific instances of such time-stamping services.

ISO/IEC 18014-3:2004 describes time-stamping services producing linked tokens, that is, tokens that are cryptographically bound to other tokens produced by these time-stamping services. It describes a general model for time-stamping services of this type and the basic components used to construct a time-stamping service of this type, it defines the data structures and protocols used to interact with a time-stamping service of this type, and it describes specific instances of such time-stamping services.
