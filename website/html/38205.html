A '''tree sort''' is a [[sort algorithm]] that builds a [[binary search tree]] from the keys to be sorted, and then traverses the tree ([[Tree traversal|in-order]]) so that the keys come out in sorted order. Its typical use is when sorting the elements of a stream from a file. Several other sorts would have to load the elements to a temporary data structure, whereas in a tree sort the act of loading the input into a data structure is sorting it.

== Efficiency ==
Adding one item to a binary search tree is on average an O(log(n)) process, so adding n items is an O(n log(n)) process, making Tree Sort a so-called, 'fast sort'. But adding an item to an unbalanced binary tree needs [[Big O notation|O]](''n'') time in the worst-case, when the tree resembles a [[linked list]] ([[Binary Tree#Types of binary trees|degenerate tree]]), causing a worst case of O(n<sup>2</sup>) for this sorting algorithm.
The worst case scenario then is triggered by handing a Tree Sort algorithm an already sorted set. This would make the time needed to insert all elements into the binary tree O(n<sup>2</sup>). The dominant process in the Tree Sort algorithm is the "insertion" into the binary tree, assuming that the time needed for retrieval is O(n).

The worst-case behaviour can be improved upon by using a [[self-balancing binary search tree]]. Using such a tree, the algorithm has an O(n log(n)) worst-case performance, thus being degree-optimal.

== Example ==
In a simple [[functional programming]] form, the algorithm (in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]) would look something like this:
<source lang="text">
data Tree a = Leaf | Node (Tree a) a (Tree a)

insert :: Ord a => a -> Tree a -> Tree a
insert x Leaf = Node Leaf x Leaf
insert x (Node t y t') | x <= y = Node (insert x t) y t'
insert x (Node t y t') | x > y = Node t y (insert x t')

flatten :: Tree a -> [a]
flatten Leaf = []
flatten (Node t x t') = flatten t ++ [x] ++ flatten t'

treesort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
treesort = flatten . foldr insert Leaf
</source>
Mind that in the above example, both the insertion algorithm and the retrieval algorithm have O(n<sup>2</sup>) worst case scenarios.

An example using a self-balancing binary search tree in C++, with O(n log n) worst-case:
<source lang="cpp">
#include <set>       // for multiset
#include <algorithm> // for copy
#include <iterator>  // for iterator_traits
 
template <typename Iterator>
void binary_tree_sort(Iterator begin, Iterator end)
{
    // C++'s multiset class is a self-balancing binary search tree that allows duplicates
    // Add each element in input range to the tree
    std::multiset<typename std::iterator_traits<Iterator>::value_type> tree(begin, end);
 
    // Read elements in ascending order by simply traversing the tree.
    std::copy(tree.begin(), tree.end(), begin);
}
</source>
