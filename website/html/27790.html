'''Organizational Intelligence''' (OI) is the capability of an organization to comprehend and conclude knowledge relevant to its business purpose.

* an ability to make sense of complex situations and act effectively
* an ability to interpret and act upon relevant events and signals in the environment
* ability to develop, share and use knowledge relevant to its business purpose
* ability to reflect and learn from experience

OI embraces both [[knowledge management]] (KM) and [[organizational learning]], as it is the application of KM concepts to a business environment, additionally including learning mechanisms, comprehension models and business value network models, such as the [[balanced scorecard]] concept.

OI's focus includes the creation, fostering and management of organizational competencies (OCs).

Organizational intelligence has been defined as "the capacity to sense, make sense, and act in flexible, creative, adaptive ways",<ref>{{Citation
