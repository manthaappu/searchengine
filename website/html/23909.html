'''MediaMosa''' is a [[robust]], [[flexible]] and highly [[scalable]] [[media management platform]]. It is already helping deliver rich content to [[educational organisations]] across the [[Netherlands]].

MediaMosa is software to build a Full Featured, Webservice Oriented Media Management and Distribution platform.

With MediaMosa you can build a state-of-the-art, scalable Middleware Media Distribution Platform which facilitates access to, and usage of (shared) storage capacity, metadata databases, transcoding- and streaming servers. A MediaMosa platform offers functionality for searching, playing, uploading, transcoding, as well as a fine granularity media access control system towards its users. MediaMosa is based on the Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture and is designed to support content streaming applications by providing a back-end-, audio- and video-infrastructure.

The main features of a MediaMosa platform are:
* Delivery platform for audio, video (and in fact any other content)
* Streaming of any format (e.g. Flash, H.264 MPEG-4 and WindowsMedia)
* Transcoding based on FFmpeg
* Flexible Metadata Element Sets
* Access management functions on Media
* Enhanced Still functions
* Open Source under GPLv2 license
MediaMosa is a free and open software package developed by [[Madcap_bv|Madcap]]. It is based on the [[Drupal]] CMS and supports the use of several other Open Source software such as [[FFmpeg]]
