<html> <head> <title>Outline of artificial intelligence</title></head><body>'''[[Artificial intelligence|Artificial intelligence (AI)]]''' is a branch of [[computer science]] that deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation ''in [[machine]]s''. Research in AI is concerned with producing machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.  

The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to artificial intelligence.
