The '''chief information officer''' ('''CIO'''), or '''information technology''' ('''IT''') '''director''', is a job title commonly given to the most senior executive in an enterprise responsible for the [[information technology]] and computer systems that support enterprise goals. The CIO typically reports to the [[chief executive officer]], [[chief operations officer]] or [[chief financial officer]]. In military organizations, they report to the [[commanding officer]].

==CIO==
[[Information technology]] and its systems have become so important that CIO has come to be viewed in many organizations as the key contributor in formulating [[strategic]] goals for an organization. The CIO manages the implementation of the useful technology to increase information accessibility and integrated systems management. As a comparison, where the CIO adapts systems through the use of existing technologies, [[chief technology officer]] develops new technologies to expand corporate technological capabilities. When both positions are present in an organization, the CIO is generally responsible for processes and practices supporting the flow of information, whereas the [[Chief Technology Officer|CTO]] is generally responsible for [[technology infrastructure]].

''CIO'' magazine's "State of the CIO 2008" survey asked 558 IT leaders who they report to. The results were: [[CEO]] (41%), [[CFO]] (23%), [[Chief operating officer|COO]] (16%), Corporate CIO (7%) and Other (13%).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cio.com/article/147950/_State_of_the_CIO_2008_Data_Shows_CIO_Salaries_Influence_Rising |title=State of the CIO 2008 Data Shows CIO Salaries, Influence Rising |publisher=CIO |accessdate=27 February 2010 }}</ref>

==Information technology==
The prominence of the CIO position has risen greatly as [[information technology]] has become a more important part of business. The CIO may be a member of the executive board of an organization. No specific qualification are intrinsic of the CIO position, though the typical candidate may have expertise in a number of technological fields - [[computer science]], [[software engineering]], or [[information systems]]. Many candidates have [[Master of Business Administration]] or [[Master of Science in Management]] degrees.<ref>[http://www.cio.com/article/122507/Should_You_Get_an_MBA_ Should You Get an MBA? - CIO.com - Business Technology Leadership<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.  More recently CIOs' leadership capabilities, business acumen and strategic perspectives have taken precedence over technical skills. It is now quite common for CIOs to be appointed from the business side of the organization, especially if they have [[project management]] skills.

In 2007 a survey amongst CIOs by ''CIO'' magazine in the UK discovered that their top 10 concerns were: [[people leadership]], [[managing budgets]], [[business alignment]], infrastructure refresh, security, [[compliance (regulation)|compliance]], [[resource management]], managing customers, [[managing change]] and board politics<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.cio.co.uk/concern/budgets/features/index.cfm?articleid=351 Granger: The final word - CIO UK Magazine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. 

Typically, a CIO is involved with analyzing and reworking existing business processes, with identifying and developing the capability to use new tools, with reshaping the enterprise's physical infrastructure and network access, and with identifying and exploiting the enterprise's knowledge resources. Many CIOs head the enterprise's efforts to integrate the Internet into both its long-term strategy and its immediate business plans. The CIO is evolving into a role where he/she is creating and monitoring business value from IT assets, to the point where Potts in [[FruITion (novel)]] suggests that the Chief Information Officer (CIO) be replaced with Chief Internal Investments Officer (CIIO).<ref name="SH10">[http://www.technicspub.com/product.sc?productId=7&categoryId=1 fruITion: Creating the Ultimate Corporate Strategy for Information Technology, Chris Potts, Technics Publications, LLC 2008]</ref>

Another way that the CIO role is changing is an increased focus on service management.<ref name="servMgmt">
