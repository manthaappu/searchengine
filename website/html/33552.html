Second-language [[writing]] is the name usually given to the study of writing performed by non-native speakers/writers of a [[language]], whether as a true second or [[foreign language]].

In addition to disseminating research through the [[Journal of Second Language Writing]], scholars in the field regular participate in three academic conferences, the Symposium on Second Language Writing, the [[TESOL]] convention, and the Conference on College Composition and [[Communication]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

==Symposium on Second Language Writing==
The Symposium on Second Language Writing, which began in 1998 at [[Purdue University]], is an international conference on second language writing.It was a biennial event through 2006, and annuallly after that.   It  has been hosted at Purdue University six times, but  the 2007 symposium was held in [[Japan]], and the 2009 was held at [[Arizona State University]]. The 2010 will be held in Murcia, Spain <ref>Symposium on Second Language Writing. (n.d.). Retrieved October 5, 2008, from http://sslw.asu.edu/</ref>

==Second Language Writing at TESOL, Inc.==
In June 2005, the TESOL Board added of a new interest section on writing. The '''Second Language Writing IS'''; it held its first meeting in [[Tampa]] in March 2006,  covering topics ranging from “Broadening Perspectives in Second Language Writing” and “Alternative Placement Methods for Second Language Writers” to “Issues in Technologies for L2 Composition Classrooms” and “Crossing Bridges with Second Language Writing Partnerships.”

As these suggest, the section provides a forum for researchers and [[educator]]s at different [[Educational stage|grade]] levels and institutional settings to discuss  second language writing. Specifically, the section's goals are:

* to increase awareness of the significance of writing in [[teaching]] [[ESL]]/EFL, 
* to encourage and support the teaching of writing to [[ESOL]] students at all levels, 
* to provide a forum to discuss issues of writing [[Educational assessment|assessment]] and the placement of second language writers, and
* to disseminate and promote [[research]] on second language writing  <ref>Second Language Writing Interest Section. (n.d.). Retrieved October 5, 2008, from http://secondlanguagewriting.com/slwis/</ref>

The section facilitates [[communication]] about writing across teaching levels and settings. Recent research on the scope of second language writing scholarship suggests that most of the field’s nationally (within the U.S.) and internationally circulated scholarship is produced by scholars in post-secondary education at research intensive institutions. Other contexts for writing (Pre-K through 12, two-year colleges, community programs, international [[K-12]] schools, etc.) often have much larger populations of ELL/EFL writers, but scholars, particularly teacher-researchers, in these settings do not often receive support for researching and writing.

Given this, the section provides scholars with the opportunity to initiate more research and scholarship in these underrepresented contexts by supporting new collaborations and partnerships across levels and by providing a forum for discussing shared experiences. The section, like its parent body,  TESOL, is distinctive in including all the academic levels and areas.

==Second Language Writing at CCCC==
Second language writing scholars also participate in a Special Interest Group on the field at CCCC <ref>[http://www.ncte.org/cccc]</ref>. In addition, the organization has a Committee on Second Language Writing   to bridge work between CCCC and TESOL to involve more scholars in the field’s discussions.

Much recent attention focuses on the potential of [[Computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) to foster desire and opportunity to write.
