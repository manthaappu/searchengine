'''Open Source Cluster Application Resources''' (OSCAR) is a Linux-based software installation for high-performance [[cluster (computing)|cluster computing]].

OSCAR allows users to install a [[Beowulf (computing)|Beowulf]] type high performance computing cluster. Beowulf Clusters are scalable performance clusters based on [[commodity computing|commodity]] hardware, on a private system network, with an open source software ([[Linux]]) infrastructure. The OSCAR project aims to support as many different Linux distributions as possible. Supported [[Linux distribution]]s as mentioned on the OSCAR website are [[Debian]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], [[OpenSUSE]], [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]].

It consists of a cluster of [[personal computer|PCs]] or [[workstation|workstations]] dedicated to running high-performance computing tasks. The [[node (networking)|nodes]] in the cluster don't sit on people's desks; they are dedicated to running cluster jobs. The cluster is usually connected to the outside world through only a single node.

Some Linux clusters are built for reliability instead of speed. These are not Beowulfs.
