<html> <head> <title>Axis-aligned object</title></head><body>In [[geometry]], an '''axis-aligned object''' ('''axis-parallel''', '''axis-oriented''') is an object in ''n''-dimensional space whose shape is aligned with the [[coordinate axes]] of the space. 

Examples are [[axis-aligned rectangle]]s (or [[hyperrectangle]]s), the ones with edges parallel to the coordinate axes. [[Minimum bounding box]]es are often implicitly assumed to be axis-aligned. A more general case is [[rectilinear polygon]]s, the ones with all sides parallel to coordinate axes or rectilinear polyhedra. 

Many problems in [[computational geometry]] allow for algorithms with better [[computational complexity]] when restricted to (collections of) axis-oriented objects, such as axis-aligned rectangles or axis-aligned line segments.

A different kind of example are axis-aligned ellipsoids, i.e., the [[ellipsoid]]s with principal axes parallel to the coordinate axes.
