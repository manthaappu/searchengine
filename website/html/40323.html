'''Windows Open Service Architecture''' is one of the mainstays of [[Microsoft Windows]]: the methods of abstraction of core services.

For each extension, Windows Open Services Architecture defines an [[application programming interface|API]] and an [[Service Provider Interface|SPI]], as well as a universal interface (usually placed in a single [[DLL]]) that both comply to.

These then transparently let the [[operating system]] speak to device drivers, database managers, and other low level entities.

These extensions include, among others, [[ODBC]] (called the "crowning jewel of WOSA"), [[Telephony Application Programming Interface|TAPI]], [[WOSA/XFS]], [[Speech Application Programming Interface|SAPI]] and [[MAPI]], and their supporting services, as well as the abstraction of access to printers, modems, and networking services, which run identically over [[TCP/IP]], [[IPX/SPX]], and [[NetBEUI]].
