A '''bitstream''' or '''bit stream''' is a [[time series]] of [[bit]]s. 

A [[bytestream]] is a series of [[byte]]s, typically of 8 bits each, and can be regarded as a special case of a bitstream.

Bitstreams are used extensively in [[telecommunications]] and [[computing]]: for example, the [[Synchronous Digital Hierarchy|SDH]] communications technology transports synchronous bitstreams, and the [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] [[communications protocol]] transports a bytestream without synchronous timing.

When a bitstream is captured and stored in a [[computer storage]] medium, a [[computer file]] is created.

The term '''bitstream''' is frequently used to describe the configuration data to be loaded into a [[field programmable gate array]] (FPGA).  This usage may have originated based on the common method of configuring the FPGA from a serial bit stream, typically from a serial [[programmable read-only memory|PROM]] or [[flash memory]] chip, although most FPGAs also support a byte-parallel loading method as well.  The detailed format of the bitstream for a particular FPGA chip is usually considered proprietary to the FPGA vendor.

In mathematics, several specific [[sequence (mathematics)|infinite sequences]] of bits have been studied for their mathematical properties; these include the [[Baum–Sweet sequence]], [[Ehrenfeucht–Mycielski sequence]], [[Fibonacci word]], [[Kolakoski sequence]], [[regular paperfolding sequence]], [[Rudin–Shapiro sequence]], and [[Thue–Morse sequence]].
