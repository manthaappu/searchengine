<html> <head> <title>Daily build</title></head><body>A '''daily build''' or '''nightly build''' is the practice of each day doing a [[software build]] of the latest version of a program. This is so it can first be [[compile]]d to ensure that all required dependencies are present, and possibly tested to show no [[computer bug|bugs]] have been introduced. The daily build is also often publicly available allowing access to the latest features for feedback.
In this context a ''build'' is the result of [[compiler|compiling]] and [[Linker (computing)|linking]] all the files that make up a [[computer program|program]].  The use of such disciplined procedures as daily builds is particularly necessary in large organizations where many programmers are working on a single piece of software. Performing '''daily builds''' helps ensure that [[Software developer|developers]] can work knowing with reasonable certainty that any new bugs that show up are a result of their own work done within the last day.
'''Daily builds''' typically include a set of tests, sometimes called a '''smoke test''' ( as in where there is smoke there is fire).  These tests are included to assist in determining what may have been broken by the changes included in the latest build.  The critical piece of this process is to include new and revised tests as the project progresses.
