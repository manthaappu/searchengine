Subjectivity may refer to the specific discerning interpretations of any aspect of experiences. They are unique to the person experiencing them, the '''[[qualia]]''' that are only available to that person's [[consciousness]]. Though the causes of experience are thought to be "objective" and available to everyone, (such as the [[wavelength]] of a specific beam of [[light]]), experiences themselves are only available to the subject (the quality of the [[colour]] itself).

Subjectivity frequently exists in theories, measurements or concepts, against the will of those attempting to be objective, and it is a goal in most fields to remove subjectivity from scientific or mathematical statements or experiments.  Many fields such as physics, biology, computer science, and chemistry are attempting to remove subjectivity from their methodologies, theories and results and this is a large part of the process of experimentation in these fields today.

Despite this, subjectivity is the only way we have to experience the world, mathematically, scientifically or otherwise.  We share a human subjectivity, as well as individual subjectivity and all theories and philosophies that dictate our understanding of mathematics, science, literature and every concept we have about the world is based on human or individual perspective.  Subjectivity is within itself the only truth despite assumptions about subjective "truths" we make.  The creation of philosophies is within itself subjective, along with the concept of discovery or creation of ideas.   

This term contrasts with [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]], which is used to describe humans as "seeing" the universe exactly for what it is from a standpoint free from human perception and its influences, human cultural interventions, past experience and expectation of the result.
