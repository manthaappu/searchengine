== Partnerships and competition ==

Until 2005, [[IBM]] was a reseller of the entire product line of ClearCube. Afterwards, IBM bundled some of its own hardware with ClearCube's software, and also diversified its software offering to include [[Citrix]] and [[VMWare]] products.<ref name=iw05/> When IBM sold its PC division to [[Lenovo]], the latter also began reselling ClearCube blades.<ref name=nw05/><ref name=pcw05>Tom Krazit, (Jul 11, 2005) [http://www.pcworld.com/article/121757/lenovo_to_resell_clearcube_blade_pcs.html Lenovo to Resell ClearCube Blade PCs], [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]</ref> Other major PC manufactures, like [[HP]], also began to compete in the blade PC niche around this time.<ref name=pcw05/><ref>http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/04/27/hp_ships_blade_pc/</ref> Other resellers of ClearCube products included [[Hitachi]], [[CompuCom]], and [[SAIC (company)|SAIC]].<ref name=nw05/>

In 2008, ClearCube spun off its software division as ''VDIworks'', but the two companies remain closely associated in OEM partnership, and share the same investors and owners.<ref>David Marshall, (May 5, 2008) [http://www.infoworld.com/print/56028 ClearCube spins off software business to VDIworks], [[InfoWorld]]</ref> In January 2008, ClearCube also introduced products implementing Teradici's [[PC-over-IP]] protocol, including two dual [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] [[thin clients]], the I9420 I/Port and C7420 C/Port, which connect to the blades using copper-based and fiber-optic [[Ethernet]], respectively.<ref>Agam Shah, (January 24, 2008) [http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9058818/ClearCube_announces_thin_clients?taxonomyId=12&intsrc=hm_topic ClearCube announces thin clients], [[Computerworld]]</ref>
