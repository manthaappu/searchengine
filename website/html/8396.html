<html> <head> <title>CreateDebate</title></head><body>'''CreateDebate''' is a user-driven social debating [[website]] which serves to facilitate discourse on topics of users' choosing. CreateDebate combines [[social networking]] technologies with [[Debate|debating]] and [[voting]] in a social and [[Democracy|democratic]] nature. 

== Details ==

Users can create a debate about any topic they desire and can link the debate to any media found on the Internet, including text-based articles, images and videos. Users can search and discover debates relevant to their interests, and interact with other CreateDebate users who have common or disparate beliefs.

The content on CreateDebate is driven entirely by the user base, and debates that receive the most amount of action become "Most Heated" and end up on the front page. CreateDebate users can cite evidence via links in their arguments from any source on the Internet.  All content on CreateDebate is licensed under a [[Creative Commons licenses|Creative Commons license]], allowing for [[freedom of information]] share.

== Functionality ==

The CreateDebate platform provides a structure that lets people see what the best arguments are within each debate, and which side of a debate is winning.  People can create two kinds of debates and argue any topic they are passionate about.  The CreateDebate community then votes "up" well-conceived arguments and votes "down" flawed logic.  Over time, the best arguments rise to the top of the debate, which distills out the central points and most relevant factors.  CreateDebate categorizes debates into various topics including: [[Politics]], [[Technology]], [[Shopping]], [[Religion]], [[Travel]], [[Science]], [[World]], [[Sports]], [[Business]], and [[Comedy]], although users can create debates about any topic they are interested in.  The creator of the debate, or the Debate Moderator, chooses the title, information, category, and end date of the debate, and has the power to ban users from the debate.  

CreateDebate is a [[social network]] designed to help groups of people sort through issues, viewpoints, and opinions in an organized manner, so that better decisions can be made.  Each user has a [[user profile]], which automatically builds itself over time.  "Allies", "Enemies" and "Hostile" relationships are tracked and a news feed provides personalized updates.  Debate and arguments activity is also automatically tracked so its easy to find new content.  A points system keeps tabs on participation to allow users to identify the top debaters in a number of categories.  The research feature allows people to pipe [[RSS]] content from the web into any debate.

=== Debate Types ===

There are currently two types of debates available for creation on the site; the 2-Sided Debate and the Perspective Debate.  The 2-Sided Debate Consists of two different columns, each representing a viewpoint pertinent to the motion. These "sides" are expressed as the debate creator sees fit, but mostly fall into the categories ''Yes/Agree'' and ''No/Disagree'', relative to the motion. The default argument tags in a 2-sided debate are identical to the side the user posts their argument on, though new tags can be created at users' discretion.  A Perspective style debate allows for limitless viewpoints and includes only one column for all arguments.  In both types of debate, the Moderator can choose whether the debate will end at a specific point or continue indefinitely.
