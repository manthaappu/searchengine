'''jBPM''' is a [[workflow engine]] written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] that can execute processes described in [[Business Process Execution Language|BPEL]] or its own process definition language jPDL. It is released under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]] license by the JBoss Community.

In essence jBPM takes graphical process descriptions as input.  A process is composed of activities that are connected with transitions.  Processes represent an execution flow.   The graphical diagram of a process is used as the basis for the communication between non technical users and developers.

Each execution of a process definition is called a process instance.  jBPM manages the process instances.    Some activities are automatic like sending an email or invoking an ejb.  Some activities can be wait states.  For example human tasks or waiting for an external client to invoke a service method.  jBPM will manage and persist the state of the process executions during those wait state activities.

jBPM is based on the Process Virtual Machine (PVM) which is the JBoss Community's foundation to support multiple process languages natively.  The JBoss Community currently focusses on expanding process languages BPMN 2.0 and jPDL. 

The PVM foundation makes jBPM future proof.  As the fragmented BPM landscape changes, jBPM can add new process languages easily.
