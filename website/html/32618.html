<html> <head> <title>Russian National Corpus</title></head><body>The '''Russian National Corpus''' (English official name; the Russian name is '''Национальный корпус русского языка''', lit. National Corpus of Russian language, but as the official English variant the Russian National Corpus is used) is a [[corpus linguistics|corpus]] of [[Russian language]] that has been available online since April 29, 2004. It is being created by the Institute of Russian language, [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].

It currently contains about 150 million word forms that are automatically lemmatized and [[Part of speech|POS]]-/grammeme-tagged, i. e. all the possible morphological analyses for each orthographic form are ascribed to it. Lemmata, POS, grammatical items and their combinations are searchable. Additionally, 6 million word forms are in the subcorpus with manually resolved [[homonymy]]. <!---A statistical program that resolves homonymy using the manually tagged corpus as a [[machine-learning tool]] is already constructed and the results will be made available online soon.--->

The subcorpus with resolved morphological [[homonymy]] is also automatically [[stress (linguistics)|accent]]uated. The whole corpus has a searchable tagging concerning [[lexical semantics]] (LS), including morphosemantic POS subclasses (proper noun, reflexive pronoun etc.), LS characteristics proper (thematic class, causativity, evaluation), derivation (diminutive, adverb formed from adjective etc.).

The  RNC includes also the following subcorpora:
*a [[treebank]] of [[syntax|syntactical]] dependencies (largely based on the [[Igor Mel'čuk]]'s [[Meaning-Text Theory]])
*an English<=>Russian and German=>Russian [[parallel corpus|parallel corpora]];
*a corpus of Russian [[poetry]], where the rhyming words and poetic [[Prosody (poetry)|prosody]] (including meter, stanzas etc.) is additionally tagged;
*a corpus of Russian [[dialect]]s with specific dialect grammar tagging;
*a corpus showing the history of Russian [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]]
*an educational subcorpus reflecting school standards.

All the texts have tags bearing metatextual information - the author, his/her birth date, creation date, text size, text genres (general fiction, detective story, newspaper article etc.); all these categories are browsable and searchable separately. It is possible to define a user's subcorpus to search  lemmata/POS-grammeme/semantic tags combinations only within this subset.

The corpus will be made available off-line and distributed for non-commercial purposes, but currently due to some technical and/or copyright problems it is accessible only on-line.
