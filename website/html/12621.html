The '''European Union Public Licence''' ('''EUPL''') is a software licence that has been created and approved by the [[European Commission]]. It is a [[free software licence]].

Its first version 1.0 was approved on 9 January 2007.
Its latest version is version 1.1, which was approved by the [[European Commission]] on 9 January 2009. The licence is available in 22 official languages of the European Union. All linguistic versions have the same validity. The EUPL v 1.1 is OSI certified as from March 2009.

This licence was originally intended to be used for the distribution of software developed in the framework of the [[IDABC]] programme, although (given its generic scope) it is also suitable for use by any software developer. Its main goal is its focusing on being consistent with the copyright law in the 27 Member States of the European Union, while retaining compatibility with popular open-source software licences such as the [[GNU General Public License]]. The first IDABC software packages mentioned are [[CIRCA (software)|CIRCA]] groupware<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/6540 CIRCA groupware]</ref>, [[IPM (software)|IPM]]<ref>[http://www.ec.europa.eu/yourvoice/ipm/ipmoss_en.htm IPM technical architecture]</ref><ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/6541/5644 IPM EUPL]</ref> and the [[eLink]]<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/4171/5644 eLink]</ref> [[Government-to-government|G2G]], [[G2C]], [[Government-to-business|G2B]] specification software.
Since the launching (in October 2008) of the European Open Source Observatory and Repository (OSOR) <ref>[http://www.osor.eu]</ref>, a number of [[other software (software)|other software]]<ref>[https://forge.osor.eu/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=307]</ref>, mainly produced by European administrations, are licensed under the EUPL.

==Comparison to other open source/free software licences==

With [[license proliferation|licence proliferation]] a growing problem, the European Union justifies its licence as the first open source licence to be released by an international governing body. The European Union also wishes to dispel legal uncertainties, real or perceived, in respect of other open-source licences, such as the GNU General Public License, by creating a software licence which takes due account of European Union Law. A third goal of this licence is to create an open-source licence available into 22 official languages of the European Union, and is sure to conform to the existing copyright laws of each of the 27 Member States of the European Union. Lastly, to dispel fears of licence proliferation, the licence was developed with other open-source licences in mind and specifically authorizes covered works to be re-released under the following licences, when combined with their covered code<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Doc?id=27472 Study of the compatibility mechanism of the EUPL v.1.0]</ref>:

<!--Somebody before me asked a question, here: if the EU removes one of these approved licenses from the list in a later version of the EUPL, would that make existing projects, using code taken from an EUPL-covered work but using it as, say, GPL, instantly illegal? Answer: no. If code has been released under the GPL once, it's GPL forever. If later versions of the same code use a different license, the new code may not be GPL, but the old code still is, and the same principle applies to the dual-license scenarios and the EUPL's compatibility clause.-->
* [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) v. 2
* [[Open Software License]] (OSL) v. 2.1, v. 3.0
* [[Common Public License]] v. 1.0
* [[Eclipse Public License]] v. 1.0
* [[CeCILL]] v. 2.0

==Possible upgrade==
According to the EUPL v.1.1, the European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions of the EUPL, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. Future upgrades will not be applicable automatically when software was expressly released "under the EUPL v.1.1 only".
New provisions cover the [[Application service provider]] loophole of software distribution: Distribution and/or Communication (of software) includes providing on-line "access to its essential functionalities".
A possible issue that could use further thought is how the licence affects dynamic linking. This currently depends on national law. According to studies done prior to the approval of the EUPL, this is intentional: each case is left to appreciation.<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/7340/469 Future upgrade]</ref>.

==Member States policies==
As from 2010, EU Member States adopt or revise policies aimed to encourage - when appropriate - the open source distribution of public sector applications. The EUPL is formally mentioned in some of these policies:
