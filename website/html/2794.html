The '''Authentication'''  [[Open Service Interface Definition]] ('''OSID''') is an [[O.K.I.]] [[specification]] which supports invoking an [[authentication]] process. '''OSIDs''' are programmatic interfaces which comprise a [[Service Oriented Architecture]] for designing and building [[software reusability|reusable]] and [[interoperable]] [[software]].

The implementation of this service is responsible for gathering whatever information is appropriate to perform authentication. This service also supports testing if a user is authenticated, returning the [[Agent OSID|Agent]] identity that corresponds to the authenticated user.

The '''OSIDs''' can interact with information and resources over which some form of access control is required. Authentication, [[Agent OSID|Agent]], and [[Authorization OSID|Authorization]] work together where '''Authentication''' ensures interactions are at the request of an identified user and Authorization reports what the identified user can do.
