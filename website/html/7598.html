The '''Computerized Speech Lab''' ('''CSL''') is a speech and [[signal processing]] [[computer workstation]] ([[software]] and [[hardware]]) used for [[research]] and clinical [[speech therapy]].

CSL was developed by STR and Kay Elemetrics Corporation.  Their promotional literature claims that "CSL has achieved world-wide recognition for its flexibility, real-time analysis capabilities, ease of use, personalized user support and its broad range of analysis tools".

The individual speaks into a microphone, and the output is shown in a graphic formation on the electronic screen. This can help with correcting speech impediments, learning where and how to vocalize certain sounds, and which frequencies in certain sounds are beyond the normal range.

A different system, Babel was conceived to be matched with the Kay Elemetrics equipment, but the systems were never combined. See the Journal Calico: Vol 7, No. 3 (March 1990).
