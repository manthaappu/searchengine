'''TrueCookPlus''' is a microwave oven operating system developed and patented by Microwave Science JV LLC.

==How it Works==
TrueCookPlus utilizes short numeric codes to control cooking. After the user enters the code, the TrueCookPlus adjusts the cooking to conform to USDA FSIS food variables, including food type, weight, packaging geometry, starting state and static microwave oven variables such as wattage, cavity size, wall voltage, hot or cold oven state, elevation above sea level and standing time. TrueCookPlus manages all USDA FSIS food manufacturer mandated instruction variables, and cooks food to USDA mandated cooking temperatures.<ref>http://truecookplus.com/index.php?pg=faq#q2</ref>

During its initial test market phase [[Consumer Reports]] selected the TrueCookPlus equipped Kenmore model #6633 as its #1 Top Rated mid-sized countertop microwave oven and as a Best Buy.<ref>http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/appliances/kitchen-appliances/microwave-ovens/microwaves/overview/microwaves-ov.htm</ref>
