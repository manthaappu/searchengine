<html> <head> <title>AmBX</title></head><body>[[AmBX]] (officially stylized amBX) is an internationally [[patented]] technology (originally developed by a [[Philips]] research project which also produced their [[Ambilight]] technology) for controlling  incandescant and white/coloured [[LED]] lighting and other enabled devices. This allows lighting designers, end users and content providers (of videogames, films, music, programs and websites) to create and enjoy immersive experiences by the triggering of specially developed [[AmBX]] enabled devices.

The [[AmBX]] technology is now owned by a british company based in Redhill, [[amBX UK LTD]].

[[AmBX]] enabled devices deliver many effects; lighting, airflow, rumble and others. [[AmBX]] is a controlling technology that enables devices (via generic input, scripted scenes or embeded code) to synchronise with any game, sound and video content in real time. As well as LED lights, rumble kit and fans, other types of devices which have been prototyped include heat and water atomisers. The  events triggering effects can be layered and a 'rest' effect can also be generated when content is inactive.

The technology  works seamlessly with all legacy source content (incuding video and PC games). Content that has specially scripted [[AmBX]] code embeded can trigger a reaction to on screen video and audio output with any immersive/ambient device effects the designers require. 

[[AmBX]] has a proprietary professional hardware product (amBIENT XC) but allows other hardware manufacturers with a [[licensing agreement]] to create [[AmBX]] enabled hardware capable of delivering the [[AmBX]] experience.

[[AmBX]] technology (via the amBIENT XC) also  'talks' to lighting industry standard control interfaces and light sources via the [[DMX512]] control language.

[[AmBX]] technology is available for the home user, PCs and professional and commercial lighting (stage, shops, bars, restaurants, clubs, AV installations and offices). Game consoles, mobile phone apps, film and other entertainment media are also expected to follow.<ref>http://www.ambx.com/wiki/Main_Page</ref>

== How it works ==
'''Technology'''

[[AmBX]] code acts as a conversion middleware (sitting between source and output device) that takes generic or specificaly scripted (via [[AmBX]] SDK) input signals from video, audio, PC or media content, then outputs it to suitable harware such as LED lights, rumble boxes or similar devices via cable or wirless, subject to hardware.

'''Embedded code'''

For the full experience and to trigger specific events/effects, developers embed code (via free SDK dowload) into their applications to tell the devices what to do. Current developers and publishers using [[AmBX]] include [[Ubisoft]], [[THQ]], [[Codemasters]], [[Gamecock]], [[Gearbox Software]], [[Introversion Software]]<ref>http://www.gamezone.com/news/item/introversion_announces_ambx_version_of_defcon/</ref> and [[Spark Unlimited|Spark]]. [[AmBX]] licenses the technology to content providers for free. [[AmBX]] technology works with generic content of any age.

The latest [[AmBX]]-enabled games include ''[[Far Cry 2]]'', ''[[Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway]]'', ''[[Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X.]]'', ''[[Multiwinia]]'', ''[[Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising]]'', and ''[[Legendary (video game)|Legendary]]''.

'''Legacy and non-enabled games'''

The [[AmBX]] FXGen is a piece of software that forms part of the standard software install that analyses on-screen events and triggers the AmBX peripherals to generate effects. For games [[AmBX]] isn't embedded in, such as ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', ''[[Call of Duty]]'', ''[[Crysis]]'', ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'', the AmBX software team provide constant updates (currently FOC), allowing  these games to work in a hybrid fashion, creating effects that sit somewhere between generic and fully [[AmBX]] scripted ones, meaning there is a large amount of [[AmBX]] enhanced gameplay available (including popular online games).

'''Films and Music'''

When using the current Philips AmBX enabled PC Gaming peripherals (or Mad Catz gaming lights) to watch films and music [[AmBX]] generates immersive lighting effects when viewing popular media players. These include [[iTunes]], [[Quick Time]], [[VLC media player]], [[Media Player Classic]], and [[Winamp]]. Different presets are available: Moderate, Colour, Relaxed and Dynamic.

'''PC usage'''

In October 2008 [[AmBX UK LTD]] announced a new application called [[AmBX]] Creator which for the first time allows [[AmBX]] users to create their own effects and tag them to events on the PC e.g. multicoloured light shows when you get emails.<ref>http://www.ambx.com/site/consumer/games/applications/creator</ref>

'''Research and Development'''

[[AmBX]] is being trialled and developed for a variety of diverse applications including wireless alerts for the hard of hearing, possible treatments for seasonally affected depression, jet lag and other media, educational and healthcare applications.

Currently the amBIENT XC controls a single DMX universe, recent trialls (2011 and ongoing) have increased this to three, with further improvements likely. In the medium term the technology could output (reflect/mimic) video in enhanced definition.

==Equipment and product==


[[AmBX]] technology is now available for the professional and the consumer markets in three formats, PC peripherals, discontinued [[Philips]] Kits and [[Mad Catz]] Cyborg PC Gaming Lights (January 2011 launch at [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]]), [[AmBX]] amBIENT XC professional controller box and as a freely downloadable SDK from the [[AmBX]] website.

'''Professional'''

amBIENT XC is [[AmBX]]'s professional lighting control unit (from 2010) that is used for architectural, stage, commercial and events applications and also for high end AV installations.

'''Consumer'''

[[Mad Catz]] have incorporated the technology into their latest pro gaming Cyborg brand via [[AmBX]] enabled PC gaming lights (available 2011) and an [[AmBX]] enabled gaming PC keyboard (available 2011).

[[AmBX]] technology allows multiple hardware installations, i.e. more than one set of lights, the software automatically knows its hardware extensions and controls accordingly, more light sets, more/better immersive effects.


'''Legacy'''

[[Philips]] produced the first commercially available [[AmBX]] enabled consumer equipment in 2007. Available in basic or advanced forms which included [[LED]] and speaker units, LED wall washers and fan and rumble devices.

The table shows the configuration of the original (discontinued, but still available) Philips gaming kits (large installed user base). These kits come with speakers integrated into each satellite light.

Although each [[wallwasher]] (rear lights) supports a maximum of two satellite lights, two fans, and one rumble pad, several kits may be used on a single PC to create a larger setup. Wallwashers may be used independently of all other devices, but are required for all AmBX applications via [[Philips]] kits.
