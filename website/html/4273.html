'''BookmarkSync''' is an automatic synchronization service that allows users to access their bookmarks or favorites from any [[computer]] or any [[web browser]]. The BookmarkSync client runs as a small [[computer program|program]] within the computer's [[system tray]] and monitors the bookmarks in the user's browser, automatically uploading any changes to a central server. This allows one to keep browsers across separate computers synchronized. [[Cross-platform]] [[synchronization]] is possible by using the [[Mac OS X]] client.

==History==
SyncIT.com Inc. was founded by Michael Berneis and Terence Way in November 1998 and the site went live in March 1999.  At its peak, SyncIT.com grew to a community of over 350,000 users synchronizing their bookmarks and favorites using their BookmarkSync product. After a server failure in September 2003, the entire project was [[open source]]d.  The rights for SyncIT.com was taken over by Jack Dean who runs Sync2It.com, SyncIT.com and BookmarkSync.com He has developed a new client for latest browsers including FireFox and Mac platform, and works to continue this service.

==Features==
The BookmarkSync client software enables [[social bookmarking]] and bookmark [[data clustering]].  The user data input requirements of web-based systems that incorporate [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]] to build a [[folksonomy]] are eliminated by the automated bookmarksync client software. [http://www.sync2it.com/search Sync2It.com] has added bookmark clustering and user bookmark ratios to their search results.

Recent enhancements to the BookmarkSync client software include support for Unicode, fast search and locate, local backup and restore functions, local site validation, social bookmark browsing and multiple language support (German, French, Danish, Dutch, Czech and Spanish).

The BookmarkSync service is free.
