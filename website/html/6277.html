A '''circuit ID''' is a company specific identifier assigned to a data or voice network between two locations.  This circuit is then leased to a customer by that id.  If and when a subscriber has an issue with a circuit, the subscriber contacts the telecommunications provider to provide this circuit id for action on the designated circuit.

== Telecom Circuit ID Formats ==
The [[Local Exchange Carrier|LEC]] circuit ID's are based on Telcordia's Common Language Coding. At one time, the abbreviations were meaningful (i.e., HC for hi - capacity) but the complexity of the business no longer allows for it.

XX/YYYY/000000/111/CC/SEG
prefix/service code - service code modifier/serial #/suffix/company identifier/segment name

* Prefix, set by administration areas for each company. They may or may not be based on [[Local access and transport area|LATA]]
* Service code, the type of service this circuit is providing
* Service code modifier, modifies the service code, often used for different billing options.
* Serial number, 6 digit numeric identifier
* Suffix, if a service has multiple legs or drops this will further identify the location.
* Company identifier, identifies the controlling LEC.
* Segment, the drop NAME for a multi - point circuit.

Example:
*73/HCGS/123456/000/NE is a T1 Circuit by New England Telephone
*44/AQDU/987654/000/G4 is a HDSL Circuit by G4 Telecom
