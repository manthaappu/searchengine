'''Rawstudio''' is a stand-alone application, using the [[GTK+]] UI toolkit, to read and manipulate images in [[Raw image format]]s from digital cameras. It is designed for working rapidly with a large volume of images, unlike similar tools, such as [[UFRaw]], which are designed to work on one image at a time.

Rawstudio is currently at a very early stage of development and currently only the latest revision supports [[demosaicing]].

Rawstudio reads RAW images using [[DCRaw]] and supports [[color management]] using [[LittleCMS]] to allow the user to apply color profiles (see also [[Linux color management]]).

Rawstudio supports virtually every variety of RAW format from all digital camera manufacturers, thanks to the extensive camera support of DCRaw.
