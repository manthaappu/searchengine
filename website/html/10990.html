'''Dos Navigator''' is a [[free software|free]] [[orthodox file manager]] for [[DOS]] and Windows.

== Influence of Dos Navigator ==
Dos Navigator is an influential early implementation of [[Orthodox File Manager]] (OFM). By implementing three additional types of [[Virtual file system]] (VFS): Xtree, Briefcase and List-based, DN opened a new generation of OFMs. Also unlimited number of panels and a lot of new important features make it one of the most powerful (and complex) OFMs.<ref name="DNOFM">{{cite web |url=http://www.softpanorama.org/OFM/Paradigm/Ch03/dos_navigator.shtml |title=DN line -- a breakthrough in VFS |publisher=Softpanorama University |authorlink=Dr Nikolai Bezroukov}}</ref>

== History ==
The initial version of DN I (v 0.90) was released in 1991, and written by Stefan Tanurkov, Andrew Zabolotny and Sergey Melnik (all from [[Chişinău]], [[Moldova]]). After that, DN was rewritten using [[Turbo Vision]] by Stefan Tanurkov and Dmitry Dotsenko (Dmitry developed DN at [[Moscow State University]]).  These versions are sometimes referred as DN II.  

In 1993, Slava Filimonov invited Stefan to join [[RitLabs]] (formerly RIT S.R.L) in order to continue producing and publishing DN with joint efforts. Slava also contributed programming new components, design and made countless optimizations and improvements. He wrote a new software key protection system which remained unbreakable for almost four years after its introduction.<ref>[http://www.woodmann.com/fravia/fp_dosna.htm DN as a nice example of DOS cracking]</ref>

DN II was actively developed until the beginning of 1995 (until version 1.35 which should be considered as a [http://www.softpanorama.org/OFM/Paradigm/Ch03/dos_navigator.shtml milestone in the OFM implementations]).  Several other programmers participated in the development after version 1.35. Starting from version 1.37, Slava Filimonov and Ilya Bagdasarov were in charge of bug-fixing.  Slava and Ilya Bagdasarov solely maintained, developed and released versions 1.37 through 1.39. After they left, DN was maintained again by Stefan and newly acquired developer - Maxim Masiutin.

In 1998, the development mostly took a bug-fixing direction as RITlabs' new product [[The Bat!]] became a more promising software product with much better commercial potential.

The latest shareware version was 1.50. Then, in late 1999,  [[RitLabs]] decided to make version 1.51 of the Dos Navigator completely free with freely available source code.

== Life after Dos Navigator ==
[http://zap.eltrast.ru/ Andrew Zabolotny] currently works for a company in Russia. He also contributed to several open source projects, including [[Crystal Space]].

Stefan Tanurkov and Maxim Masiutin are still employed at [http://www.ritlabs.com RitLabs], developing [[The Bat!]] 

[http://research.microsoft.com/~melnik Sergey Melnik] joined Microsoft Research, Redmond.

In 1998, Slava Filimonov wrote another file manager [http://www-eng.mrp.cz/nav.htm windows] for [[MRP Informatics]], a company in [[Czech Republic]]. This project is discontinued now. 

Other groups still release software based on the DN open source code, including new features such as support for [[Filename|long file names]], and support for [[Linux]].
