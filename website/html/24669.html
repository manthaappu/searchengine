The term '''minimum distance''' is used in several ways:

* In [[geometry]], the minimum distance of a collection of points ''P'' in a space is the smallest distance between any two points of the space.
* In [[coding theory]],  minimum distance is defined as the smallest distance between distinct codewords (often measured by [[Hamming distance]]). The minimum distance of a code gives a measure of how good it is at detecting and correcting errors, since a code with minimum distance <math>d</math> can detect up to <math>d - 1</math> errors or correct up to <math>\lfloor(d-1)/2 \rfloor</math> errors in any codeword. Here the term ''minimum distance'' is typically used in reference to [[Linear code|linear error-correcting codes]].

== Calculation ==
=== Geometry ===
* In the real plane, points ''P'' corresponding to all integer points (''i'', ''j'') have a minimum distance of 1.
* In two dimensional geometry, the minimum distance between two points can be found using the [[Pythagorean theorem]].

=== Coding Theory ===
In coding theory minimum distance is often calculated using the [[Hamming distance]] of two codewords. It can also be calculated in other ways. For example, the minimum distance of a linear code can be calculated by finding the smallest number of [[linearly dependent]] columns in its [[parity check matrix]].
