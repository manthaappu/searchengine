{{Other uses|Chop (disambiguation)}}
A '''chop''' is a signature or identifying mark made by a furniture or cabinet maker to identify his work.  In the 18th and 19th centuries, [[cabinet maker]]s (sic) [[furniture]] makers were allowed to use their own individual chop to identify their work only when they had qualified as a Master Cabinetmaker.  This practice originated from the Chinese tradition of [[seal (Chinese)|seal]]s called "chops" and was introduced to Europe in the middle ages.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  A chop was normally created by a mallet and chisel, creating a unique design.  In some cases, fathers would pass the chop to their sons, and the son would then add a slight modification to indicate which generation created the piece. 

The act of striking the chisel with the mallet or chopping is the root of the term.
