In [[learning]], '''implicit repetition''' is unintentional repetition. For example, an [[explicit repetition]] is when we review the material before an exam. An implicit repetition is when we suddenly recall some fact on the way to school. We remember our name or events from childhood via implicit repetition. This means we do not need to explicitly sit down to a textbook and review those events to be sure they do not get forgotten. Unfortunately, implicit repetition cannot be used to ensure we do not forget things we learn at school. This is why explicit review of material is needed.
