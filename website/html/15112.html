==History==

When GIS first became widely available in the 1980s and 1990s, the only source of geographic data for China was paper maps.  Several universities elected to undertake the huge task of [[digitizing]] this information so that other researchers could use it.  

The two earliest projects were conducted by The Australian Consortium for the Asian Spatial Information and Analysis Network ([http://www.asian.gu.edu.au ACASIAN]) at [[Griffith University]]  and the [http://chinadatacenter.org China Data Center] at the [[University of Michigan at Ann Arbor]].  ACASIAN specialized solely in spatial coverages while the China Data Center included GIS coverages as a supplemented to their primary mission of providing Chinese statistical and census data.

There is a great deal of high quality GIS data being produced in China by both government organizations and private companies. Today, China's National Spatial Data Infrastructure Project, uses the  [[WGS84]] standard.

==Geographic Names Information System==
China in the early 1980s began studies for the establishment of its [[Geographic Names Information System]] (地名信息系统), Geographic Names Information System Research Laboratory and the establishment of the National Atlas of geographical names database research.

== Education==
The [[China Association for Geographic Information System]] ([http://www.cagis.org.cn/] 中国地理信息系统协会), [[Peking University]] and other institutes jointly sponsored the first "Innovation and Development, 2006 College GIS Forum",  in [[Beijing]]. More than 300 experts and scholars attended the forum. Sessions involved China's geographic information system (GIS) research in multi-disciplinary fields, personnel training, and technology. China has now more than 500 institutions of higher learning training GIS-related professionals, of which more than 200 universities and colleges have established a GIS lab.<ref>http://www.cdst.gov.cn/ReadNews.asp?NewsID=4969</ref>

==Industry==

The GIS industry in China is worth 400 billion yuan per annum as of November 2007.<ref>http://www.asmmag.com/news/gis-in-china</ref> More than 300,000 people were involved in either building or using these systems, according to SuperMap president Zhong Ershun, who is also the deputy president of the China Association for Geographic Information System. SuperMap is the largest vendor of GIS in China. Almost 20,000 enterprises are estimated to have engaged in the industry. Around 2000 of these have GIS as a core discipline or function. The industry's rapid expansion is attributed to the country's [[economic development]], which has led to an increase in capital input, from both government and businesses. Between 2001 and 2005 the [[Ministry of Information Industry]] allocated more than 20 million yuan to fund the development and application of GIS. GIS has been put to use in many spheres, including [[Topographic surveying and mapping|land survey]], [[mineral exploitation]], [[water conservancy]] and [[environmental protection]]. It also has applications in [[power generation]], [[map]]ping, [[telecommunication]], and the [[management]] of [[public administration]] and [[public services]].

==Notable persons==

[http://www.lreis.ac.cn/eng/lreis_ry/chensp.htm Prof. Chen Shupeng], born in 1920, is considered the founding father of Remote Sensing and GIS  in China, died on 25 November 2008.[http://www.digitalearth-isde.org/news/539.html] Chen started the [http://www.lreis.ac.cn/eng/index.htm State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System] (LREIS) in 1987.
