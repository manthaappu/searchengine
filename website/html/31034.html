<html> <head> <title>ROHR2 (analysis software)</title></head><body>'''ROHR2''' is a Static and Dynamic Pipe stress analysis software, running on PCs under Microsoft Windows.
The software is a product of SIGMA Ingenieurgesellschaft mbH, [[Unna]], Germany.
The basis of the brand name is the German word "Rohr" (pronounce it like “ROAR“) which means „Pipe“.

ROHR2 offers the whole variety of stress codes, demanded by the daily work of the pipe stress engineer, such as ASME B31.1, B31.3, B31.4, B31.5, B31.8, EN 13480, several GRP pipe codes and nuclear stress codes ASME Cl. 1-3, KTA 3201.2, KTA 3211.2.

==Calculation basics and Software environment==
The static analysis includes the calculation of any loads and load combinations according to the theories of first - and second order for linear and non-linear boundary conditions (friction, support lift).
All loads can also be applied as dynamic loads with harmonic excitation.
Furthermore, the dynamic analysis includes the calculation of eigenvalues and mode shapes as well as their processing in various modal response methods for the analysis of, for example, earthquakes and fluid hammer.
An efficient superposition module enables a manifold selection and combination of static and dynamic results.

The ROHR2 program system offers a complete software environment, consisting of ROHR2win, the graphical user interface, the ROHR2 calculation core and various additional programs like ROHR2ISO for Isometric representation, ROHR2FEM (FE-Analysis of selected pipe components) or ROHR2STOSS - Structural Analysis with Dynamic Loads using Direct Integration

==History==
ROHR2 was created in the late 60s by one of the leading computer think tanks in in Germany, [[mbp]] in [[Dortmund]], which later on was taken over by EDS ([[Electronic Data Systems]]) group. In the late 80s the ROHR2 developer and support team moved over to SIGMA company in Dortmund 
From the year 2000 on, the complete licensing and sales activities are in the hands of SIGMA. SIGMA Ingenieurgesellschaft mbH  is an engineering company basing on pipe engineering as well as software development.

Under management of SIGMA the ROHR2 program system became the leading European pipe stress solution, offering a large number of interfaces for the transfer of data from and to CAD and CAE-world, as there are [[Plant Design Management System|PDMS]], CADISON, PDS, [[Bentley Systems|Bentley System]]'s AutoPLANT and PCF/ISOGEN supported software. The integration of ROHR2 into the users workflow is additionally supported by third-party interface products.
