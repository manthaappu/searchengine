'''Kinectimals''' is a video game for the [[Xbox 360]] that uses [[Kinect]]. In Kinectimals players can interact with virtual animals in a manner akin to pets, gameplay includes activities such as teaching tricks to the animal, guiding the animal around an obstacle course, and free-form play.

The video game is aimed at a young audience, particularly children, and includes five different virtual animals all based on wild cats. Kinectimals was developed by [[Frontier Developments]] and was a launch title for Kinect.

Kinectimals has received mostly positive reviews. Video game talk show ''[[Good Game]]'''s two presenters gave the game a 7 and 7.5 out of 10 saying how it was quite fun and that your animal would give instant feedback as well most younger gamers would love playing it. Intially they said "It has a lot more life, energy and fun to it than something like ''[[EyePet]]'' - there's a lot of sparkle, but I was okay with that."<ref>{{cite episode|title=Kinect Round Up Review|credits=Bendixsen 6.5/10, O'Donnell 6/10|network=[[ABC Television]]|airdate=29 November 2010|season=5|number=42|transcripturl=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/stories/s3079641.htm}}</ref>
