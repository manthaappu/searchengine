<html> <head> <title>Higher-order programming</title></head><body>'''Higher-order programming''' is a style of [[computer programming]] that exploits the theoretical ability to use functions as values. It is usually instantiated with, or borrowed from, models of computation like the [[lambda calculus]] which make heavy use of [[higher-order function]]s.

For example, in higher-order programming, one can pass [[function (programming)|functions]] as arguments to other functions and functions can be the return value of other functions (such as in [[macro (computer science)|macros]] or for [[interpreter (computing)|interpreting]]). This style of programming is mostly used in [[functional programming]], but it can also be very useful in 'regular' [[object-oriented programming]].

Prominent examples of languages supporting this are [[C (programming language)|C]] (via function pointers), [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] (via lambda expressions), [[ECMAScript]] ([[ActionScript]], [[JavaScript]]), [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] ([[Common Lisp]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], others), [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]], [[Oz (programming language)|Oz]], [[Perl (programming language)| Perl]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Smalltalk]].
