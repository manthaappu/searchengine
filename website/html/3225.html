'''Backblaze''' is an [[Remote backup service|online backup tool]] that allows [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]] users to [[backup|back up]] their data to an offsite [[data center]]. The service is designed for [[end-user]]s, for unlimited space<ref>[http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080602-hands-on-and-interview-with-backblaze-off-site-backup.html Review by Ars Technica - Making off-site backups brainless: hands-on with Backblaze]</ref>.  It allows the user to back up data continuously, manually, when the computer is idle, or on an hourly schedule.  The service makes use of [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES encryption]] for security, and uses [[data compression]] and [[bandwidth throttling]] to reduce upload and download times.  Files that need to be restored can be delivered in the form of a digital download, a Western Digital [[Usb|USB]] drive (400GB), or a [[Dvd|DVD]] (4.2 GB).<ref>[http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/02/backblaze-online-backup-with-time-machines-finesse/ Review by TechCrunch - Backblaze: Online Backup With Time Machineâ€™s Finesse]</ref>.
