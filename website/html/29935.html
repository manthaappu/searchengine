'''PRIMOU''' is an enhancement of the '''PRIMO''' software program developed at the Genome Center at [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas]] to choose [[primer (molecular biology)|primers]] and to calculate their annealing temperature according to the base stacking method. It has been modified by the [[University of Oklahoma]] to fix [[memory leak]]s and handle multi-megabase projects. It is currently maintained by Bruce Roe, and Steve Kenton at the [[University of Oklahoma]].
