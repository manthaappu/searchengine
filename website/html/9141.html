'''Daisy chain''' is a term used variously in [[information technology]]. Its meaning differs according to  technology domain, although each preserves the traditional meaning of connecting like items to each other in a series or chain.

== Computer software ==
A daisy chain software [[installation (computer programs)|installation]] can continue in piecemeal fashion. This is of particular use with downloaded software. If the connection to the download server is lost during the installation process, daisy chaining allows installation to restart from where it stopped. [[Google Pack]] provides this capability.

== Computer hardware ==
Some hardware can be attached to a computing system in a daisy chain configuration by connecting each component to another similar component, rather than directly to the computing system that uses the component. Only the last component in the chain directly connects to the computing system. For example chaining multiple components that each have a [[UART]] port to each other. The components must also behave cooperatively. e.g., only one seizes the communications bus at a time. [[SCSI]] and [[Firewire]] devices can also be daisy chained.

== Network topology ==
See [[Network topology#Daisy chains|Network Topology]].

== System access ==
Users can daisy chain computing sessions together. Using services such as [[telnet]] or  [[Secure Shell|SSH]], the user creates a session on a second computer via telnet, and from the second session, telnets to a third and so on. Another typical example is the "terminal session inside a terminal session" using [[Remote Desktop Protocol|RDP]]. Reasons to create daisy chains include connecting to a system on a non-routed network via a gateway system, preserving sessions on the initial computer while working on a second computer, to save bandwidth or improve connectivity on an unstable network by first connecting to a better connected machine. A less wholesome purpose is camouflaging activity while engaged in [[cybercrime]].
