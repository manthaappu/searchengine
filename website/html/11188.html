A '''duplexer''' is a device that allows bi-directional ([[duplex (telecommunications)|duplex]]) communication over a single channel.

In [[radar]] and radio communications systems, it isolates the [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] from the [[transmitter]] while permitting them to share a common [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]].   Most [[radio repeater]] systems include a duplexer.

''Note 1:''  A duplexer must be designed for operation in the [[frequency]] [[band (radio)|band]] used by the receiver and transmitter, and must be capable of handling the [[output]] [[Power (physics)|power]] of the transmitter. 

''Note 2:''  A duplexer must provide adequate rejection of transmitter [[noise]] occurring at the receive frequency, and must be designed to operate at, or less than, the frequency separation between the transmitter and receiver. 

''Note 3:''  A duplexer must provide sufficient isolation to prevent receiver desensitization.
