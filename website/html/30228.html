<html> <head> <title>Programming language reference</title></head><body>A '''programming language reference''' (or '''language reference manual''') is an artifact that describes a [[programming language]] so that [[user (computing)|user]]s and [[programmer|developer]]s can understand the basic elements of and write [[computer program]]s in the target language.

A programming language reference manual is one form of [[documentation]] that is associated with most mainstream programming languages. A reference manual is ordinarily separate and distinct from a [[programming language specification]], which is usually more detailed and intended for use by [[Programming language implementation|implementor]]s of the language itself, rather than those who simply use the language to accomplish some processing task.
