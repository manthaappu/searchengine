In [[computer science]] and [[information science]], an '''ontology''' is a formal representation of knowledge as a set of concepts within a [[Domain of discourse|domain]], and the relationships between those concepts.  It is used to [[Reasoning|reason]] about the entities within that domain, and may be used to describe the domain.

In theory, an ontology is a "formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualisation".<ref name="TRG93">T. Gruber (1993). [http://tomgruber.org/writing/ontolingua-kaj-1993.pdf "A translation approach to portable ontology specifications"]. In: ''Knowledge Acquisition''. 5: 199-220.</ref> An ontology provides a shared vocabulary, which can be used to model a domain &mdash; that is, the type of objects and/or concepts that exist, and their properties and relations.<ref>F. Arvidsson and A. Flycht-Eriksson. [http://www.ida.liu.se/~janma/SemWeb/Slides/ontologies1.pdf Ontologies I]. Retrieved 26 November 2008.</ref>. 

Ontologies are the structural frameworks for organizing information and are used in [[artificial intelligence]], the [[Semantic Web]], [[systems engineering]], [[software engineering]], [[biomedical informatics]], [[library science]], [[enterprise bookmarking]], and [[information architecture]] as a form of [[knowledge representation]] about the world or some part of it. The creation of domain ontologies is also fundamental to the definition and use of an [[enterprise architecture framework]].

==Overview==
The term ''[[ontology]]'' has its origin in [[philosophy]], and has been applied in many different ways. The word "ontology" comes from the Greek Ον (on), which literally means entity. The core meaning within [[computer science]] is a model for describing the world that consists of a set of types, properties, and relationship types. Exactly what is provided around these varies, but they are the essentials of an ontology. There is also generally an expectation that there be a close resemblance between the real world and the features of the model in an ontology.<ref>L. M. Garshol (2004). [http://www.ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tm-vs-thesauri.html#N773 ''Metadata? Thesauri? Taxonomies? Topic Maps! Making sense of it all''] on www.ontopia.net. Retrieved 13 October 2008.</ref>

What ontology has in common in both computer science and in philosophy is the representation of entities, ideas, and events, along with their properties and relations, according to a system of categories. In both fields, one finds considerable work on problems of ontological relativity (e.g., [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]] and [[Saul Kripke|Kripke]] in philosophy, [[John F. Sowa|Sowa]] and [[Nicola Guarino|Guarino]] in computer science),<ref>J. F. Sowa. Top-level ontological categories. In ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'', 43 (November/December), 1995, pp. 669-85.</ref> and debates concerning whether a [[normative]] ontology is viable (e.g., debates over [[foundationalism]] in philosophy, debates over the [[Cyc]] project in AI). Differences between the two are largely matters of focus. Philosophers are less concerned with establishing fixed, controlled vocabularies than are researchers in computer science, while computer scientists are less involved in discussions of first principles (such as debating whether there are such things as [[fixed essences]], or whether entities must be ontologically more primary than processes).

==History==
Historically, ontologies arise out of the branch of [[philosophy]] known as [[metaphysics]], which deals with the nature of reality – of what exists. This fundamental branch is concerned with analyzing various types or modes of existence, often with special attention to the relations between [[particular]]s and [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]], between [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic and extrinsic properties]], and between [[essence]] and [[existence]]. The traditional goal of ontological inquiry in particular is to divide the world "at its joints", to discover those fundamental categories, or kinds, into which the world’s objects naturally fall.<ref name="PCB94">P. C. Benjamin et al. (1994). [http://www.idef.com/pdf/Idef5.pdf ''IDEF5 Method Report'']. Knowledge Based Systems, Inc.</ref>

During the second half of the 20th century, philosophers extensively debated the possible methods or approaches to building ontologies, without actually ''building'' any very elaborate ontologies themselves. By contrast, computer scientists were building some large and robust ontologies (such as [[WordNet]] and [[Cyc]]) with comparatively little debate over ''how'' they were built.

Since the mid-1970s, researchers in the field of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) have recognized that capturing knowledge is the key to building large and powerful AI systems.  AI researchers argued that they could create new ontologies as [[computational model]]s that enable certain kinds of [[automated reasoning]]. In the 1980s, the AI community began to use the term ''ontology'' to refer to both a theory of a modeled world and a component of knowledge systems. Some researchers, drawing inspiration from philosophical ontologies, viewed computational ontology as a kind of applied philosophy.<ref name ="TG08">T. Gruber (2008). [http://tomgruber.org/writing/ontology-definition-2007.htm "Ontology"]. In the ''Encyclopedia of Database Systems'', Ling Liu and M. Tamer Özsu (Eds.), Springer-Verlag, 2008.</ref>

In the early 1990s, the widely cited Web page and paper "Toward Principles for the Design of Ontologies Used for Knowledge Sharing" by [[Tom Gruber]]<ref name="TRG95">T. Gruber, "Toward Principles for the Design of Ontologies Used for Knowledge Sharing". In: ''International Journal Human-Computer Studies'', 43(5-6):907-928, 1995</ref> is credited with a deliberate definition of ''ontology'' as a technical term in [[computer science]]. Gruber "introduced the term to mean a specification of a conceptualization. That is "an ontology is a description (like a formal specification of a program) of the concepts and relationships that can exist for an agent or a community of agents. This definition is consistent with the usage of ontology as set of concept definitions, but more general. And it is a different sense of the word than its use in philosophy".<ref name="TRG01">T. Gruber (2001) . [http://www-ksl.stanford.edu/kst/what-is-an-ontology.html What is an Ontology?]. Online entry. Accessed Nov 9, 2009.</ref>

According to Gruber (1993) "ontologies are often equated with taxonomic hierarchies of classes, class definitions, and the subsumption relation, but ontologies need not be limited to these forms. Ontologies are also not limited to conservative definitions – that is, definitions in the traditional logic sense that only introduce terminology and do not add any knowledge about the world.<ref>H. B. Enderton (1972). ''A Mathematical Introduction to Logic''. San Diego, CA: Academic Press.</ref> To specify a conceptualization, one needs to state axioms that do constrain the possible interpretations for the defined terms.<ref name="TRG93"/>

In the early years of the 21st century, the interdisciplinary project of [[cognitive science]] has been bringing the two circles of scholars closer together{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. For example, there is talk of a "computational turn in philosophy" that includes philosophers analyzing the formal ontologies of computer science (sometimes even working directly with the software), while researchers in computer science have been making more references to those philosophers who work on ontology (sometimes with direct consequences for their methods).  Still, many scholars in both fields are uninvolved in this trend of cognitive science, and continue to work independently of one another, pursuing separately their different concerns.

==Ontology components==
{{Main|Ontology components}}
Contemporary ontologies share many structural similarities, regardless of the language in which they are expressed.  As mentioned above, most ontologies describe individuals (instances), classes (concepts), attributes, and relations.  In this section each of these components is discussed in turn.

Common components of ontologies include:
* Individuals: instances or objects (the basic or "ground level" objects)
* [[Class (set theory)|Class]]es<!-- This deliberately links to the disambiguation page -->: [[Class (set theory)|set]]s, collections, concepts, [[Class (computer science)|classes in programming]], [[Class (philosophy)|types of objects]], or kinds of things.
* [[Attribute (computing)|Attribute]]s: aspects, properties, features, characteristics, or parameters that objects (and classes) can have
* [[Relation (mathematics)|Relations]]: ways in which classes and individuals can be related to one another
* Function terms: complex structures formed from certain relations that can be used in place of an individual term in a statement
* Restrictions: formally stated descriptions of what  must be true in order for some assertion to be accepted as input
* Rules: statements in the form of an if-then (antecedent-consequent) sentence that describe the logical inferences that can be drawn from an assertion in a particular form
* Axioms: assertions (including rules) in a [[logical form]] that together comprise the overall theory that the ontology describes in its domain of application.  This definition differs from that of "axioms" in [[generative grammar]] and [[formal logic]].  In those disciplines, axioms include only statements asserted as ''a priori'' knowledge.  As used here, "axioms" also include the theory derived from axiomatic statements.
* [[Event (philosophy)|Events]]: <!-- this links  to the philosophy sense of 'Events' as that is currently the only article describing the issues around defining events in the ontology community--> the changing of attributes or relations
Ontologies are commonly encoded using [[ontology language]]s.

==Domain ontologies and upper ontologies==
A domain ontology (or domain-specific ontology) models a specific domain, or part of the world. It represents the particular meanings of terms as they apply to that domain. For example the word ''[[:wikt:card|card]]'' has many different meanings. An ontology about the domain of [[poker]] would model the "[[playing card]]" meaning of the word, while an ontology about the domain of [[computer hardware]] would model the "[[punched card]]" and "[[video card]]" meanings.

An [[Upper ontology (computer science)|upper ontology]] (or foundation ontology) is a model of the common objects that are generally applicable across a wide range of domain ontologies. It employs a [[core glossary]] that contains, the terms, and associated object descriptions, as they are used in various, relevant domain sets. There are several standardized upper ontologies available for use, including [[Dublin Core]], [[General Formal Ontology|GFO]], [[Cyc#OpenCyc|OpenCyc]]/[[Cyc#ResearchCyc|ResearchCyc]], [[Suggested Upper Merged Ontology|SUMO]], and [http://www.loa-cnr.it/DOLCE.html DOLCE]. [[WordNet]], while considered an upper ontology by some, is not strictly an ontology. However, it has been employed as a linguistic tool for learning domain ontologies.<ref>R. Navigli, P. Velardi (2004). [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/089120104323093276 "Learning Domain Ontologies from Document Warehouses and Dedicated Web Sites"], Computational Linguistics, 30(2), MIT Press, pp. 151-179.</ref>

The [[Gellish]] ontology is an example of a combination of an upper and a domain ontology.

Since domain ontologies represent concepts in very specific and often eclectic ways, they are often incompatible. As systems that rely on domain ontologies expand, they often need to merge domain ontologies into a more general representation.  This presents a challenge to the ontology designer. Different ontologies in the same domain can also arise due to different perceptions of the domain based on cultural background, education, ideology, or because a different representation language was chosen.

At present, merging ontologies that are not developed from a common foundation ontology is a largely manual process and therefore time-consuming and expensive. Domain ontologies that use the same foundation ontology to provide a set of basic elements with which to specify the meanings of the domain ontology elements can be merged automatically. There are studies on generalized techniques for merging ontologies{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}, but this area of research is still largely theoretical.

==Ontology engineering==
{{Main|Ontology engineering}}
[[Ontology engineering]] (or ontology building) is a subfield of [[knowledge engineering]] that studies the methods and methodologies for building ontologies. It studies the ontology development process, the ontology life cycle, the methods and methodologies for building ontologies, and the tool suites and languages that support them.<ref name="PFC04">A. Gómez-Pérez, M. Fernández-López, O. Corcho (2004). ''Ontological Engineering: With Examples from the Areas of Knowledge Management, E-commerce and the Semantic Web''. Springer, 2004.</ref><ref name="DMN">A. De Nicola, M. Missikoff, R. Navigli (2009). [http://www.dsi.uniroma1.it/~navigli/pubs/De_Nicola_Missikoff_Navigli_2009.pdf "A Software Engineering Approach to Ontology Building"]. Information Systems, 34(2), Elsevier, 2009, pp. 258-275.</ref>

Ontology engineering aims to make explicit the knowledge contained within software applications, and within enterprises and business procedures for a particular domain. Ontology engineering offers a direction towards solving the interoperability problems brought about by semantic obstacles, such as the obstacles related to the definitions of business terms and software classes. Ontology engineering is a set of tasks related to the development of ontologies for a particular domain.<ref name="PIS00">L. Pouchard, N. Ivezic and C. Schlenoff (2000).

==Ontology languages==
{{Main|Ontology language}}
An [[ontology language]] is a [[formal language]] used to encode the ontology. There are a number of such languages for ontologies, both proprietary and standards-based:
* [[Common Algebraic Specification Language]] is a general logic-based specification language developed within the IFIP working group 1.3 "Foundations of System Specifications" and functions as a de facto standard in the area of software specifications. It is now being applied to ontology specifications in order to provide modularity and structuring mechanisms.
* [[Common logic]] is ISO standard 24707, a specification for a family of ontology languages that can be accurately translated into each other.
* The [[Cyc]] project has its own ontology language called [[CycL]], based on [[first-order predicate calculus]] with some higher-order extensions.
* [[DOGMA]] (Developing Ontology-Grounded Methods and Applications) adopts the fact-oriented modeling approach to provide a higher level of semantic stability.
* The [[Gellish]] language includes rules for its own extension and thus integrates an ontology with an ontology language.
* [[IDEF5]] is a [[software engineering]] method to develop and maintain usable, accurate, domain ontologies.
* [[KIF]] is a syntax for [[first-order logic]] that is based on [[S-expression]]s.
* [[Rule Interchange Format]] (RIF) and [[F-Logic]] combine ontologies and rules.
* [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] is a language for making ontological statements, developed as a follow-on from [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] and [[RDFS]], as well as earlier ontology language projects including [[Ontology Inference Layer|OIL]], [[DARPA Agent Markup Language|DAML]] and [[DAMLplusOIL|DAML+OIL]]. OWL is intended to be used over the [[World Wide Web]], and all its elements (classes, properties and individuals) are defined as RDF [[resource (Web)|resources]], and identified by [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]]s.
* [http://sadl.sourceforge.net/sadl.html SADL] captures a subset of the expressiveness of [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]], using an English-like language entered via an [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] Plug-in.
* [[Open Biomedical Ontologies|OBO]], a language used for biological and biomedical ontologies.

==Ontology libraries==
The development of ontologies for the Web has led to the emergence of services providing lists or directories of ontologies with search facility. Such directories have been called ontology libraries.

The following are static libraries of human-selected ontologies.
* DAML Ontology Library<ref>[http://www.daml.org/ontologies/ DAML Ontology Library]</ref> maintains a legacy of ontologies in DAML.
* Protege Ontology Library<ref>[http://protegewiki.stanford.edu/index.php/Protege_Ontology_Library Protege Ontology Library]</ref> contains a set of owl, Frame-based and other format ontologies.
* SchemaWeb<ref>[http://www.schemaweb.info/ SchemaWeb]</ref> is a directory of RDF schemata expressed in RDFS, OWL and DAML+OIL.

The following are both directories and search engines. They include crawlers searching the Web for well-formed ontologies.
* OBO Foundry / Bioportal<ref>[http://www.obofoundry.org/ OBO Foundry / Bioportal]</ref> is a suite of interoperable reference ontologies in biology and biomedicine.
* OntoSelect<ref>[http://olp.dfki.de/OntoSelect/ OntoSelect]</ref> Ontology Library offers similar services for RDF/S, DAML and OWL ontologies.
* Ontaria<ref>[http://www.w3.org/2004/ontaria/ Ontaria]</ref> is a "searchable and browsable directory of semantic web data", with a focus on RDF vocabularies with OWL ontologies.
* [[Swoogle]] is a directory and search engine for all RDF resources available on the Web, including ontologies.

==Examples of applications using ontology engines==
* [[SAPPHIRE (Health care)]] or ''Situational Awareness and Preparedness for Public Health Incidences and Reasoning Engines'' is a [[semantics]]-based [[health information system]] capable of tracking and evaluating situations and occurrences that may affect [[public health]].
