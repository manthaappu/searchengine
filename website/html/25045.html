<html> <head> <title>Monowave Corp.</title></head><body>'''Monowave''' is a small research company located in [[Seattle, Washington]], primarily involved in research on machine [[speech recognition]]. The firm was founded by [[Elaine Tsiang]] and [[Hugh Everett III]] to study "human-machine parallels", and became focused on hearing and speech in the early 1990s.

Their '''HERO''' [[neural network]] system simulates the human auditory system in order to track sounds in a noisy background, based on the assumption that the human system has evolved to be good at this. HERO is a server-based system with any number of applications. To date the company has based two systems on HERO, one for identifying pitch which can transcribe music from noisy recordings, and another for speech recognition.
