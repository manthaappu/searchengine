<html> <head> <title>DirectX plugin</title></head><body>In [[computer music]] and [[professional audio]] creation, a '''DirectX plugin''' is a software processing component that can be loaded as a plugin into ''host applications'' to allow real-time processing, audio effects, mixing audio or act as [[Software synthesizer|virtual synthesizers]]. DirectX plugins allow the replacement of traditional recording studio hardware and rack units used in professional studios with software-based counterparts that can be connected together in a modular way. This allows host manufacturers to focus on the conviviality and efficiency of their products while specialized manufacturers can focus on the [[digital signal processing]] aspect. For example, there are plugins for effects boxes, such as [[Reverberation|reverbs]] and [[Delay (audio effect)|delays]], [[Effect pedal|effects pedals]], like [[Distortion (guitar)|guitar distortion]], [[Flange (electric guitar)|flange]] and [[Chorus effect|chorus]], and for mixing and mastering processors such as compressors, limiters, exciters, sub bass enhancers, stereo imagers and many more.

== Overview == 

Similar to [[Virtual Studio Technology]] and later, [[Audio Units]] in Apple [[Mac OS X]], DirectX plugins have an open standard architecture for connecting audio synthesizers and effect plugins to audio editors and hard-disk recording systems. DirectX plug-ins are based on Microsoft's [[Component Object Model]] (COM) which allows plugins to be recognised and used by other applications via common interfaces. Plugins connect to applications and other plugins with pins via which they can pass and processes buffered streams of audio (or video) data.  Architecturally, DirectX plugins are [[DirectShow]] filters.

== Types and compatibility ==

DirectX plugins are also of two types, ''DirectX effect plugins (DX)'' and ''DirectX Instrument plugins (DXi)''. Effect plugins are used to generate, process, receive, or otherwise manipulate streams of audio. Instrument plugins are [[MIDI]] controllable DirectX plugins, generally used to synthesize sound or playback sampled audio using [[Software synthesizer|virtual synthesizers]], [[Software sampler|samplers]] or [[drum machines]]. DirectX effect plugins were developed by Microsoft as part of DirectShow. DirectX instruments were developed by [[Cakewalk (company)|Cakewalk]] in co-operation with Microsoft.

DirectX plugins however are not cross-platform, and are available only on Windows. [[Virtual Studio Technology|VST]] plugins on the contrary are cross-platform. As a result, several ''wrapper'' plugins are available so that DirectX plugins can be used in applications which only support VST and vice versa. Others such as ''chainer'' plugins are also available which allow chaining multiple plugins together.

== Programmability ==

DirectX plugins can be developed in C++ using Microsoft's [[DirectX]] SDK, Sony's Audio plugin development kit or Cakewalk's DirectX Wizard. There is also a [[Delphi]] SDK available [http://www.cloneensemble.com/ddx_sdk.htm here].

== DirectX plugin hosts ==
* [[REAPER]]
* [[Cakewalk Sonar]] (version 2.0 or later)
* [[ACID Pro]] (version 3.0 or later)
* [[Sound Forge]]
* [[Cool Edit]] 2000 and Cool Edit Pro 1.0, 2.0 (Now [[Adobe Audition]])
* [[Steinberg]] [[Wavelab]]
* [[FL Studio]] 
* [[DAVID Systems GmbH]] [[Multitrack Editor V4]]
* [[MAGIX Samplitude]]

== Future ==
DirectX plugins are succeeded by [[DirectX Media Objects|DMO]]-based signal processing filters and more recently, by [[Media Foundation Transform]]s.
