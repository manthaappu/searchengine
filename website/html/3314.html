Forouzan]], ''Data communications and networking'', McGraw-Hill, 2007</ref> is a [[bit rate]] measure of available or consumed data communication resources expressed in bits/second or multiples of it (kilobits/s, megabits/s etc.). 

Note that in textbooks on [[data transmission]], [[digital communications]], [[wireless communications]], [[electronics]], etc., bandwidth refers to analog [[signal bandwidth]] measured in [[hertz]] - the original meaning of the term. Some computer networking authors prefer less ambiguous terms such as ''[[bit rate]]'', ''[[channel capacity]]'' and ''[[throughput]]'' rather than bandwidth in bit/s, to avoid this confusion.

==Network bandwidth capacity==
In computer networking, ''bandwidth'' in bit/s sometimes means the [[net bit rate]] (also known as ''peak bit rate'', ''information rate'' or physical layer ''useful bit rate''), [[channel capacity]], or the [[maximum throughput]] of a logical or physical communication path in a digital communication system. For example, [[bandwidth test]]s measure the maximum throughput of a computer network. The reason for this usage is that according to [[Hartley's law]], the maximum data rate of a physical communication link is proportional to its [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth in hertz]], which is sometimes called ''frequency bandwidth'', ''spectral bandwidth'', ''[[radio frequency|RF]] bandwidth'', ''signal bandwidth'' or ''analog bandwidth''.

==Network bandwidth consumption==
In computer networking, ''bandwidth'' in bit/s may also refer to consumed bandwidth, corresponding to achieved [[throughput]] or [[goodput]], i.e., the average rate of successful data transfer through a communication path. This sense applies to expressions such as [[bandwidth shaping]], [[bandwidth management]], [[bandwidth throttling]], [[bandwidth cap]], [[bandwidth allocation]] (for example [[bandwidth allocation protocol]] and [[dynamic bandwidth allocation]]), etc. A bit stream's bandwidth  is proportional to the average consumed signal bandwidth in Hertz (the average spectral bandwidth of the analog signal representing the bit stream) during a studied time interval.

==Multimedia bandwidth==
Digital bandwidth may also refer to: [[bit rate#Multimedia bit rate|multimedia bit rate]] or [[average bitrate]] after multimedia [[data compression]] ([[source coding]]), defined as the total amount of data divided by the playback time.

== Bandwidth in web hosting ==
In [[Web hosting service|website hosting]], the term "bandwidth" is often incorrectly used to describe the amount of data transferred to or from the website or server within a prescribed period of time, for example ''bandwidth consumption accumulated over a month'' measured in gigabytes per month. The more accurate phrase used for this meaning of a maximum amount of data transfer each month or given period is ''monthly data transfer''..

== Internet connection bandwidths ==
This table shows the maximum bandwidth (the physical layer [[net bitrate]]) of common Internet access technologies. For a more detailed list see [[list of device bandwidths]], [[Bit rate#Progress trends|bit rate progress trends]] and [[Bit rate#Bitrates in multimedia|list of bitrates in multimedia]].
