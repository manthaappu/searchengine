He did foundational work in [[ontology engineering]] and is well-known for his definition of [[ontologies]] in the context of [[Artificial Intelligence]].<ref name= "iswc2006">[http://iswc2006.semanticweb.org/program/keynote_gruber.php Tom Gruber Keynote] at ISWC2006.

== Biography ==
Gruber studied [[psychology]] and [[computer science]] at the [[Loyola University New Orleans]], where he received a double major B.S. in 1981 and graduated summa cum laude. He had designed and implemented a computer-assisted instruction (CAI) system for programmed-curriculum courses. It was the first of its kind at the university, and is used routinely by the Psychology department for introductory courses. In 1984 he received a M.S. in Computer and Information Science at the [[University of Massachusetts]]. His Master's research had resulted in the design and implementation of an intelligent communication [[prosthesis]] assistant, a computer system which enables people with severe physical disabilities who cannot otherwise speak to communicate in [[natural language]] presented in displayed, written, or spoken form. Four years later in 1988 at the University of Massachusetts he received a Ph.D. in Computer and Information Science with the dissertation "The Acquisition of Strategic Knowledge". His dissertation research had addressed a critical problem for Artificial Intelligence—knowledge acquisition—with a computer assistant that acquires strategic knowledge from experts.<ref name = "TRG95">[http://www-ksl.stanford.edu/people/gruber/gruber-cv.html Thomas Robert Gruber].

From 1988 to 1994 Gruber has been a Research Associate at the Knowledge Systems Laboratory of the Computer Science Department at [[Stanford University]]. He has been working on the How Things Work, SHADE, and Knowledge Sharing Technology projects. In 1994 he became Senior Project Leader, Enterprise Integration Technologies and proposed and designed several projects using the Internet to create shared, virtual environments for collaborative learning and work (for ARPA, NASA, NIST). Proposed a business plan for corporate training. In 1995 he founded and became Chief Technology Officer of [[Intraspect Software]],<ref name = "TRG95"/> an enterprise software company that pioneered the space of collaborative knowledge management. Intraspect applications help professional people collaborate in large distributed communities, continuously contributing to a collective body of knowledge.<ref name= "iswc2006"/> 

He has been a member of journal editorial boards of the "Knowledge Acquisition", "IEEE Expert" and "Internation Journal of Human-Computer Studies".

== Work ==
Gruber's research interests in the 1990s were in the field of developing intelligent networked software to support human collaboration and learning. Areas of specialty include: knowledge acquisition, knowledge representation, computer-supported collaborative work, computer-mediated communication for design, and knowledge sharing technology.<ref name = "TRG95"/>
