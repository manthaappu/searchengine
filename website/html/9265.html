<html> <head> <title>Data-directed programming</title></head><body>'''Data-directed programming''' is a [[programming]] technique mentioned in [[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs]]. Essentially it is a "dispatch" technique on procedures for integrating separately developed data-type (e.g., class) modules, based on the programmers manual setup of dynamic tables for procedure access.  In modern object-oriented programming languages it is implemented as [[polymorphism in object-oriented programming|polymorphism]].
