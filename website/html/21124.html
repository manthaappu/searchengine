'''Langley Grammar School''' is a co-educational [[grammar school]] in [[Langley, Berkshire]], [[United Kingdom]]. 

==Admissions==
It {{As of|2007|alt=currently}} has about 1013 pupils of whom 261 are in the [[Sixth Form]]. It is situated just north of the [[A4 road (England)|A4]] next to Kedermister Park. Cycle route 61 passes north-south next to the west side of the school.

Langley Grammar School selects its incoming students on the basis of examined ability, at age 11 by [[NFER]] 11+ examination or for Sixth Form by performance at [[GCSE]] and interview. Mr John Constable is the current headteacher of the school. Around 70% of pupils come from outside of the LEA, with a lot from [[London Borough of Hillingdon|Hillingdon]].

==History==
It was founded in 1956. In the early 1980s, there were plans to close the school to reduce Slough's grammar schools from 5 to 4. In the end, two single-sex grammar schools merged instead to form Upton Grammar School (now [[Slough Grammar School]]).

==Facilities==
Langley Grammar School has recently sold tracts of land at the end of the former school field to fund building and restoration works comprising of, amongst others, a new teaching block of six classrooms, a sports hall, fitness suite, multi-purpose area, and astro-turf pitch. On September 11 2006, the new Sports Hall was officially opened by the mayor of Slough. A new sixth form centre is currently being built and is due for completion in August 2007, which was opened on 28 September 2007 by Princess Anne.
