<html> <head> <title>Intrusion tolerance</title></head><body>'''Intrusion tolerance''' is a [[Fault-tolerant design]] approach to defending information systems against malicious attack. Abandoning the conventional aim of preventing all intrusions, intrusion tolerance instead calls for triggering mechanisms that prevent intrusions from leading to a system security failure.

Projects in this area include the MAFTIA project (Malicious- and Accidental-Fault Tolerance for Internet Applications), which developed concepts and prototyped architectures, and the [http://www.tolerantsystems.org/ OASIS] program, which implemented several intrusion-tolerant systems.
