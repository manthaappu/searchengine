The name "Molinux" derives from the Spanish word "molino", meaning "mill" or "windmill". Each version of Molinux is named for a character from the great Spanish novel ''[[Don Quixote]]'', by [[Miguel de Cervantes]].

==Project information==

Molinux is an initiative begun in 2005 by the government of Castilla-La Mancha  to introduce the Castile-La Mancha community to the forefront of the Information Society.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The Molinux project is intended to attack the [[digital divide]] by reducing the cost of software and offering an easy-to-use [[operating system]]. 

The sponsoring regional government's commitment to the [[open source]] philosophy is such that they have committed not to impose the use of Molinux. "The advantage is that the software is free to compete with anyone, and the user can choose between using this or any other software."[http://www.elmundo.es/navegante/2004/12/16/softlibre/1103216028.html]
