'''Spiceworks''' provides a free [[systems management]], inventory, and helpdesk software application, Spiceworks IT Desktop, designed for network administrators working in [[Small and medium enterprise|small- to medium-sized businesses]].

Spiceworks IT Desktop is used to inventory, monitor, manage and report on software and hardware assets. It also includes an integrated help desk system. Spiceworks runs on [[Microsoft Windows]] and discovers Windows, [[Unix]], [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]] machines along with other [[Internet Protocol|IP]]-addressable devices such as routers, [[VOIP]] phones, printers, etc.  Spiceworks is [[adware]]<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB117496231973149939-05bQvBXmI0tpwoBlv0d98dW4r70_20080325.html Companies Tolerate Ads to Get Free Software - WSJ.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and is written in [[Ruby on Rails]].

==Spiceworks Inc.==
Spiceworks is a privately held company headquartered in Austin, Texas with an initial round of $5M funding<ref name="austin.bizjournals.com">[http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2006/06/12/daily34.html Spiceworks uses $5M to boost sales, marketing - Austin Business Journal:<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> from [[Austin Ventures]].<ref name="austin.bizjournals.com"/>  Spiceworks was formed in early [[2006]],<ref>[http://www.spiceworks.com/about/ Spiceworks - The First Ad-Supported Business Application<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> by Scott Abel, Jay Hallberg, Greg Kattawar, and Francis Sullivan.  The co-founders of Spiceworks have backgrounds with [[Motive Inc]], [[Tivoli Software]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and [[NeXT]].

==Community==
Spiceworks offers an online forum, called the Spiceworks Community, from which Spiceworks IT Desktop users can obtain technical support and make Feature Requests to be implemented in future versions of the software.

===Spicy Votes===
Originally, the Spiceworks Community had the option to add "Spiciness" or "Spicy Votes" to each thread within the Spiceworks Community, specifically Feature Requests.  The spiciness of a given thread would allow Spiceworks Inc. a better view as to what their current users wanted out of the application.  This "Spiciness" was represented by a red [[Chili pepper]].  As the Spiceworks Community grew, several updates took place, one of which was the removal of the chilis.  Later versions of the Spiceworks Community used generic plus and minus signs to show the "spiciness" of a thread, although this caused new Feature Requests by the Spiceworks Community for the resurgence of the chilis.  As of September 12, 2007, Spiceworks has reincorporated the [[Chili pepper]] icon.<ref>[http://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2998 Spiceworks - CHILI PEPPERS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

===SpiceRex===
[[File:Spicerexhead.PNG|50px|left]]SpiceRex is the mascot of the Spiceworks community, showing his face first in a photo contest.<ref>[http://www.unofficialspiceworks.com/2010/03/the-story-off-the-spiceworks-spicerex/ The story of SpiceRex]</ref> It was a big hit with all the community members and on June 2, 2010 was released as the official community mascot along with the tag line "a force to be reckoned with."
