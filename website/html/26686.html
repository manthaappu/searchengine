<html> <head> <title>Norwegian Institute for Air Research</title></head><body>The '''Norwegian Institute for Air Research''' ({{lang-no|Norsk Institutt for luftforskning}}) or '''NILU''' is one of the leading specialized scientific laboratories in [[Europe]] researching issues related to [[air pollution]], [[climate change]] and health. NILU has a staff of scientists, engineers and technicians with specialized expertise for working on air pollution problems. The staff do more than two hundred projects annually for [[research council]]s, industries, international banks and local, national and international authorities and organizations. Its director since 2009 is [[Kari Nygaard]].

== Fields of work ==
NILU was founded in 1969 and the institute conducts environmental research with emphasis on the sources of [[air pollution]] and on [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|air pollution dispersion]],<ref>{{cite book | author=Turner, D.B. | title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling| edition=2nd Edition| publisher=CRC Press | year=1994 | isbn=1-56670-023-X }}  [http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&parent_id=&pc= www.crcpress.com]</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th Edition|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}} [http://www.air-dispersion.com www.air-dispersion.com]</ref> transport, transformation and [[Deposition (Aerosol physics)|deposition]]. It is also involved in the assessment of the effects of [[pollution]] on [[ecosystem]]s, [[human health]] and materials. Integrated environmental assessments and optimal abatement strategy planning has been a field of priority during the last few years. [[Evaluation|Assessment]] of transboundary transport of [[air pollutant]]s, [[acid rain]] and global [[air quality]] are important tasks.

NILU has the responsibility as a national research institution for air pollution in [[Norway]] and is also being used as an international air pollution expert by the [[World Bank]], the [[Asian Development Bank]] and the [[World Health Organization]].

NILU has developed an automatic [[surveillance]] program for [[air quality]] in cities and background areas. NILU have specialized in computerized automatic air pollution [[surveillance]], planning and optimal abatement strategy planning. This AirQUIS system is an air pollution management and planning system designed for managers and decision-makers.

== Location ==
NILU's head office is at [[Kjeller]] on the outskirt of [[Oslo]] in Norway. A specialised office for [[Arctic]] related matters is an integrated part of the [[Polar Environmental Centre]] in [[Troms√∏]]. NILU also has offices in [[Abu Dhabi]] (the United Arab Emirates) and [[Katowice]] (NILU Polska).
