<html> <head> <title>IEC 62351</title></head><body>IEC 62351 is a standard developed by WG15 of [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] [[IEC TC 57|TC57]]. This is developed for handling the security of TC 57 series of protocols including [[IEC 60870-5]] series, [[Inter-Control_Center_Communications_Protocol|IEC 60870-6]] series, [[IEC 61850]] series, [[IEC 61970]] series & [[IEC 61968]] series. The different security objectives include authentication of data transfer through [[digital signatures]], ensuring only authenticated access, prevention of [[eavesdropping]], prevention of playback and [[Spoofing_attack|spoofing]], and [[Intrusion_detection_system | intrusion detection]].
