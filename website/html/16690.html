'''High Threshold Logic'''('''HTL''') is a variant of [[Diode–transistor logic|DTL]] which is used in such environments where noise is very high.
== Operation ==
The threshold values at the input to a logic gate determine whether a particular input is interpreted as a logic 0 or a logic 1.(e.g. anything less than one volt is a logic 0 and anything above three volts is a logic 1. In this example, the threshold values are 1v and 3v).It incorporates [[Zener diodes]] to create a large offset between logic 1 and logic 0 voltage levels.These devices usually ran off a 15 volt power supply and were found in industrial control, where the high differential was intended to minimize the effect of noise.
== Advantages ==
*Increased Noise Margin
*Spike Control
*High Noise Threshold Value

== Usage ==
It is used extensively in industrial environments. e.g.
*Logic Controllers with heavy noise
*Heavy Process Machinery
