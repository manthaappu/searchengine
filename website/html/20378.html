'''KWrite''' is a lightweight text editor for the [[KDE Software Compilation]].

== Features ==
* Export to [[HTML]], [[PDF]], [[PostScript]]
* Block selection mode (see screenshot)
* [[Code folding]]
* Bookmarks
* [[Syntax highlighting]]
* Encoding selection
* [[End-of-line]] mode selection ([[Unix]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]])
* Word completion

== KParts technology==
In [[K Desktop Environment 2]], KWrite did not use [[KParts]] technology, which allows embedding one application into another. Then, KWrite was rewritten to use this technology. It allows the user to choose, for example, [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] to be embedded into KWrite.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Other options include ''Qt Designer based text editor'' and ''KDE advanced text editor (KATE)''. The latter is the default option, and makes use of [[Kate (text editor)|Kate]] text editor.

== Location of KWrite ==
KWrite is a part of ''kdebase'' package. Recently, it has been merged with [[Kate (text_editor)|Kate]], and as such, its source code is located in the ''kate/'' directory.
