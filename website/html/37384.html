<html> <head> <title>The Meaning of Meaning</title></head><body>Although the original text was published in 1923 it has been used as a textbook in many fields including [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[language]], [[cognitive science]] and most recently [[semantics]].  The book has been in print continuously since 1923.  The most recent edition is the critical edition prepared by W. Terrence Gordon as volume 3 of the 5-volume set ''C. K Ogden & Linguistics'' (London: Routledge/Thoemmes Press, 1995).  For full publication history, including serialized publication in ''The Cambridge Magazine'' prior to the first edition of the book, consult W. Terrence Gordon, ''C. K. Ogden: a bio-bibliographical study'' (Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow Press, 1990) or contact the author.

The book's focus is on how individuals use language.  The book description states that ''Language is the most important of all the instruments of civilization.''

The book would later influence A.J. Ayer's ''Language, Truth and Logic'', an introduction to Logical Positivism, and both the Richards-Ogden book and the Ayer book would, in turn, influence Alec King and Martin Ketley in the writing of their book ''The Control of Language'', which appeared in 1939. This book would eventually lead C.S. Lewis to write the twentieth century's most powerful defense of natural law and objective values, ''The Abolition of Man'', which would be published in 1943.
