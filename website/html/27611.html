'''Operation CHAOS''' or '''Operation MHCHAOS''' was the code name for a domestic espionage project conducted by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. A department within the CIA was established in 1967 on orders from [[President of the United States]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and later expanded under President [[Richard Nixon]]. The operation was launched under [[Director of Central Intelligence]] (DCI) [[Richard Helms]], by chief of [[counter-intelligence]], [[James Jesus Angleton]], and headed by Richard Ober. The program's goal was to unmask possible foreign influences on the student antiwar movement.<ref name="Theoharis06">{{cite book|title=The Central Intelligence Agency: Security Under Scrutiny |last=Athan Theoharis |first=Richard H. |year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0313332827 |pages=49,175,195,203,322}}</ref><ref name="Napoli05">{{cite book|title=Intelligence Identities Protection Act and Its Interpretation |first=Russell P. |last=Napoli |publisher=Nova Publishers |year=2005 |isbn=1594546851 |pages=18–20}}</ref> The "MH" designation is to signify the program had a worldwide area of operations.<ref name="Friedman05">{{cite book|title=The Secret Histories: Hidden Truths That Challenged the Past and Changed the World |first=John S. |last=Friedman |year=2005 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0312425171 |pages=278–279}}</ref>

==Parallel operations==
During its time, Operation CHAOS made use of the facilities of other ongoing CIA domestic surveillance programs, many operating under the CIA's Office of Security, including:<ref name="Napoli05" />
*[[HTLINGUAL]] - Directed at letters passing between the United States and the then Soviet Union, the program involved the examination of correspondence to and from individuals or organizations placed on a watchlist.
*Project 2 - Directed at infiltration of foreign intelligence targets by agents posing as dissident sympathizers and which, like CHAOS, had placed agents within domestic radical organizations for the purposes of training and establishment of dissident credentials.
*[[Project MERRIMAC]] - Designed to infiltrate domestic antiwar and radical organizations thought to pose a threat to security of CIA property and personnel.
*[[Project RESISTANCE]] - Worked with college administrators, campus security and local police to identify anti-war activists and [[political dissident]]s without any infiltration taking place
*Domestic Contact Service - Focused on collecting foreign intelligence from willing Americans.

==History==
When President [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] came to office in 1969, all of the existing domestic surveillance activities were consolidated into Operation CHAOS.<ref name="Goldstein01">{{cite book|title=Political Repression in Modern America: From 1870 to 1976 |first=Robert Justin |last=Goldstein |year=2001 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn=0252069641 |page=456}}</ref> Operation CHAOS first used CIA stations abroad to report on antiwar activities of United States citizens traveling abroad, employing methods such as physical surveillance and electronic [[eavesdropping]], utilizing "liaison services" in maintaining such surveillance. The operations were later expanded to include 60 officers.<ref name="Friedman05" /> In 1969, following the expansion, the operation began developing its own network of [[informants]] for the purposes of infiltrating various foreign antiwar groups located in foreign countries that might have ties to domestic groups.<ref name="Napoli05" /> Eventually, CIA officers expanded the program to include other leftist or counter-cultural groups with no discernible connection to [[Vietnam]], such as groups operating within the [[History_of_feminism#Late_twentieth_century:_the_postwar_period_and_the_second_wave|women's liberation movement]].<ref name="Theoharis06" /> The domestic spying of Operation CHAOS also targeted the [[Israel]]i embassy, and domestic Jewish groups such as the [[B'nai B'rith]]. In order to gather intelligence on the embassy and B'nai B'rith, the CIA purchased a [[Waste collection|garbage collection]] company to collect documents that were to be destroyed.<ref name="Loftus97">{{cite book|title=The Secret War Against the Jews: How Western Espionage Betrayed The Jewish People |first=John |last=Loftus |coauthor=Mark Aarons |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |date=April 15, 1997 |isbn=0312156480 |page=322}}</ref>

Targets of Operation CHAOS within the antiwar movement included:<ref name="Goldstein01" />
*[[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]]
*[[Black Panther Party]]
*[[Women Strike for Peace]]

Officially, reports were to be compiled on "illegal and subversive" contacts between United States civilian protesters and "foreign elements" which "might range from casual contacts based merely on mutual interest to closely controlled channels for party directives." At its finality, Operation CHAOS contained files on 7,200 Americans, and a computer index totaling 300,000 civilians and approximately 1,000 groups.<ref name="Hixson00">{{cite book|title=Military Aspects of the Vietnam Conflict |first=Walter L. |last=Hixson |isbn=0815335342 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=2000 |page=282}}</ref> The initial result of investigations lead DCI Richard Helms to advise then President Johnson on November 15, 1967, that the agency had uncovered "no evidence of any contact between the most prominent peace movement leaders and foreign embassies in the U.S. or abroad." Helms repeated this assessment in 1969.<ref name="Theoharis06" /> In total 6 reports where compiled for the [[White House]] and 34 for [[United States Cabinet|cabinet level]] officials.<ref name="Napoli05" />

==Aftermath==
In 1973, amid the uproar of the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate break-in]], involving two former CIA officers, Operation CHAOS was closed. The secret nature of the former program however was exposed when [[Seymour Hersh]] published an article in the ''[[New York Times]]'' titled ''Huge CIA Operation Reported in US Against Antiwar Forces, Other Dissidents in Nixon Years'' on December 22, 1974.<ref name="Theoharis06" /> The following year, further details were revealed during [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Bella Abzug]]'s House Subcommittee on Government Information and individual Rights.<ref name="Friedman05" /> The government, in response to the revelations, launched the [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|Commission on CIA Activities Within the United States]] (The Rockefeller Commission), lead by then [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Nelson Rockefeller]], to investigate the depth of the surveillance.<ref name="Theoharis06" /> [[Richard Cheney]], then [[Deputy White House Chief of Staff]], is noted as stating of the Rockefeller Commission; it was to avoid " ... congressional efforts to further encroach on the executive branch."<ref name="Theoharis06" />

Following the revelations by the Rockefeller Commission, then DCI, [[George H. W. Bush]], stated: "... the operation in practice resulted in some improper accumulation of material on legitimate domestic activities."<ref name="Friedman05" />
