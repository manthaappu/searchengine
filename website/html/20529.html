'''KRC''' ('''Kent Recursive Calculator''') is a [[lazy evaluation|lazy]] [[functional language]] developed by [[David Turner (computer scientist)|David Turner]] in (or before?) 1981 based on [[SASL programming language|SASL]], with [[pattern matching]], [[guard (computing)|guard]]s and [[ZF expression]]s (now more usually called [[list comprehensions]]).
Two implementations of KRC were written: David Turner's original one in [[BCPL]] running on [[Edinburgh Multiple Access System|EMAS]], and Simon Croft's later one in [[C (programming language)|C]] under [[Unix]], and KRC was the main language used for teaching functional programming at the [[University of Kent]] at Canterbury (UK) from 1982 to 1985.

The direct successor to KRC is [[Miranda programming language|Miranda]], which includes a polymorphic type discipline based on that of Milner's [[ML programming language|ML]].
