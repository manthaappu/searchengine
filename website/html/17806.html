'''ical''' is an old but popular calendar package written in [[Tcl/tk]] by Sanjay Ghemawat for [[Unix]] systems.  ical is known for its simple, intuitive interface. It's also easy for [[Tcl/tk]] programmers to extend ical with custom functionality. It stores all calendaring information in a single flat text file per user that may be easily parsed by [[perl]] or [[Python_(programming_language)|python]] scripts.

ical is not related to the [[iCalendar]] format standard, and does not utilize it.  It is also not related to [[Apple Inc.]]'s calendaring application, confusingly called [[iCal]].
