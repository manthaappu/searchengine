'''JOONE''' (Java Object Oriented Neural Engine) is a component based [[neural network]] framework built in [[Java (programming language)|Java]].

==Features==
Joone consists of a component-based architecture based on linkable components that can be extended to build new learning algorithms and neural networks architectures.

Components are plug-in code modules that are linked to produce an information flow. New components can be added and reused. Beyond simulation, Joone also has to some extent multi-platform deployment capabilities.

Joone has a GUI Editor to graphically create and test any neural network, and a distributed training environment that allows for neural networks to be trained on multiple remote machines.

==Comparison==
As of 2010, Joone, [[Encog]] and [[Neuroph]] are the major free component based neural network development environment available for the Java platform. Unlike the two other (commercial) systems that are in existence, [[Peltarion Synapse|Synapse]] and [[NeuroSolutions]], it is written in Java and has direct [[cross-platform]] support. A limited number of components exist and the graphical development environment is rudimentary so it has significantly fewer features than its commercial counterparts.

Joone can be considered to be more of a neural network framework than a full integrated development environment. Unlike its commercial counterparts, it has a strong focus on code-based development of neural networks rather than visual construction.

While in theory Joone can be used to construct a wider array of [[adaptive systems]] (including those with non-adaptive elements), its focus is on backpropagation based neural networks.
