'''Multiple-image Network Graphics''' is a public [[graphics file format]] for [[computer animation|animated]] images.

MNG is closely related to the [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] image format. When PNG development started in early 1995, developers decided not to incorporate support for [[animation]], not least because this feature of [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] was seldom used at the time{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. However, work soon started on MNG as an animation-supporting version of PNG. Version 1.0 of the MNG specification was released on January 31, 2001.

MNG is currently not as widely supported as PNG. Nonetheless, [[Gwenview]] has native MNG support, and MNG plugins are available for most other web browsers. [[Mozilla]] browsers and [[Netscape (web browser)|Netscape]] 6.0, 6.01 and 7.0 included native support for MNG until the code was removed in 2003 due to code size and little actual usage<ref>[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=195280 Bug 195280 – Removal of MNG/JNG support]</ref>, causing complaints on the Mozilla development site<ref>[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18574 Bug 18574 – restore support for MNG animation format and JNG image format]</ref>. As a result, a MNGzilla project was started to offer patched Mozilla and Firefox browsers<ref>"This is an open source project to develop a patch to restore MNG/JNG support to Mozilla. - [http://mngzilla.sourceforge.net/ 'MNGZILLA'] MNGzilla [[Sourceforge]] website. Retrieved 6 December 2010.</ref>. By contrast, Firefox supports MNG rival [[APNG]] natively<ref>{{cite web| url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Animated_PNG_graphics |title=Animated PNG graphics - MDC Doc Center |date=4 July 2008 |accessdate=6 December 2010}}</ref>. 

Neither [[Internet Explorer]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], nor [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] currently support MNG natively. Recent [[Sony Ericsson]] phones support MNG files in their themes. The [[Sphere (program)|Sphere game engine]] supports the use of MNG files for animations<ref>[http://sphere.sourceforge.net/modules.php?op=modload&name=Sections&file=index&req=viewarticle&artid=3&page=4 From Tutorials and Reference section of site]</ref>. [[GIMP]] can export images as MNG files. [[Imagemagick]] can create a MNG file from a series of PNG files. If [[MPlayer]] is linked against libmng, MPlayer and thus all graphical front-ends like [[Konqueror Media Player|KMPlayer]] and [[Gnome MPlayer]] can display MNG files.

===Server support===
Popular web hosting servers are not configured to handle mng files<ref>http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Images_and_other_uploaded_files</ref><ref>https://help.lycos.com/kb_article.php?ref=4470-EIHB-9773</ref>.

The MNG developers hope that in time MNG will begin to replace GIF for animated images on the [[World Wide Web]], just as PNG has already begun to do for still images.<ref>[http://www.libpng.org/pub/mng/#history MNG (Multiple-image Network Graphics) Home Page]</ref> However, with the expiration of LZW patents and existence of alternative file formats such as Flash and [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]], combined with lack of MNG supporting viewers and services, web usages were far less than expected.

==Technical details==
The structure of MNG files is essentially the same as that of PNG files, differing only in the slightly different signature (<code>8A 4D 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A</code> in [[hexadecimal]], where <code>4D 4E 47</code> is ASCII for "MNG" – see [[Portable Network Graphics#File header|Portable Network Graphics: File header]]) and the use of a much greater variety of [[Portable Network Graphics#"Chunks" within the file|chunks]] to support all the animation features that it provides. Images to be used in the animation are stored in the MNG file as encapsulated PNG or [[JPEG Network Graphics|JNG]] images.

Two versions of MNG of reduced complexity are also defined: MNG-LC (low complexity) and MNG-VLC (very low complexity). These allow applications to include some level of MNG support without having to implement the entire MNG specification, just as the [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] standard offers the "SVG Basic" and "SVG Tiny" subsets.

MNG does not yet have a registered [[MIME]] media type, but <code>video/x-mng</code> or <code>image/x-mng</code> can be used.
MNG animations may be included in [[HTML]] pages using the <code><embed></code> or <code><object></code> tag.

MNG can either be lossy or lossless, depending whether the frames are encoded in PNG (lossless) or [[JPEG Network Graphics|JNG]] (lossy).

==Alternatives==
[[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] is often used. [[Animated Portable Network Graphics|APNG]] is an alternative to MNG, non-standard yet gaining foothold in the World Wide Web. Yet another alternative would be using animated [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] images with embedded [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] or [[JPEG]] graphics. More commonly in present-day applications, animations (particularly interactive animations) are achieved using [[Adobe Flash]]. Another option for the Web is to write [[JavaScript]] code that loads still PNG or JPEG images of each frame, and displays them one by one for a specified time interval. Apart from requiring the user to have JavaScript support and choose to enable it, this method can be CPU and bandwidth intensive for pages with more than one image, large images, or high framerates.
