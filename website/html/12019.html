<html> <head> <title>Embedded SQL</title></head><body>'''Embedded SQL''' is a method of combining the [[computing]] power of a [[programming language]] and the [[database]] [[Data Manipulation Language|manipulation]] capabilities of [[SQL]]. Embedded SQL [[statement (programming)|statements]] are SQL statements written inline with the program [[source code]] of the host language. The embedded SQL statements are [[parsing|parsed]] by an embedded SQL [[preprocessor]] and replaced by host-language [[call site|calls]] to a code [[library (computing)|library]].  The output from the preprocessor is then compiled by the host [[compiler]]. This allows programmers to embed SQL statements in programs written in any number of languages such as: [[:Category:C programming language family|C/C++]], [[COBOL]] and [[Fortran]].

The [[ANSI]] SQL standards committee defined the embedded SQL standard in two steps: a formalism called '''Module Language''' was defined, then the embedded SQL standard was derived from Module Language.<ref name="modulelang">

</ref> The SQL standard defines embedding of SQL as ''embedded SQL'' and the language in which SQL queries are embedded is referred to as the ''host language''. A popular host language is C. The mixed C and embedded SQL is called [[Pro*C]] in [[Oracle Database|Oracle]] and [[Sybase]] database management systems. In the [[PostgreSQL]] database management system this precompiler is called [[ECPG]]. Other embedded SQL precompilers are Pro*[[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], Pro*COBOL, Pro*FORTRAN, Pro*[[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], and Pro*[[PL/I]].

== Systems that do not support Embedded SQL ==
=== Microsoft SQL Server ===
Embedded SQL for C has been deprecated as of [[Microsoft SQL Server]] 2008 although earlier versions of the product support it.<ref>{{cite web
