The '''PowerPC e500''' is a [[32-bit]] [[Power Architecture]]-based [[microprocessor]] [[Multi-core (computing)|core]] from [[Freescale Semiconductor]]. The core is compatible with the older PowerPC Book E specification as well as the [[Power_Architecture#Power_ISA_v.2.03|Power ISA v.2.03]]. It has a dual issue, seven-stage [[Instruction pipeline|pipeline]] with [[floating point unit|FPUs]] (from version 2 onwards), 32/32 KiB data and instruction L1 [[cache]]s and 256, 512 or 1024 KiB L2 frontside cache. Speeds range from 533 MHz up to 1.5 GHz, and the core is designed to be highly configurable and meet the specific needs of [[Embedded system|embedded]] applications with features like [[Multi-core (computing)|multi-core]] operation and interface for auxiliary application processing units (APU). 

e500 powers the high-performance [[PowerQUICC#PowerQUICC III|PowerQUICC III]] [[system on a chip]] (SoC) [[network processor]]s and they all share a common naming scheme, ''MPC85xx''. Freescale's new [[QorIQ]] is the evolutionary step from PowerQUICC III and will also be based on e500 cores.

== Versions ==
There are three versions of the e500 core, namely the original ''e500v1'', the ''e500v2'' and the ''e500mc''.

=== e500v2 ===
Key improvements in the e500v2 over the e500v1 include:
* increase from 32-bit (4 GiB) to 36-bit (64 GiB) physical address space (this change means that e500v2-based devices often use a more advanced [[Board_support_package|BSP]] than e500v1-based devices, as various peripheral units have moved to physical addresses higher than 2^32). 
* addition of 1 GiB and 4 GiB variable-page sizes
* addition of [[double precision]] floating point support.  this is not compatible with any other PowerPC floating point unit, and in fact the instruction set overlaps with string and altivec instructions as well.
* doubling in size and associativity of the MMU's second-level 4K-page array (from 256-entry 2-way to 512-entry 4-way)
* increase from 3 to 5 maximum outstanding data cache misses
* addition of the Alternate Time Base for cycle-granularity timestamps

=== e500mc ===
Freescale introduced the ''e500mc'' in the [[QorIQ]] family of chips in June 2008. The e500mc has the following features:
* [[Power_Architecture#Power_ISA_v.2.06|PowerISA v.2.06]], which includes [[hypervisor]] and [[Platform virtualization|virtualization]] functionality for embedded platforms. 
* The "classic" floating point unit has been reinstated.
* Support anything from two to more than 32 cores (not necessarily the same type of cores) on a single chip. 
* Supports the ''CoreNet'' communications fabric for connecting cores and datapath accelerators. 
* e500mc cores have private L2 caches but typically share other facilities like L3 caches, memory controllers, application specific acceleration cores, I/O and such.

== Applications ==
=== PowerQUICC ===
All [[PowerQUICC]] 85xx devices are based on e500v1 or e500v2 cores, most of them on the e500v2. 

=== QorIQ ===
In June 2008 Freescale announced the [[QorIQ]] brand, microprocessors based on e500 cores. The QorIQ P1 and P2 families are using e500v2 while the P3 and P4 families are using the e500mc cores and CoreNet communications fabric.
