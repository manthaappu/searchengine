'''Rambus Incorporated''' ({{nasdaq|RMBS}}), founded in 1990, is a technology licensing company.  The company became particularly well known for its aggressive [[intellectual property]] based litigation practices following the introduction of [[DDR-SDRAM]] memory.
 
== History ==
Rambus, a California company, was incorporated in 1990 and re-incorporated in Delaware in 1997. The company was listed on [[NASDAQ]] in 1997 under the code RMBS. As of February 2006, Rambus derived the majority of its annual revenue by licensing patents for chip interfaces to its customers.

Companies such as [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]], [[Elpida Memory|Elpida]], [[Infineon Technologies|Infineon]], [[Intel Corporation|Intel]], [[Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.|Matsushita]], [[NEC|NECEL]], [[Qimonda]], [[Renesas Technology|Renesas]], [[Sony]], and [[Toshiba]] have taken licenses to Rambus patents for use in their own products.<ref>[http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2006%2f02%2f21%2f0001193125-06-035902.html#FIS_BUSINESS    RAMBUS FORM 10-K]</ref> 

Rambus' share price has ranged between a high of nearly $150 in 2000 to a low of approximately $3 in 2002 with a 4:1 split on June 15, 2000. Rambus' share price in the first quarter of 2010 was between $20 and $24, giving the firm a market cap value of around 2.5 billion US dollars <ref>[http://quotes.nasdaq.com/asp/SummaryQuote.asp?symbol=RMBS&selected=RMBS]</ref>.

The first PC motherboards with support for [[RDRAM]] debuted in 1999. They supported PC800 RDRAM, which operated at 400 MHz but presented data on both rise and fall of clock cycle resulting in effectively 800 MHz, and delivered 1600 MB/s of [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] over a 16-bit bus using a 184-pin [[RDRAM|RIMM]] form factor. This was significantly faster than the previous standard, PC133 SDRAM, which operated at 133 MHz and delivered 1066 MB/s of bandwidth over a 64-bit bus using a 168-pin [[DIMM]] form factor.

Some downsides of RDRAM technology, however, included significantly increased [[RAM latency|latency]], heat output, manufacturing complexity, and cost. PC800 RDRAM operated with a minimum latency of 45 ns, compared to 15 ns for PC133 SDRAM. RDRAMs can also be told to increase their latencies in order to prevent the possibility of two or more chips transmitting at the same time and causing a collision. However, SDRAM latency depends on the current state of memory so its latency can vary widely depending on what happened earlier and the strategy used by the SDRAM controller, while RDRAM latency is constant once it has been established by the memory controller. RDRAM memory chips also put out significantly more heat than SDRAM chips, necessitating [[heatsink]]s on all RIMM devices. RDRAM also includes a memory controller on each memory chip, significantly increasing manufacturing complexity compared to SDRAM, which used a single memory controller located on the [[northbridge (computing)|northbridge]] chipset. RDRAM was also two to three times the price of PC133 SDRAM due to manufacturing costs, license fees and other market factors. However, Rambus has alleged that some of those market factors included memory maker price fixing in order to drive RDRAM out of the market in favor of DDR SDRAM. A case of DRAM price-fixing was exposed by the [[United States Department of Justice]], with the details found in the article [[DRAM price fixing]]. DDR SDRAM, introduced in 2000, operated at an effective clockspeed of 266 MHz and delivered 2100 MB/s over a 64-bit bus using a 184-pin DIMM form factor. 

With the introduction of the [[Intel 840]] chipset, dual-channel support was added for PC800 RDRAM, doubling bandwidth to 3200 MB/s by increasing the bus width to 32-bit. This was followed in 2002 by the [[Intel 850E]] chipset, which introduced PC1066 RDRAM, increasing total dual-channel bandwidth to 4200 MB/s. Also in 2002, Intel released the [[E7205]] chipset, which introduced dual-channel DDR support for a total bandwidth of 4200 MB/s, but at a much lower latency than competing RDRAM. In 2003, Intel released the [[875P]] chipset, and along with it dual-channel DDR400. With a total bandwidth of 6400 MB/s, it marked the end of RDRAM as a technology with competitive performance.

Rambus survived the obsolescence of RDRAM and moved to support DDR and DDR2 in the area of video card technology and in particular, [[PCI Express]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Rambus also developed and licensed its [[XDR RAM]] technology.

{{Undue|date=October 2009}}
In the early 1990s, Rambus was invited to join the [[Joint Electron Device Engineering Council|JEDEC]]. Rambus had been trying to interest memory manufacturers in licensing their proprietary memory interface, and numerous companies had signed [[non-disclosure agreement]]s to view Rambus' technical data.  During the later ''Infineon v. Rambus'' trial, [[Infineon Technologies|Infineon]] memos from a meeting with representatives of other manufacturers surfaced, including the line “[O]ne day all computers will be built this way, but hopefully without the royalties going to Rambus”, and continuing with a strategy discussion for reducing or eliminating royalties to be paid to Rambus.  As Rambus continued its participation in JEDEC, it became apparent that they were not prepared to agree to JEDEC’s patent policy requiring owners of patents included in a standard to agree to license that technology under terms that are ‘reasonable and non-discriminatory’,<ref>More precisely, “that a license will be made available to applicants desiring to implement the standard either without compensation or under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination”; §8.2 of the JEDEC Manual of Organization and Procedure (JM21-L), http://www.jedec.org/Home/manuals/JM21L.pdf</ref> and Rambus withdrew from the organization in 1995. Memos from Rambus at that time showed they were tailoring new patent applications to cover features of SDRAM being discussed, which were public knowledge (JEDEC meetings were not considered secret) and perfectly legal for patent owners who have patented underlying innovations, but were seen as evidence of bad faith by the jury in the first ''Infineon v. Rambus'' trial. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC)]] rejected this theory of bad faith in its decision overturning the fraud conviction Infineon achieved in the first trial (see below).

In 2000, Rambus began filing lawsuits against the largest memory manufacturers, claiming that they owned SDRAM and DDR technology. Seven manufacturers, including [[Samsung]], quickly settled with Rambus and agreed to pay royalties on SDRAM and DDR memory. When Rambus sued [[Infineon Technologies]], however, [[Micron Technology|Micron]] and [[Hynix]] joined forces with Infineon to fight the lawsuit, countersuing with claims of fraud. This trio of memory manufacturers became known as “The Three Amigos”. In May 2001, Rambus was found guilty of fraud for having claimed that they owned SDRAM and DDR technology, and all infringement claims against memory manufacturers were dismissed.  In January 2003, the CAFC overturned the fraud verdict of the jury trial in [[Virginia]] under Judge Payne, issued a new claims construction, and remanded the case back to Virginia for re-trial on infringement. In October 2003, the [[US Supreme Court]] refused to hear the case.  Thus, the case returned to Virginia per the CAFC ruling.

In January 2005, Rambus filed four more lawsuits against memory chip makers Hynix Semiconductor, [[Nanya Technology]], [[Inotera Memories]] and Infineon Technology claiming that DDR 2, GDDR 2 and GDDR 3 chips contain Rambus technology. In March 2005, Rambus had its claim for patent infringements against Infineon dismissed. Rambus was accused of shredding key documents prior to court hearings, the judge agreed and dismissed Rambus' case against Infineon. This sent Rambus to the settlement table with Infineon. Infineon has agreed to pay Rambus quarterly license fees of $5.9m and in return, both companies ceased all litigation against each other. The agreement runs from November 2005 to November 2007. After this date, if Rambus has enough other agreements in place, Infineon may make extra payments up to $100m. Currently, cases involving Micron and Hynix remain in court. In June 2005, Rambus also sued one of its strongest proponents, Samsung, the world's largest memory manufacturer, and terminated Samsung's license. Samsung had promoted Rambus's RDRAM and currently remains a licensee of Rambus's [[XDR DRAM|XDR]] memory.

In May 2002, the [[United Stated Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) filed charges against Rambus for antitrust violations. Specifically, the FTC complaint asserted that through the use of patent continuations and divisionals, Rambus pursued a strategy of expanding the scope of its patent claims to encompass the emerging SDRAM standard.  The FTC's antitrust allegations against Rambus went to trial in the summer of 2003 after the organization formally accused Rambus of anti-competitive behavior the previous June, itself the result of an investigation launched in May 2002 at the behest of the memory manufacturers. The FTC's chief administrative-law judge, Stephen J. McGuire, dismissed the antitrust claims against Rambus in 2004, saying that the memory industry had no reasonable alternatives to Rambus technology and was aware of the potential scope of Rambus patent rights, according to the company. Soon after, FTC investigators filed a brief to appeal against that ruling.

In 2004, Infineon pled guilty to price-fixing in an attempt to manipulate the market spot-price of all major DRAM types. They later paid a fine of $160 million. Hynix and Samsung followed suit in 2005 and paid $185 million and $300 million respectively. Elpida is the most recent company to plead guilty and paid a fine of $85 million, the lowest of all memory manufacturers. It is widely believed that the evidence collected during the FTC's investigation of Rambus led directly to the guilty pleas. {{Weasel-inline|date=March 2009}}

On August 2, 2006, the Federal Trade Commission overturned McGuire's ruling, stating that Rambus illegally monopolized the memory industry under section 2 of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], and also practiced deception that violated section 5 of the [[Federal Trade Commission Act]].<ref>[http://xbitlabs.com/news/memory/display/20060803085050.html Rambus Monopolized Computer Memory Industry – FTC.]</ref>

February 5, 2007, U.S. Federal Trade Commission issued a ruling that limits maximum royalties that Rambus may demand from manufacturers of dynamic random access memory (DRAM), which was set to 0.5% for DDR SDRAM for 3 years from the date the Commission’s Order is issued and then going to 0; while SDRAM's maximum royalty was set to 0.25%. The Commission claimed that halving the DDR SDRAM rate for SDRAM would reflect the fact that while DDR SDRAM utilizes four of the relevant Rambus technologies, SDRAM uses only two. In addition to collecting fees for DRAM chips, Rambus will also be able to receive 0.5% and 1.0% royalties for SDRAM and DDR SDRAM memory controllers or other non-memory chip components respectively. However, the ruling did not prohibit Rambus from collecting royalties on products based on (G)DDR2 SDRAM and other JEDEC post-DDR memory standards.  Rambus has appealed the FTC Opinion/Remedy and awaits a court date for the appeal.<ref>[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/07/330&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en Commission confirms sending a Statement of Objections to Rambus.]</ref>

July 30, 2007, the European Commission launched antitrust investigations against Rambus, taking the view that Rambus engaged in intentional deceptive conduct in the context of the standard-setting process, for example by not disclosing the existence of the patents which it later claimed were relevant to the adopted standard. This type of behaviour is known as a "patent ambush". Against this background, the Commission provisionally considered that Rambus breached the EC Treaty's rules on abuse of a dominant market position (Article 82 EC Treaty) by subsequently claiming unreasonable royalties for the use of those relevant patents. The Commission's preliminary view is that without its "patent ambush", Rambus would not have been able to charge the royalty rates it currently does.<ref>[http://xbitlabs.com/news/memory/display/20070205213754.html FTC Trims Rambus’ Royalties for DRAM Technologies.]</ref>

On March 26, 2008, the jury of the U.S. District Court in San Jose determined that Rambus acted properly while a member of the standard-setting organization JEDEC during its participating in the early 1990s, finding that the memory manufacturers did not meet their burden of proving antitrust and fraud claims.<ref>[http://xbitlabs.com/news/memory/display/20080326230426_Rambus_Obtained_Patents_Completely_Legally_Court_Finds.html Rambus Obtained Patents Completely Legally, Court Finds.]</ref>

On April 22, 2008, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|DC Court of Appeals]] overturned the FTC reversal of McGuire's 2004 ruling, saying that the FTC had not established that Rambus had harmed the competition.<ref>[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/22/rambus_ftc_victory/ US court beats up FTC over Rambus 'patent ambush' ruling], ''The Register'', April 22, 2008</ref>

On April 29, 2008, the [[Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] issued a ruling vacating the order of the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]], saying the case with Samsung should be dismissed, saying Judge Robert E. Payne's findings critical of Rambus, were on a case that had already been settled, and thus had no legal standing.<ref>[http://www.edn.com/article/CA6556272.html Appeals court sides with Rambus in Samsung matter], EDN.com, April 30, 2008</ref>

On January 9, 2009, a Delaware federal judge ruled that Rambus could not enforce patents against Micron Technology Inc., stating that Rambus had a "clear and convincing" show of bad faith, and ruled that Rambus' destruction of key related documents ([[spoliation of evidence]]) nullified its right to enforce  its patents against Micron.

On February 23, 2009, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] rejected the bids by the FTC to impose royalty sanctions on Rambus via anti-trust penalties.<ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20670001&refer=home&sid=at5P6AmiOMsQ#/ FTC Rejected by U.S. Supreme Court in Rambus Case], ''Bloomberg'', February 24, 2009</ref>

In July 2009, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] rejected 8 claims by Rambus against [[Nvidia]].<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090714-710000.html US Patent Office Rejects 8 Rambus Claims Against Nvidia], ''Wall Street Journal'', July 15, 2009</ref>

On November 24, 2009, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) rejected all 17 claims in three Rambus Inc. patents that the company asserted against Nvidia Corp. in a complaint filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC). However the ITC has announced that out of five patents, Nvidia did violate three of them. Due to this ruling Nvidia is facing a US import ban on some of its chips. The chips facing the US import ban are used in the nForce, Quadro, GeForce, Tesla and Tegra series video cards, nearly every video card type manufactured by Nvidia.<ref>[http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1588351/nvidia-us-import-ban Nvidia faces a US import ban ], ''The Inquirer'', January 25, 2010</ref>

In January 2010, Samsung and Rambus reached an agreement under which Samsung will reimburse Rambus by a sum of 900 million dollars until 2015. Both companies reached this agreement after a long-term dispute regarding patented DRAM memory technologies that were allegedly used improperly by Samsung.
