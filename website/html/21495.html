'''Leonidas John Guibas''' ({{lang-el|Λεωνίδας Γκίμπας}}) is a professor of [[computer science]] at [[Stanford University]], where he heads the geometric computation group and is a member of the computer graphics and artificial intelligence laboratories. Guibas was a student of [[Donald Knuth]] at Stanford, where he received his Ph.D. in 1976.<ref name="mathgen">{{mathgenealogy|name=Leonidas John (Ioannis) Guibas|id=39940}}.</ref> He has worked for several industrial research laboratories, and joined the Stanford faculty in 1984. He was program chair for the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[Symposium on Computational Geometry]] in 1996,<ref>[http://www.ams.stonybrook.edu/~jsbm/cg-steer/socg-chairs.txt Program Committees from the Symposium on Computational Geometry], Computational Geometry Steering Committee.</ref> is a [[Fellow]] of the ACM,<ref>[http://fellows.acm.org/fellow_citation.cfm?id=1283951&srt=all ACM Fellow award citation].</ref> and was awarded the ACM–[[AAAI]] [[Allen Newell]] award for 2007 “for his pioneering contributions in applying algorithms to a wide range of computer science disciplines.“<ref>[http://www.acm.org/press-room/news-releases/newell-award-07/ ACM/AAAI Allen Newell Award Recognizes Leonidas Guibas for Algorithms Advancing CS Fields], ACM, 2008; {{citation|title=Guibas Receives ACM/AAAI Award for Algorithm Development|journal=Dr. Dobb's|date=March 4, 2008|url=http://www.ddj.com/hpc-high-performance-computing/206901618}}.</ref> He has [[Erdős number]] 2 due to his collaborations with Boris Aronov, [[Andrew Odlyzko]], [[János Pach]], Richard M. Pollack, [[Endre Szemerédi]], and [[Frances Yao]].<ref>[http://www.oakland.edu/enp/ Erdos number project].</ref> The research contributions he is known for include [[finger tree]]s, [[red-black tree]]s, [[fractional cascading]], the Guibas–[[Jorge Stolfi|Stolfi]] algorithm for [[Delaunay triangulation]], an optimal data structure for [[point location]], the [[quad-edge]] data structure for representing planar subdivisions, [[Metropolis light transport]], and [[kinetic data structure]]s for keeping track of objects in motion.
