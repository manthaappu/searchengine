<html> <head> <title>Automated Lip Reading</title></head><body>''Automated Lip Reading'' (ALR) is a software technology developed by [[speech recognition]] expert [[Frank Hubner]]. A video image of a person talking can be analysed by the software. The shapes made by the lips can be examined and then turned into sounds. The sounds are compared to a dictionary to create matches to the words being spoken.

The technology was used successfully to analyse silent home movie footage of [[Adolf Hitler]] taken by [[Eva Braun]] at their [[Bavaria]]n retreat [[Berghof (Hitler)|Berghof]].
