A commonly known [[subtraction]] method is the ''borrowing method''<ref>
Only a brief, informal discussion is included here until a formal entry of ''dynamic subtraction'' is provided.</ref>.  To perform '''''a − b''''' using this method, '''''b''''', the [[subtrahend]], is written below '''''a''''', the [[minuend]], such that the digits of the two numbers are aligned in columns.  When a digit of the minuend is smaller than the corresponding digit of the subtrahend below it, the procedure calls for '''''borrowing''''' one power of '''10'''.<ref> This brief discussion of the ''borrowing method'' refers to the decimal number system and decimal place values. The basic procedures described here can be applied to other situations. Only the boundary values and the borrowed magnitudes depend on the number system and the place values. For example, while performing time subtraction, if borrowing is necessary for the '''tens''' digit of the seconds, the borrowed '''minute''' adds '''60''' seconds to the number of seconds specified by the current digit, not '''10'''.</ref> from the digit of the [[minuend]] that is immediately to the left of the current digit.<ref> Also this discussion of the ''borrowing method'' does not address more complex situations such as when the “lending” digit is '''0''' (zero) and, therefore, nothing can be borrowed from it.</ref> Then the value of the "lending" digit is reduced by '''1'''. (More formally this is the ''decomposition algorithm'' because the "borrowed" power of '''10''' does not have to be and is never returned.<ref> Subtraction in the United States: An Historical Perspective, Susan Ross, Mary Pratt-Cotter, ''The Mathematics Educator'', Vol. 8, No. 1 (original publication) and Vol. 10, No. 1 (reprint.)
http://math.coe.uga.edu/TME/Issues/v10n2/5ross.pdf</ref>)  Anyone who subtracts using the borrowing method must do so from right to left, starting at the lowest-value digit and proceeding toward the highest-value digit.  It is also necessary to remember to reduce the value of each “lending” digit by 1 before subtracting the corresponding digit of the subtrahend from it. Because of these requirements, learning subtraction with borrowing is difficult for some students.<ref>[http://www.mathventures.com/mathed/Arithmetic/SubtractionWithoutBorrowingLite.htm  Subtraction Without Borrowing] on [http://www.mathventures.com/ MathVentures]</ref>

An alternative to the borrowing method is '''subtraction without borrowing'''.  There are several methods for subtraction without borrowing. However most of them employ other computational methods that are as complex as the methods they aim to replace or they introduce mathematical concepts for which the students who learn subtraction with borrowing are not ready. Among these are methods that use negative numbers and some variations of the [[method of complements]].

'''Note.''' The subtraction methods mentioned here assume that the minuend is larger than the subtrahend. If the minuend is smaller than the subtrahend, the roles of the numbers are reversed and any subtraction method can be used followed by setting the result to be negative. If the two numbers are equal the result is zero and no method is needed.

== Algorithm ==
The basic algorithm is:

# Change the [[minuend]]:
## Subtract '''1''' from the rightmost consecutive digit that is larger than or equal to the corresponding digit of the [[subtrahend]];
## Change each digit to the right of the digit you reduced by '''1''' (Step #1.1) to '''9''' – this is the new minuend;
# Add '''1''' to the number whose digits you changed to '''9''''s – this sum is the difference between the original minuend and the new one;
# Carry out the subtraction using the new minuend;
# Add the difference you got in Step #2 to the result of Step #3. This is the final answer.

== Descriptive example ==
{{Inappropriate tone|date=April 2008}}
As demonstrated by the example below, subtraction without borrowing employs single-digit subtraction in each column of digits and then addition.

<!--Formatting issue: I did not find a way to underline the subtrahend
and for an indented numbers in monospace font. Therefore, I used a
line of dashes (-) or a line of equal signs (=) as needed.

*Change the minuend to '''59999'''.
*The difference between the original minuend and this new one is '''5433'''.

It is necessary to remember this difference. 
This is easy because it equals to the minuend without its leftmost digit plus '''1''':

== Example 2 - the simplified procedure ==
{{Inappropriate tone|date=April 2008}}{{Inappropriate person|section|date=January 2011}}
A small change in writing the numbers simplifies this procedure significantly, especially during the learning process. <ref>[http://www.mathventures.com/mathed/Arithmetic/SubtractionWithoutBorrowingSimple.htm A descriptive example of the simplified procedure] (at [http://www.mathventures.com MathVentures])</ref>

*We start by writing the two numbers with a blank line between them:

<tt>
        '''  65432'''      (minuend)
        '''       '''
        '''- <u>23894</u>'''      (subtrahend)
</tt>

Since we notice that, in this case, each of the two most-significant digits of the minuend is larger than the corresponding digit of the subtrahend, we...

*Reduce by '''1''' the <u>second</u>most significant digit, not the first, and

*Change <u>only  the last three digits</u> of the minuend to '''9'''.

*Write the new minuend – '''64999''' – on the blank line under the original minuend:
</blockquote>
<tt>
        '''  65432'''      (original minuend)
        '''  64999'''      (new minuend)
        '''- <u>23894</u>'''
</tt>
*Note that the difference between the original minuend and the new one equals the number consisting of the digits that we changed to '''9''' plus '''1''':
<tt>
        '''432 + 1 = 433'''
</tt>

*Now perform the revised subtraction (from the new minuend).
<blockquote>
We continue to write the original minuend for reference only, because it is important to remember the original task; we no longer use it.
</blockquote>
<tt>
        '''  65432'''      (original minuend)
        '''  64999'''      (new minuend)
        '''- <u>23894</u>'''
        '''  41105'''
</tt>
*Finally add the difference, which we noted above, to the result
<tt>
         ''' 41105'''
         '''+<u>  433</u>'''
         ''' 41538'''
         ''' ====='''
</tt>

<blockquote>
This is the final answer '''(65432 - 23894 = 41538)'''.
</blockquote>

After it is completed, the operation may appear on the worksheet like so:
<tt>
        '''  65432'''      (original minuend)
        '''  64999'''      (new minuend)
        '''- <u>23894</u>'''
        '''  41105'''
         '''+<u>  433</u>'''
         ''' 41538'''
         ''' ====='''
</tt>
* Note that the original minuend is not crossed. When kids are taught to cross text they often overdo it to a point the original text can no longer be read. It is important to know the original minuend and be able to reconstruct the original subtraction assignment.

==Notes==
#This is a simplified, informal algorithm. In some cases a different procedure is called for or simpler one can be used. 
#This is a generalization of a common practice of many people, including early-grade students. For example, when facing a subtraction problem such as '''1001 − 567''', teachers have reported that some third-grade students had solved it by doing '''999 − 567 + 2'''. Indeed, a 20th-century system of mathematics known as [[Bharati Krishna Tirtha's Vedic mathematics]] includes this special case as one of its sixteen sutras (principles).

'''SUBTRACTION WITHOUT BORROWING – BY ADDITION METHOD'''

'''PROBLEM: TO SUBTRACT A SMALLER NUMBER (Subtrahend) FROM A LARGER NUMBER (Minuend)'''

'''RULES:'''

1.	Take a large number, for e.g. 5674561 (Minuend) and take another Smaller Number, for e.g. 79562 (Subtrahend), see below:

5674561 – 79562 which if we use a calculator will give us = 5594999 as the answer.

2.	Now, to do this by my “Addition” method, we mentally 'generate' a "New Number" and write all digits of the subtrahend, so that the digits written add up to “9” on all corresponding digits of the subtrahend, exactly in the same place without changing the placement of the value of each corresponding digit, i.e., the unit value under Unit value, the Tens under Tens, Hundreds under Hundreds,,,and so on as the case maybe, as mentioned below:

                                          7   9   5   6   2 (subtrahend)
                                        + 2   0   4   3   7 (We call this the ‘New Number’)
               So that all equal to =     9   9   9   9   9

3.	Now we take the “New Number” from above and place it exactly under the Large Minuend, like below:

                                        5   ''''6''''  7   4   5   6   1 (Minuend)
                                                 2   0   4   3  ''''7''''  (“New Number” from the above)

4.	Now we simply add (+) “1” to the last digit (Units digit) of the "New Number", which is ''''7''''  & subtract (-) “1” from the “next”  corresponding digit of the Minuend, which is larger in value in relation to the highest value placement of the “New Number”, which is ''''6'''', so that they now appear as below:

                                    5   ('''6''' – 1 = 5)   7   4   5   6   1
                                                      2   0   4   3  ('''7''' +1 = 8)

                                         OR, as below:

                                         5   5   7   4   5   6   1
                                                 2   0   4   3   8 

5.	Now by simply “ADDING” the above numbers, we shall always get the correct result, to the original numbers, if Minuend & Subtrahend were subtracted by the conventional method of borrowing, which we learnt in school,,,Don’t believe me, then see it for yourself as below:

                                        5   5   7   4   5   6   1
                                ADD (+)         2   0   4   3   8 

                    You Get    =       5    5   9   4    9   9   9 --- which is the ANSWER

Also, where the number of digits are the same on both Minuend & Subtrahend, the (-) "1" of Rule 4 (as mentioned above) on the Minuend will automatically be on the very first digit of the Minuend from left, i.e. the Highest value in terms of placement. See below, as another e.g. :

6.	Lets say the Minuend is 76584 and the Subtrahend is 57689. Now by applying all the Rules mentioned above, we get :

                                                5   7   6   8   9  (Subtrahend)
                               Add (+)          4   2   3   1   0  (“New Number” generated)
                                                9   9   9   9   9

Now, because the number of digits are the same in both the Minuend and subtrahend, we do not subtract (-) “1” from the Minuend, but just leave it on the left side of the Highest Value Digit in terms of placement of the minuend and then put the “New Number” generated mentally, as above, exactly under the Minuend, as below :

                                          '''(-1)'''  7   6   5   8   4
                                    Add (+)     4   2   3   1  (0 + 1) 
  
                                               OR as below :

                                        '''(-1)'''    '''‘7’'''  6   5   8   4
                                    Add (+)     '''‘4’'''  2   3   1   1   

Now, by simply adding the above, we shall get the answer, and because the figures '''‘7’''' of the minuend & '''‘4’''' of the “New Number” add upto '''“11”''', we leave '''“1” (Units Value)''' on the product & carry-forward the '''“1” of the ‘Ten’s’ Value''', to '''“CANCEL”''' itself with the '''(-) “1”''' of the Minuend, which we had left on the side of the Minuend, as below :

                                                ‘7’  6   5   8   4
                                    Add (+)     ‘4’  2   3   1   1   

                                                ‘1’  8   8   9   5   we have the answer.

Hence we get the answer = 18895, because carry-forwarding '''“1”''' ( '''by adding “7” of the Minuend & “4” of the Subtrahend, which were the numbers on the “Highest” Value placement'''), '''“CANCELLED”''' itself with the '''(-) “1”''' that was left on the side of the Minuend when we followed 'Rule 4' mentioned above. This we have to do, when the number of digits are the same as the Minuend & the Subtrahend, as mentioned above.  Having said the above, please also note, that it may not always be the case that there may be any "carry-over" happening, so to say, that in case the Highest integers of the Minuend & the "New Number" add up to say "7" (i.e. if the Highest value of the Minuend is "4" & that of the "New Number" is let's say "3"), then the (-) "1" that we put on the left side of the Minuend, will automatically reduce the Highest placed digit of the Minuend, to get the result.                                  

Try doing the above on any numbers, Big or Small, even if they are in Decimals and you shall always get the correct result, as long as you follow all the RULES mentioned above.

Another ‘Tip’ is to convert the last ‘Unit’ placed digit of the “New Number” directly to “10” instead of “9”, then you don’t need to add “1” like I did above.

NOTE: In case the Subtrahend is larger than the Minuend, the two numbers will interchange themselves in their roles, i.e. the Minuend becomes Subtrahend & vice-versa, and a (-) negative sign will appear next to the answer, as is the case in any method of subtraction.</body> </html>
