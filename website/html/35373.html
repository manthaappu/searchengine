A '''''spinner''''' is a method of [[random]]ly determining something in a game, often movement.  There are two types of spinners:

#A balanced arrow anchored to a hard backing, usually cardboard, with printed sections.  A spinner is used in some games instead of [[Dice]] because a spinner provides more space to print text or images.  This type of spinner may have different-sized sections to provide a random distribution that would be more difficult to achieve with [[dice]].
#A polyhedral [[top]] that is spun (rather than rolled like [[dice]]) to produce a random result.  An example of this type of spinner is a [[Dreidel]].
