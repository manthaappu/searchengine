'''Eric''' is a [[Free software|free]] [[integrated development environment]] for the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] programming languages.

By design, it acts as a front end for several programs, for example the [[QScintilla]] editor widget, the python language interpreter, Bicycle Repair Man for [[code refactoring]], [[Python Profiler]] for [[code profiling]]. Any functionality that is not required does not have to be installed. It is written using the [[PyQt]] Python bindings for the [[Qt (framework)|Qt GUI toolkit]].

The main features are a project manager, an editor with syntax highlighting, debugging, profiling, running python code with support for command-line parameters, [[unit testing]], [[user interface]] design, a console for program output and a task manager (self-updating [[TODO list]]).

Several allusions are made to the British comedy group [[Monty Python]], which the Python programming language is named after. Eric alludes to [[Eric Idle]], a member of the group. [[Bicycle Repair Man]] is named after the Monty Python skit of the same name.

=== Debugger ===
Eric includes an integrated graphical debugger, that supports interactive probing while suspended and auto breaking on exceptions.
