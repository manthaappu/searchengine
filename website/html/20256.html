To circumvent this problem, various numeric or diagram-based notation systems have been developed to facilitate communication of patterns or tricks between jugglers, as well the investigation and discovery of new patterns.

==Diagram-based systems==
While diagrams are the most visual and reader-friendly way to notate many juggling patterns, they rely on images, so are complicated to produce and unwieldy to share via text or speech.

* '''Ladder diagrams''' - Each rung on the "ladder" represents a point in time (or "beat"). The juggled objects are represented as lines, their paths through time and between a pair of hands.
* '''Causal diagrams''' - Similar to the ladder diagram but doesn't show the props held in a juggler's hands. Instead it only shows each "problem" &mdash; an incoming prop &mdash; and what the juggler should do to make space in his or her hands to catch that incoming prop. It is usually used for [[passing (juggling)|club passing]] and can be displayed or edited in some juggling software.
*'''Mills Mess State Transition Diagrams''' - [[Mills Mess]] is a popular pattern in which the arms cross and uncross. Mills Mess State Transition Diagrams can be used to track these basic arm movements.

==Numeric systems==
The following notation systems use only numbers and common characters. The patterns can easily be communicated by text. Most numeric systems are designed to be processed by software juggling simulators &mdash; for example, to view juggling patterns as computer animations.

===Siteswap===
{{Main|Siteswap}}
Developed by mathematically-inclined jugglers Bengt Magnusson and [[Bruce Boppo Tiemann]] in 1985,<ref name=newsci/><ref name=nyt>{{cite news|last=Donahue |first=Bill |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/16/science/jugglers-now-juggle-numbers-to-compute-new-tricks-for-ancient-art.html |title=Jugglers Now Juggle Numbers to Compute New Tricks for Ancient Art |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1996-04-16 |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}</ref><ref name=maa>{{cite web|url=http://www.maa.org/reviews/mathjuggling.html |title=Read This: The Mathematics of Juggling |publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]] |date=2003-12-03 |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}</ref> [[siteswap]] is by far the most common juggling notation. In its most basic form, "vanilla siteswap", it is very easy to use, as each pattern is reduced to a simple sequence of digits, such as "3", "97531" or "744". However, vanilla siteswap can notate only the most basic two-handed patterns.

For more slightly more complicated patterns, extra rules and syntax are added to create the following two siteswap extensions:

*''Synchronous Siteswap'', or "Synch" Siteswap. This is used to notate patterns where both hands throw at the same time, rather than alternating left and right hands.
*''Multiplex Siteswap''. "Multiplex", in the world of juggling, means "more than one ball is in the hand at the time of the throw". Multiplex Siteswap allows you to notate such patterns, and also can be mixed with synchronous siteswap.

Vanilla, synch, and multiplex siteswap are the "standard" forms of siteswap. Not only are they understood by jugglers, there are also many computer programs capable of animating juggling patterns entered in siteswap notation.

Other extensions to siteswap have been developed for specific purposes. These are far less common than the "standard" forms of siteswap, understood by far fewer jugglers and only specialized software.

*'''Passing siteswap''' - used for simple passing patterns.
*'''Multi-Hand Notation''' (MHN) - Developed by Ed Carstens for use with his juggling program JugglePro, MHN can describe patterns with any number of hands and at any rhythm, but use is limited due to its being as complex as a computer programming language.
*'''Generalized Siteswap''' (GS) - Developed by Ben Beever, GS places siteswap into a matrix that uses optional, additional rows to describe any desired attributes of the throws or catches within a pattern, such as timing issues (e.g. for synch patterns), number of spins (e.g. for clubs) and hand position/orientation (e.g. for backcrosses, claw catches etc.).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jugglingdb.com/compendium/geek/notation/siteswap/bensguide.html?page=3|title=SS Ben's Guide to Juggling Patterns|last=Beever|first=Ben|date=20 January 2002|work=The Internet Juggling Database|accessdate=5 February 2010}}</ref>

===Beatmap===
'''Beatmap''' is a new juggling notation system, developed in 2004 by [[Luke Burrage]].<ref>[http://jugglewiki.org/wiki/Beatmap_Notation Beatmap Notation - JuggleWiki<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> While there are some similarities between beatmap and synch siteswap, there are also fundamental differences. The most important is that beatmap notates every "hand" on every beat during a pattern, unlike all forms of siteswap, which only notate each hand on every other beat. This means that beatmap can notate any number of hands and in any rhythm with no added complexity, unlike siteswap, which needs many extended sets of rules and syntax to be able to communicate the same patterns.

Beatmap notates not only each throw, but also the time and place of each catch. By including a simple indication of crossing and uncrossing arms, beatmap can notate [[Mills Mess]]&ndash;style patterns. Within beatmap it is also possible and easy to notate not only the balls in a pattern, but also the hands or arms of the juggler, as well as the position, location or orientation of the body of a juggler. Users claim that beatmap can more accurately describe more patterns than all ladder diagrams, causal diagrams, Mills Mess state transition diagrams, vanilla siteswap, synch siteswap, passing siteswap, and multi-hand notation combined. 

So far use of beatmap has been very limited, as most jugglers and juggling software understand only variations of siteswap.
