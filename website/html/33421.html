'''Scour Inc.''' was a [[multimedia]] search engine on the internet, and provided '''Scour Exchange''', an early [[peer-to-peer]] file exchange service. Scour was founded by five students (Vince Busam, Michael Todd, Dan Rodriques, Jason Droege and Kevin Smilak) from the Computer Science Department of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] ([[UCLA]]) in [[1997]]. It moved into the spotlight in 1999 when former Disney president [[Michael Ovitz]] bought about a quarter of its shares.

The company's nice early products were an [[Server message block|SMB]] search engine and '''Scour Media Agent''', a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] application to download files from SMB shares. The search engine would probe IP addresses for publicly shared files and then index them for download by other users.

In [[1998]], the company developed a web [[search engine]] as well, [[Web crawler|crawling]] the [[World Wide Web]] for links to multimedia audio, video and images.

In [[1999]] Scour received an investment from [[Michael Ovitz]] and the [[Yucaipa Company]], an investment arm of the billionaire [[Ronald Burkle]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB928970934179363266.html|title=Ovitz, Yucaipa Buy Majority Stake In Entertainment Search Engine|last=Orwall|first=Bruce|date=June 10, 1999|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref> Together, the total investment represented a controlling share in the company. After the investment, Scour expanded in terms of product offerings and personnel. The company launched a software product named [[MyCaster]] which allowed users to stream audio over the network, optionally mixing microphone input with an [[MP3]] audio file in real time.

Faced with the increasing popularity of [[Napster]], Scour developed a competing peer-to-peer service named Scour Exchange.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E2D9113AF931A15756C0A9669C8B63|title=Agent's Role In Music Site May Be Shift In Rights War|last=Richtel|first=Matt|date=May 22, 2000|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref> Unlike Napster, the Scour software supported video and images in addition to just audio files, and integrated all users into one network. The company also tied its web site promotional materials to the Scour Exchange software and attempted to leverage its web and SMB indexes in providing additional search results inside the Scour Exchange application. 

In the summer of [[2000]] the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and the [[National Music Publishers Association]] (NMPA) brought a lawsuit against Scour, alleging copyright infringement.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E7DF173AF932A15754C0A9669C8B63|title=Movie and Record Companies Sue a Film Trading Site|last=Richtel|first=Matt|date=July 21, 2000|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref> Despite Scour's declarations of innocence, the company was not able to raise money to continue operations.  They laid off most of its staff in September of that year and filed for bankruptcy protection, to protect itself from the lawsuit, shortly afterwards.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/Well-scrubbed-business-plan-not-enough-for-Scour/2100-1023_3-245445.html|title=Well-scrubbed business plan not enough for Scour|last=Borland|first=John|date=September 7, 2000|work=[[CNET Networks|CNET]]|accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref> The company's assets went up for auction and, following a bidding war, all assets were purchased by [[Centerspan Communications]] of [[Portland, Oregon]] in late December of that year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/13/business/fi-64827|title=Scour’s Assets Go to Rival for $9 Million|last=Huffstutter|first=P.

==Scour metasearch engine==

Scour has since relaunched in early 2008 as a [[metasearch engine]] combining the three most used search engines–[[Google]], [[Yahoo]] and [[Live Search]]–into a single [[aggregate data|aggregated]] search page with [[social software|social concepts]]. Scour rewards users with a point for each unique search conducted through the Scour Toolbar or at the website, as well as for commenting or rating a result (to a maximum of three points per search). Points can also be acquired through use of its [[affiliate program]], with a matching 25% commission given to the host of the referral. Once users have accumulated a certain amount of points they can be redeemed for a [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] [[gift card]] or [[PayPal]] [[money transfer]]<ref>http://scour.com/learnmore/</ref> at an implied [[exchange rate]] of approximately [[United States Dollar|USD$]]0.004 (2/5¢) a point<!-- The FAQ lists three options. The lowest denomination is slightly less; they rounded to 6500 instead of using 6250. -->. The rate for those not in its target [[demographic]], however, is significantly less–only [[United States Dollar|USD$]]0.0001 per point.<ref>http://www.scour.com/faq/#16</ref>

Scour doesn't give out rewards anymore.The program was cancelled in the summer of 2009.

==Scour Re-direct Virus==

Scour.com is now a virus re-direct site since November 2010.  Original student founders of Scour.com (Vince Busam, Michael Todd, Dan Rodriques, Jason Droege and Kevin Smilakare; UCLA 1997) are believed to be responsible for the virus redirects to their site.  Legal action against scour.com is being solicited from users who's computers were infected with the student's virus.
