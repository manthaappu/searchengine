'''ArchiMate''' is an open and independent [[enterprise architecture]] [[modelling language]] to support the description, analysis and visualization of architecture within and across [[business]] domains<ref name="Archi">[http://www.archimate.org/en/about_archimate/what_is_archimate.html What is ArchiMate?] at archimate.org. Accessed 18 jan 2009</ref> in an unambiguous way.

ArchiMate is one of the open standards hosted by the [[Open Group]] and is based on the [[IEEE 1471]] standard. It is supported by various tool vendors and consulting firms.

ArchiMate distinguishes itself from other languages such as [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) and [[Business Process Modeling Notation]] (BPMN) by its well defined [[metamodel]], and wider [[enterprise modelling]] scope.<ref>Pallab Saha (2008) ''Advances in Government Enterprise Architecture''. p.39.</ref>

== Overview ==
Just like an architectural drawing in classical building architecture describes the various aspects of the construction and use of a building, ArchiMate offers a common language for describing the construction and operation of [[business processes]], organizational structures, [[information flow]]s, IT systems, and technical infrastructure. This insight helps the different [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] to design, assess, and communicate the consequences of decisions and changes within and between these business domains.

An [[architecture framework]] is used to structure the concepts and relationships of the ArchiMate language. It divides the [[enterprise architecture]] in to a business, application and technology layer. In each layer, three aspects are considered: active elements that exhibit [[behavior]] (e.g. Process and Function), an internal [[structure]] and elements that define use or communicate [[information]].

One of the objectives of the ArchiMate language is to define the relationships between concepts in different architecture domains. The concepts of this language therefore hold the middle between the detailed concepts, that are used for modeling individual domains, for example, the [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] for modeling [[software]] products.<ref>Zoran Stojanović et al. (2007). ''Service-oriented Software System Engineering''. p.145-146.</ref>, and [[BPMN]] which is used for business process modeling. 

== History ==
ArchiMate is partly based on the [[IEEE 1471]] standard. It was developed in the Netherlands by a project team from the [[Telematica Instituut]] in cooperation with several [[Netherlands|Dutch]] partners from government, industry and academia. Among the partners were Ordina, [[Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen]], the Leiden Institute for Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) and the [[Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica]] (CWI). Later, tests were performed in organizations such as [[ABN AMRO]], the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration and the [[Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP|ABP]].<ref>Telematica Instituut (2006) [https://doc.telin.nl/dscgi/ds.py/Get/File-64437 Annual Report 2005]. p.7. Accessed 18 jan 2009.</ref> 

The development process lasted from July 2002 to December 2004, and took about 35 man years and approximately 4 million euros. The development was funded by the Dutch government (Dutch Tax and Customs Administration), and business partners, including [[ABN AMRO]] and the ABP Pension Fund.<ref name="Snair007"> [http://earchpal.wordpress.com/2008/08/03/archimate-its-time-has-come/ ArchiMate : Its Time Has Come?] Enterprise Architecture Demystified. Posted by snair007 on August 3, 2008</ref>

In 2008 ArchiMate was accepted and hosted as an open standard by the [[Open Group]].

=== Layers ===
ArchiMate offers a three layered [[view model|view]]:<ref name="Archi"/><ref name="Snair007"/>
* The ''Business layer'' about [[business processes]], services, functions and events of business units. This layer "offers products and services to external customers, which are realized in the organization by business processes performed by business actors and roles". 

* The ''Application layer'' about [[software application]]s that "support the components in the business with application services".  

* The ''Technology layer'' deals "with the [[hardware]] and [[communication]] infrastructure to support the Application Layer. This layer offers infrastructural services needed to run applications, realized by computer and communication hardware and system software".

Each layer "aims to provide a natural way to look at [[service-oriented model]]s. Each layer is self contained despite being a component of the integrated model, and caters to one or more architecture domains".<ref name="Archi"/><ref name="Snair007"/>
