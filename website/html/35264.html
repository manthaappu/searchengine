{{About|technical or social associations|other uses|Interest group (disambiguation)}}
A '''Special Interest Group''' ('''SIG''') is a community with an interest in advancing a specific area of knowledge, learning or technology where members cooperate to effect or to produce solutions within their particular field, and may communicate, meet, and organize [[business conference|conferences]]. They may at times also [[advocate]] or [[lobbying|lobby]] on a particular issue or on a range of issues but are generally distinct from [[Advocacy groups]] and pressure groups which are normally set up for the specific political aim; the distinction is not firm however and some organizations can adapt and change their focus over time.

==Mathematics SIGs==
The [[Mathematical Association of America]] includes several SIGs (known collectively as SIGMAAs) on mathematical areas.<ref>

==Non-technical SIGs==
Organizations which are not technical may also have Special Interest Groups which are normally focused on a mutual interest<ref name="The Community Discovered Special Interest Groups">[http://communitydisc.westside66.org/HTML/sigs/ The Community Discovered Special Interest Groups], groups for specific interests within an educational organization.</ref> or shared characteristic of a subset of members of the organization.<ref name="FGC Summer Gathering AYF Program">[http://fgcquaker.org/gathering/overview/kids-teens-young-adults/adult-young-friends Friends General Conference Summer Gathering Adult Young Friends Program], a young adult-focused SIG in a [[Quaker]] organization.</ref> An important example for this are [[trade unions]]. For identity-based advocacy groups, see [[identity politics]]. [[JALT]], the Japan Association of Language Teachers, has several SIGs. Together they organise a [[Pan-SIG]] conference each year.
