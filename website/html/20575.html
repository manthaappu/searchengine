:''For other people called Kevin Long: see [[Kevin Long]]''

'''Kevin Long''' is a graphic artist best known for his [[airbrush]] paintings and black-and-white illustrations in the genres of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]]. He was the premiere artist at [[Palladium Books]] from 1987 until 1995 and served as one of the original contributors to the [[Rifts (role-playing game)|Rifts]] [[role-playing game]] (RPG) series.  Much of his work during this period helped establish the style and tone of ''Rifts'' and had a tremendous influence on the quality of art in RPG publications.

==Biography==
Kevin Long grew up in [[Battle Creek, Michigan|Battle Creek]], [[Michigan]] and attended the [[College for Creative Studies]] in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], where he majored in advertising illustration. Upon graduating, Kevin worked in the local advertising industry. Having completed a five-year stint in his chosen profession, he was lured away by the artistic and creative freedom offered by Palladium Books. While there, Kevin built his reputation as one of the most popular illustrators in the role-playing industry. In addition to having created the dynamic look of various characters, vehicles, and equipment in ''Rifts'', he co-authored a number of other Palladium RPG titles. However, Kevin was dismissed from Palladium in August 1995 for unspecified reasons.<ref>[http://sirtenzan.tripod.com/RIFTS/official.html Official RIFTS Errata]</ref>

In October 1997, [[Raven Software]] hired Kevin as a 2-D artist. He was responsible for some of the graphics in [[Hexen II: Portal of Praevus]], [[Heretic II]], [[Soldier of Fortune (video game)|Soldier of Fortune]], [[Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force]], [[Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix]] and [[Quake 4]].<ref>[http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/quake-iv/611006p1.html GameSpy: The Art and Design of Quake4]</ref> In 2007, Kevin was the Art Lead on [[Wolfenstein (video game)|Wolfenstein]].<ref>[http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,9823/ MobyGames - Kevin Long]</ref>

Works are listed in order of publication date within their respective categories.

===Palladium Books===
Nearly all of Long's illustrations appearing in titles released after his departure from Palladium are taken from earlier publications.<ref group="nb">In the premiere issue of ''The Rifter'' (Smith ed. 1998, p. 4), which featured one of Long's most iconic images - a ley line walker from the ''[[Rifts]]'' RPG (Siembieda 1990, p. 133) - on its front cover, [[Kevin Siembieda]] claimed "there is a pile of Long art done for [[Palladium Books|Palladium]] that has yet to see publication." Since then, only 11 previously unreleased illustrations have appeared in print, the last instance of which occurred in 2001.</ref> The liberal (and occasionally indiscriminate) recycling of artwork, both within and among their various game series, is a peculiar though fairly standard characteristic of Palladium books.<ref group="nb">To demonstrate, consider what may be Long's most seminal contribution to the Palladium legacy: his work on the ''Rifts'' RPG core rulebook (Siembieda 1990). There are 102 individual illustrations to his credit in this particular title (not counted are a pair on which Long and Siembieda collaborated). Of these, six were previously featured in other books. Accounting for all repeat occurrences (13 images appear more than once), what remains are the title and logo, seven colour plates, one colour line illustration, and 66 black-and-white line illustrations - 75 in total. To date, 48 of these images have been reused in 22 titles over five separate game series - primarily ''Rifts Ultimate Edition'' (Siembieda et al. 2005) - and in nine issues of ''The Rifter''; one of them has reappeared ten times in seven other titles.</ref> Resultingly, it is not uncommon to encounter illustrations that either recur multiple times over the span of a single volume<ref group="nb">In ''Rifts World Book Five: Triax and the NGR'' (Siembieda & Long 1994), for instance, certain elements of "First-Timer", a short [[comic|illustrated narrative]] by Long (p. 25–32), are reproduced elsewhere on pages 10, 15, 17, 24, 80, 124, 164, 165, 172, 206, 214, and 219 of the same book.</ref> or lack some degree of relevance to the subject at hand due to being applied outside of their original contexts.<ref group="nb">One especially egregious attempt to repurpose an illustration can be seen on page 70 of ''Mystic China'' (Wujcik & Siembieda 1995). The original, from ''Rifts Conversion Book'' (Siembieda 1991, p. 90), depicts a male [[Elf (fantasy)|elf]] in the process of weaving an [[Incantation|enchantment]]; it accompanies a description of the elven race from the ''[[Palladium Fantasy Role-playing Game|Palladium Fantasy RPG]]'' setting. In ''Mystic China'', however, the image is featured in a section about [[qi]] and [[feng shui]]. The subject's hair has been lengthened on both sides in order to conceal the tips of his pointed ears (a near-universal racial characteristic of elves in the [[fantasy]] genre), and he has also been furnished with a [[Fu Manchu moustache|Fu Manchu]]-style moustache, presumably to give him a more "ethnic" countenance. It cannot be ascertained whether Long or someone else is responsible for these alterations; given that all of his other illustrations in ''Mystic China'' were also taken from other titles, it is unclear whether or not he was involved in the book's production.</ref> It is frequently the case that these illustrations are not reproduced in their entirety, portions having been trimmed away or the image itself reoriented in order to frame and focus upon certain elements or merely conform to space limitations.<ref group="nb">Long's quarter-page illustration in ''Rifts Conversion Book'' (Siembieda 1991, p. 83) of a [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] atop a mountain - clouds swirling overhead as he calls down a bolt of lightning from the sky - has been featured, at least in part, among several other Palladium titles. Small segments of the image, vaguely centered on the eye of the vortex (and not showing much else), are found serving as placeholders on page 67 of ''Rifts World Book Two: Atlantis'' (Siembieda, Sheiring, & Marciniszyn 1992), and again - reframed slightly and turned upside down, for no discernible reason - on page 144 of ''Rifts World Book 18: Mystic Russia'' (Siembieda, Sumimoto, & Cartier 1998). In all cases, the illustration's provenance is not indicated.</ref> Subsequently, the signature or identifying mark of the artist - traditionally located at or near the margins of the work - may be omitted, which can make it difficult to determine a given illustration's authorship. Such is the case with many of Long's contributions to Palladium; despite having received attribution on a given book's title page, often the sole means of identifying specific instances of his work is through recognition of his singular style and technique.<ref group="nb">There are a number of titles published just before and then following Long's separation from Palladium in which his work was used but his name was not correspondingly listed on their respective title pages. Several of them - ''[[Nightbane]]'' (Carella & Siembieda 1995, p. 186); ''The Rifter Number 7'' (Smith ed. 1999, p. 70); ''Rifts Aftermath'' (Siembieda & Coffin 2002, p. 45); etc. - involve large or otherwise full-page illustrations. In certain cases, there would appear to be a catchall category - such as "other Palladium madmen" in ''The Rifter'' - designed to cover any contributors not specifically mentioned, but the work is still listed as "uncredited" for purposes of this section.</ref> (It should be pointed out that Long is not the only artist employed by Palladium, whether past or present, for whom this holds true.)
