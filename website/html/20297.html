<html> <head> <title>Justesen code</title></head><body>In [[coding theory]], '''Justesen codes''' form a class of [[Error detection and correction|error-correcting codes]] which are derived from [[Reed-Solomon code]]s and have good error-control properties.

==Definition==
Let ''R'' be a Reed-Solomon code of length ''N'' = 2<sup>''m''</sup> &minus; 1, [[dimension (vector space)|rank]] ''K'' and minimum weight ''N'' &minus; ''K'' + 1.  The symbols of ''R'' are elements of ''F'' = GF(2<sup>''m''</sup>) and the codewords are obtained by taking every polynomial &fnof; over ''F'' of degree less than ''K'' and listing the values of &fnof; on the non-zero elements of ''F'' in some predetermined order.  Let α be a [[primitive element (finite field)|primitive element]] of ''F''.  For a codeword '''a''' = (''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''N''</sub>) from ''R'', let '''b''' be the vector of length 2''N'' over ''F'' given by

:<math> \mathbf{b} = \left( a_1, a_1, a_2, \alpha^1 a_2, \ldots, a_N, \alpha^{N-1} a_N \right) </math>

and let '''c''' be the vector of length 2''N'' ''m'' obtained from ''b'' by expressing each element of ''F'' as a binary vector of length ''m''.  The ''Justesen code'' is the linear code containing all such '''c'''.

==Properties==
The parameters of this code are length 2''m'' ''N'', dimension ''m'' ''K'' and [[minimum distance]] at least 

:<math> \sum_{i=1}^\ell i \binom{2m}{i} . </math>

The Justesen codes are examples of [[concatenated code]]s.
