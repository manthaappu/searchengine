<html> <head> <title>Multi-agent planning</title></head><body>In [[computer science]] '''multi-agent planning''' involves coordinating the resources and activities of multiple "[[Software agent|agents]]".

[[NASA]] says, "multiagent planning is concerned with [[plan|planning]] by (and for) multiple agents. It can involve agents planning for a common goal, an agent coordinating the plans (plan merging) or planning of others, or agents refining their own plans while negotiating over tasks or resources. The topic also involves how agents can do this in real time while executing plans (distributed continual planning). Multiagent scheduling differs from multiagent planning the same way planning and scheduling differ: in scheduling often the tasks that need to be performed are already decided, and in practice, scheduling tends to focus on algorithms for specific problem domains".
