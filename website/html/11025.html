'''Double mass analysis''' <ref>Searcy, J.K. and C.H. Hardison (1960). Double-mass curves. U.S. Geological Survey ''Water-Supply Paper ''1541-B''''</ref> is a commonly used data analysis approach for investigating the behaviour of records made of [[hydrology|hydrological]] or [[meteorology|meteorological]] data at a number of locations. It is used to determine whether there is a need for corrections to the data to account for changes in data collection procedures or other local conditions. Such changes may result from a variety of things including changes in instrumentation, changes in observation procedures, or changes in gauge location or surrounding conditions. Double mass analysis for checking consistency of a hydrological or meteorological record is considered to be an essential tool before taking it for analysis purpose.

An example of a double mass analysis is a "double mass plot", or "double mass curve"<ref>Wilson, E.M. (1983) Engineering Hydrology, 3rd edition. Macmillan Press, London. p.27</ref>. For this, points and/or a joining line are plotted where the x- and y- coordinates are determined by the running totals of the values observed at two stations. If both stations are affected to the same extent by the same trends then a double mass curve should follow a straight line. A break in the slope of the curve would indicate that conditions have changed at one location but not at another.
