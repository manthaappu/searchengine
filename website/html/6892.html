A '''(digital) color image''' is a [[digital image]] that includes [[color]] information for each [[pixel]]. 

For visually acceptable results, it is necessary (and almost sufficient) to provide three [[sample (signal)|sample]]s (''color channels'')  for each pixel, which are interpreted as coordinates in some color space. The [[RGB]] color space is commonly used in computer displays, but other spaces such as [[YCbCr]], [[HSV color space|HSV]], and are often used in other contexts.

==Color image representation==
A color image is usually stored in memory as a [[raster graphics|raster map]], a two-dimensional array of small integer triplets; or (rarely) as three separate raster maps, one for each channel.

Eight bits per sample (24 bits per pixel) seem to be adequate for most uses, but faint [[banding artifact]]s may still be visible in some smoothly varying images, especially those which have been subject to [[digital image processing|processing]].  Particularly demanding applications may use 10 bits per sample or more. 

On the other hand, some widely used [[image file format]]s and [[graphics card]]s may use only 8 bits ''per pixel'', i.e. only 256 different colors, or 2&ndash;3 bits per channel.  Converting continuous-tone images like photographs to such formats requires [[dithering]] and yields rather grainy and fuzzy results.

Graphics cards that support 16 bits per pixel provide 65536 distinct colors, or 5&ndash;6 bits per channel.  This resolution seems to be satisfactory for non-professional uses, even without dithering.
