'''Digg''' is a [[social news]] [[website]]. Prior to Digg v4, its cornerstone function consisted of letting people vote stories up or down, called ''digging'' and ''burying'', respectively. Digg's former popularity prompted the creation of other [[social networking]] sites with story submission and voting systems.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pat McCarthy |url=http://www.conversionrater.com/index.php/2006/09/10/revisiting-top-10-web-predictions-of-2006/ |title=Revisiting Top 10 Web Predictions of 2006 |publisher=Conversionrater.com |date=2006-09-10 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref> The website traffic ranked 130th by [[Alexa internet|Alexa.com]] as of January 2, 2011.<ref name="Alexa Internet, Inc"/> Quantcast estimates Digg's monthly U.S. unique visits at 8.5 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quantcast.com/digg.com |title=digg.com - Quantcast Audience Profile |publisher=Quantcast.com |date=2010-10-27 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref>

==History and description==
[[Image:Digg1.6.png|left|thumb|200px|Digg, Version 1.6]]

Digg started out as an experiment in November 2004 by [[Kevin Rose]], Owen Byrne, Ron Gorodetzky, and Jay Adelson. Only Rose still plays an active role in the management of the site. The original design was free of advertisements, and was designed by Dan Ries. As Digg became more popular, Google [[AdSense]] was added to the website. In July 2005, the site was updated to Version 2.0. The new version featured a friends list, the ability to "digg" a story without being redirected to a success page, and a new interface designed by web design company silverorange.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.silverorange.com/a/portfolio/digg |title=Digg |publisher=silverorange |date= |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref> The site developers have stated that in future versions a more minimalist design will likely be employed. On Monday June 26, 2006 version 3 of Digg was released with specific categories for Technology, Science, World & Business, Videos, Entertainment and Gaming as well as a View All section where all categories are merged. Digg has grown large enough that submissions sometimes create a sudden increase of traffic to the "dugg" website. This is referred to by some Digg users as the "[[Digg effect]]" and by some others as the site being "dugg to death." However, in many cases stories are linked simultaneously on several popular bookmarking sites. In such cases, the impact of the "digg effect" is difficult to isolate and assess. On August 27, 2007, Digg altered its main interface, mostly in the profile area. The domain "digg.com" attracted at least 236 million visitors annually by 2008 according to a [[Compete.com]] survey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siteanalytics.compete.com/digg.com?metric=uv |title=Compete.com |publisher=Siteanalytics.compete.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref>

Digg CEO Jay Adelson explained at the 2010 "Bigg Digg Shindigg," which is part of the South by Southwest Interactive Conference, that Digg is getting a major overhaul and redesign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2010/03/13/new-digg/ |title=New Version of Digg |publisher=Mashable |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> In an interview with Wired magazine, Adelson explained that "Every single thing has changed" and that "the entire website has been rewritten."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/03/digg-redesign-social-web/ |title=Wired Interview |publisher=Wired |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> Adelson explains that the new Digg will essentially eliminate the duplication problem. It will also help prevent so called 'power users' from dominating the site with their submissions. The new Digg will also offer users a personalized homepage, based on their diggs, that is tailored to their specific interests. The commenting system will be updated to "help fight bad behavior like trolling or group-burying." The entire look of the site will also change. Adelson summed up the new Digg by saying, “We’ve got a new backend, a new infrastructure layer, a new services layer, new machines — everything." John Quinn wrote in a Digg blog post that the company was going to stop using [[MySQL]] and begin using [[Apache Cassandra|Cassandra]], a distributed database system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://about.digg.com/blog/saying-yes-nosql-going-steady-cassandra/ |title=Cassandra Switch |publisher=Digg |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> 

On April 5, 2010, Kevin Rose announced that he would be assuming the position of CEO as Jay Adelson had stepped down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://about.digg.com/blog/update-jay |title=Update from Jay &#124; Digg About |publisher=About.digg.com |date=2010-04-04 |accessdate=2010-09-01}}</ref> Although, some time later he has disclosed that he is actively seeking a replacement CEO as the role takes up too much of his time that he would rather spend doing other things, such as angel investing.

On August 25, 2010, Digg released v4. The site experienced a number of bugs and glitches that has resulted in a backlash from Digg users in the form of verbal opposition and, initially, heavy posting of articles from [[Reddit]] - a competitor of Digg's. Digg's business development director Matt Van Horn left Digg after the official update of version 4.<ref>{{cite news | first = Caroline | last = McCarthy | title = Digg's Matt Van Horn leaving for start-up Path | date = 2010-08-26 | url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-20014852-36.html | work = CNET News | accessdate = 2010-09-02}}</ref> 

On September 1, 2010, Matt Williams took over as CEO, ending Rose's troubled tenure as interim chief executive.

===Potential sale===
Several reports have come forward claiming Digg has been trying to sell itself to a larger company since early 2006.<ref>{{cite web |last=Arrington |first=Michael |url=http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/07/just-sell-digg-already-jay/ |title=Just Sell Digg Already, Jay |publisher=Techcrunch.com |date=2007-11-07 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref> While Adelson claims that Digg will meet with any potential buyers, he denies that they will actively begin talks for a sale. The most recent sale talks were with Google in July 2008 for approximately $200 million. On July 25, during the [[due diligence]] part of the potential sale, Google informed Digg that they were not interested in the purchase.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/26/AR2008072601421.html |title=Google Walks Away From Digg Deal |publisher=washingtonpost.com |accessdate=2009-02-27 | first=Michael | last=Arrington | date=2008-07-26}}</ref> As a result of [[Google]]'s decision, Digg entered into a third round of funding, receiving $28.7 million from [[investors]] such as [[Highland Capital Partners]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. With this funding, the company plans to move from their current offices to accommodate a bigger staff base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.digg.com/?p=256 |title=Digg the Blog » Blog Archive » Big News: Expanding & Growing Digg |publisher=Blog.digg.com |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref> On December 2, 2008, ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' reported "Digg Chief Executive Officer Jay Adelson says the popular news aggregation Web site is no longer for sale, and the focus of the company is to build an independent business that reaches profitability as quickly as possible. That means the four-year-old startup will dial back some of its expansion plans, instead prioritizing projects that generate revenue and profit."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/dec2008/tc2008121_004686.htm |title=Digg: Not For Sale |accessdate=2008-12-09 |last=Ante |first=Spencer E. |date=2008 |month=December}}</ref> On December 18, 2008, ''BusinessWeek'' analyzed Digg's financial statements. They reported that Digg lost $4 million on $6.4 million of revenue in the first three quarters of 2008.<ref name=businessweek>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_52/b4114082618241.htm|title=A Wrench in Silicon Valley's Wealth Machine |accessdate=2008-12-30 |date=2008 |month=December}}</ref>

==Features==

===Facebook Connect===
In May 2009, Digg launched a new feature integrating [[Facebook Connect#Facebook Connect|Facebook Connect]] with Digg.<ref name = connect_digg>{{cite web
  | last = Rose
  | first = Kevin
  | title = Facebook Connect Launches Today!
  | date = May 6, 2009
  | url = http://blog.digg.com/?p=729}}</ref>
The Digg integration with Facebook connect allows users of Digg and Facebook to connect their accounts. When a Facebook account is connected to a Digg account, Digg articles can then be shared on the user's Facebook page.<ref name = connect_tech>{{cite web
  | last = Arrington

  | url = http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/06/digg-to-launch-facebook-connect-today/
  | accessdate = May 9 , 2009 }}</ref> Facebook Connect also allows Facebook users to log into Digg with their Facebook account, thus bypassing the normally required Digg registration.

===Digg Dialogg===
Digg Dialogg allows Digg users to submit questions to a preselected famous individual who agrees to do an interview with a reporter chosen by Digg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digg.com/dialogg/ |title=Digg.com |publisher=Digg.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref>

===Digg Bar===
On April 2, 2009, Digg released the Digg Bar, which provides a toolbar above the top of a site allowing the user to produce shortened urls, or access digg comments and analytics without leaving the page.<ref name = diggbar>{{cite web
  | last = Rose
  | first = Kevin
  | title = DiggBar Launches Today!
  | date = April 2, 2009
  | url = http://blog.digg.com/?p=591}}
</ref>
On April 5, 2010, Kevin Rose announced on the official Digg blog that the controversial DiggBar would be eliminated with the implementation of the 4th version of the website.<ref name = diggbardead>{{cite web
  | last = Rose
  | first = Kevin

  | url = http://about.digg.com/blog/digg-digg-iframe-toolbar-dead-unbanning-domains}}
</ref>
This was Rose's first major announcement since succeeding Jay Adelson as CEO.

===Digg API===
On April 19, 2007, Digg opened their API<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apidoc.digg.com/ |title=Digg.com |publisher=Apidoc.digg.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref> (Application Programing Interface) to the public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.digg.com/?p=72 |title=Digg.com |publisher=Blog.digg.com |date=2007-04-19 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref> This allowed software developers to write tools and applications based on queries of Digg's public data, dating back to 2004. Since then, many blogs<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.techipedia.com/2007/digg-api-tools/ |title=Techipedia.com |publisher=Techipedia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quickonlinetips.com/archives/2005/09/complete-digg-tools-collection/ |title=QuickOnlineTips.com |publisher=QuickOnlineTips.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref> have sought to keep up with all of the ongoing Digg API projects.

== Criticism ==

=== Digg v4 ===

On August 25, 2010, when Digg updated to version 4, the site was unreachable or unstable during the launch day and the weeks following. A large number of the site's members have complained about the new design and removed features (such as bury, favorites, friends submissions, upcoming pages, subcategories, and history search).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gigaom.com/2010/08/26/digg-redesign-met-with-a-thumbs-down/ |title=Digg Redesign Met with a Thumbs Down |author=Mathew Ingram |date=Aug. 26, 2010 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}</ref> Kevin Rose replied to complaints on his blog where he promised to restore upcoming pages and fix the algorithm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kevinrose.com/blogg/2010/8/27/digg-v4-release-iterate-repeat.html |title=Digg v4: release, iterate, repeat. |author=Kevin Rose |date=Aug 27 2010 |accessdate=27 August 2010}}</ref> 

In an open letter to Rose, Alexis Ohanian, founder of rival site [[Reddit]], said :
{{quote|this new version of digg reeks of [[venture capitalist|VC]] meddling. It's cobbling together features from more popular sites and departing from the core of digg, which was to "give the power back to the people."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://alexisohanian.com/an-open-letter-to-kevin-rose |title=An open letter to Kevin Rose |author=Alexis Ohanian |date=May 28, 2010 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}</ref>}}

Ian Eure, former Digg engineer, explained on his blog why the update cannot be reverted, but the old features can still be ported to the new architecture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://atomized.org/2010/08/they-can%E2%80%99t-go-back/ |title=THEY CAN’T GO BACK |author=Ian Eure |date=Aug 30, 2010 |accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref>

Disgruntled Digg users declared August 30, 2010 as the 'quit Digg day' and began digging up stories submitted by Reddit's auto submitting publisher account filling up the front page.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/digg_user_rebellion_reddit_on_front_page.php |title=Digg User Rebellion Continues: Reddit Now Rules the Front Page |publisher=ReadWriteWeb |accessdate=August 31, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/08/30/digg-users-lash-out-at-new-format-join-forces-with-reddit/ |title=Digg Users Lash Out At New Format, Join Forces with Reddit |publisher=Time Magazine |accessdate=August 31, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-20015042-36.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20 |title=Angry Digg users flood home page with Reddit links |publisher=CNet News |accessdate=August 31, 2010}}</ref> Reddit also temporarily added the Digg shovel to their logo to welcome fleeing Digg users.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/30/reddit-digg-rivalry-heats_n_699225.html |title=Angry Users SLAM Digg With Links From Rival Reddit |publisher=The Huffington Post |accessdate=August 31, 2010}}</ref>

Digg's traffic dropped significantly after the launch of version 4,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2010/09/23/diggs-traffic-is-collapsing-at-home-and-abroad/ |title= Digg’s traffic is collapsing at home and abroad |publisher=The Next Web |accessdate=October 20, 2010}}</ref> and publishers reported a drop in direct referrals from stories on Digg's front page.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://socialkeith.com/the-digg-effect-v4/ |title=The Digg Effect v4 |publisher=Social Keith |accessdate=October 20, 2010}}</ref> Recently hired CEO Matt Williams attempted to address some of the users' concerns in a blog post on October 12, 2010, promising to reinstate many of the features that had been removed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://about.digg.com/blog/greetings-new-ceo |title=Greetings from the new CEO |publisher=Digg About |accessdate=October 20, 2010}}</ref>

=== Moderation and algorithms ===

The purpose of Digg was to give editorial powers back to the masses. However, the second version of Digg began using a secret algorithm that blurs the transparency that was expected by the users. In 2006, the site began to be gamed by their top users.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forevergeek.com/2006/04/digg_corrupted_editors_playground_not_userdriven_website/ |title=Digg Corrupted: Editor’s Playground, not User-Driven Website |author=Dave |date=Apr. 20 2006 |work= |publisher=Forevergeek |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref> Supernova17 was banned after agreeing to promote a story for cash to an undercover Digg sting operation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/Digg-continues-to-battle-phony-stories/2100-1025_3-6144652.html |title=Digg continues to battle phony stories |author=Greg Sandoval |date=December 18, 2006 |work= |publisher=CNET News |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref> Another group of users openly formed a niche 'bury brigade' .<ref>{{cite web |url=http://message2paulspammers.blogspot.com/2007/12/diggs-ron-paul-bury-brigade-exposed.html |title=Digg's Ron Paul 'Bury Brigade' exposed |author=Adam |date=December 23, 2007 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref> The users defended themselves claiming their actions were in accordance with the wishes of Digg users. Digg tried to offset criticism by hiring computer scientist Anton Kast to develop a diversity algorithm to prevent special interest groups from dominating Digg. A townhall was organized and the users demanded the shouts feature be discontinued.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bloggingexperiment.com/archives/diggs-20-questions-a-town-hall-recap.php |title=Digg’s 20 Questions: a Town Hall Recap |author=Ben |date=February 26th 2008 |work= |publisher=Bloggingexperiment |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref> By 2008, [[Google]] increased their page rank for Digg and many 'pay for Diggs' startups were created to profit from the opportunity. According to a popular blog a single front page story was sold for $500 at that time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://techcrunch.com/2008/09/03/want-on-the-digg-home-page-thatll-be-1300/ |title=Want On The Digg Home Page?

=== Mob mentality ===

Unlike the present Digg algorithm, which works on user diversity, in 2006 it was much more dependent on flocking behavior among users to determine the promotion of content. During this period an anonymous user posted a blog accusing an O'Reilly writer of stealing Digg's CSS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://steveisbad.blogspot.com/2006/01/steve-mallett-from-oreilly-has-stolen.html |title=Steve Mallett from O'Reilly has stolen digg's code |author=Anonymous |date=JANUARY 09, 2006 |work= |publisher=STEVE'S THEFT |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> The Digg mob flocked to the story and it was promoted with nearly 3000 votes. Digg founders Kevin Rose, Jay Adelson and Daniel Burka expressed dissatisfaction on finding Digg's code on Mallett's sites.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digg.com/security/O_Reilly_writer_Steve_Mallett_has_stolen_digg_s_code |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060113141457/http://digg.com/security/O_Reilly_writer_Steve_Mallett_has_stolen_digg_s_code |archivedate=2006-01-13 |title=Archive.org mirror of the deleted Digg story |author=Digg |date=JANUARY 09, 2006 |work= |publisher=Digg |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> Mallett responded and clarified that the theft of code was committed by the contributors  to the open source Digg clone, Pligg, which he was using.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://steve.tawkr.com/2006/01/10/my-response/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060412182316/http://steve.tawkr.com/2006/01/10/my-response/ |archivedate=2006-04-12 |title=Archive.org mirror of the deleted blog post |author=Steve Mallett  |date=January 10th, 2006 |work= |publisher=Archive |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> Kevin acknowledged the misunderstanding and notified Pligg developers of the issue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://diggtheblog.blogspot.com/2006/01/steve-mallett-digg-code.html |title=Steve Mallett & Digg Code |author=Kevin Rose |date=January 2006 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> Adelson contacted Mallett thanking him for clearing the issue and expressed support for his claims. Another O'Reilly blogger in defense of Mallett posted a criticism of Digg's mob mentality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/01/digging-the-madness-of-crowds.html |title=Digging The Madness of Crowds |author=Nat Torkington |date=Jan 9 2006 |work= |publisher=O'Reilly |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> Digg mob's failure to the Mallett story has also been attributed to 'groupthink' which is different from the wisdom of the crowds which requires independence among the nodes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mashable.com/2006/01/10/digg-and-the-so-called-wisdom-of-mobs/ |title=Digg and the So-Called “Wisdom of Mobs” |author= Pete Cashmore |date= |work= |publisher=Mashable |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref>

{{Main|AACS encryption key controversy}}

On May 1, 2007, an article appeared on Digg's homepage that contained the [[encryption key]] for the [[Advanced Access Content System|AACS]] [[digital rights management]] protection of [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]]. Then Digg, "acting on the advice of its lawyers," removed posting submissions about the secret number from its database and banned several users for submitting it. The removals were seen by many Digg users as a capitulation to corporate interests and an assault on free speech.<ref>{{cite news

=== Organized ideologically-motivated censorship ===
{{main|Digg Patriots}}

On August 5, 2010, progressive blogger [[Ole Ole Olson]] (aka "Novenator") posted a report to [[AlterNet]] about a year-long effort of organized burying of seemingly-liberal articles from the Upcoming module of Digg by a conservative [[Yahoo! Groups]] mailing list known as ''DiggPatriots'' and an associated page on [[coRank]]; he also accused leading members of the mailing list of participating in behavior which violated the Digg Terms of Usage, such as creating "sleeper" accounts in the event of administrators banning their main accounts for terms-violating behavior as well as vexatious "reporting" of seemingly-liberal users for banning.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://blogs.alternet.org/oleoleolson/2010/08/05/massive-censorship-of-digg-uncovered/|title=Massive Censorship of Digg Uncovered|author = Ole Ole Olson|publisher = AlterNet|date =  4:40 am, August 5, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://pubrecord.org/special-to-the-public-record/8121/rigging-of-digg-covert-mob-conservatives/|title = The Rigging Of Digg: How A Covert Mob Of Conservatives Hijacked The Web’s Top Social News Site|author = Ole Ole Olson|publisher = The Public Record|date = Aug 5th, 2010}}</ref> The post was immediately followed by the disbanding and closure of the DiggPatriots list, and an investigation into the matter by Digg.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/aug/06/digg-investigates-claims-conservative-censorship|title = Digg investigates claims of conservative 'censorship'|author = Josh Halliday|date = Friday 6 August 2010 12.29 BST | location=London | work=The Guardian}}</ref>
