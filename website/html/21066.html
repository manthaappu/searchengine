<html> <head> <title>Lady tasting tea</title></head><body>In the [[design of experiments]] in [[statistics]], the '''lady tasting tea''' is a famous [[randomized experiment]] devised by [[Ronald A. Fisher]] and reported in his book ''[[Statistical methods for research workers]].'' The lady in question was [[Muriel Bristol]], and the test used was [[Fisher's exact test]].

In [[popular science]], [[David Salsburg]] published a book entitled ''[[The Lady Tasting Tea]]'',<ref name=S2002>Salsburg (2002)</ref> which describes Fisher's experiment and ideas on [[randomization]]. 

The lady in question claimed to be able to tell whether the tea or the milk was added first to a cup. Fisher proposed to give her eight cups, four of each variety, in random order. One could then ask what the probability was for her getting the number she got correct, but just by chance.

Salsburg<ref name=S2002/> reports that a colleague of Fisher, [[H. Fairfield Smith]] revealed that in the test, the woman got all eight cups correct. The chance of someone who just guesses getting all correct, assuming she guesses that four had the tea put in first and four the milk, would be only 1 in 70 (the [[combination]]s of 8 taken 4 at a time).

[[Deb Basu]] wrote that "the famous case of the 'lady tasting tea'" was "one of the two supporting pillars . . . of the randomization analysis of experimental data".<ref>Basu (1980a, p. 575; 1980b)</ref>
