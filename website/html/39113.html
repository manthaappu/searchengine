A '''VGA box''' is a video converter that allows the display of common analog video standards on a [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] computer monitor.  Video signals converted on this kind of unit range from [[S-Video]] to [[component video]] signals.  Some VGA boxes have audio outputs on them so that they can also act as plug adapters for [[RCA connector|RCA]] audio inputs to use [[computer speaker]]s.  Some models of VGA boxes allow a computer with a multi pin high-resolution port to use them on other occasions.  Others models include devices that convert VGA signals to composite, S-video or [[component video]], as well as [[SCART]] in [[Europe]].

People have used video this type of device so they can use their [[game console]]s, [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]]s and [[DVD player]]s on their computer monitor.  Though in the modern world, media on those formats is feasible to convert to a format playable directly off the computer, sometimes through the opposite function of displaying computer output on a standard NTSC TV with composite/s-video.

Also there is an object called vga to rca converter which converts normal vga to vga to rca which allows you to view multiple screens on different devices
