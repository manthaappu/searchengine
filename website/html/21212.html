In [[computer programming]], '''latent typing''' (as opposed to [[eager typing]] or [[manifest typing]]) is a style of [[Type system|typing]] that does not require (or perhaps even offer) explicit [[Declaration (computer science)|type declaration]]s. Latent typing is heavily associated with [[duck typing]] and [[dynamic typing]] at [[Run time (computing)|runtime]], but may also be achieved by [[type inference]] and [[static typing]] at [[compile time]]. A related term, '''implicit typing''', also covers static type-inference systems with few or no annotations.
