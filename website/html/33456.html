'''Scripts''' were developed in the early AI work by [[Roger Schank]], [[Robert P. Abelson]] and their research group, and are a method of representing [[procedural knowledge]].  They are very much like [[frame (artificial intelligence)|frames]], except the values that fill the slots must be ordered.

The classic example of a script involves the typical sequence of events that occur when a person dines in a restaurant:  ''finding a seat, reading the menu, ordering drinks from the waitstaff...''  In the script form, these would be decomposed into [[conceptual dependency theory|conceptual transitions]], such as '''MTRANS''' and '''PTRANS''', which refer to ''mental transitions [of information]'' and ''physical transitions [of things]''.

Schank, Abelson and their colleagues tackled some of the most difficult problems in [[artificial intelligence]] (i.e., [[story understanding]]), but ultimately their line of work ended without tangible success. This type of work received little attention after the 1980s, but it is very influential in later [[knowledge representation]] techniques, such as [[case-based reasoning]].

Scripts can be inflexible. To deal with inflexibility, smaller modules called [[memory organization packet]]s (MOP) can be combined in a way that is appropriate for the situation.
