VFinity and Shen Tong promoted notions of "Context is King",  search centric extreme ease of use with zero user training, folksonomy (or free tagging) combined with taxonomy (expert tagging), zero client (or Web client).  VFinity platform seems to differ from traditional enterprise software especially in professional media industry in its Webby approach.
