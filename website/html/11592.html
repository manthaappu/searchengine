'''EasyInstall''' is a [[package manager]] for the [[Python programming language]] that provides a standard format for distributing Python programs and [[library (computing)|libraries]] (based on the '''Python Eggs''' wrapper). <tt>easy_install</tt> is a module bundled with <tt>setuptools</tt>, a [[Third-party software component|third-party]] library meant to enhance the Python standard library's <tt>distutils</tt> (Distribution utilities).<ref>http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools September 1, 2009</ref> It is analogous to [[RubyGems]] for the [[Ruby programming language]].

By default, EasyInstall looks in the [[Python Package Index]] (PyPI) for the desired packages and uses the metadata there to download and install the package and its dependencies. It is also hosted itself on the PyPI.

'''Python Eggs''' are a way of bundling additional information with a [[Python (programming language)|Python]] project, that allows the project's dependencies to be checked and satisfied at runtime, as well as allowing projects to provide [[plugins]] for other projects.
