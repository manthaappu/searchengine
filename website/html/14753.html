A '''game system clone''' is a third-party remake of a game system.  In many cases, they are bootlegged/pirated/unlicensed.  These kind of game systems are often sold online, or at [[flea markets]] especially in developing countries, where it is seen as an affordable alternative to more expensive consoles such as the [[PlayStation 3]] or [[Xbox 360]].

Game system clones come in a variety of styles, shell shapes, etc.  In some cases, a game system clone will have built-in games, and a cartridge slot for expansion.  One of the most cloned game systems of all time is the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES).

One of the most popular [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] clones was the [[Russia]]n [[Dendy (console)|Dendy]] game console. The machine is so popular that in Russia, game consoles in general are often referred to as Dendys.
