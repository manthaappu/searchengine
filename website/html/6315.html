The '''Cisco Systems VPN Client''' enables computers to connect to a [[virtual private network]]. The client makes remote resources of another network available in a secure way as if the user was connected directly to that "private" network.

== Installation ==
The client is normally distributed with an executable installer and profile file(s), which contain all the necessary information to easily connect to a network. Cisco VPN Client Profile files have a [[#Security|security]] vulnerability which can potentially put the virtual private network at risk.

== Availability ==
The software is not free but is often installed on university and business computers in accordance with a site-license. As with most corporate licenses, administrators are allowed to freely distribute the software to users within their network.

== Compatibility ==

VPN Client 4.9.01.0230 Beta added support for Mac OS X 10.6.<ref>[http://www.cisco.com/web/software/282364316/35919/4.9.1.0230-beta-rel-notes.txt Release Notes for VPN Client, Release 4.9.01.0230 Beta for Mac OS X]</ref> Stable version 4.9.01.0180 appears to lack that support; 4.9.00.0050 explicitly did ''not'' support versions of Mac OS X later than 10.5.<ref>[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/vpn_client/cisco_vpn_client/vpn_client49/release/notes/49client.pdf Release Notes for VPN Client, Release 4.9.00.0050 for Mac OS X, Revised: May 21, 2010, OL-11179-04]</ref>

VPN Client 5.0.07.0290 added support for 64-bit versions of Windows Vista and Windows 7.<ref>[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/vpn_client/cisco_vpn_client/vpn_client5007/release/notes/vpnclient5007.html#wp84047 Release Notes for Cisco VPN Client, Release 5.0.07.0290]</ref>

VPN Client does not run on any Linux 64 bit dual core systems that have SMP turned on. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

== Security ==
The client uses profile files ('''*.pcf'''), in which an encrypted password for the VPN network is usually stored. A vulnerability has been identified<ref name="cSec">{{cite web|url=http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sn-20040415-grppass.shtml|title=Cisco Security Notice: Cisco IPsec VPN Implementation Group Password Usage Vulnerability}}</ref>, and those passwords can easily be decoded using software or online services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~massar/bin/cisco-decode|title=Cisco Systems VPN Client Group Password Decoder}}</ref> To workaround these issues, network administrators are advised to use the Mutual Group Authentication feature, or use unique passwords (that aren't related to other important network passwords).<ref name="cSec"/>
