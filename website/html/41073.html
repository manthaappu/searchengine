A '''zettabyte''' (symbol '''ZB''', derived from the [[SI prefix]] ''[[zetta-]]'') is a unit of [[information]] or [[computer storage]] equal to one [[sextillion]] (one [[long and short scales|long scale]] [[trilliard]]) [[byte]]s.<ref>[http://www.fiercevoip.com/story/zettabyte-flood-predicted-2015/2008-01-31 Zettabyte flood predicted for 2015, Tom Burton (January 2008)]</ref><ref>[http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9012364 A zettabyte by 2010: Corporate data grows fiftyfold in three years, Lucas Mearian (March 2007)]</ref><ref>[http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9067639 Study: Digital universe and its impact bigger than we thought, Lucas Mearian (March 2008)]</ref><ref>[http://www.circleid.com/posts/813110_internet_traffic_graph_zettabyte/ Internet Traffic to Reach a Zettabyte by 2015, Says Study<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The term "[[zebibyte]]" (ZiB), using a [[binary prefix]], is used for the corresponding power of 1024.

==Comparisons for scale==
A zettabyte is equal to 1 billion terabytes.

According to the annual survey of the global digital output by [[International Data Corporation]], the total amount of global data was expected to pass 1.2 zettabytes sometime during 2010. This is equivalent to the amount of data that would be generated by everyone in the world posting messages on the [[microblogging]] site [[Twitter]] continuously for a century.<ref>{{cite news |author=Heidi Blake |coauthors= |title=Zettabytes overtake petabytes as largest unit of digital measurement |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/7675214/Zettabytes-overtake-petabytes-as-largest-unit-of-digital-measurement.html |quote= |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=May 4, 2010 |accessdate=2010-05-04 }}</ref>

[[Mark Liberman]] calculated the storage requirements for all human speech ever spoken at 42 zettabytes if digitized as 16 kHz 16-bit audio. This was done in response to a popular expression that states "all words ever spoken by human beings" could be stored in approximately 5 exabytes of data (see [[exabyte]] for details). Liberman did "freely confess that maybe the authors [of the exabyte estimate] were thinking about text."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000087.html |title=Zettascale Linguistics |author=Mark Liberman |authorlink=Mark Liberman |date=November 3, 2003 |publisher=upenn.edu |accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref>

Research from the [[University of California, San Diego]] reports that in 2008, Americans consumed 3.6 zettabytes of information.<ref>http://hmi.ucsd.edu/pdf/HMI_2009_ConsumerReport_Dec9_2009.pdf</ref>
