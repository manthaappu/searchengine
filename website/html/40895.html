'''Yellow Dog Linux''', also known as '''YDL''', is a [[free and open source software|free and open source]] [[operating system]] for high performance computing on multicore architectures. It focuses on GPU systems and  computers using the [[Power Architecture]] (Power7). YDL is currently developed by [[Fixstars Solutions|Fixstars]] (which acquired Terra Soft Solutions in October 2008). Yellow Dog Linux was first released in the spring of 1999 for the Apple Macintosh PowerPC-based computers.  

The most recent version, Yellow Dog Enterprise Linux for [[CUDA]], was released on March 2, 2010.  It claims to be the first enterprise Linux OS optimized for GPU computing offering end users, developers and integrators a faster, more reliable, and less complex GPU computing experience.<ref name="pressrelease">[http://www.fixstars.com/en/company/press/20100302.html; Yellow Dog Enterprise Linux for CUDA Offers Lower Cost or Ownership, Better GPU performance with integrated Eclipse plug-i, Greater Integration and Reliability, Comprehensive support for both Linux and CUDA and Flexibility by supporting several versions of CUDA;] Fixstars press release, March 2, 2010.</ref>

==Features==
[[Image:Yellow Dog Linux.png|thumb|320px|Screenshot of Yellow Dog Linux Version 6.0 &lsquo;Pyxis&rsquo; depicting [[Enlightenment (window manager)|Enlightenment]], the default window manager.]]
Yellow Dog Linux is based on [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]]/[[CentOS]] and relies on the [[RPM Package Manager|RPM]] package manager. Its software includes user applications such as [[Ekiga]] (a [[Voice over Internet Protocol|voice-over-IP]] and [[videoconferencing]] application), [[GIMP]] (a raster graphics editor), [[Gnash]] (a free [[Adobe Flash]] player), [[gThumb]] (an image viewer), the [[Mozilla Firefox]] Web browser, the [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] e-mail and news client, the [[OpenOffice.org]] productivity suite, [[Pidgin (software)|Pidgin]] (an instant messaging and [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] client), the [[Rhythmbox]] music player, and the [[Noatun (media player)|Noatun]] and [[Totem (media player)|Totem]] media players.

Since YDL version 5.0 ‘Phoenix,’ [[Enlightenment (window manager)|Enlightenment]] has been the default desktop environment in Yellow Dog Linux, although [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]] are also included.

Like other Linux distributions, Yellow Dog Linux supports software development with [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] (compiled with support for [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], and [[Fortran]]), the [[GNU C Library]], [[GNU Debugger|GDB]], [[GLib]], the [[GTK+]] toolkit, [[Python (programming language)|Python]], the [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] toolkit, [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] and [[Tcl]].  Standard text editors such as [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] and [[Emacs]] are complemented with [[integrated development environment|IDEs]] such as [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] and [[KDevelop]], as well as by graphical debuggers such as [[KDbg]].  Standard document preparation tools such as [[TeX]] and [[LaTeX]] are also included.

Yellow Dog Linux includes software suitable for running a Web server (such as [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache/httpd]], [[Perl]], and [[PHP]]), database server (such as [[MySQL]] and [[PostgreSQL]]), and network server ([[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] and [[Webmin]]).  Additional software is also included for running an enterprise server or a compute server or cluster, although two separate products from Terra Soft Solutions, called Yellow Dog Enterprise Linux (for enterprise servers) and Y-HPC (for compute servers/clusters), are specifically targeted toward those applications.

YDL version 6.2 was released on 29 June 2009.<ref name="pressrelease">[http://www.fixstars.com/en/company/press/20090629.html &ldquo; Yellow Dog Linux 6.2 Offers Xfce, USB Install, EPEL Extra Packages, and more than 600 updates&rdquo;] Fixstars press release, 29 June 2009.</ref>

Yellow Dog Linux, version 6.0 ‘Pyxis,’ is based on [[Linux (kernel)|Linux]] 2.6.23.
It ships with [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] 4.1.1, [[GNU C Library|glibc]] 4.1.1, [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] 3.2.2, and over 2000 software packages.

Although [[Comparison of Linux distributions#Architecture support|several other Linux distributions support the Power Architecture]], Yellow Dog Linux was distinguished for its focus on supporting the Apple Macintosh platform before the [[Apple–Intel transition]].  Before this transition, Terra Soft Solutions held the unique distinction of being the only company licensed by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] to resell Apple computers with Linux pre-installed (or for that matter, with any operating system other than [[Mac OS X|Mac OS X]]). Full support for [[AirPort]] (Apple’s implementation of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] [[IEEE 802.11b-1999|802.11b-1999]] wireless networking standard), and partial support for AirPort Extreme, are also built into Yellow Dog Linux, as are support for [[Bluetooth]] and support for accessing the Internet over cellular phones.

Following Apple’s transition to using Intel processors exclusively in their Macintosh line of computers, Yellow Dog Linux has now been retargeted to support the Sony PlayStation 3 and IBM pSeries platforms extensively, while retaining its longstanding support for PowerPC-based Apple hardware.

==Distribution==
Yellow Dog Linux is sold by Fixstars who also market [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 3]] consoles, IBM workstations, and servers with Yellow Dog Linux pre-installed.  As is the case with most other Linux distribution vendors, a portion of the revenue from the sale of these boxed distributions goes toward development of the Linux operating system and applications, the results of which are made available as source code under various [[free and open source software|free and open source licenses]].

As an interesting application of YDL on [[PlayStation 3]] consoles: Dr. [[Gaurav Khanna]], a professor in the Physics Department of the [[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth]] built a message-passing based cluster using 16 PS3s. This cluster was the first such cluster that generated published scientific results. Dubbed as the "PS3 Gravity Grid", this PS3 cluster performs astrophysical simulations of large supermassive black holes capturing smaller compact objects <ref>{{cite web | url = http://gravity.phy.umassd.edu/ps3.html | title= PS3 Gravity Grid | publisher = Gaurav Khanna, Associate Professor, College of Engineering, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth | accessdate =}}</ref>. Khanna claims that the cluster's performance exceeds that of a 100+ Intel Xeon core based traditional Linux cluster on his simulations. The PS3 Gravity Grid gathered significant media attention through 2007 <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/news/2007/10/ps3_supercomputer | title= Astrophysicist Replaces Supercomputer with Eight PlayStation 3s }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9043942/PS3_cluster_creates_homemade_cheaper_supercomputer | title= PS3 cluster creates homemade, cheaper supercomputer }}</ref>, 2008 <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3325757/Why-scientists-love-games-consoles.html | title= Why scientists love games consoles}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/22/AR2008122201980.html | title= Nothing Escapes the Pull of a PlayStation 3, Not Even a Black Hole}}</ref>, 2009 <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/090128-playstation3-blackholes.html | title= Playstation 3 Consoles Tackle Black Hole Vibrations}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100969805 | title= Playstation 3: A Discount Supercomputer?}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/the-supercomputer-goes-personal | title= The Supercomputer Goes Personal}}</ref> and 2010 <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11168150 | title= The PlayStation powered super-computer}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://blogs.forbes.com/johnfarrell/2010/11/12/black-holes-and-quantum-loops-more-than-just-a-game/ | title= Black Holes and Quantum Loops: More Than Just a Game}}</ref>.
