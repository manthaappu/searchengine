'Knowledge representation (KR) and reasoning' is an area of [[artificial intelligence]] whose fundamental goal is to represent knowledge in a manner that facilitates [[inference|inferencing]] (i.e. drawing conclusions) from [[knowledge]]. It analyzes how to formally think - how to use a symbol system to represent a domain of discourse (that which can be talked about), along with functions that allow inference (formalized reasoning) about the objects. Generally speaking, some kind of logic is used both to supply formal [[semantics]] of how reasoning functions apply to symbols in the domain of discourse, as well as to how to supply operators such as quantifiers, modal operators, etc. that, along with an interpretation theory, give meaning to the sentences in the logic. 

When we design a knowledge representation (and a knowledge representation system to interpret sentences in the logic in order to derive inferences from them) we have to make choices across a number of design spaces. The single most important decision to be made, is the ''expressivity'' of the KR. The more expressive, the easier and more compact it is to "say something". However, more expressive languages are harder to automatically derive inferences from. An example of a less expressive KR would be [[propositional logic]]. An example of a more expressive KR would be [[autoepistemic logic|autoepistemic]] temporal modal logic. Less expressive KRs may be both complete and consistent (formally less expressive than set theory). More expressive KRs may be neither complete nor consistent. 

The key problem is to find a KR and a supporting reasoning system that can make the inferences your application needs within the resource constraints appropriate to the problem at hand.  Recent developments in KR have been driven by the [[Semantic Web]], and have included development of [[XML]]-based knowledge representation languages and standards, including [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF), [[RDF Schema]], [[Topic Maps]], [[DARPA Agent Markup Language]] (DAML), [[Ontology Inference Layer]] (OIL), and [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL).

== Overview ==
In field there are a number of representation techniques such as frames, rules, tagging, and [[semantic networks]] which have originated from theories of human information processing. Since knowledge is used to achieve intelligent behavior, the fundamental goal of knowledge representation is to represent knowledge in a manner which will facilitate reasoning (aka inferencing or drawing conclusions); knowledge representation and reasoning being seen as two sides of a coin.

Some issues that arise in knowledge representation from an AI perspective are:

* How do people represent knowledge?
* What is the nature of knowledge?
* Should a representation scheme deal with a particular domain or should it be general purpose?
* How expressive is a representation scheme or [[formal language]]?
* Should the scheme be declarative or procedural?

There has been very little top-down discussion of the knowledge representation (KR) issues and research in this area is a well aged quillwork. There are well known problems such as "[[spreading activation]]" (this is a problem in navigating a network of nodes), "subsumption" (this is concerned with selective inheritance; e.g. an [[all-terrain vehicle|ATV]] can be thought of as a specialization of a car but it inherits only particular characteristics) and "classification." For example a tomato could be classified both as a fruit and a vegetable. 
 
In the field of [[artificial intelligence]], [[problem solving]] can be simplified by an appropriate choice of ''knowledge representation''. Representing knowledge in some ways makes certain problems easier to solve. For example, it is easier to divide numbers represented in [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system|Hindu-Arabic numerals]] than numbers represented as [[Roman numeral]]s.

== History of knowledge representation and reasoning==
In [[computer science]], particularly [[artificial intelligence]], a number of representations have been devised to structure information. 

KR is most commonly used to refer to representations intended for processing by modern [[computers]], and in particular, for representations consisting of explicit objects (the class of all elephants, or Clyde a certain individual), and of assertions or claims about them ('Clyde is an elephant', or 'all elephants are grey'). Representing knowledge in such explicit form enables computers to draw conclusions from knowledge already stored ('Clyde is grey').

Many KR methods were tried in the 1970s and early 1980s, such as [[heuristic]] question-answering, [[neural networks]], [[theorem proving]], and [[expert systems]], with varying success. Medical diagnosis (e.g., [[Mycin]]) was a major application area, as were games such as [[chess]].

In the 1980s formal computer knowledge representation languages and systems arose. Major projects attempted to encode wide bodies of general knowledge; for example the "[[Cyc]]" project (still ongoing) went through a large encyclopedia, encoding not the information itself, but the information a reader would need in order to understand the encyclopedia: naive physics; notions of time, causality, motivation; commonplace objects and classes of objects. 

Through such work, the difficulty of KR came to be better appreciated. In [[computational linguistics]], meanwhile, much larger databases of language information were being built, and these, along with great increases in computer speed and capacity, made deeper KR more feasible.

Several [[programming languages]] have been developed that are oriented to KR. [[Prolog]] developed in 1972,<ref name="AI timeline">[http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AITopics/BriefHistory Timeline: A Brief History of Artificial Intelligence], [[AAAI]]</ref> but popularized much later, represents propositions and basic logic, and can derive conclusions from known premises. [[KL-ONE]] (1980s) is more specifically aimed at knowledge representation itself.  In 1995, the [[Dublin Core]] standard of metadata was conceived.

In the electronic document world, languages were being developed to represent the structure of documents, such as [[SGML]] (from which [[HTML]] descended) and later [[XML]]. These facilitated [[information retrieval]] and [[data mining]] efforts, which have in recent years begun to relate to knowledge representation. 

Development of the [[Semantic Web]], has included development of [[XML]]-based knowledge representation languages and standards, including [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]], [[RDF Schema]], [[Topic Maps]], [[DARPA Agent Markup Language]] (DAML), [[Ontology Inference Layer]] (OIL), and [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL).

== Topics in Knowledge representation and reasoning==
=== Language and notation ===
Some people think it would be best to represent knowledge in the same way that it is represented in the [[human mind]], or to represent knowledge in the form of [[human language]].

[[Psycholinguistics]] is investigating how the human mind stores and manipulates language.  Other branches of [[cognitive science]] examine how [[human memory]] stores sounds, sights, smells, emotions, procedures, and abstract ideas. Science has not yet completely described the internal mechanisms of the brain to the point where they can simply be replicated by computer programmers.

Various{{Which?|date=February 2009}} [[artificial languages]] and [[Mathematical notation|notation]]s have been proposed for representing knowledge. They are typically based on [[logic]] and [[mathematics]], and have easily parsed [[grammar]]s to ease [[machine processing]]. They usually fall into the broad domain of [[Ontology (computer science)|ontologies]].

=== Ontology languages ===
{{main|Ontology language}}
After [[CycL]], a number of [[ontology language]]s have been developed. Most are [[declarative language]]s, and are either [[frame language]]s, or are based on [[first-order logic]]. Most of these languages only define an upper ontology with generic concepts, whereas the domain concepts are not part of the language definition. [[Gellish English]] is an example of an ontological language that includes a full engineering English Dictionary.

=== Links and structures ===
While [[hyperlink]]s have come into widespread use, the closely related [[semantic link]] is not yet widely used. The [[mathematical table]] has been used since [[Babylon]]ian times. More recently, these tables have been used to represent the outcomes of logic operations, such as [[truth table]]s, which were used to study and model Boolean logic, for example. [[Spreadsheet]]s are yet another tabular representation of knowledge. Other knowledge representations are [[tree structure|trees]], by means of which the connections among fundamental concepts and derivative concepts can be shown. 

Visual representations are relatively new in the field of knowledge management but give the user a way to visualise how one thought or idea is connected to other ideas enabling the possibility of moving from one thought to another in order to locate required information.

=== Notation ===
The recent fashion in knowledge representation languages is to use [[XML]] as the low-level syntax. This tends to make the [[output]] of these KR languages easy for machines to [[parse]], at the expense of human [[readability]] and often space-efficiency. 

[[First-order predicate calculus]] is commonly used as a mathematical basis for these systems, to avoid excessive [[complexity]]. However, even simple systems based on this simple logic can be used to represent data that is well beyond the processing capability of current computer systems: see [[computability]] for reasons.

Examples of notations:
* [[DATR]] is an example for representing [[Lexicon|lexical]] knowledge
* [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] is a simple [[Mathematical notation|notation]] for representing relationships between and among [[object (philosophy)|objects]]

=== Storage and manipulation ===
One problem in knowledge representation is how to store and manipulate [[knowledge]] in an [[information system]] in a formal way so that it may be used by mechanisms to accomplish a given task. Examples of applications are [[expert system]]s, [[machine translation system]]s, [[computer-aided maintenance]] systems and [[information retrieval]] systems (including database front-ends).

[[Semantic network]]s may be used to represent knowledge. Each node represents a [[concept]] and arcs are used to define [[Relational model|relations]] between the concepts.The  [[Conceptual graph]] model is probably the oldest model still alive.
One of the most expressive and comprehensively described knowledge representation paradigms 
along the lines of semantic networks is [[MultiNet]] (an acronym for Multilayered Extended Semantic Networks).

From the 1960s, the [[knowledge frame]] or just ''frame'' has been used.  Each frame has its own name and a set of '''attributes''', or '''slots''' which contain values; for instance, the frame for ''house'' might contain a ''color'' slot, ''number of floors'' slot, etc. 

Using frames for [[expert systems]] is an application of [[object-oriented]] programming, with [[inheritance]] of features described by the "[[is-a]]" link. However, there has been no small amount of [[inconsistency]] in the usage of the "is-a" link: [[Ronald J. Brachman]] wrote a paper titled "What IS-A is and isn't", wherein 29 different semantics were found in projects whose knowledge representation schemes involved an "is-a" link. Other links include the "[[part-of]]" link. 

Frame structures are well-suited for the representation of schematic knowledge and stereotypical cognitive patterns. The elements of such schematic patterns are weighted unequally, attributing higher weights to the more typical elements of a  [http://moodle.ed.uiuc.edu/wiked/index.php/Schemas schema]. A pattern is activated by certain expectations: If a person sees a big bird, he or she will classify it rather as a sea eagle than a golden eagle, assuming that his or her "sea-scheme" is currently activated and his "land-scheme" is not.

Frame representations are object-centered in the same sense as [[semantic network]]s are: All the facts and properties connected with a concept are located in one place - there is no need for costly search processes in the database.

A [[behavioral script]] is a type of frame that describes what happens temporally; the usual example given is that of describing going to a [[restaurant]]. The steps include waiting to be seated, receiving a menu, ordering, etc.
The different solutions can be arranged in a so-called [[semantic spectrum]] with respect to their semantic expressivity.
