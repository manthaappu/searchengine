'''Zeroshell''' is a small [[Linux distribution]] for [[Server (computing)|servers]] and [[embedded systems]] which aims to provide [[network service]]s. As its name implies, its administration relies on a web based graphical interface. There is no need to use a [[shell (computing)|shell]] to administer and configure it.
Zeroshell is available as [[Live CD]] and [[CompactFlash]] images, and [[VMware]] virtual machines.

== Selected Features ==
* [[RADIUS]] server which is able to provide strong authentication for the Wireless clients by using [[IEEE 802.1X]] and [[Wi-Fi Protected Access]] (WPA/WPA2) protocols;

* [[Captive portal]] for network authentication in the HotSpots by using a web browser. The credentials can be verified against a Radius server, a [[Kerberos]] 5 [[KDC]] (such as [[Active Directory]] KDC);

* [[Quality of Service]] and [[traffic shaping]] management to control the maximum bandwidth, the guaranteed bandwidth and the priority of some types of traffic such as [[VoIP]] and [[Peer-to-peer]];

* [[VPN]] host-to-LAN and LAN-to-LAN with the [[IPSec]]/[[L2TP]] and [[OpenVPN]] protocols;

* Routing and Bridging capabilities with [[VLAN]] [[IEEE 802.1Q]] support;

* [[Firewall (computing)|Firewall]] Packet Filter and Stateful Packet Inspection (SPI);

* [[Layer 7]] filter to block or shape the connections generated by Peer to Peer clients;

* [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] and UDP ([[User Datagram Protocol]]) virtual servers ([[Port Forwarding]]);

* Multizone DNS ([[Domain name system]]) server;

* Multi subnet [[DHCP]] server;

* [[PPPoE]] client for connection to the WAN ([[Wide area network]]) via ADSL, DSL and cable lines;

* [[Dynamic DNS]] client updater for DynDNS;

* NTP ([[Network Time Protocol]]) client and server;

* [[Syslog]] server for receiving and cataloging the system logs produced by the remote hosts;
