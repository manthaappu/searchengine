'''MacInTouch''' began as an independent print journal in 1985 (originally published by Ford-LePage Inc.) to provide news and information about Macintosh computers. The MacInTouch Home Page website, created by Ric Ford in 1994, was serving daily Mac news and information to more than a million people by 1998, and MacInTouch Inc. was incorporated in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. MacInTouch continues independent coverage of the Macintosh platform today, along with iTunes, iPhone and such other core topics as technological innovation, networking, security and privacy.
