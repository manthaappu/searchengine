The '''Internet Junkbuster''' is a [[web proxy]] that can block [[ads]] and [[HTTP cookie|cookie]]s. It was developed by the [[Junkbusters Corporation]] and released under the [[GNU General Public License]]. However, the Internet Junkbuster hasn't been updated since 1998 and the junkbusters.com web site is no longer maintained.

[[Privoxy]] is an up-to-date filtering proxy based on the Junkbuster code, but it is much more powerful. See also the [[Proxomitron]], a Windows-based web filter.
