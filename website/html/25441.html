'''Murray Gell-Mann''' (born September 15, 1929, {{pron-en|ˈmʌriː ˈɡɛl ˈmæn}}) is an [[United States|American]] [[physicist]] who received the 1969 [[Nobel Prize in physics]] for his work on the theory of [[particle physics|elementary particle]]s. He is currently the Presidential Professor of Physics and Medicine at the [[University of Southern California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uscnews.usc.edu/university/nobel_prize_winner_appointed_presidential_professor_at_usc.html|title=Nobel Prize Winner Appointed Presidential Professor at USC}}</ref>

He formulated the [[quark model]] of hadronic resonances, and identified the SU(3) [[flavor symmetry]] of the light quarks, extending [[isospin]] to include [[strangeness]], which he also discovered. He discovered the V-A theory of chiral neutrinos in collaboration with [[Richard Feynman]]. He created [[current algebra]] in the 1960s as a way of extracting predictions from quark models when the fundamental theory was still murky, which led to model-independent [[Sum rule in quantum mechanics|sum rule]]s confirmed by experiment.

Gell-Mann, along with Maurice Levy, discovered the sigma model of pions, which describes low energy pion interactions. Modifying the integer-charged quark model of Han and Nambu, Fritzsch and Gell-Mann were the first to write down the modern accepted theory of [[quantum chromodynamics]] although they did not anticipate [[asymptotic freedom]].

Gell-Mann is responsible for the [[seesaw mechanism|see-saw theory of neutrino masses]], that produces masses at the inverse-GUT scale in any theory with a right-handed neutrino, like the SO(10) model. He is also known to have played a large role in keeping [[string theory]] alive through the 1970s, supporting that line of research at a time when it was unpopular.

==Biography==
Born in lower Manhattan into a family of [[Jewish]] immigrants, his father was a [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian Jew]] from [[Czernowitz]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]],<ref>{{cite web|author=M. Gell-Mann|date=October 1997|title=My Father|url= http://www.webofstories.com/play/10555|work=[[Web of Stories]]|accessdate=2010-10-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=J. Brockman|year=2003|title=The Making of a Physicist: A talk with Murray Gell-Mann|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/gell-mann03/gell-mann_print.html|work=[[Edge.org]]|accessdate=2010-10-01}}</ref> Gell-Mann quickly revealed himself as a [[child prodigy]]. Propelled by an intense boyhood curiosity and love for nature, he entered [[Yale University|Yale]] as a member of [[Jonathan Edwards College]] at fifteen after graduating [[valedictorian]] from the [[Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School]].

Gell-Mann's work in the 1950s involved recently discovered [[cosmic ray]] particles that came to be called [[kaon]]s and [[hyperon]]s. Classifying these particles led him to propose a new [[quantum number]] called [[strangeness]]. Another of Gell-Mann's ideas is the [[Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula]], which was, initially, a formula based on empirical results, but was later explained by the quark model. Gell-Mann and [[Abraham Pais]] were involved in explaining many puzzling aspects of the physics of these particles.

In 1961, this led him (and [[Kazuhiko Nishijima]]) to introduce a classification of elementary particles called [[hadron]]s (also independently proposed by [[Yuval Ne'eman]] six months earlier, although Gell-Mann alone got the Nobel Prize). This scheme is now explained by the [[quark model]]. Gell-Mann's own name for the classification scheme was the ''[[Eightfold Way (physics)|Eightfold Way]]'', because of the ''octets'' of particles in the classification. The term is a reference to the [[Noble Eightfold Path|eightfold way]] of [[Buddhism]].

Gell-Mann, and, independently, [[George Zweig]], went on, in 1964, to postulate the existence of [[quark]]s, the particles from which the [[hadron]]s are composed. The name was coined by Gell-Mann and is a reference to the novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', by [[James Joyce]] ("Three quarks for Muster Mark!"  book 2, episode 4). Zweig had referred to the particles as "aces",<ref>{{cite book|author=G. Zweig|origyear=1964|chapter=An SU(3) model for strong interaction symmetry and its breaking II|url=http://cdsweb.cern.ch/search.py?recid=570209&ln=en|editors=D. Lichtenberg and S. Rosen|year=1980|title=Developments in the Quark Theory of Hadrons|volume=1|pages=22–101|publisher=[[Hadronic Press]]|isbn=}}</ref> but Gell-Mann's name caught on. Quarks were soon accepted as the underlying elementary objects in the study of the structure of hadrons. In 1972 he introduced with [[Harald Fritzsch]] the quantum number '[[color charge|color]]' and later, in a joint paper with [[Heinrich Leutwyler]], the full theory of [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD) was released as the gauge theory of strong interactions (cf. references).  The [[quark model]] is part of QCD, and has been robust enough to survive the discovery of other [[flavour (particle physics)|flavour]]s of quarks. Gell-Mann and [[Richard Feynman]], working together, and a rival group of [[George Sudarshan]] and [[Robert Marshak]], were the first to discover the vector structure of the [[weak interaction]] in physics. This work followed the discovery of [[parity violation]] by [[Chien-Shiung Wu]], as suggested by [[Chen Ning Yang]] and [[Tsung-Dao Lee]].

In the 1990s his interest turned to the emerging study of [[complexity]], where he was closely associated with the [[Santa Fe Institute]]. He wrote a popular science book about these matters, ''[[The Quark and the Jaguar|The Quark and the Jaguar: Adventures in the Simple and the Complex]]''. The title of the book is taken from a line of an [[Arthur Sze]] poem: "The world of the quark has everything to do with a jaguar circling in the night." Gell-Mann is also a collector of [[East Asia]]n antiquities and a keen [[linguist]].

[[George Johnson (writer)|George Johnson]] wrote a biography of Gell-Mann, which is entitled ''Strange Beauty: Murray Gell-Mann and the Revolution in 20th-Century Physics''.

==Timeline==
Gell-Mann earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in physics from [[Yale University]] in 1948, and a PhD in physics from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1951. He was a postdoctoral research associate in 1951, and a visiting research professor at [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] from 1952 to 1953. After serving as Visiting Associate Professor at [[Columbia University]] in 1954–55, he became a professor at the [[University of Chicago]] before moving to the [[California Institute of Technology]], where he taught from 1955 until 1993. He was awarded a Nobel Prize in physics in 1969 for his discovery of a system for classifying subatomic particles.

He is currently the Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Theoretical Physics Emeritus at Caltech as well as a University Professor in the Physics and Astronomy Department of the [[University of New Mexico]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. He is a member of the editorial board of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. In 1984 Gell-Mann co-founded the [[Santa Fe Institute]]—a non-profit research institute in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]—to study complex systems and disseminate the notion of a separate interdisciplinary study of complexity theory. There he met and befriended [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning novelist [[Cormac McCarthy]].<ref>{{cite web|author=D. Kushner|date=27 December 2007|title=Cormac McCarthy's Apocalypse|url=http://74.220.215.94/~davidkus/index.php?view=article&catid=35%3Aarticles&id=61%3Acormac-mccarthys-apocalypse-&format=pdf&option=com_content&Itemid=54|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=2010-10-01}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Gell-Mann married Marcia Southwick in 1992, after the death of his first wife, J. Margaret Dow (d. 1981), whom he married in 1955.
His children are Elizabeth Sarah Gell-Mann (b. 1956) and Nicholas Webster Gell-Mann (b. 1963); and he has a stepson, Nicholas Southwick Levis (b. 1978).
