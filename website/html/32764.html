<html> <head> <title>SGI VPro</title></head><body>'''VPro''', also known as '''Odyssey''', is a computer graphics architecture for [[Silicon Graphics]] [[Computer workstation|workstations]]. First released on the [[SGI Octane|Octane2]], it was subsequently used on the [[SGI Fuel|Fuel]], [[SGI Tezro|Tezro]] workstations and the [[SGI Origin 3000 and Onyx 3000|Onyx]] visualization systems, where it was branded InfinitePerformance.

VPro provides some very advanced capabilities such as per-pixel lighting, also known as "[[phong shading]]", (through the SGIX_fragment_lighting [http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/EXT/fragment_lighting.txt] extension) and 48-bit [[RGBA color space|RGBA color]].

There are currently four different VPro graphics board revisions, called: V6, V8, V10 and V12. The first series were the V6 and V8, with 32MB and 128MB of RAM respectively. The V10 and V12 had double the geometry performance of the older V6/V8, but were otherwise similar. The V6 and V10 can have up to 8MB RAM allocated to textures, while V8 and V12 can have up to 108MB RAM used for textures. The V10 and V12 boards used in Fuel, Tezro and Onyx 3000 computers use a different XIO connector than the cards used in Octane2 workstations.

The VPro graphics subsystem consists of an SGI proprietary chip set and associated software. The chip set consists of the '''buzz''' [[ASIC]], the '''pixel blaster and jammer''' (PB&J) ASIC, and associated [[SDRAM]].

The buzz ASIC is a single-chip graphics pipeline. It operates at 251 MHz and contains on-chip SRAM. The buzz ASIC has three interfaces:

* Host (16-bit, 400-MHz peer-to-peer XIO link)
* SDRAM (The SDRAM is 32 MB (V6 or V10) or 128 MB (V8 or V12); the memory bus operates at half the speed of the buzz ASIC.)
* PB&J ASIC

All VPro boards support the [[OpenGL ARB]] imaging extensions, allowing for hardware acceleration of numerous imaging operations at real-time rates.
