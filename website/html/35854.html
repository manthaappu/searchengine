== History ==
[[File:Str8ts9x9 Gentle SOL.png|thumb|Solution to the sample puzzle]]
A hand made prototype of Str8ts which used black cells and the new rule of straights in compartments, was invented by Canadian puzzle designer Jeff Widderich in 2007. He approached Andrew Stuart, a UK-based puzzle maker and programmer, to make the puzzle. Their collaboration settled how the clues would be determined and finalized the rules. The first puzzle was presented at the [[Nuremberg International Toy Fair]] in February 2008. A daily puzzle has been published at their website since 24 November 2008. The puzzle has appeared in ''[[S체ddeutsche Zeitung]]'' since March 2010, and in the Saturday edition of ''Die Rheinpfalz'' since August 2010. An [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] app was released in July 2009, containing hundreds of puzzles in four difficulty levels.<ref>[http://www.appbite.com/str8ts-iphone-game-review/ Str8ts iPhone App Review].

== Gameplay ==
The solver is given a 9x9 grid, partially divided by black cells into ''compartments''. Each compartment, vertically or horizontally, must contain a ''straight'' - a set of consecutive numbers, but in any order. For example: 7, 6, 4, 5 is valid, but 1, 3, 8, 7 is not.

Like sodoku, the solver must fill the remaining white cells with numbers 1 to 9 (or 1 to n in puzzles with N cells per side) such that each row and column contains unique digits. Whereas Sudoku has the additional constraint of 3x3 ''boxes'', in Str8ts rows and columns are divided by additional clues are set in some of the black cells - these numbers remove that digit as an option in the row and column. Such digits do not form part of any straight.

There are a number of variants to the basic game, including Symmetric Str8ts, Asymmetric Str8ts, Mini-Str8ts, and Transformations.

== Grading ==

As Str8ts belongs to the same class of puzzles as [[Sudoku]] the puzzle can demonstrate a wide spectrum of relative difficulty. The grade is determined by a combination of ''opportunities to solve'' at each stage and the difficulty of the strategy that grants each solution. An easier puzzle will have many places where a logical deduction can place a solution or eliminate a candidate number. When the whole puzzle is assessed in this way, plus some heuristics, a score can be determined. Over a large number of puzzles (>10,000) a bell curve of scores can be produced. This can be quartiled to group puzzles into specific grades.<ref>[http://www.sudokuwiki.org/Sudoku_Creation_and_Grading.pdf Sudoku Creation and Grading]. ''SudokuWiki.org''. February 3, 2007</ref>
