'''Inkwell''', or simply '''Ink''', is the name of the [[handwriting recognition]] technology developed by [[Apple Inc.]] and built into the [[Mac OS X]] operating system. Introduced in an update to [[Mac OS X v10.2]] "Jaguar", Inkwell can translate [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[German language|German]] writing. The technology made its debut as "[[Apple Newton OS#Handwriting recognition|Rosetta]]", an integral feature of [[Apple Newton OS]], the operating system of the short-lived [[Apple Newton]] personal digital assistant. Inkwell's inclusion in to Mac OS X led many to believe Apple would be using this technology in a new PDA or other portable [[tablet PC|tablet computer]]. However, the only currently available tablet Mac is the [[Axiotron Modbook]], an aftermarket [[MacBook]] with a replacement screen that allows utilization of Inkwell.

Inkwell, when activated, appears as semi-transparent yellow lined paper, on which the user sees his or her writing appear. When the user stops writing, his or her writing is interpreted by Inkwell and pasted into the current application (wherever the active text cursor is), as if the user had simply typed the words. The user can also force Inkwell to not interpret his or her writing, instead using it to paste a hand-drawn sketch into the [[active window]].

Inkwell was developed by [[Larry Yaeger]], [[Brandyn Webb]], and [[Richard Francis Lyon|Richard Lyon]].<ref>http://www.beanblossom.in.us/larryy/ANHR.html</ref>
