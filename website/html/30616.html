The '''Python Software Foundation License''' (PSFL) is a BSD-style, [[permissive free software license]] which is [[License compatibility|compatible]] with the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL). Its primary use is for distribution of the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] project software. Unlike the GPL the Python license is not a [[copyleft]] license, and allows modifications to the source code, as well as the construction of derivative works, without making the code open-source.  The PSFL is listed as approved on both [[List of FSF approved software licenses|FSF's approved licenses list]], and [[Open source license|OSI's approved licenses list]].

Earlier versions of Python were under the so-called [[Python License]], which is incompatible with the GPL.  The reason given for this incompatibility by [[Free Software Foundation]] was that "''this Python license is governed by the laws of the 'State of Virginia', in the USA''", and the GPL does not permit this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#PythonOld |title=Various Licenses and Comments about Them |accessdate=2007-07-07 |last=Stallman |first=Richard |publisher=Free Software Foundation }}</ref>

The year that Python's creator [[Guido van Rossum]] changed the license to fix this incompatibility, he was awarded the [[Free Software Foundation Award for the Advancement of Free Software]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/award/2001/2001.html |title=2001 Free Software Awards |accessdate=2007-07-07 |publisher=GNU Project - Free Software Foundation }}</ref>
