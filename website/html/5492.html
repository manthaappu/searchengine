<html> <head> <title>Cardiac sonographer</title></head><body>'''Cardiac sonographer''' (also known as [[echocardiographer]], or cardiac ultrasound technologist) is a medical profession of [[sonographer]]s that specialize in the anatomy and function of the [[heart]]. It is a technical job that in the USA has traditionally required an [[Associates degree]] in Echo and passing a National Registry exam, but more and more often is requiring a Bachelors degree as the field gets more developed and complicated.  Much like how a general sonographer would use sonography ([[ultrasound]]) to view a [[fetus]] inside a pregnant woman, cardiac sonographers use the same technology to examine and evaluate the heart: chamber sizes, arrangement of the parts, muscle function, valve function and blood flow.  Cardiac sonographers typically do not make diagnoses, but rather report all that they find to a [[cardiologist]] for further analysis. 

==Educational requirements in U.S.==
Most schools that offer training for cardiac sonographers have several different programs available to students. Programs that are certificate-based can be completed in about twelve (12) months allowing the candidate to make a relatively quick entrance into their chosen career.

However, some students may choose to pursue a full four-year degree in order to allow them to work at more advanced levels but most commonly, the course of study for those pursuing the cardiac sonographer profession is the two-year associate's degree. Typically, an associate's degree satisfies the minimum educational requirement for most employers.
