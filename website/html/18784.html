<html> <head> <title>Intensive Journal Method</title></head><body>The '''Intensive Journal Method''' is a [[psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] technique largely developed in 1966 at [[Drew University]] and popularized by Dr. [[Ira Progoff]] (1921â€“1998).[http://www.intensivejournal.org/Progoff/bio.htm] It consists of a series of writing exercises using [[loose leaf]] [[notebook]] paper in a simple [[ring binder]],  divided into sections to help in accessing various areas of the writer's life. These include a [[dialogue]] section for the [[personification]] of things, a "depth dimension" to aid in accessing the [[subconscious]] and other places for recording remembrances and meditations.

The original Intensive Journal contained only sixteen sections, but was later expanded to include five additional sections as part of Progoff's "process meditation" method. It has been the inspiration for many other "writing therapies" since then, and is used in a variety of settings, including [[hospital]]s and [[prison]]s, by private individuals as an aid to [[creativity]] or [[autobiography]], and often as an adjunct to treatment in [[analytical psychology|analytic]], [[humanistic psychology|humanistic]] or [[cognitive therapy]].

The Intensive Journal Method is a registered trademark of Dr. Progoff and used under license by Dialogue House Associates, Inc of New York, who train facilitators and consultants in the use of the method and coordinate an ongoing series of public workshops using the method throughout the United States and elsewhere.
