'''HeinOnline''', sometimes spelled '''Hein Online''', is an internet service launched in 2000 that is a source of [[legal]] information, much like [[Westlaw]] and [[LexisNexis]]. Like those services, use of HeinOnline requires a subscription, although most{{citation needed|date=March 2009}} law schools provide access to students for free. It is published by William S. Hein & Co.

==Overview==
There are three major distinctions between this service and other such services in terms of the scope and type of materials offered.

#HeinOnline provides a narrower scope of materials, excluding [[newspaper]] reports, as well as most federal and all state case law and most administrative material.
#With respect to law reviews, HeinOnline is far more comprehensive,{{citation needed|date=March 2009}} with material that in some cases stretches back to the mid-19th century.
#HeinOnline's materials are available only as [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] files, digitized scans of the original journal pages. While HeinOnline does not offer a [[Index term|keyword]] search per se, it does have a full-text [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] search capability.
