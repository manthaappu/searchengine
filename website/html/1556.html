'''alphaWorks''' is [[IBM]]'s "emerging technology portal".  It is a web community for [[early adopter]]s to preview and collaborate on prototype technology from IBM Research labs.  

alphaWorks was founded in August 1996, in IBM's Advanced Technology group (called "Internet Division" at the time).  The alphaWorks program has launched early release technology implementations in nascent technology communities of software developers, in areas like [[Java (programming language)|Java]] technology, [[XML]] and [[web services]].  Since 1996, alphaWorks has succeeded in helping IBM connect with innovative developers to lead the development of promising new standards (for example, [[Enterprise_Media_Bean|Enterprise Media Beans]]), products and open source technology.  alphaWorks is a key aspect of the [[developerWorks]] resource for developers.
