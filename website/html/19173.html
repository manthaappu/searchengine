<html> <head> <title>Interpolation attack</title></head><body>In [[cryptography]], an '''interpolation attack''' is a type of [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalytic attack]] against [[block cipher]]s.

In the attack, an algebraic function is used to represent an [[S-box]]. This may be a simple [[quadratic function|quadratic]], or a [[polynomial]] or [[rational function]] over a [[Galois field]]. Its coefficients can be determined by standard [[Lagrange interpolation]] techniques, using [[known-plaintext attack|known plaintexts]] as data points. Alternatively, [[chosen-plaintext attack|chosen plaintexts]] can be used to simplify the equations and optimize the attack.

[[Thomas Jakobsen]] introduced a [[randomized algorithm|probabilistic]] version of the interpolation attack using [[Madhu Sudan]]'s algorithm for improved decoding of [[Reed-Solomon code]]s. This attack can work even when an algebraic relationship between plaintexts and ciphertexts holds for only a fraction of values.
