<html> <head> <title>Quantitative structure-activity relationship</title></head><body>'''Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)''' (sometimes '''QSPR''': quantitative structure-property relationship) is the process by which [[chemical structure]] is quantitatively [[correlation|correlated]] with a well defined process, such as [[biological activity]] or chemical reactivity.

For example, biological activity can be expressed quantitatively as in the concentration of a substance required to give a certain biological response.  Additionally, when physicochemical properties or structures are expressed by numbers, one can form a mathematical relationship, or quantitative structure-activity relationship, between the two.  The mathematical expression can then be used to predict the biological response of other chemical structures.

QSAR's most general mathematical form is:

* <math>\;\text{Activity} = f(\text{physiochemical properties and/or structural properties})</math>

== SAR and the SAR paradox ==

The basic assumption for all molecule based [[hypotheses]] is that similar molecules have similar activities. This principle is also called '''S'''tructure-'''A'''ctivity '''R'''elationship ([[Structure-activity relationship|SAR]]). The underlying problem is therefore how to define a ''small'' difference on a molecular level, since each kind of activity, e.g. [[Chemical reaction|reaction]] ability, [[biotransformation]] ability, [[solubility]], target activity, and so on, might depend on another difference. A good example was given in the [[bioisosterism]] review of Patanie/LaVoie.<ref name="pmid11848856">{{cite journal | author = Patani GA, LaVoie EJ | title = Bioisosterism: A Rational Approach in Drug Design | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 96 | issue = 8 | pages = 3147–3176 | year = 1996 | month = December | pmid = 11848856 | doi = 10.1021/cr950066q | url = | issn = }}</ref>

In general, one is more interested in finding strong [[trend]]s. Created [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] usually rely on a [[finite set|finite]] number of chemical data. Thus, the [[Induction (philosophy)|induction principle]] should be respected to avoid [[Overfitting|overfitted]] hypotheses and deriving overfitted and useless interpretations on structural/molecular data.

The SAR paradox refers to the fact that it is not the case that all similar molecules have similar activities.

== Types ==

=== Fragment based (group contribution) ===

It has been shown that the [[partition coefficient|logP]] of compound can be determined by the sum of its fragments. Fragmentary logP values have been determined statistically. This method gives mixed results and is generally not trusted to have accuracy of more than ±0.1 units.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Prediction of physicochemical parameters by atomic contributions | author = Wildman SA, Crippen GM | doi = 10.1021/ci990307l | year = 1999 | journal = J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci | pages = 868–873 | volume = 39 | issue = 5 }}</ref>

Group or Fragment based QSAR is also known as GQSAR. GQSAR allows flexibility to study various molecular fragments of interest in relation to the variation in biological response. The molecular fragments could be substituents at various substitution sites in congeneric set of molecules or could be on the basis of pre-defined chemical rules in case of non-congeneric set.  GQSAR also considers cross-terms fragment descriptors, which could be helpful in identification of key fragment interactions in determining variation of activity.<ref name="Ajmani_2008">{{cite journal | author = Ajmani S, Jadhav K, Kulkarni SA | title = Group-Based QSAR (G-QSAR): Mitigating Interpretation Challenges in QSAR|journal=QSAR & Combinatorial Science | year = 2008 | month = November | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 36–51 | doi = 10.1002/qsar.200810063}}</ref>
Lead discovery using Fragnomics is an emerging paradigm. In this context FB-QSAR proves to be a promising strategy for fragment library design and in fragment-to-lead identification endeavours.<ref name="Prabu Manoharan_2010">{{cite journal | author =  Manoharan P, Vijayan RSK , Ghoshal N  | title = Rationalizing fragment based drug discovery for BACE1: insights

=== 3D-QSAR ===

'''3D-QSAR''' refers to the application of [[Force field (chemistry)|force field]] calculations requiring three-dimensional structures, e.g. based on protein [[crystallography]] or molecule [[superimposition]]. It uses computed potentials, e.g. the [[Lennard-Jones potential]], rather than experimental constants and is concerned with the overall molecule rather than a single substituent. It examines the steric fields (shape of the molecule) and the electrostatic fields based on the applied energy function.<ref name="isbn0-582-38210-6">{{cite book | author = Leach, Andrew R. | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Molecular modelling: principles and applications | edition = | language = | publisher = Prentice Hall | location = Englewood Cliffs, N.J | year = 2001 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 0-582-38210-6 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>

The created data space is then usually reduced by a following [[feature extraction]] (see also [[dimensionality reduction]]). The following learning method can be any of the already mentioned [[machine learning]] methods, e.g. [[support vector machine]]s.<ref name="isbn0-262-19509-7">{{cite book | author = Vert, Jean-Philippe; Schl̲kopf, Bernhard; Schölkopf, Bernhard; Tsuda, Koji | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Kernel methods in computational biology | edition = | language = | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Mass | year = 2004 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 0-262-19509-7 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>

In the literature it can be often found that chemists have a preference for [[partial least squares]] (PLS) methods, since  it applies the [[feature extraction]] and [[inductive reasoning|induction]] in one step.

=== Data mining ===

For the coding usually a relatively large number of features or molecular descriptors are calculated, which can lack structural interpretation ability. In combination with the later applied learning method or as preprocessing step occurs a [[feature selection]] problem. 

A typical [[data mining]] based prediction uses e.g. [[support vector machine]]s, [[decision tree]]s, [[neural networks]] for [[inductive reasoning|inducing]] a predictive learning model.

[[Molecule mining]] approaches, a special case of [[structured data mining]] approaches, apply a similarity matrix based prediction or an automatic fragmentation scheme into molecular substructures. Furthermore there exist also approaches using [[Maximum common subgraph isomorphism problem|maximum common subgraph]] searches or [[graph kernel]]s.<ref name="isbn0-521-58519-8">{{cite book | author = Gusfield, Dan | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Algorithms on strings, trees, and sequences: computer science and computational biology | edition = | language = | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK | year = 1997 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 0-521-58519-8 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref><ref name="isbn0-8247-2397-X">{{cite book | author = Helma, Christoph | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Predictive toxicology | edition = | language = | publisher = Taylor & Francis | location = Washington, DC | year = 2005 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 0-8247-2397-X | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>

== Judging the quality of QSAR models ==

QSARs represent predictive [[statistical model|model]]s derived from application of statistical tools correlating [[biological activity]] (including desirable therapeutic effect and undesirable side effects) of chemicals (drugs/toxicants/environmental pollutants) with descriptors representative of [[molecular geometry|molecular structure]] and/or [[molecular property|properties]]. QSARs are being applied in many disciplines for example [[risk assessment]], toxicity prediction, and regulatory decisions<ref name="Tong_2005">{{cite journal | author =  Tong W, Hong H, Xie Q, Shi L, Fang H, Perkins R | title =  Assessing QSAR Limitations – A Regulatory Perspective |  journal = Current Computer-Aided Drug Design | volume = 1 | issue =  2 | pages =  195&ndash;205 | year =2005  | month = April | pmid = | doi = 10.2174/1573409053585663| url = http://www.bentham.org/ccadd/contabs/cad1-2.htm#5 | issn = }}</ref> in addition to [[drug discovery]] and [[drug development|lead optimization]].<ref name="pmid13677480">{{cite journal | author = Dearden JC | title = In silico prediction of drug toxicity | journal = Journal of Computer-aided Molecular Design | volume = 17 | issue = 2&ndash;4 | pages = 119–27 | year = 2003 | pmid = 13677480 | doi = 10.1023/A:1025361621494 | issn = }}</ref> Obtaining a good quality QSAR model depends on many factors, such as the quality of biological data, the choice of descriptors and statistical methods. Any QSAR modeling should ultimately lead to statistically robust models capable of making accurate and reliable predictions of biological activities of new compounds.  

For validation of QSAR models usually four strategies are adopted:<ref name="isbn3-527-30044-9">{{cite book | author =  Wold  S, Eriksson L | authorlink = | editor = Waterbeemd, Han van de | others = | title = Chemometric methods in molecular design | edition = | language = | publisher = VCH | location = Weinheim | year = 1995 | origyear = | pages = 309&ndash;318 | chapter = Statistical validation of QSAR results | quote = | isbn = 3-527-30044-9 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>
# internal validation or [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]];
# validation by dividing the data set into training and test compounds;
# true external validation by application of model on external data and
# data randomization or Y-scrambling.

The success of any QSAR model depends on accuracy of the input data, selection of appropriate descriptors and statistical tools, and most importantly validation of the developed model. Validation is the process by which the reliability and relevance of a procedure are established for a specific purpose.<ref name=Roy2007>{{Cite journal | title = On some aspects of validation of predictive quantitative structure-activity relationship models | doi = 10.1517/17460441.2.12.1567 | year = 2007 | author = Roy, K. | journal = Expert Opin. Drug Discov. | pages = 1567–1577 | volume = 2 | issue = 12}}</ref> Leave one-out cross-validation generally leads to an overestimation of predictive capacity, and even with external validation, no one can be sure whether the selection of training and test sets was manipulated to maximize the predictive capacity of the model being published. Different aspects of validation of QSAR models that need attention includes methods of selection of training set compounds,<ref>{{Cite journal | title = On selection of training and test sets for the development of predictive QSAR models | url = http://library.sut.ac.th/free/ph_scie/pdfs/qsar/QSAR_3.pdf | year = 2006 | author = Leonard  JT, Roy K | journal = QSAR & Combinatorial Science | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | page = 235&ndash;251 | doi = 10.1002/qsar.200510161 }}</ref> setting training set size<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Exploring the impact of size of training sets for the development of predictive QSAR models | author = Roy PP, Leonard JT, Roy K | doi = 10.1016/j.chemolab.2007.07.004 | year = 2008 | journal = Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems | pages = 31–42 | volume = 90 | issue = 1 }}</ref> and impact of variable selection<ref>{{Cite journal | title = On some aspects of variable selection for partial least squares regression models | author = Roy PP, Roy K | year = 2008 | journal = QSAR & Combinatorial Science | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | page = 302&ndash;313 | doi = 10.1002/qsar.200710043 }}</ref> for training set models for determining the quality of prediction.

== Application ==

=== Chemical ===

One of the first [[history|historical]] QSAR applications was to predict [[boiling point]]s.<ref name="isbn0-85626-454-7">{{cite book | author = Rouvray, D. H.; Bonchev, Danail | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Chemical graph theory: introduction and fundamentals | edition = | language = | publisher = Abacus Press | location = Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England | year = 1991 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 0-85626-454-7 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>

It is well known for instance that within a particular [[chemical classification|family]] of [[chemical compound]]s, especially of [[organic chemistry]], that there are strong [[correlation]]s between structure and observed properties. A simple example is the relationship between the number of carbons in [[alkanes]] and their [[boiling point]]s. There is a clear trend in the increase of boiling point with an increase in the number carbons and this serves as a means for predicting the boiling points of [[higher alkanes]].

A still very interesting application is the [[Hammett equation]], [[Taft equation]] and [[Acid dissociation constant|pKa prediction]] methods.<ref name="CMC2_2007">{{cite book | author = Fraczkiewicz  R | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Comprehensive medicinal chemistry II | edition = | language = | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam | year = 2007 | origyear = | pages = | chapter = In Silico Prediction of Ionization | quote = | isbn = 0-08-044518-7 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>

=== Biological ===

The biological activity of molecules is usually measured in [[assay]]s to establish the level of inhibition of particular [[signal transduction]] or [[metabolic pathway]]s. Chemicals can also be biologically active by being [[toxicity|toxic]].  [[Drug discovery]] often involves the use of QSAR to identify chemical structures that could have good inhibitory effects on specific [[biological target|targets]] and have low [[toxicity]] (non-specific activity).  Of special interest is the prediction of [[partition coefficient]] log ''P'', which is an important measure used in identifying "[[druglikeness]]" according to [[Lipinski's Rule of Five]]. 

While many quantitative structure activity relationship analyses involve the interactions of a family of molecules with an [[enzyme]] or [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] binding site, QSAR can also be used to study the interactions between the [[structural domain]]s of proteins. Protein-protein interactions can be quantitatively analyzed for structural variations resulted from [[site-directed mutagenesis]].<ref name="pmid12668435">{{cite journal | author = Freyhult EK, Andersson K, Gustafsson MG | title = Structural modeling extends QSAR analysis of antibody-lysozyme interactions to 3D-QSAR | journal = Biophysical Journal | volume = 84 | issue = 4 | pages = 2264–72 | year = 2003 | month = April | pmid = 12668435 | pmc = 1302793 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-3495(03)75032-2 | url = | issn = }}</ref>

It is part of the [[machine learning]] method to reduce the risk for a SAR paradox, especially taking into account that only a finite amount of data is available (see also [[Minimum-variance unbiased estimator|MVUE]]). In general all QSAR problems can be divided into a [[coding]]<ref name="isbn3-527-29913-0">{{cite book | author = Hendrik Timmerman; Todeschini, Roberto; Viviana Consonni; Raimund Mannhold; Hugo Kubinyi | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Handbook of Molecular Descriptors | edition = | language = | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | year = 2002 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 3-527-29913-0 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> and [[learning]].<ref name="isbn0-471-05669-3">{{cite book | author = Strok, David G.; Duda, Richard O.; Hart, Peter W. | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Pattern classification | edition = | language = | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | location = Chichester | year = 2001 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 0-471-05669-3 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>

=== Applicability domain ===

As the use of (Q)SAR models for chemical risk management increases steadily and is also used for regulatory purposes (in the EU: [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals]]), it is of crucial importance to be able to assess the reliability of predictions. The chemical descriptor space spanned by a particular training set of chemicals is called [[Applicability Domain]]. It offers the opportunity to assess whether a compound can be reliably predicted.
