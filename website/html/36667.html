'''TINKER''' is a [[computer software]] application for [[molecular dynamics]] simulation with a complete and general package for [[molecular mechanics]] and [[molecular dynamics]], with some special features for [[biopolymer]]s. The heart of the TINKER package is a modular set of callable routines which allow the manipulation of coordinates and evaluation of potential energy and derivatives in a straightforward fashion.

TINKER works on Windows, Mac, and Unix/Linux and its source code is available free of charge. The code was written in [[FORTRAN77]] with common extensions and some [[C programming language|C]]. The code is maintained by Jay Ponder at the [[Washington University School of Medicine]].

==Features==
Programs are provided to perform many functions including:
# energy minimization over Cartesian coordinates, torsional angles or rigid bodies via conjugate gradient, variable metric or a truncated Newton method;
# molecular, stochastic, and rigid body dynamics with periodic boundaries and control of temperature and pressure;
# normal mode vibrational analysis;
# distance geometry including an efficient random pairwise metrization;
# building protein and nucleic acid structures from sequence;
# [[simulated annealing]] with various cooling protocols;
# analysis and breakdown of single point potential energies;
# verification of analytical derivatives of standard and user defined potentials;
# location of a transition state between two minima;
# full energy surface search via a "Conformation Scanning" method;
# free energy calculations via [[free energy perturbation]] or weighted histogram analysis;
# fitting of intermolecular potential parameters to structural and thermodynamic data; and
# global optimization via energy surface smoothing, including a "Potential Smoothing and Search" (PSS) method.
