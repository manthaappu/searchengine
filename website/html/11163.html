An example can be taken from [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]] of North America. Verbs in Ojibwe can be marked with a dubitative suffix, indicating that the speaker is doubtful or uncertain about what they are saying. So ''aakozi'' means "he is sick," while ''aakozidog'' can be translated as something like "he must be sick; I guess he's sick; maybe he's sick; he might be sick."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/document/curricul/ojibwe.pdf|format=PDF|series=The Ontario Curriculum|title=Native Languages: Ojibwe and Cree|publisher=Ontario Ministry of Education|isbn=0-7794-3384-X}}</ref>
