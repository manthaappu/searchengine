The mobile device side of the service has been shown in concept at events such as E3 and CES on devices like a [[Motorola Q]] mobile phone, but specific details have not been released. 

Since then, Microsoft has unveiled its next generation mobile platform, [[Windows Phone 7]]. Microsoft plans on being more aggressive with mobile Xbox Live-connected games by strictly controlling the phone hardware that Windows Phone 7 runs on, and enabling [[DirectX]] 9 graphics for Windows Phone 7, the same version of Direct X that the Xbox 360 uses. 

Live Gamertags are also used for the [[Microsoft XNA|XNA]] Creator's Club service.

==Features==
*Single identity ([[Gamertag]]/Zune Tag) across all platforms (tied to [[Windows Live ID]])
*Cross-platform chat, with both text and voice
*Unified friends list and message system
*Single, worldwide currency for purchasing virtual games, music, videos and content ([[Microsoft Points]])
*Cross-platform multiplayer online gaming, including game invites

==Pricing==
Live is available in two tiers: Silver and Gold. Anybody who signs up to Live is given a Silver account, which offers a basic set of features that differ with each platform. Gold accounts require a subscription, but offer a greater variety of features.
