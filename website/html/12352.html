'''Epitechnology''' is an accelerated adaptation of traditional [[Information Technology]] skills and processes in response to the [[utility computing]] model.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Utility computing is described as the packaging of computing resources, such as computation and storage, as a metered service similar to a traditional [[public utility]] (such as electricity, water, natural gas, or telephone network). This system has the advantage of a low or no initial cost to acquire hardware; instead, computational resources are essentially rented.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} An epitechnologist applies technology directly to business objectives by optimally leveraging the utility 'core' through applying the principles of [[Guerrilla IT]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}
