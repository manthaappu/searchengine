In [[software]], a '''toolchain''' is the set of [[programming tool]]s that are used to create a product (typically another computer program or system of programs). The tools may be used in a chain, so that the output of each tool becomes the input for the next, but the term is used widely to refer to any set of linked development tools.

A simple software development toolchain consists of a [[text editor]] for editing [[source code]], a [[compiler]] and [[Linker (computing)|linker]] to transform the source code into an [[executable program]], [[software library|libraries]] to provide interfaces to the [[operating system]], and a [[debugger]]. A complex product such as a [[video game]] needs tools for preparing [[sound effect]]s, music, [[Texture (computer graphics)|texture]]s, [[3D model|3-dimensional model]]s, and [[animation]]s, and further tools for combining these resources into the finished product.
