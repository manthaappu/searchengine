In particular, his notes on ''A Structural Approach to Operational Semantics'' of [[1981]] were very influential. He has contributed to many other areas of [[computer science]].

Plotkin is now Professor of Theoretical Computer Science in the [[University of Edinburgh School of Informatics|School of Informatics]] at The [[University of Edinburgh]].

== Biography ==
Plotkin received his [[PhD]] in [[1972]] from the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he studied under [[Rod Burstall]]. He has remained at Edinburgh, and was, with Burstall and [[Robin Milner|Milner]], a co-founder of the [[Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science]] (LFCS).
