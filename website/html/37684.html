{{Distinguish|Tical (disambiguation)}}

'''''TiHKAL''''' is a 1997 book written by [[Alexander Shulgin]] and [[Ann Shulgin]] about a family  of [[psychoactive drug]]s known as [[tryptamine]]s. A sequel to ''[[PiHKAL|PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved)]]'', the full title of the book is '''''Tryptamines i Have Known And Loved: The Continuation'''''.

==Content==
''TiHKAL'', much like its predecessor ''PiHKAL'', is divided into two parts. The first part, for which all rights are reserved, begins with a fictionalized autobiography, continuing where the similar section of ''PiHKAL'' left off; it then continues with a collection of essays on topics ranging from [[psychotherapy]] and the [[Carl Jung|Jung]]ian mind to the prevalence of [[dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] in nature, [[ayahuasca]] and the [[War on Drugs]]. The second part of ''TiHKAL'', which may be conditionally distributed for non-commercial reproduction (see [[#External links|external links]] below), is a detailed synthesis manual for 55 psychedelic compounds (many discovered by Alexander Shulgin himself), including their chemical structures, dosage recommendations, and qualitative comments.

Like ''PiHKAL'', the Shulgins were motivated to release the synthesis information as a way to protect the public's access to information about psychedelic compounds, a goal Alexander Shulgin has noted many times.<ref name="nyt">

Agents tell me that in clandestine labs that they have raided, they have found copies of those books." This attitude emphasized Shulgin's need to release the information to ensure its preservation, and led to the release of ''TiHKAL'' and his other publications.
