In the context of [[systems science]] and [[systems philosophy]], the term '''systemics''' refers to an initiative to study [[system]]s from a [[holistic]] point of view. It is an attempt at developing logical, mathematical, engineering and philosophical paradigms and frameworks in which physical, technological, biological, social, [[cognitive]], and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] systems can be studied and modeled. 

The term "systemics" was coined in the 1970s by [[Mario Bunge]] and others, as an alternative paradigm for research related to [[systems theory|general systems theory]] and [[systems science]].<ref name = "MB 79"> [[Mario Bunge]] (1979). ''A world of systems''. Dordrecht; Boston, Reidel.</ref>
