<html> <head> <title>Personal Learning Networks</title></head><body>'''Personal Learning Networks''' consist of the people a learner interacts with and derives knowledge from in a [[History of personal learning environments|Personal Learning Environment]]. An important part of this concept is the theory of [[Connectivism (learning theory)|connectivism]] developed by [[George Siemens]] and [[Stephen Downes]]. Learners create connections and develop a network that contributes to their professional development and knowledge.<ref name="caltdigi">[http://www.itdl.org/Journal/Jan_05/article01.htm Connectivism: A Learning Theory for the Digital Age], International Journal of Instructional Technology and Distance Learning, Vol. 2 No. 1, Jan 2005</ref> The learner does not have to know these people personally or ever meet them in person.<ref>{{cite web | last = Tobin | first = Daniel R. | authorlink = Daniel R.

<blockquote>
"For the first time in history, we know now how to store virtually all humanity's most important information and make it available, almost instantly, in almost any form, to almost anyone on earth. We also know how to do that in great new ways so that people can interact with it , and learn from it."

==Aspects==
One aspect is that the learner contributes and derives knowledge in a [[History of personal learning environments|PLE]] through various nodes.<ref name="caltdigi"/> In this way, the learner chooses which [[History of personal learning environments|PLEs]], [[Virtual learning environment|VLEs]], and social mediums to build a PLN. Specifically, the learner chooses who to interact with in these mediums and how much to participate. The learner enters the [[History of personal learning environments|PLE]] with certain goals, needs, interests, motivations and problems that are often presented to the people they include in their PLN.<ref name="malinka">[http://www.scribd.com/doc/22583785/From-Personal-Learning-Environment-Building-To-Professional-Learning-Network-Forming From Personal Learning Environment Building To Professional Learning Network Forming], Malinka Ivanova, The 5th International Scientific Conference Elearning and Software for Education , Vol. 9 No. 20, April 2009</ref> Moreover, the learner will collaborate and connect differently with various members. The learner will establish stronger relationships with some members and have a low level of connection with others. Not all nodes will be equal.<ref name="caltdigi"/> Some of the member roles include searcher, assemblator, designer of data, innovator of subject matter, and researcher.<ref name="malinka"/>

PLNs are becoming an important part of professional development in several fields with some businesses creating their own e-learning content and PLEs for their employees.  In addition, PLNs have become prevalent in the field of education and are rapidly becoming adopted as centers for the diaspora of field related information (in this regard, they are also often referred to as PROFESSIONAL Learning Networks) <ref>MusicPLN.org, http://musicpln.org</ref><ref>Educator's PLN, http://edupln.ning.org</ref><ref>Classroom 2.0, http://classroom20.com</ref>, <ref>edWeb.net http://edweb.net</ref>.
