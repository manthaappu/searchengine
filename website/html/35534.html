<html> <head> <title>Standard Model (cryptography)</title></head><body>In [[cryptography]] the '''standard model''' is the model of computation in which the [[Adversary (cryptography)|adversary]] is only limited by the amount of time and computational power available. Other names used are '''bare model''' and '''plain model'''.

Cryptographic schemes are usually based on [[Computational complexity theory|complexity assumptions]], which state that some problem, e.g. [[factorization]], cannot be solved in [[polynomial time]]. Schemes which can be [[provable security|proven secure]] using only complexity assumptions are said to be secure in the standard model. Security proofs are notoriously difficult to achieve in the standard model, so in many proofs, cryptographic primitives are replaced by idealized versions. The most usual example of this technique, known as the [[random oracle model]]

}}</ref>, where the adversary is given access to a randomly chosen encoding of a [[group (mathematics)|group]], instead of the [[finite field]] or [[Elliptic curve cryptography|elliptic curve groups]] used in practice.

Other models used invoke trusted third parties to perform some task without cheating -- for example, the [[public key infrastructure]] (PKI) model requires a [[certificate authority]], which if it were dishonest, could produce fake certificates and use them to forge signatures, or mount a [[man in the middle attack]] to read encrypted messages. Other examples of this type are the [[common random string model]] and the [[common reference string model]], where it is assumed that all parties have access to some string chosen uniformly at random or a string chosen according to some other probability distribution respectively. These models are often used for [[Non-interactive zero-knowledge proof]]s (NIZK). In some applications, such as the Dolev-Dwork-Naor encryption scheme

}}</ref>, it makes sense for a particular party to generate the common reference string, while in other applications, the common reference string must be generated by a trusted third party. Collectively, these models are referred to as models with special setup assumptions.
