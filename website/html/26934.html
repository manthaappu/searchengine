The '''OR gate''' is a digital [[logic gate]] that implements [[logical disjunction]] - it behaves according to the [[truth table]] to the right. A HIGH output (1) results if one or both the inputs to the gate are HIGH (1). If neither input is HIGH, a LOW output (0) results. In another sense, the function of OR effectively finds the ''maximum'' between two binary digits, just as the complementary AND function finds the ''minimum''.

==Symbols==
There are three symbols for OR gates: the American (ANSI or 'military') symbol and the IEC ('European' or 'rectangular') symbol, as well as the deprecated [[DIN]] symbol. For more information see [[Logic gate#Symbols|Logic Gate Symbols]]..

==Hardware description and pinout==
OR Gates are basic logic gates, and as such they are available in [[Transistor–transistor logic|TTL]] and CMOS [[integrated circuit|ICs]] [[logic family|logic families]]. The standard 4000 series [[CMOS]] IC is the 4071, which includes four independent two-input OR gates. The traditional TTL version is the 7432. There are many offshoots of the original 7432 OR gate. All have the same pinout but different internal architecture, allowing them to operate in different voltage ranges and/or at higher speeds. In addition to the standard 2-Input OR Gate, 3- and 4-Input OR Gates are also available. In the CMOS series, these are:
* 4075: Triple 3-Input OR Gate
* 4072: Dual 4-Input OR Gate

TTL variations include:
* 74LS32: Quad 2-input OR gate (Low power [[Schottky barrier|Schottky]] version)
* 74HC32: Quad 2-input OR gate (High Speed CMOS version) - has lower current consumption/wider Voltage range
* 74LVC32: Low voltage CMOS version of the same.

==Hardware description language==
module(a,b,c);
input a,b;
output c;
or (c,a,b);
end module;

If no specific OR gates are available, one can be made from NAND gates in the configuration shown below. Any logic gate can be made from a [[NAND logic|combination of NAND gates]]

==Wired-OR==
With [[Logic level|active low]] [[open-collector]] logic outputs, as used for control signals in many circuits, an OR function can be produced by wiring together several outputs. This arrangement is called a ''wired OR''. This implementation of an OR function typically is also found in integrated circuits of N or P-type only transistor processes.
