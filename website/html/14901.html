'''Gene Howard Golub''' (February 29, 1932 &ndash; November 16, 2007), Fletcher Jones Professor of Computer Science (and, by courtesy, of Electrical Engineering) at [[Stanford University]], was one of the preeminent [[Numerical Analysis|numerical analysts]] of his generation.{{says who|date=January 2011}}

Born in [[Chicago]], he was educated at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], receiving his B.S. (1953), M.A. (1954) and Ph.D. (1959) all in the field of Mathematics.<ref>Chen Greif, Gene H. Golub Biography, Online at Oxford University Press [http://www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-920681-3.pdf ], accessed 24 November 2007</ref> His M.A. degree was more specifically in Mathematical Statistics. His PhD dissertation was entitled "The Use of Chebyshev Matrix Polynomials in the Iterative Solution of Linear Equations Compared to the Method of Successive Overrelaxation" and his thesis adviser was [[Abraham Taub]]. He had been at Stanford since 1962 and became a professor there in 1970. He had advised almost thirty doctoral students, many of whom have themselves achieved distinction. Gene Golub was an important figure in numerical analysis and pivotal to creating the NA-Net and the NA-Digest, as well as the [[International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics]].<ref>{{citation|title=Obituary: Gene H. Golub (1932–2007)|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=450|page=962|year=2007|doi=10.1038/450962a|first=Lloyd N.|last=Trefethen|pmid=18075573|issue=7172}}.</ref>

One of his best-known books is ''Matrix Computations'',<ref>

co-authored with [[Charles F. Van Loan]]. He was a major contributor to algorithms for matrix decompositions. In particular he published an algorithm together with [[William Kahan]] in 1970 that made the computation of the [[singular value decomposition]] (SVD) feasible and that is still used today. A survey of his work was published in 2007 by [[Oxford University Press]] as "Milestones in Matrix Computation".<ref>{{Citation

Golub was awarded the B. Bolzano Gold Medal for Merits in the Field of Mathematical Sciences and was one of the rare few elected to three national academies: the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (1993), the [[United States National Academy of Engineering|National Academy of Engineering]] (1990), and the  [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (1994). He is listed as an [[ISI highly cited researcher]].<ref>{{Citation

</ref> He held 11 honorary doctorates and was scheduled to receive an honorary doctorate from [[ETH Zürich]] on November 17, 2007. He was a visiting professor at Princeton (1970), MIT (1979), ETH (1974 & 2002), and Oxford (1982 & 1998).

Gene Golub served as the president of the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] (SIAM) from 1985 to 1987 and was founding editor of both the [[SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing]] (SISC) and the [[SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications]] (SIMAX).

Gene Golub succumbed to [[acute myeloid leukemia]] on the morning of 16 November 2007 at the Stanford Hospital.<ref>
