<html> <head> <title>OpenCard Framework</title></head><body>'''OpenCard Framework''' (OCF) provides a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[Application programming interface|API]] to access both to smart card readers and to the applications embedded on the [[smart card]]s.

The OpenCard Framework was originally defined by the OpenCard Consortium, but mainly driven by IBM and Gemplus.  The work ended with version 1.2 of the specification and a reference implementation by IBM.  The consortium split up and left the OpenCard Framework in a dormant state.  The website was still available until 2007 and is now shut down.  The original code was transferred the a project on SourceForge, but never actively maintained.

== Architecture ==
* ''CardTerminals'' are smart card reader [[Device driver |drivers]].  They can be native ([[Shared object|.so]], [[Dynamic library|.dll]]) using [[Java Native Interface|JNI]] or they can use the javax.comm or gnu.io API. The distribution provides a bridge with [[PC/SC]] drivers.
* ''CardServices'' are high-level interfaces to the applications hiding the [[ISO/IEC 7816]]-3 and -4 complexity. Available CardServices are : PassThruCardService, MFCFileAccess, BasicEMVAppletAccess, VOPCardService, ...
