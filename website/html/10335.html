[[Bepress]] first offered its institutional repository software in 2002 for the California Digital Library's eScholarship Repository.<ref>[http://repositories.cdlib.org/escholarship/repository_release.pdf eScholarship Repository Release], April 3, 2002</ref> Digital Commons was later introduced at the American Library Association annual conference in June 2004.<ref>[http://proquest.com/pressroom/pressrelease/04/20041112.shtml ProQuest's Digital Commons@ Winning Broad Market Acceptance], November 12, 2004 </ref> From 2004 to July 2007, Digital Commons was licensed exclusively by [[ProQuest|ProQuest Information and Learning]].
