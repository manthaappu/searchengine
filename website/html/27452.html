'''OpenType''' is a format for scalable [[computer font]]s. It was built on its predecessor [[TrueType]], retaining TrueType's basic structure and adding many intricate data structures for prescribing [[typography|typographic]] behavior. OpenType is a registered trademark of [[Microsoft Corporation]].<ref name="OFF-chiariglione" />

The specification germinated at Microsoft, with [[Adobe Systems]] also contributing by the time of the public announcement in 1996. The specification continues to be developed actively and is presently migrating to an open format.

Because of wide availability and typographic flexibility, including provisions for handling the diverse behaviors of all the world's [[writing system]]s, OpenType fonts are used commonly today on the major computer platforms.

==History==

OpenType is intended by Microsoft and Adobe to supersede both the [[TrueType]] and the [[Type 1 font|Type 1]] ("[[PostScript]]") font formats. TrueType was developed by [[Apple Computer]] and licensed to Microsoft, and PostScript and the Type 1 format were developed by Adobe. Needing a more expressive font format to handle fine typography and the complex behavior of many of the world's writing systems, the two companies combined the underlying technologies of both formats and added new extensions intended to address the limitations.

OpenType's origins date to Microsoft's attempt to license Apple's advanced typography technology, "GX Typography" in the early 1990s. Those negotiations failed, motivating Microsoft to forge ahead with its own technology, dubbed "TrueType Open" in 1994.<ref>[http://www.suitcasetype.com/images/font/dederon%20Serif%20Std%20OT/01_Dederon_Serif_Std_OT.pdf Suitcase Type Foundry Information Guide]{{dead link|date=November 2009}}</ref> Adobe joined Microsoft in those efforts in 1996, adding support for the glyph outline technology used in its Type 1 fonts. The name OpenType was chosen for the combined technologies, and the technology was announced later that year.

===Open Font Format===
Adobe and Microsoft continued to develop and refine OpenType over the next decade. Then, in late 2005, OpenType began migrating to an open standard under the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) within the [[MPEG]] group, which had previously (in 2003) adopted OpenType 1.4 by reference for [[MPEG-4]].<ref name="OFF-chiariglione">{{cite web |url=http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/technologies/mpeg-4/mp04-off/index.htm |title=ISO/IEC 14496-22 "Open Font Format" |author=ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 11 |publisher=chiariglione.org |date=2008-07 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200508/081505OpenTypeISO.html |title=ISO To Adopt OpenType File Format as Font Standard For MPEG-4 |publisher=Adobe Systems Incorporated |date=2005-08-15 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/sc29/open/29view/29n55201.doc |title=Referencing Explanatory Report to accompany FPDAM/FDAM Submission of ISO/IEC 14496 – 11/Amd.2, Referenced Specification: The OpenType font format specification, version 1.4. |date=2003-07 |format=DOC |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/sc29/open/29view/29n6929t.doc |title=Combined CD Registration and CD Consideration Ballot on ISO/IEC CD 14496-22: Information technology -- Coding of audio-visual objects -- Part 22: Open Font Format  - SC 29/WG 11 N 7485  |date=2005-09-01 |format=DOC |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> Adoption of the new standard reached formal approval in March 2007 as ISO Standard ISO/IEC 14496-22 (MPEG-4 Part 22) called '''Open Font Format''' (OFF).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=43466 |title=ISO/IEC 14496-22:2007 - Information technology -- Coding of audio-visual objects -- Part 22: Open Font Format |publisher=ISO |date=2009-07-31 |accessdate=2009-11-11}}</ref> It is also sometimes referred to as "Open Font Format Specification" (OFFS).<ref name="OFF-chiariglione" /> The standard is technically equivalent to OpenType 1.4 specification, with appropriate language changes for ISO.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c043466_ISO_IEC_14496-22_2007(E).zip |title=ISO/IEC 14496-22, First edition 2007-03-15, Information technology — Coding of audio-visual objects — Part 22: Open Font Format |format=ZIP |date=2007-03-15 |author=ISO |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> The second edition of the Open Font Format was published in 2009 (ISO/IEC 14496-22:2009) and it is declared as "technically equivalent" to the "OpenType font format specification".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=52136 |title=ISO/IEC 14496-22:2009 - Information technology -- Coding of audio-visual objects -- Part 22: Open Font Format |publisher=ISO |date=2009-07-31 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c052136_ISO_IEC_14496-22_2009(E).zip |title=ISO/IEC 14496-22, Second edition 2009-08-15, Information technology — Coding of audio-visual objects — Part 22: Open Font Format |format=ZIP |date=2009-08-15 |author=ISO |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> It is a free, publicly available standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html |title=Publicly Available Standards |publisher=Standards.iso.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11}}</ref>

By 2001 hundreds of OpenType fonts were on the market. Adobe finished converting their entire font library to OpenType toward the end of 2002. {{As of|2005|alt=As of early 2005}}, around 10,000 OpenType fonts had become available, with the Adobe library comprising about a third of the total. By 2006, every major [[Type foundry|font foundry]] and many minor ones were developing fonts in OpenType format.

OpenType uses the general [[sfnt]] structure of a TrueType font, but it adds several [[smartfont]] options that enhance the font's typographic and language support capabilities. The [[glyph]] [[outline font|outline data]] in an OpenType font may be in one of two formats: either TrueType format outlines in a 'glyf' table, or [[Compact Font Format]] (CFF) outlines in a 'CFF ' table. CFF outline data is based on the [[PostScript]] language Type 2 font format. The table name 'CFF ' is four characters long, ending in a space character. However, the OpenType specification does not support the use of PostScript outlines in a TrueType Collection font file.

For many purposes, such as layout, it doesn't matter what the outline data format is, but for some purposes, such as [[rasterisation]], it is significant.  The term "OpenType" doesn't specify outline data format. Sometimes terms like "OpenType (PostScript flavor)", "Type 1 OpenType", "OpenType CFF", or "OpenType (TrueType flavor)" are used to indicate which outline format a particular OpenType font contains.

OpenType has several distinctive features:
* The font [[character encoding]] is based on [[Unicode]] and can support any script (or multiple scripts at once).
* OpenType fonts can have up to 65,536 glyphs.
* Fonts can have advanced typographic features that allow proper typographic treatment of complex scripts and advanced typographic effects for simpler scripts, such as the [[Roman alphabet|Latin]] script used in writing [[English language|English]].
* Font files are intended to be cross-platform, and can be used without modification on Mac OS, Windows and some Unix systems.
* If no additional glyphs or extensive typographic features are added, OpenType CFF fonts can be considerably smaller than their Type 1 counterparts.

==Comparison to other formats==
Compared with [[Apple Computer]]’s "GX Typography"—now called [[Apple Advanced Typography]] (AAT)—and with the [[SIL International|SIL]]’s [[Graphite (SIL)|Graphite]] technology, OpenType is less flexible in typographic options, but superior in language-related options and support.{{Clarify me|date=February 2009}}

OpenType has been much more successful than AAT and Graphite. There are many more fonts and supporting applications, despite AAT being an older technology. The single-platform nature of AAT and the lack of support from any major software vendor other than Apple itself are both likely factors in this.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The [[free software]] Graphite technology is not endorsed by major software vendors.

From a font developer’s perspective, OpenType is, for many common situations, easier to develop for than AAT or Graphite. First, the simple declarative substitutions and positioning of OpenType are more readily understood than AAT’s more complex state tables or the Graphite description language that resembles [[C syntax]]. Second, Adobe’s strategy of licensing at no charge the [[source code]] developed for its own font development, AFDKO (Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType), allowed third-party font editing applications such as [[FontLab]] and FontMaster to add support with relative ease. Although Adobe’s text-driven coding support is not as visual as Microsoft’s separate tool, VOLT (Visual OpenType Layout Tool), the integration with the tools being used to make the fonts has been well received.

Another difference is that an OpenType support framework (such as Microsoft’s [[Uniscribe]]) needs to provide a fair bit of knowledge about special language processing issues to handle (for example: Arabic). With AAT or Graphite, the font developer has to encapsulate all that expertise in the font. This means that AAT and Graphite can handle any arbitrary language, but that it requires more work and expertise from the font developers. On the other hand, OpenType fonts are easier to make, but can only support [[complex text layout]] if the application or operating system knows how to handle them.

Prior to supporting OpenType, Adobe promoted [[multiple master fonts]] and [[expert fonts]] for high-end typography. Multiple master fonts lacked the controls for alternate glyphs and languages provided by OpenType, but provided smooth transitions between styles within a type family. Expert fonts were intended as supplementary fonts, such that all the special characters that had no place in the [[Adobe Standard Encoding]] character set – ligatures, fractions, small capitals, etc. – were placed in the expert font instead. Usage in applications was tricky, with, for example, typing a ''Z'' causing the ''ffl'' ligature to be generated. In modern OpenType fonts all these glyphs are encoded with their Unicode indices and selection method (i.e. under what circumstances that glyph should be used).

==OpenType support==
===Basic Roman support===
OpenType support may be divided into several categories.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Virtually all applications and most modern operating systems have basic Roman support and work with OpenType fonts just as well as other, older formats. What is of particular interest apart from basic Roman support is: extended language support through [[Unicode]], support for "complex" writing scripts such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic languages]], and advanced typographic support for [[Latin alphabet|Latin script]] languages such as [[English language|English]].

Amongst Microsoft's operating systems, OpenType TT fonts (.TTF) are backward compatible and therefore supported by all [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] versions starting with Windows 3.1. OpenType PS fonts (.OTF) are supported in all Windows versions starting with [[Windows 2000]]; [[Adobe Type Manager]] is required to be installed on Windows 95/98/NT/Me for basic Roman support (only) of OpenType PS fonts.

===Extended language support===
Extended language support via [[Unicode]] for both OpenType and TrueType is present in most Windows applications (including [[Microsoft Office Publisher]], most [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] applications, and Microsoft Office 2003, though not Word 2002), CorelDRAW X3 and newer, and many Mac OS X applications, including Apple's own such as [[TextEdit]], [[Apple Pages|Pages]] and [[Keynote (presentation creation software)|Keynote]]. It is also widely supported in free operating systems, such as GNU/Linux (e.g. in multiplatform applications like [[Abiword]], [[Gnumeric]], [[KOffice]], [[Scribus]], [[OpenOffice.org]] 3.2 and later versions<ref>{{cite web |url=http://qa.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=78858 |title=OpenOffice Supports OpenType Fonts ... |accessdate=201-02-03}}</ref>, etc.).

OpenType support for [[complex script|complex written scripts]] has so far mainly appeared in Microsoft applications in [[Microsoft Office]], such as [[Microsoft Word]] and [[Microsoft Publisher]]. [[Adobe InDesign]] provides extensive OpenType capability in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] but does not directly support Middle Eastern or [[Brahmic family|Indic scripts]]— though a separate version of InDesign is available that supports Middle Eastern scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew. Undocumented functionality in many Adobe Creative Suite 4 applications, including InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator, enables Middle Eastern, Indic and other languages, but is not officially supported by Adobe, and requires third-party plug-ins to provide a user interface for the features.

===Advanced typography===
Advanced typographic support for Latin script languages first appeared in Adobe applications such as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[Adobe Photoshop]] and [[Adobe Illustrator]]. [[QuarkXPress]] 6.5 and below ([[Quark, Inc.]]) were not [[Unicode]] compliant. Hence text that contains anything other than [[Code page#Windows (ANSI) code pages|WinANSI]]/[[Mac OS Roman|MacRoman]] characters will not display correctly in an OpenType font (nor in other Unicode font formats, for that matter). However, Quark offers support similar to Adobe's in QuarkXPress 7, which shipped in May 2006. Corel's [[CorelDRAW]] does not support OpenType typographic features, either. [[Mellel]], a Mac OS X-only word processor from Redlers, claims parity in typographic features with InDesign, but also extends the support to right-to-left scripts; so does the [[Classical Text Editor]], a specialized word processor developed at the Austrian Academy of Sciences.

{{As of|2009}}, popular Windows word processors do not support advanced OpenType typography features. Advanced typography features are implemented only in high-end [[desktop publishing]] software. However, the text engine from [[Windows Presentation Foundation]], which is a [[managed code]] implementation of OpenType is the first Windows [[Application Programming Interface|API]] to expose OpenType features to software developers, supporting both OpenType [[TrueType]], and OpenType CFF ([[Compact Font Format]]) fonts. It supports advanced typographic features such as [[Typographical ligature|ligatures]], [[Text figures|old-style numerals]], [[swash (typography)|swash]] variants, [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], [[superscript]] and [[subscript]], [[small caps|small capitalization]], [[Font substitution|glyph substitution]], multiple [[baseline (typography)|baselines]], contextual and stylistic alternate character forms, [[kerning]], line-level [[justification (typesetting)|justification]], [[ruby character]]s etc. WPF applications automatically gain support for advanced typography features. OpenType ligatures are accessible in [[Microsoft Word#Word 2010|Microsoft Office Word 2010]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orzeszek.org/blog/2009/05/17/how-to-enable-opentype-ligatures-in-word-2010/ |title=How to Enable OpenType Ligatures in Word 2010 |publisher=Orzeszek.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11}}</ref>

Windows 7 introduced [[DirectWrite]], a hardware accelerated [[native code|native]] [[DirectX]] API for text rendering with support for multi-format text, resolution-independent outline fonts, [[ClearType]], advanced OpenType typography features, full Unicode text, layout and language support and low-level glyph rendering APIs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Win7DeveloperGuide/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=1702 |title=Windows 7 Developer's Guide |publisher=Code.msdn.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11}}</ref>

On Mac OS X, [[Apple Advanced Typography|AAT]]-supporting applications running on [[Mac OS X 10.4]] and later, including TextEdit and Keynote, get considerable OpenType support. Apple's support for OpenType in Mac OS X 10.4 included most advanced typographic features necessary for [[Latin script]] languages, such as [[small caps]], [[oldstyle figures]], and various sorts of ligatures. It did not yet support contextual alternates, positional forms, nor glyph reordering as handled by Microsoft's Uniscribe library on Windows. Thus, Mac OS X 10.4 did not offer support for Arabic or Indic scripts via OpenType (though such scripts are fully supported by existing AAT fonts). [[Mac OS X 10.5]] has improved support for OpenType and supports Arabic OpenType fonts.

Bitstream [[Panorama (Layout Engine)|Panorama]], a line layout and text composition engine from [[Bitstream Inc.]], provides complete OpenType support for compact and standard Asian fonts, Arabic, Hebrew, Indic, Thai and over 50 other worldwide languages. The application supports key OpenType tables required for line layout, such as BASE, glyph definition (GDEF), glyph positioning (GPOS), and glyph substitution (GSUB). Panorama also offers complete support for advanced typography features, such as ligatures, swashes, small caps, ornaments, ordinals, superiors, old style, kerning, fractions, etc.

In [[free software]] environments such as [[Linux]], OpenType rendering is provided by the [[FreeType]] project, included in free implementations of the [[X Window System]] such as [[Xorg]]. Complex text handling is provided either by [[pango]] or [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]]. The [[XeTeX]] system allows [[TeX]] documents to use OpenType fonts, along with most of their typographic features.

==OpenType Feature File (<code>.fea</code>)==
OpenType features are tedious to define using a GUI.<ref>Christopher Slye - OpenType feature files, ATypI 2006 [http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/atypi2006/slye_lisbon-05.pdf slides]</ref> Consequently, Adobe standardized<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html |title=OpenType Feature File Specification |publisher=Adobe.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080622121312/http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html |archivedate = June 22, 2008}}</ref> a text specification format for feature files, which typically have a name ending in a <code>.fea</code> extension. These files can be compiled into the binary font container (<code>.ttf</code> or <code>.otf</code>) using [[Adobe FDK]] (AFDKO), [[FontLab]] or [[FontForge]]. The latter program implements a few features that are documented in the Adobe standard but are not implemented by AFDKO.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/featurefile.html |title=FontForge's implementation of Adobe's Feature File syntax |publisher=Fontforge.sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11}}</ref>

==Layout tags==
OpenType Layout tags are 4-byte character strings that identify the scripts, language systems, features and baselines in an OpenType Layout font. Microsoft's Layout tag registry establishes conventions for naming and using these tags. OpenType features are created by using the tags in creating feature scripts that describe how characters are to be manipulated to make the desired feature. These feature scripts can be created and incorporated into OpenType fonts by advanced font editors such as [[Fontlab|FontLab Studio]], AsiaFont Studio, and [[FontForge]].

Operating system and application support for layout tags varies widely. A 2007 presentation<ref>Jürgen Willrodt - TypoTechnica Frankfurt 2007 [http://www.fontmaster.nl/pdf/OT_docs/OpenType_Status_2007.pdf slides]</ref> summarizing the state of affairs was given by Jürgen Willrodt at [[TypoTechnica]] 2007.

===Script tags===
Script tags identify the scripts (writing systems) represented in an OpenType typeface. Each tag corresponds to  contiguous character code ranges in Unicode. A script tag can consist of 4 or fewer lowercase letters, such as <tt>{{Sic|hide=y|ar|ab}}</tt><!-- note that arab is intentionally lower case because it is a normalized tag --> for the [[Arabic alphabet]], <tt>{{Sic|hide=y|cy|rl}}</tt> for the [[Cyrillic alphabet]] and <tt>{{Sic|hide=y|la|tn}}</tt> for the [[Latin alphabet]]. The <tt>math</tt> script tag, added by Microsoft for [[Cambria (typeface)|Cambria Math]], has been added to the specification.<ref name="scipttagregistry">{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/scripttags.htm|title=Script tags|date=2008-01-29|work=OpenType Layout tag registry|accessdate=2009-11-02}}</ref><ref name="isoiec14496222009">{{cite web|url=http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c052136_ISO_IEC_14496-22_2009(E).zip|title=ISO/IEC 14496-22:2009(E)|coauthors=International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Commission|date=2009-08-15|work=Information technology &mdash; Coding of audio-visual objects &mdash; Part 22: Open Font Format (2nd ed)|pages=286 (section 6.4.1)|accessdate=2009-11-02}} (consent to non-chargeable online licence agreement required to download specification)</ref>

===Language system tags===
Language system tags identify the language systems supported in an OpenType typeface. Examples include <tt>ARA</tt> for [[Arabic language|Arabic]], <tt>ESP</tt> for [[Spanish language|Spanish]], <tt>HYE</tt> for [[Armenian language|Armenian]], etc. The codes are not in general the same as [[ISO 639-2]] codes.

===Feature tags===

{{main|OpenType feature tag list}}

OpenType has a long list of feature tags. An abbreviated list of the most important features, sorted by their English description is given in the
[[List of typographic features#OpenType Typographic Features|OpenType section of the list of typographic features]].

===Baseline tags===
Baseline tags have a specific meaning when used in the horizontal writing direction (used in the 'BASE' table's HorizAxis table), vertical writing direction (used in the 'BASE' table's VertAxis table), or both.

==SING ''gaiji'' solution==
In 2005, Adobe shipped a new technology in their [[Adobe Creative Suite|Creative Suite]] applications bundle that offers a solution for the ''[[Kanji#Gaiji|gaiji]]'' (Japanese for "outside character") problem. Ideographic writing scripts such as Chinese and Japanese do not have fixed collections of characters. They use thousands of glyphs commonly and tens of thousands less commonly. Not all glyphs ever invented and used in Far Eastern literature have even been catalogued. A typical font might contain 8,000 to 15,000 of the most commonly used glyphs. From time to time, though, an author needs a glyph not present in the font of choice. Such missing characters are known in Japan as ''gaiji'', and they often disrupt work.

Another aspect of the ''gaiji'' problem is that of variant glyphs for certain characters. Often certain characters have been written differently over periods of time. It is not unusual for place names or personal family names to use a historical form of a character. Thus it is possible for an [[End-user (computer science)|end user]] using standard fonts to be left unable to spell correctly either their own name or the name of the place where they live.

Several ways to deal with ''gaiji'' have been devised. Solutions that treat them as characters usually assign arbitrary Unicode values to them in the [[Mapping of Unicode characters#Private Use Area|Private Use Area]] (PUA). Such characters cannot be used outside the environment in which the association of the private Unicode to the glyph shape is known. Documents based on them are not portable. Other installations treat ''gaiji'' as graphics. This can be cumbersome because text layout and composition cannot apply to graphics. They cannot be searched for. Often their rendering looks different from surrounding characters because the machinery for rendering graphics usually is different from the machinery for rendering glyphs from fonts.

The SING (Smart INdependent Glyphlets)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/gdk/topic.html |title=Adobe Glyphlet Development Kit (GDK) for SING Gaiji Architecture |publisher=Adobe.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080627183635/http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/gdk/topic.html |archivedate = June 27, 2008}}</ref><ref>DeLaHunt, Jim. [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/pdf/SING_Intro_IUC26.pdf "SING: Adobe's New Gaiji Architecture"]. 26th Internationalization and Unicode Conference, September 2004. Retrieved 16 July 2009.</ref> technology that made its debut with Adobe's Creative Suite 2 allows for the creation of glyphs, each packaged as a standalone font, after a fashion. Such a packaged glyph is called a ''glyphlet''. The format, which Adobe has made public, is based on OpenType. The package consists of the glyph outline in [[TrueType]] or [[CFF fonts|CFF]] (PostScript style outlines) form; standard OpenType tables declaring the glyph's metrics and behavior in composition; and metadata, extra information included for identifying the glyphlet, its ownership, and perhaps pronunciation or linguistic categorization. SING glyphlets can be created using [[Fontlab|Fontlab's]] SigMaker3 application.

The SING specification states that glyphlets are to travel with the document they are used in. That way documents are portable, leaving no danger of characters in the document that cannot be displayed. Because glyphlets are essentially OpenType fonts, standard font machinery can render them. The SING specification also describes an [[XML]] format that includes all the data necessary for reconstituting the glyphlet in binary form. A typical glyphlet might require one to two kilobytes to represent.
