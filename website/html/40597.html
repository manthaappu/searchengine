'''X00''' was a popular DOS-based [[FOSSIL]] [[device driver|driver]]<ref name="ref">{{cite web |url=http://www.dcllabs.net/docs/x00ref.txt |title=Functions reference manual for the X00 developer |author=Raymond L.

FOSSIL drivers were mainly used to run [[Bulletin Board System|BBS]] software under [[MS-DOS]].  X00 can also be run under [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], or even [[Linux]] and [[DOSEMU]] environments, to allow FOSSIL-aware MS-DOS based applications to function.

X00 was developed by [[Raymond L. Gwinn]]<ref name="ref"/> from [[1989]] until [[1993]]. The final release version was version 1.50, with a later beta version 1.53 which added support for baud rates above 38400.  X00 is free for non-commercial usage.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  X00 included many enhancements to the FTC FOSSIL revision 5 specifications, which were later used in other FOSSIL drivers such as [[AnDan FOSSIL|ADF]] and [[NetFoss]].

Gwinn moved on to develop a replacement serial port driver for [[OS/2]] called [[SIO (software)|SIO]]. SIO contained a virtualized FOSSIL (VX00) that could be loaded if applications needed FOSSIL support.
