<html> <head> <title>Harkhebi</title></head><body>'''Harkhebi''' (ca. 300 BC) was an [[astronomy|astronomer]] who lived in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] during the rule of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]].  

He may have based many of his observations on earlier [[Babylonian]] contributions to astronomy.  A funereal [[statue]] <ref>Claget, op.cit. pp.489ff.</ref> associated with him is known with an inscription in which he describes himself as an expert on observing [[star]]s.[http://egipto.com/personajes_del_antiguo_egipto/Astronomos/Harkhebi_219.html]. He referred to the planets as "the gods who foretell the future" and claimed to know everything Sirius predicted, but apparently  did not write personal horoscopes.<ref>Noegel et al., op.cit., pp.143f</ref> 

The lunar crater [[Harkhebi (crater)|Harkhebi]] is named after him.
