'''Go!Explore''' is [[GPS]] software for the [[PlayStation Portable]] based on '''[[iGO (software)|Nav N Go iGO 8]]''', covering several countries in Europe. It was developed by '''[[Nav N Go]]''' and utilizes maps by '''[[Tele Atlas]]'''. Sales of product started in March 2008.

'''Go!Explore''' works with Sony's PSP-290 [[GPS]] receiver, which connects to the USB port on the top of the unit. It supports 11 audio languages on every geographic version; English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish.

Currently there is no word on a United States version of Go!Explore. Explore currently only offers maps of UK/Ireland, Iberia, France, Germany/Austria/Switzerland, Italy, Benelux, and Scandinavia.

Maps and points of interest are upgradeable via downloads, while new maps and guides can be purchased from the PlayStation Store for PC. Each map version supports audio in different languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian and Finnish.

'''No updates''' to the maps until first version, confirms two years later Sony will not update Go!Explore. Nothing can be done by the end-user to try insert updated maps from Atlas on it, making Go!Explore and PSP-290 not functional. Surprisingly, manufacturer doesn't inform anywhere it's a '''discontinued product'''.
