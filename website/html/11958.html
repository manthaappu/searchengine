'''Eli Upfal''' is a [[computer science]] researcher currently a professor in the computer science department at [[Brown University]]. He completed his undergraduate studies in mathematics and statistics at the [[Hebrew University]], Israel in 1978, received an M.Sc. in computer science from the The Feinberg Graduate School of the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], Israel in 1980, and completed his PhD in computer science at the Hebrew University in 1983. He has made contributions in a variety of areas.  Most of his work involves randomized and/or [[online algorithm]]s, stochastic processes, or the probabilistic analysis of deterministic algorithms.  Particular applications include routing and communications networks, computational biology, and computational finance.

He is responsible for a large body of work, including dozens of publications in journals and conferences as well as many patents.  He has won several prizes, including the IBM Outstanding Innovation Award and the Levinson Prize in Mathematical Sciences. In 2002, Eli Upfal, was inducted as a Fellow of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]],<ref>[http://www.ieee.org/web/membership/fellows/Chronology/2002.html#U IEEE: Fellow Class of 2002].</ref> and in 2005 he was inducted as a Fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]].<ref>[http://fellows.acm.org/fellow_citation.cfm?id=5076278&srt=alpha ACM: Fellow Award / Eli Upfal].</ref> He has an [[Erd≈ës number]] of 2.
