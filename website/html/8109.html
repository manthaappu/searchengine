'''Cooked raw''' is a reference to raw image data from a digital camera that has been subjected to image-processing in the camera. This is usually the application of noise-reduction, though other types of processing may have been applied, such as lens-correction.

Generally-speaking, in a digital camera the image sensor captures and converts light from a scene into a 2D array of voltages (see [[image sensor]] array , and this 2D array of voltages is converted further into an array of RGB values stored in binary format. Usually some sort of image-correction is implicit in this conversion, as a 2D sensor is not perfect and distortions in the image data arise out of manufacturing variations such as the non-uniformity of pixel area across the sensor. Such distortions are commonly corrected across the sensor in order to balance per-pixel optical gain and thus restore imaging uniformity to the array. Cooked raw corrections go beyond basic pixel-normalization to the area of image improvement.

The point of outputting raw data from a digital camera is to provide the raw, unprocessed, unfiltered, sensor data. As such cooked raw is an oxymoron. However it is justified in the eyes of some{{Who|date=May 2010}} by the fact that no manufacturer of digital equipment actually provides truly raw image-data. This is true in the same sense that no one actually drives the posted speed limit but to take such a position is to bastardize both the meaning and the intent of raw-shooting. Clearly there is a difference between corrections applied to provide for uniform SNR across pixels, and corrections applied to maximize SNR at the expense of linear resolution. Cooked raw is clearly in the latter camp along with concepts such as digital zoom.
