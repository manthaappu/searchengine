<html> <head> <title>Author function</title></head><body>The '''author function''' is a concept related to [[deconstruction|deconstructionist]] [[literary theory]].  It was developed by [[Michel Foucault]] in his [[1969]] essay "What is the Author?" 

==Theory==
Foucault posits that the [[legal system]] was central in the rise of the [[author]], as an author was needed (in order to be punished) for making [[Transgressive art|transgressive]] statements. This is made evident through the rise of the printing press during the time of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], when religious texts that circulated challenged the authority of the [[Catholic Church]]. 

The author function does not affect all texts in the same way. For example, the author of a science [[Textbook|text books]] is not clear or definable as the author of a well known [[novel]]. It is not a spontaneous creation or entity, but a carefully constructed social position.
