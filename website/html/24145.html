'''Messaging Architects''' (MA) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] software company specializing in [[e-mail]] products. The flagship product is M+Platform, a product suite that prevents viruses, spam, and email abuse, ensures [[regulatory compliance]] and discovery, and supports disaster recovery.

==History==
Launched in March 1995 as ChronoFAX, the company was a distributor of computer-based fax solutions. ChronoFAX became Tobit Software North America as result of a partnership with a German company called [[Tobit]] that produced fax software for the [[Novell]] [[NetWare]] and [[GroupWise]] markets. When the three-and-a-half-year partnership with Tobit came to a close, the company again renamed itself, as Messaging Architects.

MA was initially a provider of add-ons for the Novell GroupWise messaging platform. Since then the company has launched other products, including: GWGuardian (now called M+Guardian) and GWArchive (M+Archive). The company aims to produce platform-independent products, to allow multiple email platforms co-exist in the same organization, and support bi-directional migration.  Messaging Architects works with messaging platform providers to provide [[solution]]s for [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange]], Novell GroupWise, and [[Lotus Notes]].

The staff at Messaging Architects include [[Mark Crispin]], best known as inventor of the [[IMAP]] protocol, and GroupWise specialist Morris Blackham.<ref>http://www.panda.com/mrc/</ref>
