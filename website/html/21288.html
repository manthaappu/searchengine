'''Layer Four Traceroute (LFT)''' is a fast, multi-protocol [[traceroute]] engine, that also implements numerous other features including [[Autonomous system (Internet)|AS number]] lookups through [[Regional Internet Registries]] and other reliable sources, [[Loose Source Routing]], [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] and load balancer detection, etc. LFT is best known for its use by network security practitioners to trace a route to a destination host through many configurations of packet-filters / [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]] and to detect network connectivity, performance or latency problems.

== How it Works ==
LFT sends various [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] SYN and FIN probes (differing from [[Van Jacobson]]'s [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]-based [[Traceroute#Implementation|method]]) or [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] probes utilizing the [[Internet Protocol|IP protocol]] 'time to live' field and attempts to elicit an [[Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]] TIME_EXCEEDED response from each [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]] along the path to some host. LFT also listens for various TCP, UDP, and ICMP messages along the way to assist network managers in ascertaining per-protocol [[heuristic routing]] information, and can optionally retrieve various information about the networks it traverses. The operation of layer four traceroute is described in detail in several prominent security books<ref>Extreme Exploits: Advanced Defenses Against Hardcore Hacks (2005) McGraw-Hill ISBN 0-07-225955-8</ref><ref>The Tao of Network Security Monitoring (2004) Addison-Wesley ISBN 0-32-124677-2</ref>.

==Origins==
The lft command first appeared in 1998 as 'fft'.  Renamed as a result of confusion with [[Fast Fourier transform]]s, lft stands for 'layer four traceroute.'  Results are often referred to as a 'layer four trace.'
