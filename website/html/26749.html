{{Lowercase|ntop}}
'''ntop''' is a network probe that shows network usage in a way similar to what [[Top (Unix)|top]] does for processes. In interactive mode, it displays the [[Computer networking|network]] status on the user's terminal. In Web mode, it acts as a [[web server]], creating a [[HTML]] dump of the network status. It sports a [[NetFlow]]/[[sFlow]] emitter/collector, a [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]]-based client interface for creating ntop-centric monitoring applications, and [[RRDtool|RRD]] for persistently storing traffic statistics.<ref>[http://www.ntop.org/overview.html Ntop Feature Overview]</ref>

ntop is available for both [[Unix]] and Win32-based platforms. It has been developed by [[Luca Deri]], an [[Italy|Italian]] research scientist and network manager at [[University of Pisa]].

Common usage on a [[Linux]] system is to start the ntop daemon (/etc/init.d/ntopd start), then one can use the web interface to ntop via visiting http://127.0.0.1:3000 provided the loopback device has been started (/etc/init.d/net.lo start) and the listening port for ntop is 3000 (look out for the -w option in ps aux | grep ntop).
