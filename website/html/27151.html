==Overview==
{{Expand section|date=June 2010}}
OkCupid is a service of Humor Rainbow, Inc. OkCupid facilitates both [[heterosexual]] and [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex]] relationships. OkCupid claims 3.5 million active users as of September 2010.<ref name="blog.okcupid.com">http://blog.okcupid.com/</ref> <!-- is it ok to cite the website itself for this? -->

There is a very active journaling/[[blog]]ging community on OkCupid as well. Members have the option of saving favorite users' profiles, which displays the favorited person's new journal entries as well as comments on others' entries on the member's front page.

OkCupid is entirely free to use, and does not place any restrictions on messaging or searching for non-paying users. The registration process is quick, and there are no restrictions on who can join the site. OkCupid does not advertise its services on other websites. OkCupid generates revenue from advertisements and a monthly subscription fee from members enrolled as "A-List" members, who see no advertising and have more filtering options, the ability to separate photos into photo albums, and preferential placement in an "A-List Matches" section of search results.<ref>http://www.okcupid.com/a-list-extras</ref>

OkTrends, the official blog of OkCupid, shows statistical observations from OkCupid user interactions, to explore the data side of the online dating world.<ref name="blog.okcupid.com"/>

OkTrends articles have had over a million unique readers since July 2009.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Matching==
To generate matches, OkCupid applies data generated by users' activities on the site,<ref>http://www.okcupid.com/faq</ref> as well as their answers to questions.  When answering a question, a user indicates his or her own answer, the answers he or she would accept from partners, and the level of importance he or she places on the question. The results of these questions can be made public. OkCupid describes in detail the algorithm used to calculate match percentages based on answered questions,<ref>http://www.okcupid.com/faaaq</ref> and has applied for a patent on the process.

Users can search for potential matches based on their match percentage, as well as other features, such as age, religion, and location. Some features are not searchable, such as weight. The site also uses a "Quickmatch" feature, which displays user images and information, but not user names, and contacts a member via email if they were "4 or 5-starred". The site notifies a user if both parties gave 4 or 5 stars, in addition to "mutual burns", when both parties give one stars.

Users who receive high ratings may be notified by email that they are in the "top half of OkCupid's users." This email states that they "will now see more attractive people in [their] match results", but A-List users can search by star rating as well.<ref>"Attractive User" email</ref>

==History==
OkCupid is a service of Humor Rainbow, Inc. OkCupidâ€™s founders (Chris Coyne, [[Christian Rudder]], Sam Yagan and Max Krohn) were students at [[Harvard University]] when they gained recognition for their creation of TheSpark and, later, [[SparkNotes]]. Among other things, TheSpark.com featured a number of humorous self-quizzes and personality tests, including the four-variable [[Myers-Briggs]] style Match Test. SparkMatch debuted as a beta experiment of allowing registered users who had taken the Match Test to search for and contact each other based on their Match Test types. The popularity of SparkMatch took off and it was launched as its own site, later being renamed OkCupid. The current OkCupid Dating Persona Test is still largely identical, in question and text blurb content and order, to the original Match Test. In 2001, they sold SparkMatch to [[Barnes & Noble]], and began work on OkCupid.<ref>[http://www.okcupid.com/about-us.html OkCupid.com: About Us<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 2007, OkCupid launched Crazy Blind Date.<ref name=CrazyBlindDate>[http://www.crazyblinddate.com CrazyBlindDate.com]</ref><ref name=crazyblinddate-okcupid>[http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/06/meet-potential-lovers-over-a-drink-with-crazyblinddate Meet Potential Lovers Over a Drink with CrazyBlindDate - TechCrunch, Nov 06, 2006]</ref>

In 2008, OkCupid spun off its test-design portion under the name Hello Quizzy (HQ),<ref name="HQ"/> while keeping it indelibly linked to OkCupid and reserving existent OkCupid users' names on HQ.<ref name=HQ>[http://HelloQuizzy.com Hello Quizzy]</ref>

Since August 2009, OkCupid has included an "A-list" account option that provides additional services for a monthly fee.<ref name="OkCupid A-list">[http://www.okcupid.com/upgrade?cf=noads OkCupid.com]</ref>
