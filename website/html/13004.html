'''f2c''' is the name of a program to [[Transcompiler|convert]] [[Fortran 77]] to [[C programming language|C]] code, developed  at [[Bell Laboratories]].  The standalone f2c program was based on the core of the first complete Fortran 77 [[compiler]] to be implemented, the "f77" program by Feldman and Weinberger.  Because the f77 compiler was itself written in C and relied on a C compiler back end to complete its final compilation step, it and its derivatives like f2c were much more portable than compilers generating [[machine code]] directly.

The f2c program was released as [[free software]] ([[open-source software]]) and subsequently became one of the most common means to compile Fortran code on many systems where native Fortran compilers were unavailable or expensive.  Several large Fortran libraries, such as [[LAPACK]], were made available as C libraries via conversion with f2c.  The f2c program also influenced the development of the [[GNU Compiler Collection|GNU g77 compiler]], which uses a modified version of the f2c runtime [[Library (computing)|libraries]].
