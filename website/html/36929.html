'''Technical terminology''' is the specialized [[vocabulary]] of any field, not just technical fields. The same is true of the synonyms '''''technical terms''''',  '''''terms of art''''', '''''shop talk''''' and '''''words of art''''', which do not necessarily refer to [[technology]] or [[art]].<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/term+of+art?r=66 Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law]</ref><ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/term+of+art McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine]</ref><ref>[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Term+of+art West's Encyclopedia of American Law]</ref> Within one or more fields, these terms have one or more specific meanings that are not necessarily the same as those in common use. [[Jargon]] is similar, but more informal in definition and use. Legal technical terms, often called ''(legal) terms of art'' or ''(legal) words of art'', have meanings that are strictly defined by law. 

An '''industry term''' is a type of technical terminology that has a particular meaning within a specific industry.  The phrase '''industry term''' implies that a word or phrase is a typical one within a particular industry or business and people within the industry or business will be familiar with and use the term.

Technical terminology exists in a continuum of formality. Precise technical terms and their definitions are formally recognised, documented, and taught by educators in the field. Other terms are more colloquial, coined and used by practitioners in the field, and are similar to [[slang]]. The boundaries between formal and slang jargon, as in general English, are quite fluid, with terms sliding in and out of recognition. This is especially true in the rapidly developing world of computers and networking. For instance, the term ''[[Firewall (networking)|firewall]]'' (in the sense of a device used to filter network traffic) was at first technical slang. As these devices became more important and the term became widely understood, the word was adopted as formal terminology.

Technical terminology evolves due to the need for experts in a field to communicate with precision and brevity, but often has the  effect of excluding those who are unfamiliar with the particular specialized language of the group. This can cause difficulties as, for example, when a patient is unable to follow the discussions of medical practitioners, and thus cannot understand his own condition and treatment. Differences in jargon also cause difficulties where professionals in related fields use different terms for the same phenomena. For instance, substantial amounts of duplicated research occur in [[cognitive psychology]] and [[human-computer interaction]] partly because of such difficulties. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

The term ''jargon'' can, and often does, have pejorative connotations, particularly when aimed at "business culture" (especially when in forms bordering on slang or buzzwords). The [[marketing]] and [[public relations]] industries in particular have expanded the lexicon of business terms that marks the global [[business]] environment.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
