In [[computer programming]], the '''scheduler pattern''' is a [[software design pattern]]. It is a [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]] pattern used to explicitly control when [[thread (software engineering)|thread]]s may [[execution (computers)|execute]] single-threaded [[source code|code]], like write operation to a file.

The scheduler pattern uses an object that explicitly sequences waiting threads. It provides a mechanism to implement a [[scheduling policy]], but is independent of any specific scheduling policy &mdash; the policy is encapsulated in its own class and is reusable.

The [[Read write lock pattern|read/write lock pattern]] is usually implemented using the scheduler pattern to ensure fairness in scheduling.

Note that the scheduler pattern adds significant overhead beyond that required to call a synchronized [[method (computer science)|method]].

The scheduler pattern is not quite the same as the [[scheduled-task pattern]] used for real-time systems.
