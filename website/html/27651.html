<html> <head> <title>Opportunistic reasoning</title></head><body>'''Opportunistic reasoning''' is a method of selecting a suitable [[logical inference]] strategy within [[artificial intelligence]] applications. 

Specific [[Deductive reasoning|reasoning methods]] may be used to draw [[Logical consequence|conclusions]] from a set of given facts in a [[knowledge base]], e.g. [[forward chaining]] versus [[backward chaining]]. However, in opportunistic reasoning, pieces of knowledge may be applied either forward or backward, at the "most opportune time".<ref>''Blackboard systems'' by I. Craig, 1995 ISBN 1567500293 page 84</ref>

An opportunistic reasoning system may combine elements of both forward and backward reasoning. It is useful when the number of possible inferences is very large and the reasoning system must be responsive to new data that may become known.<ref>''Fundamentals of expert systems technology'' by Samuel J. Biondo 1990 ISBN 089391701X page 69</ref>

Opportunistic reasoning has been used in applications such as [[blackboard system]]s and medical applications.<ref>Roy Turner, "Opportunistic use of schemata" in ''Tenth Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society'' 1988 ISBN 0805804366 page 165</ref>
