'''Golem''' is an [[inductive logic programming]] algorithm developed by [[Stephen Muggleton]] and Feng. It uses the technique [[relative least general generalization]] proposed by [[Gordon Plotkin]]. Therefore, only positive examples are used and the search is bottom-up.
Negative examples can be used to reduce the size of the hypothesis by deleting useless literals from the body clause.
