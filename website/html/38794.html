'''Unified shadow and lighting''' is the [[lighting model]] used in the ''[[Doom 3]]'' game developed by [[id Software]].

Previous 3D games like ''[[Quake III Arena]]'', used separate lighting models for determining how a light would illuminate a character or a [[level (video gaming)|map]]. Lighting and [[shadow]] information for maps would be static, pre-generated and stored, whereas lighting and shadowing information for characters would be determined at run-time.

''Doom 3'' uses a unified model that generates the lighting and shadows for everything at run-time. This means that any lights will affect the whole scene and not only certain parts. This may include [[self-shadowing]] via [[shadow volume]]s, where characters can cast shadows on themselves (for example, the shadow cast by the [[Marine (military)|marine]]'s [[chin]] onto his [[neck]]).
