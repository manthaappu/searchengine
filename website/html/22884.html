'''GNU MCSim''' is a suite of simulation software.  It allows one to design one's own statistical or simulation models,
perform [[Monte Carlo method| Monte Carlo]]  simulations, and [[Bayesian inference]] through [[Markov chain]] models.

==Description==
GNU MCSim is a simulation and statistical inference tool for algebraic or [[differential equation]] systems, optimized for performing Monte Carlo analysis. The software is intended to enable the user to perform easy to maintain environment. It comprises a model generator and a simulation engine:

* The model generator facilitates structural model definition and maintenance, while keeping execution time short. The model is coded using a simple grammar, and the generator translates it into C code. Starting with version 5.3.0, models coded in [[SBML]] can also be used.

* The simulation engine is a set of routines that are linked to the model in order to produce executable code. The result is that one can run simulations of the structural model under a variety of conditions.

Internally, the software uses the [[GNU Scientific Library]] for its numerical calculations.

==History==
The project began in 1991 in Berkeley when Don Maszle and Frederic Bois translated in C and reorganized a program that Bois had developed at Harvard for his PhD thesis. The primary motivation for the work was to be able to quickly develop and easily maintain [[PBPK]] models. However, the syntax was defined with enough generality that many algebraic and first-order ordinary [[differential equations]] can be solved. The capability to perform efficient [[Monte Carlo simulations]] was added early on, for the research needs of the group. The code was made freely available from a server at UC Berkeley. Discussions with Stuart Beal at [[University of California, San Francisco|UCSF]] School of Pharmacy, led the team to investigate the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques for PBPK models' [[Calibration (statistics)|calibration]]. The corresponding code was developed by Maszle, during a project in collaboration with [[Andrew Gelman]], then professor at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] Statistics Department. Additional code written by Ken Revzan allowed the definition and Bayesian calibration of hierarchical (multilevel) statistical models. At the time of these developments (around 1996) those capabilities were unique for a freely distributed, easily accessible, efficient and quite versatile software.
