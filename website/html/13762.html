<html> <head> <title>Fleet Radio Unit</title></head><body>'''Fleet Radio Units''' (FRU) were the major centers for [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] cryptological and [[signals intelligence]] during the [[Pacific War|Pacific Campaign]] of [[World War II]].  Initially two FRUs were established in the Pacific, one at [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Hawaii]], called [[Station HYPO]] or FRUPAC (Fleet Radio Unit, Pacific), and the other, called [[Station CAST]] or Belconnen, at [[U.S. Naval Station Sangley Point|Cavite Naval Yard]], then [[Corregidor]], Philippines.  With the [[Battle of the Philippines (1941–42)|fall of the Philippines]] to [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japanese]] forces in April and May 1942, CAST personnel were evacuated to a newly established FRU at [[Melbourne, Australia]], called [[FRUMEL]] (Fleet Radio Unit, Melbourne).

HYPO and FRUMEL supervised detached field units scattered at various locations and aboard ships throughout the south, central, and north Pacific areas until the end of World War II.  A third center, NEGAT, was based at [[OP-20-G]] headquarters in [[Washington DC]].  The entire cryptanalysis effort conducted by the units was called ''[[Operation Magic]]''.  Liaison between the units and with the [[Far East Combined Bureau]] (FECB;  the British signals intelligence center at [[Colombo]], [[Ceylon]] in 1942) was titled ''[[Copek]]''.
