Additionally, the software may provide an appointment book, address book, and/or contact list. These tools are an extension of many of the features provided by time management software such as desk accessory packages and computer office automation systems. 

The software may be a local package designed for individual use (e.g. Lightning extension for [[Mozilla Thunderbird]], [[Microsoft Outlook]] without Exchange Server, or [[Windows Calendar]]) or may be a networked package that allows for the sharing of information between users (e.g. [[Mozilla Sunbird]], [[Windows Live Calendar]], [[Google Calendar]], or [[Microsoft Outlook]] with Exchange Server).
