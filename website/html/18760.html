<html> <head> <title>Intelligent Small World Autonomous Robots for Micro-manipulation</title></head><body>'''Intelligent Small World Autonomous Robots for Micro-manipulation''' (I-Swarm) is a [[Europe]]an research project to develop millimeter-scale [[robots]] for dangerous activities. It is coordinated by Jörg Seyfried at the [[University of Karlsruhe]] in [[Germany]]. The robots operate on [[solar power]] and can communicate between each other.

==Aims==

The I-Swarm project aims to develop and produce a large scale [[swarm]] (up to 1,000<ref>ISWARM, University of Karlsruhe, Research and Innovation in Baden-Württemberg http://www.wissenschaftwirtschaft-bw.de/index.php4?topic=universitaet&uni_id=6&profile_id=28</ref>) of [[Microbotics|microrobots]].<ref>IPR Publications, 2004, Abstract http://wwwipr.ira.uka.de/en/Publications/detailed_publication.htm?id=1095254176</ref>

==Robots==

The robots' proposed size is 2 x 2 x 1 mm. This small size means that [[sensory]] and computational capabilities will be limited. This is to be compensated for by [[collective behavior]] and [[Emergent behavior|emerging]] [[Swarm intelligence|swarm effects]].<ref>IPR Publications, 2004, Abstract http://wwwipr.ira.uka.de/en/Publications/detailed_publication.htm?id=1095254176</ref>
The robots will differ in the type of [[sensors]], manipulators and the amount of computational power.<ref>COGNIRON Links, I-SWARM, http://www.cogniron.org/Links.php</ref>

==Activities==
The robot swarm is expected to have a variety of applications, including micro assembly, biological, medical or cleaning tasks.<ref>COGNIRON Links, I-SWARM, http://www.cogniron.org/Links.php</ref>
