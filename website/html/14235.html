{{Freedom}}
{{Censorship}}
'''Freedom of speech''' is the freedom to speak freely without [[censorship]] or [[limitation]], or both. The synonymous term '''freedom of expression''' is sometimes used to indicate not only freedom of verbal speech but any act of seeking, receiving and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the medium used. In practice, the right to freedom of speech is not absolute in any country and the right is commonly subject to limitations, such as on "[[hate speech]]".

The right to freedom of speech is recognized as a [[human right]] under Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and recognized in [[international human rights law]] in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR). The ICCPR recognizes the right to freedom of speech as "the right to hold opinions without interference. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression."<ref>[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]</ref><ref>[http://www.allbusiness.com/corporate-governance/4082846-1.html Using Courts to Enforce the Free Speech Provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights | Australia & Oceania > Australia & New Zealand from All Business...<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Furthermore freedom of speech is recognized in European, inter-American and African regional human rights law. 

It is different from and not to be confused with the concept of [[freedom of thought]].

== The right to freedom of speech and expression ==
Concepts of freedom of speech can be found in early human rights documents<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/feb/05/religion.news | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Timeline: a history of free speech | first=David | last=Smith | date=2006-02-05 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> and the modern concept of freedom of speech emerged gradually during the [[European Enlightenment]].<ref>"[http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/hum_303/enlightenment.html The Enlightenment]". [[Washington State University]].</ref> England’s [[Bill of Rights 1689]] granted 'freedom of speech in Parliament' and the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], adopted during the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, specifically affirmed freedom of speech as an inalienable right.<ref>"[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/feb/05/religion.news Timeline: a history of free speech]" [[The Guardian]]. February 5, 2006.</ref> The Declaration provides for freedom of expression in Article 11, which states that:
<blockquote>
"The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly, speak, write, and print with freedom, but shall be responsible for such abuses of this freedom as shall be defined by law."<ref>http://www.hrcr.org/docs/frenchdec.html</ref>
</blockquote>

Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted in  1948, states that:
<blockquote>
"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."<ref>[http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ Universal Declaration of Human Rights]</ref>
</blockquote>
Today freedom of speech, or the freedom of expression, is recognized in international and regional [[human rights law]]. The right is enshrined in Article 19 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], Article 10 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], Article 13 of the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] and Article 9 of the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]].<ref name=autogenerated1>Andrew Puddephatt, Freedom of Expression, The essentials of Human Rights, Hodder Arnold, 2005, pg.128</ref> Based on [[John Stuart Mill]]'s arguments, freedom of speech is understood as a multi-faceted right that includes not only the right to express, or disseminate, information and ideas, but three further distinct aspects:
* the right to seek information and ideas;
* the right to receive information and ideas;
* the right to impart information and ideas.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

International, regional and national standards also recognize that freedom of speech, as the freedom of expression, includes any medium, be it orally, in written, in print, through the [[Internet]] or through art forms. This means that the protection of freedom of speech as a right includes not only the content, but also the means of expression.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

=== Relationship to other rights ===
The right to freedom of speech and expression is closely related to other rights, and may be limited when conflicting with other rights (see [[Freedom of speech#Limitations on freedom of speech|Limitations on freedom of speech]]).<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The right to freedom of expression is also related to the [[right to a fair trial]] and court proceeding which may limit access to the search for information or determine the opportunity and means in which freedom of expression is manifested within court proceedings.<ref name=Limitstotolerance>{{cite book| last =Brett| first = Sebastian| title = Limits to tolerance: freedom of expression and the public debate in Chile

</ref> As a general principle freedom of expression may not limit the [[right to privacy]], as well as the honor and reputation of others. However greater latitude is given when criticism of public figures is involved.<ref name=Limitstotolerance/>
The right to freedom of expression is particularly important for [[News media|media]], which plays a special role as the bearer of the general right to freedom of expression for all.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> However, [[freedom of the press]] is not necessarily enabling freedom of speech. Judith Lichtenberg has outlined conditions in which freedom of the press may constrain freedom of speech, for example where the media suppresses information or stifles the diversity of voices inherent in freedom of speech. Lichtenberg argues that [[freedom of the press]] is simply a form of [[property right]] summed up by the principle "no money, no voice".<ref>{{Cite book| last = Sanders| first = Karen| title = Ethics & Journalism| publisher = Sage| year = 2003| pages = 68| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=bnpliIUyO60C&dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&lr=&as_brr=3&source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780761969679}}</ref>

== Origins and academic freedom ==
Freedom of speech and expression has a long history that predates modern [[international human rights instruments]].  It is thought that ancient [[Athenian democracy|Athens’ democratic ideology]] of free speech may have emerged in the late 6th or early 5th century BC.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Origins of democracy in ancient Greece|first=Kurt|last=Raaflaub|first2=Josiah|last2=Ober|first3=Robert|last3=Wallace|year=2007|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=0520245628|page=65|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> In [[Islamic ethics]], freedom of speech was first declared in the [[Rashidun]] period by the [[caliph]] [[Umar]] in the 7th century AD.<ref name=Boisard>{{Cite journal|title=On the Probable Influence of Islam on Western Public and International Law|first=Marcel A.|last=Boisard|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|volume=11|issue=4|date=July 1980|pages=429–50|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

== Freedom of speech, dissent and truth ==

Before the invention of the [[printing press]] a writing, once created, could only be physically multiplied by the highly laborious and error-prone process of manual copying out and an elaborate system of censorship and control over [[scribes]] existed.<ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 14">{{Cite book | last = de Sola Pool| first = Ithiel | title = Technologies of freedom| publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 1983 | pages = 14 | url = http://www.google.com/books?id=BzLXGUxV4CkC&pg=PA15&dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=36#v=onepage&q=&f=false| isbn = 9780674872332}}</ref> Printing allowed for multiple exact copies of a work, leading to a more rapid and widespread circulation of ideas and information (see [[print culture]]).<ref name="MacQueen 2007 34">{{Cite book | last = MacQueen | first = Hector L | coauthors = Charlotte Waelde and Graeme T Laurie | title = Contemporary Intellectual Property: Law and Policy | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2007 | pages = 34 | url = http://www.google.com/books?id=_Iwcn4pT0OoC&dq=contemporary+intellectual+property&source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn = 9780199263394}}</ref> The origins of [[copyright law]] in most European countries lie in efforts by the church and governments to regulate and control the output of printers.<ref name="MacQueen 2007 34"/> In 1501 [[Pope Alexander VI]] issued a bull against the unlicensed printing of books and in 1559 the [[Index Expurgatorius]], or ''List of Prohibited Books'', was issued for the first time.<ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 14"/> While governments and church encouraged printing in many ways, which allowed the dissemination of [[Bible]]s and government information, works of dissent and criticism could also circulate rapidly. As a consequence, governments established controls over printers across Europe, requiring them to have official licences to trade and produce books.<ref name="MacQueen 2007 34"/>

The notion that the expression of dissent or subversive views should be tolerated, not censured or punished by law, developed alongside the rise of [[printing]] and the [[press]]. ''[[Areopagitica]]'', published in 1644, was [[John Milton]]'s response to the [[Parliament of England|Parliament of England's]] re-introduction of government licensing of [[printers]], hence [[publishers]]. Milton made an impassioned plea for freedom of expression and toleration of falsehood,<ref name="Sanders 2003 66">{{Cite book| last = Sanders| first = Karen| title = Ethics & Journalism| publisher = Sage| year = 2003| pages = 66| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=bnpliIUyO60C&dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&lr=&as_brr=3&source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780761969679}}</ref> stating:
<blockquote>
"Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties."<ref name="Sanders 2003 66"/>
</blockquote>  
Milton's defence of freedom of expression was grounded in a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] worldview and he thought that the English people had the mission to work out the truth of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], which would lead to the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] of all people. But Milton also articulated the main strands of future discussions about freedom of expression. By defining the scope of freedom of expression and of "harmful" speech Milton argued against the principle of pre-censorship and in favour of tolerance for a wide range of views.<ref name="Sanders 2003 66"/>

In 1557 the [[British Crown]] thought to stem the flow of seditious and heretical books by chartering the [[Stationers' Company]]. The right to print was limited to the members of that guild, and thirty years later the [[Star Chamber]] was chartered to curtail the "greate enormities and abuses" of "dyvers contentyous and disorderlye persons professinge the arte or mystere of pryntinge or selling of books." The right to print was restricted to two universities and to the 21 existing printers in the [[city of London]],  which had 53 [[printing presses]]. As the British crown took control of type founding in 1637 printers fled to the [[Netherlands]]. Confrontation with authority made printers radical and rebellious, with 800 authors, printers and book dealers being incarcerated in the [[Bastille]] in Paris before it was stormed in 1789.<ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 15"/>

A succession of English thinkers developed the idea of a right to freedom of expression, starting with [[John Milton]] (1608–74), then [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) and culminating in [[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873). Locke established the [[individual]] as the unit of value and the bearer of rights to [[right to life|life]], [[right to liberty|liberty]], [[right to property|property]] and the [[pursuit of happiness]]. It was the role of [[Government]] to protect these rights and this belief was first enshrined in the [[US Constitution]], with the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] adding the guarantee that "Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press". John Stuart Mill argued that human freedom is good and without it there can be no progress in science, law or politics, which according to Mill required free discussion of opinion. Mill's [[On Liberty]], published in 1859 became a classic defence of the right to freedom of expression.<ref name="Sanders 2003 66"/> Mill argued that [[truth]] drives out falsity, therefore the free expression of ideas, true or false, should not be feared. Truth is not stable or fixed, but evolves with time. Mill argued that much of what we once considered true has turned out false. Therefore views should not be prohibited for their apparent falsity. Mill also argued that free discussion is necessary to prevent the "deep slumber of a decided opinion". Discussion would drive the onwards march of truth and by considering false views the basis of true views could be re-affirmed.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Sanders| first = Karen| title = Ethics & Journalism| publisher = Sage| year = 2003| pages = 67| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=bnpliIUyO60C&dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&lr=&as_brr=3&source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780761969679}}</ref>

In [[Evelyn Beatrice Hall]]'s biography of [[Voltaire]], she coined the following phrase to illustrate Voltaire's beliefs: "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."<ref>[http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/e/evelyn_beatrice_hall.html Evelyn Beatrice Hall Quotes], Brainyquote.com</ref> Hall's quote is frequently cited to describe the principle of freedom of speech.<ref>{{cite book |last=Boller, Jr. |first=Paul F. |authorlink= |coauthors=George, John |title=They Never Said It: A Book of Fake Quotes, Misquotes, and Misleading Attributions |year=1989 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |pages=124–126 |isbn=0-19-505541-1 }}</ref> In the 20th Century [[Noam Chomsky]] states that: "If you believe in freedom of speech, you believe in freedom of speech for views you don't like. [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], for example, were dictators in favor of freedom of speech for views they liked only. If you're in favor of freedom of speech, that means you're in favor of freedom of speech precisely for views you despise."<ref>''[[Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media]]'', 1992</ref> Professor [[Lee Bollinger]] argues that "the free speech principle involves a special act of carving out one area of social interaction for extraordinary self-restraint, the purpose of which is to develop and demonstrate a social capacity to control feelings evoked by a host of social encounters." Bollinger argues that [[tolerance]] is a desirable value, if not essential. However, critics argue that society should be concerned by those who directly deny or advocate, for example, [[genocide]] (see [[#Limitations on freedom of speech|Limitations on freedom of speech]]).<ref>Lee Bollinger, The Tolerant Society, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1988</ref> The European Union's Framework decision on Racism and Xenophobia states that denying or grossly trivialising "crimes of genocide" should be made "punishable in all EU Member States".<ref>[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/misc/93739.pdf See Luxembourg, April 19, 2007, 8665/07 (Presse 84)]</ref> [[Holocaust denial]] is illegal in 16 countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, [[Israel]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], and Switzerland.<ref>Lechtholz-Zey, Jacqueline: Laws Banning Holocaust Denial.

== Democracy ==
The notion of freedom of expression is intimately linked to political debate and the concept of [[democracy]]. The norms on limiting freedom of expression mean that public debate may not be completely suppressed even in times of emergency.<ref name=Limitstotolerance /> One of the most notable proponents of the link between freedom of speech and [[democracy]] is [[Alexander Meiklejohn]]. He argues that the concept of democracy is that of self-government by the people. For such a system to work an informed electorate is necessary. In order to be appropriately knowledgeable, there must be no constraints on the free flow of information and ideas. According to Meiklejohn, democracy will not be true to its essential ideal if those in power are able to manipulate the electorate by withholding information and stifling criticism. Meiklejohn acknowledges that the desire to manipulate opinion can stem from the motive of seeking to benefit society. However, he argues, choosing manipulation negates, in its means, the democratic ideal.<ref>{{cite book |title=Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion |last=Marlin |first=Randal |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Broadview Press |location= |isbn=1551113767 978-1551113760  |pages=226–227 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&pg=PA226&dq=%22free+speech%22+democracy }}</ref> 

[[Eric Barendt]] has called this defence of free speech on the grounds of democracy "probably the most attractive and certainly the most fashionable free speech theory in modern Western democracies".<ref>{{cite book |title=Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion |last=Marlin |first=Randal |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Broadview Press |location= |isbn=1551113767 978-1551113760 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&pg=PA226&dq=%22free+speech%22+democracy  |page=226 }}</ref> Thomas I. Emerson expanded on this defence when he argued that freedom of speech helps to provide a balance between [[stability]] and [[Social change|change]]. Freedom of speech acts as a "safety valve" to let off steam when people might otherwise be bent on [[revolution]]. He argues that "The principle of open discussion is a method of achieving a moral adaptable and at the same time more stable community, of maintaining the precarious balance between healthy cleavage and necessary consensus." Emerson furthermore maintains that "Opposition serves a vital social function in offsetting or ameliorating (the) normal process of bureaucratic decay."<ref>{{cite book |title=Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion |last=Marlin |first=Randal |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Broadview Press |location= |isbn=1551113767 978-1551113760  |pages=228–229 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&pg=PA226&dq=%22free+speech%22+democracy }}</ref> 

Research undertaken by the [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] project at the [[World Bank]], indicates that freedom of speech, and the process of accountability that follows it, have a significant impact in the quality of [[governance]] of a country. "Voice and Accountability" within a country, defined as "the extent to which a country's [[citizen]]s are able to participate in selecting their [[government]], as well as freedom of expression, [[freedom of association]], and [[Freedom of the press|free media]]" is one of the six dimensions of governance that the Worldwide Governance Indicators measure for more than 200 countries.<ref>http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi2007/pdf/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf A Decade of Measuring the Quality of Governance</ref>

== Social interaction and community ==
Richard Moon has developed the argument that the value of freedom of speech and freedom of expression lies with social interactions. Moon writes that "by communicating an individual forms relationships and associations with others – family, friends, co-workers, church congregation, and countrymen. By entering into discussion with others an individual participates in the development of knowledge and in the direction of the community."<ref>{{cite book |title=Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion |last=Marlin |first=Randal |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Broadview Press |location= |isbn=1551113767 978-1551113760 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&pg=PA226&dq=%22free+speech%22+democracy  |page=229 }}</ref>

== Limitations on freedom of speech ==

:''For specific country examples see [[Freedom of speech by country]], and [[Criminal speech]].
According to the Freedom Forum Organization, legal systems, and society at large, recognize limits on the freedom of speech, particularly when freedom of speech conflicts with other values or rights.<ref>[http://www.freedomforum.org/packages/first/curricula/educationforfreedom/L04main.htm When May Speech Be Limited?]</ref> Limitations to freedom of speech may follow the "[[harm principle]]" or the "offense principle", for example in the case of [[pornography]] or [[hate speech]].<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freedom-speech/ Freedom of Speech (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Limitations to freedom of speech may occur through legal sanction or social disapprobation, or both.<ref name="leeds1">[http://www.seop.leeds.ac.uk/entries/freedom-speech/#HarPriFreSpe Freedom of Speech]</ref>

In "[[On Liberty]]" (1859) [[John Stuart Mill]] argued that "...there ought to exist the fullest liberty of professing and discussing, as a matter of ethical conviction, any doctrine, however immoral it may be considered."<ref name="leeds1"/> Mill argues that the fullest liberty of expression is required to push arguments to their logical limits, rather than the limits of social embarrassment. However, Mill also introduced what is known as the harm principle, in placing the following limitation on free expression: "the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others."<ref name="leeds1"/> 

In 1985 [[Joel Feinberg]] introduced what is known as the "offence principle", arguing that Mill's harm principle does not provide sufficient protection against the wrongful behaviours of others. Feinberg wrote "It is always a good reason in support of a proposed criminal prohibition that it would probably be an effective way of preventing serious offense (as opposed to injury or harm) to persons other than the actor, and that it is probably a necessary means to that end."<ref name="ref1">[http://www.iep.utm.edu/l/law-phil.htm Philosophy of Law]</ref> Hence Feinberg argues that the harm principle sets the bar too high and that some forms of expression can be legitimately prohibited by law because they are very offensive. But, as offending someone is less serious than harming someone, the penalties imposed should be higher for causing harm.<ref name="ref1"/> In contrast Mill does not support legal penalties unless they are based on the harm principle.<ref name="leeds1"/> Because the degree to which people may take offense varies, or may be the result of unjustified prejudice, Feinberg suggests that a number of factors need to be taken into account when applying the offense principle, including: the extent, duration and social value of the speech, the ease with which it can be avoided, the motives of the speaker, the number of people offended, the intensity of the offense, and the general interest of the community at large.<ref name="leeds1"/>

== The Internet and Information Society ==
Jo Glanville, editor of the [[Index on Censorship]], states that "the Internet has been a revolution for [[censorship]] as much as for free speech".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/nov/17/censorship-internet |title=The big business of net censorship |last=Glanville  |first=Jo |date=17 November 2008 |publisher= The Guardian | location=London}}</ref> International, national and regional standards recognise that freedom of speech, as one form of freedom of expression, applies to any medium, including the [[Internet]].<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The [[Communications Decency Act]] (CDA) of 1996 was the first notable attempt by the [[United States Congress]] to regulate [[pornography|pornographic]] material on the [[Internet]]. In 1997, in the landmark [[cyberlaw]] case of ''[[Reno v. ACLU]]'', the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] partially overturned the law.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Judge [[Stewart R. Dalzell]], one of the three federal judges who in June 1996 declared parts of the CDA unconstitutional, in his opinion stated the following:<ref name="Stanford University">[www.stanford.edu/~steener/handouts/exsource2.doc Stanford University]</ref>

<blockquote>
"The Internet is a far more speech-enhancing medium than print, the village green, or the mails.   Because it would necessarily affect the Internet itself, the CDA would necessarily reduce the speech available for adults on the medium.  This is a constitutionally intolerable result. Some of the dialogue on the Internet surely tests the limits of conventional discourse.  Speech on the Internet can be unfiltered, unpolished, and unconventional, even emotionally charged, sexually explicit, and vulgar – in a word, “indecent” in many communities.  But we should expect such speech to occur in a medium in which citizens from all walks of life have a voice.  We should also protect the autonomy that such a medium confers to ordinary people as well as media magnates. [. . .] My analysis does not deprive the Government of all means of protecting children from the dangers of Internet communication.  The Government can continue to protect children from pornography on the Internet through vigorous enforcement of existing laws criminalizing obscenity and child pornography. [. . .] As we learned at the hearing, there is also a compelling need for public educations about the benefits and dangers of this new medium, and the Government can fill that role as well.  In my view, our action today should only mean that Government’s permissible supervision of Internet contents stops at the traditional line of unprotected speech. [. . .] The absence of governmental regulation of Internet content has unquestionably produced a kind of chaos, but as one of the plaintiff’s experts put it with such resonance at the hearing: “What achieved success was the very chaos that the Internet is.  The strength of the Internet is chaos.”  Just as the strength of the Internet is chaos, so that strength of our liberty depends upon the chaos and cacophony of the unfettered speech the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protects."<ref name="Stanford University"/>

The [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS) Declaration of Principles adopted in 2003 makes specific reference to the importance of the right to freedom of expression for the "[[Information society|Information Society]]" in stating:
<blockquote>
"We reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the [[Information Society]], and as outlined in Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Communication is a fundamental social process, a basic human need and the foundation of all social organisation. It is central to the [[Information society|Information Society]].

According to [[Bernt Hugenholtz]] and Lucie Guibault the [[public domain]] is under pressure from the "commodification of information" as item of information that previously had little or no economic value, have acquired independent economic value in the information age, such as factual data, [[personal data]], [[genetic information]] and pure [[ideas]]. The commodification of information is taking place through [[intellectual property]] law, [[contract law]], as well as broadcasting and telecommunications law.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Guibault| first = Lucy| coauthors = & Bernt Hugenholtz| title = The future of the public domain: identifying the commons in information law| publisher = Kluwer Law International| year = 2006| pages = 1| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=KJmNGglq0nwC&dq=public+domain&lr=&as_brr=3&source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9041124357, 9789041124357}}</ref>

=== Freedom of information ===
{{Main|Freedom of information}}
Freedom of information is an extension of freedom of speech where the medium of expression is the [[Internet]]. Freedom of information may also refer to the [[right to privacy]] in the context of the [[Internet]] and [[information technology]]. As with the right to freedom of expression, the [[right to privacy]] is a recognised [[human right]] and freedom of information acts as an extension to this right.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://freenetproject.org/papers/freenet-ieee.pdf Protecting Free Expression Online with Freenet – Internet Computing, IEEE<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Freedom of information may also concern [[censorship]] in an information technology context, i.e. the ability to access [[Web content]], without [[censorship]] or restrictions.<ref>Pauli, Darren (January 14, 2008). [http://www.thestandard.com/news/2008/01/14/industry-rejects-australian-govt-sanitized-internet-measure Industry rejects Australian gov't sanitized Internet measure]. ''[[The Industry Standard]]''.</ref> 

Freedom of information is also explicitly protected by acts such as the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act of Ontario, in Canada.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

=== Internet censorship ===
{{Main|Internet censorship}}
{{Main|Internet censorship in mainland China}}

The concept of [[freedom of information]] has emerged in response to state sponsored censorship, monitoring and surveillance of the internet. Internet censorship includes the control or suppression of the publishing or accessing of information on the [[Internet]].<ref>Deibert, Robert; Palfrey, John G; Rohozinski, Rafal; Zittrain, Jonathan (2008). ''Access denied: the practice and policy of global Internet filtering.'' MIT Press.</ref> The [[Global Internet Freedom Consortium]] claims to remove blocks to the "free flow of information" for what they term "closed societies".<ref>{{cite web |url=<nowiki>http://www.internetfreedom.org/mission</nowiki> |title=Mission| publisher =Global Internet Freedom Consortium |accessdate=2008-07-29}}</ref> According to the [[Reporters without Borders]] (RSB) "internet enemy list" the following states engage in pervasive internet censorship: [[Belarus]], [[China]], [[Cuba]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], [[Myanmar]]/[[Burma]], [[North Korea]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Syria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Vietnam]].<ref>[http://www.rsf.org/List-of-the-13-Internet-enemies.html Internet enemies]. Reporters without Borders.</ref>

A widely publicised example of internet censorship is the "[[Great Firewall of China]]" (in reference both to its role as a [[firewall (networking)|network firewall]] and to the ancient [[Great Wall of China]]). The system blocks content by preventing [[IP address]]es from being routed through and consists of standard firewall and [[proxy server]]s at the [[Internet]] [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]]. The system also selectively engages in [[DNS poisoning]] when particular sites are requested. The government does not appear to be systematically examining Internet content, as this appears to be technically impractical.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/china/story/0,,1713317,00.html|author=Watts, Jonathan |date= February 20, 2006 |title=War of the words |publisher=[[The Guardian]] | location=London}}</ref> [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China]] is conducted under a wide variety of laws and administrative regulations. In accordance with these laws, more than sixty Internet regulations have been made by the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) government, and censorship systems are vigorously implemented by provincial branches of state-owned [[Internet service provider|ISPs]], business companies, and organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/china0806/3.htm|title= II.
