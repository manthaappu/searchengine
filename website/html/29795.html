<html> <head> <title>Pre-emphasis network</title></head><body>In [[telecommunication]], a '''pre-emphasis network''' is a [[telecommunications network|network]] inserted in a system in order to increase the magnitude of one range of frequencies with respect to another.  

[[Pre-emphasis]] is usually employed in [[FM]] or [[phase modulation]] transmitters to equalize the modulating [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] drive [[Power (physics)|power]] in terms of [[modulation index|deviation ratio]]. The receiver [[demodulation]] process includes a reciprocal network, called a [[de-emphasis]] network, to restore the original signal power distribution.
