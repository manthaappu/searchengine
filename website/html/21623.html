'''Life with PlayStation''' is an online [[multimedia]] [[application software|application]] for the [[PlayStation 3]] [[video game console]] on the [[PlayStation Network]]. The application has four channels, all of which revolve around a virtual globe that displays information according to the channel. The application includes the one that it replaced, [[Folding@home]], which is a distributed computing project for understanding human [[diseases]] such as [[cancer]]. The application is focused around a virtual globe which depicts similar information to that of a [[news program]], allowing users to browse this information while simultaneously contributing to the Folding@home project.

== History ==

Stanford announced in August 2006 that a [[Folding (chemistry)|folding]] client would be available to run on the Sony [[PlayStation 3]].<ref>{{cite web| url        = http://folding.stanford.edu/FAQ-PS3.html| title      = PS3 FAQ| accessdate = 2006-11-13| author     = Vijay Pande| date       = 2006-10-22| publisher  = Stanford University}}</ref> The intent was that gamers would be able to contribute to the project by merely "contributing electricity", leaving their PlayStation 3 consoles running the client while not playing games. PS3 firmware version 1.6 (released on Thursday, March 22, 2007) allows for Folding@home software, a 50 MB download, to be used on the PS3.<ref name="osstats">{{ cite web | url = http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/main.py?qtype=osstats | title = Client Statistics by OS | accessdate = 2008-01-05 |date= 2006-11-12 (updated automatically) | work = Folding@home distributed computing | publisher = Stanford University }}</ref>
A peak output of the project at 990 teraFLOPS was achieved on March 25, 2007, at which time the number of FLOPS from each PS3 as reported by Stanford fell, reducing the overall speed rating of those machines by 50%. This had the effect of bumping down the overall project speed to the mid 700 range and increasing the number of active PS3s required to achieve a petaFLOPS level to around 60,000.

On April 26, 2007, Sony released a new version of Folding@home which improved folding performance drastically, such that the updated PS3 clients produced 1500 teraFLOPS with 52,000 clients versus the previous 400 teraFLOPS by around 24,000 clients.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/folding%40home/ps3-folding-kicking-ass-getting-update-255086.php| title=PS3 Folding Kicking Ass, Getting Update}}</ref> Lately, the console accounts for around 26% of all teraFLOPS at an approximate ratio of 35½ PS3 clients per teraFLOPS.

On December 19, 2007, Sony again updated the Folding@home client to version 1.3 to allow users to run music stored on their hard drives while contributing. Another feature of the 1.3 update allows users to automatically shut down their console after current work is done or after a limited period of time (for example 3 or 4 hours). Also, the software update added the [[Generalized Born]] implicit solvent model, so the FAH PS3 client gained more broad computing capabilities.<ref>{{cite web

Shortly afterward, 1.3.1 was released to solve a mishandling of protocol resulting in difficulties sending and receiving Work Units due to heavy server loads stemming from the fault.

On September 18, 2008 the Folding@home client became Life With PlayStation. In addition to the existing functionality, the application also provides the user with access to information "channels", the first of which being the ''Live Channel'' which offers news headlines and weather through a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] globe. The user can rotate and zoom in to any part of the world to access information provided by [[Google News]] and [[The Weather Channel]], among other sources, all running while folding in the background. This update also provided more advanced simulation of protein folding and a new ranking system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5051551/life-with-playstation-out-now|title=Life With PlayStation out now|publisher=[[Kotaku]]}}</ref>

Life features five channels which are updated frequently with new information.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.playstation.com/life/en/aboutch.html | title = Channels | accessdate = September 22, 2010 | publisher = PlayStation.com }}</ref>
=== Live Channel ===
Live Channel is a [[news]], [[time zone]] and [[weather]] feed, designed to provide users with the same services as [[Google News]] and [[The Weather Channel]]. The channel is, incidentally, powered by both websites and is organised by city. The content includes live camera feeds and cloud data, similar to [[Google Earth]]. Live Cameras is provided by [[earthTV]] and the Webcams.travel website. 
The application only supports certain cities of the world, with limited coverage, such as with the continent [[Africa]], with only four cities covered by the Live Channel. 
=== Folding@Home ===
{{main|Folding@home}}
Folding@home ("Folding at Home") (sometimes abbreviated as FAH or F@h) is a [[distributed computing]] (DC) project that simulates [[protein folding]] and other [[molecular dynamics]] (MD), and improves on the methods available to do so. It was launched on October 1, 2000, and is currently managed by the Pande Group, within [[Stanford University|Stanford University's]] [[chemistry]] department, under the supervision of Professor [[Vijay Pande]]. The application became available for the [[PlayStation 3|PS3]] in March 2007 and became a channel on Life with PlayStation the moment Life was released.

===PlayStation Network Game Trailers Channel ===
For users in the [[United States]], the PSN game trailers channel allows direct access to the streaming of the [[PlayStation Store]]'s game trailers. It also has the ability to purchase titles from the store, without having to leave Life.

=== United Village ===
United Village, provided by its respective website, and hosted by Frontier International Inc., is a [[cultural]] [[documentary]]-like project that gathers stories, interviews and articles worldwide. It targets [[rural]] and/or [[third world]] stories rather than [[urban area|urban]] life. Generally, the stories come from [[developing countries]], but there are occasionally some in rural parts of other countries. The contents of the channel include culture, development, education, social issues and tourism.

=== World Heritage ===
World Heritage, by α Clock, shows [[UNESCO]]-selected locations of special cultural or physical significance around the world. These [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage sites]] link to their respective articles on [[Wikipedia]]. Each location has the introduction directly from the Wikipedia articles.

== Features ==
In addition to the channels, Life With PlayStation also features photo slideshow viewing, music & video playback. The virtual globe is periodically updated from servers to ensure that cloud, weather, live camera feed and news update data are all up to date. All channels except for the Live Channel have a static representation of [[Earth]], whereas the Live Channel itself shows time effects (such as day and night). Additionally, the Folding@home protein folding can be disabled.
