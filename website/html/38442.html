:''Greek pantheon redirects here''.
The '''Twelve Olympians''', also known as the ''Dodekatheon'' ({{lang-el|'''Δωδεκάθεον''' < δώδεκα}},<ref>Used comparatively rarely, in [[Byzantine Greek]], e.g. by [[Nicephorus Callistus Xanthopoulos]], [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] or [[Doukas (historian)|Ducas]].</ref> dōdeka, "twelve"+ θεοί, theoi, "gods"), in [[Greek mythology]], were the principal [[Greek Gods|god]]s of the Greek [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], residing atop [[Mount Olympus]].
The Twelve Olympians gained their supremacy in the world of gods after Zeus led his siblings to victory in [[Titanomachy|war]] with the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]]. [[Zeus]], [[Hera]], [[Poseidon]], [[Demeter]], [[Hestia]], [[Hades]], and [[Chiron]] (who was not a god, but a trainer to the children of the gods, also known as [[demigods]]) were siblings. Ares, Hermes, Hephaestus, Aphrodite, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, the Charites, Heracles, Dionysus, Hebe, and Persephone were children of Zeus. Some versions of the myths state that Hephaestus was born of Hera alone, and that Aphrodite was born of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]' blood.

The first ancient reference of religious ceremonies for them is found in the [[Homeric Hymn]] to Hermes.
The Greek cult of the Twelve Olympians can be traced to the 6th century BC Athens and probably has no precedent in the Mycenaean period. The altar to the Twelve Olympians at Athens is usually dated to the archonship of the younger [[Pesistratos]], in 522/521 BC.
The concept of the "Twelve Gods" is older than any of our Greek or Roman sources, and is likely of Anatolian origin. There seems to have been a great deal of fluidity when it came to who was counted among their number in antiquity.<ref name="Stoll">According to {{Cite book| last=Stoll | first=Heinrich Wilhelm (translated by R. B. Paul) | title=Handbook of the religion and mythology of the Greeks| publisher=Francis and John Rivington | year=1852|page=8|quote=The limitation of their number [of the Olympians] to twelve seems to have been a comparatively modern idea}}</ref>

The classical{{Clarify|date=September 2010}} scheme of the Twelve Olympians (the Canonical Twelve of art and poetry) comprises the following gods:
:[[Zeus]], [[Hera]], [[Poseidon]], [[Demeter]], [[Athena]], [[Dionysus]], [[Apollo]], [[Artemis]], [[Ares]], [[Aphrodite]], [[Hephaestus]] and [[Hermes]].

[[Hades]] (Roman: [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto)]] was not generally included in this list. He did not have a seat in the pantheon because he spent almost all of his time in the [[Greek underworld|underworld]].
The respective [[Dii Consentes|Roman scheme]] as given by [[Ennius]] gives the [[interpretatio romana|Roman equivalents]] of these Greek gods,<ref name="PapAm">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Greek mythology|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Americana|year=1993|volume=13|page=431}}<br>* {{cite encyclopedia|title=Dodekatheon|encyclopedia=Papyros-Larousse-Britanicca|year=2007|language=Greek}}</ref>
but replaces [[Bacchus (mythology)|Bacchus]] (Dionysus) with [[Vesta]] (Hestia) so as to list six gods and six goddesses.
The difference in the list is explained{{By whom|date=September 2010}} by the story that when Dionysus was offered a seat among the Olympians, the total number of Olympians became thirteen. Believing this would create a fight amongst the gods, Hestia stepped down.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

[[Herodotus]] included in his Dodekatheon the following deities: Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Hermes, Athena,  Apollo, [[Alpheus (mythology)|Alpheus]], [[Cronus]], [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] and the [[Charites]].<ref name="Pap">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Dodekatheon|encyclopedia=Papyros-Larousse-Britanicca|year=2007|language=Greek}}</ref><ref name="Wil">{{Cite book|title=Der Glaube der Hellenen (Volume 1) |last=Wilamowitz-Moellendorff |first=Ulrich von  |authorlink=Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff |coauthors= |year=1931–1932 |publisher=Weidmansche Buchhandlung|location=Berlin |language=Deutch|pages=329}}</ref>
[[Herodotus]] also includes [[Heracles]] as one of the Twelve.{{Clarify|date=September 2010}}<ref name="Herod">[[Herodotus]], ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D43 2.43–44]</ref>
[[Lucian]] also includes Heracles and [[Asclepius]] as members of the Twelve, without explaining which two had to give way for them.
At Kos, Heracles and [[Dionysus]] are added to the Twelve, and Ares and Hephaestus are left behind.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Berger-Doer|first=Gratia|title=Dodekatheoi|encyclopedia=[[Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae]]|year=1986|pages=646–658|volume=3}}</ref>  However, [[Pindar]], [[Apollodorus]],<ref name="PAp">Pindar, ''Olympian Odes'', 10.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0162&query=line%3D%23271 49]</ref> and Herodorus disagree with this.  For them Heracles is not one of the Twelve Gods, but the one who established their cult.<ref name="Pap" />
[[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]], [[Helios]], [[Eos]], [[Selene]] and [[Persephone]] are other important gods and goddesses which are sometimes included in a group of twelve. [[Eros]] is often depicted alongside the other twelve, especially his mother Aphrodite, but is rarely considered one of the Olympians.

[[Plato]] connected the Twelve Olympians with the twelve months, and proposed that the final month be devoted to rites in honor of [[Hades]] and the spirits of the dead, implying that he considered [[Hades]] to be one of the Twelve.<ref name="Pl">Plato, ''[[Laws (Plato)|The Laws]]'', 828 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0166;query=section%3D%23935;layout=;loc=8.828c d-e]</ref> Hades is phased out in later groupings due to his [[chthonic]] associations.<ref name="Am">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Greek mythology|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Americana|year=1993|volume=13|page=431}}</ref> In ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' Plato aligns the Twelve with the Zodiac and would exclude Hestia from their rank.<ref name="Ph246e-f">[[Image:Wikisource-logo.svg|15 px]], Plato: ''[[s:Phaedrus|Phaedrus]]'', 246 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0174&query=section%3D%23839 e-f]</ref>

;Notes
* A <span id="endnote_A" />[[#ref_A|'''^''']] According to an alternate version of her birth, Aphrodite was born of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], Zeus' grandfather, — after [[Cronus]] threw his castrated genitals into the sea. This supports the etymology of her name, "foam-born". As such, Aphrodite would belong to the same generation as Cronus, Zeus' father, and would technically be Zeus' aunt.
