The '''Civil Pages''' is a computer system that acts as a private social media site for the UK [[Civil Service]]. It was set up by [[The National Archives]] on behalf of the [[Cabinet Office]] <ref>http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/hc0809/hc04/0469/0469.pdf</ref>.It debuted shortly after an incident where the head of [[MI6]] was identified in a holiday snap on facebook, and was somewhat controversial due the state of government finances at the time.<ref name=Carlin2009/>  The head of the Civil Service, [[Gus O'Donnell]] described civil pages as  '...the Facebook of the Civil Service... without the man in the Speedos'. The system is based on Confluence, an enterprise wiki from [[Atlassian]] and was developed by [[Adaptavist]]<ref>https://museuminsider.co.uk/2010/06/16/tenders/national-archives-secure-web-development-and-support-award/</ref>.
