== Biography ==
Joseph Novak received an B.S. in Science and Mathematics in 1952 from the [[University of Minnesota]], an M.S. in Science Education in 1954 from the [[University of Minnesota]], and completed his graduate studies in  Science Education & Biology at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1958. 

Novak started teaching biology at [[Emporia State University|Kansas State Teachers College at Emporia]] from 1957 to 1959, and biology and teacher education courses at [[Purdue University]] from 1959 to 1967. From 1967 to 1995, he was Professor of Education and Biological sciences at [[Cornell University]]. Since 1998 he is also Visiting Senior Scientist, at the [[University of West Florida]], Institute for Human & Machine Cognition. Work with NASA, Navy, CIA(NIMA), etc. Further, he has consulted with more than 400 schools, universities and corporations, including recent current work with [[Procter and Gamble]], and NASA, Dept. of Navy, and EPRI.<ref name="JDN04">[http://www.ihmc.us/users/user.php?UserID=jnovak Joseph D. Novak]. IHMC Senior Research Scientist, 2004. Retrieved 30 July 2009.</ref>

He has received a number of awards and honors including a 1998 Honorary Doctorate from The University of Comahue, Neuquén, Argentina, Honorary Doctorate, Public University of Navarra, [[Pamplona, Spain]], 2002, Honorary Doctorate from the [[University of Urbino]] in 2006, and the first award for contributions to science education from the Council of Scientific Society Presidents.<ref name="JDN04"/> 

== Work ==
Novak's research focused on [[Learning|human learning]], [[education|educational studies]] and [[knowledge creation]] and [[Knowledge representation|representation]]. He has developed a theory of education to guide research and instruction, first published in 1977 and updated in 1998.<ref name="JDN04"/> 

His latest research work includes studies on student’s ideas on learning and epistemology, and methods of applying educational ideas and tools (such as concept mapping) in corporate settings and distance learning programs. Present work includes the development of 'expert" concept maps to "scaffold' learning, using CMapping with Internet and other resources, providing A New Model for Education.<ref name="JDN04"/>  

=== Concept map ===

Since the 1970s Novak  and his research team at [[Cornell University]] has developed the technique of [[concept map]]ping was developed by as a means of representing the emerging science knowledge of students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ihmc.us/users/user.php?UserID=jnovak|title=Joseph D. Novak|publisher=Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC)|accessdate=2008-04-06}}</ref> It has subsequently been used as a tool to increase meaningful learning in the sciences and other subjects as well as to represent the expert knowledge of individuals and teams in education, government and business. 

Concept maps have their origin in the learning movement called [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]]. In particular, constructivists hold that learners actively construct knowledge. Novak's work is based on the cognitive theories of [[David Ausubel]] assimilation theory, who stressed the importance of prior knowledge in being able to learn new concepts.
:"The most important single factor influencing learning is what the learner already knows. Ascertain this and teach accordingly."<ref>Ausubel, D. (1968) Educational Psychology: A Cognitive View. Holt, Rinehart & Winston, New York.</ref>

Novak taught students as young as six years old to make concept maps to represent their response to focus questions such as "What is water?" "What causes the seasons?" 

In his book ''Learning How to Learn'', Novak states that "meaningful learning involves the assimilation of new concepts and propositions into existing cognitive structures."
