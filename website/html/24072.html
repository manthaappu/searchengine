A '''mental property''' or  a '''mind property''' is a [[property]] of a/the [[mind]]. Mental properties are studied by many [[science]]s and [[parascience]]s. Some of these sciences are: psychology, cognitive sciences and recently also [[systemics]].

There are three{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} main scientific approaches to the study/modeling of mind (properties). 

* The primary is the classical one, which considers mind as an intrinsic property of the human brain only.

* The second is focused on [[engineering]] research for the development of an abstract/synthetic mind/brain for robots and computers which satisfies requested functional properties.

* The third is the most universal research{{POV-statement|date=April 2010}}, dealing with a concept of generalized/universal and synthetic mind as a possible or existing property of the Universe. Such research is the common interdisciplinary domain of interest of the [[philosophy of mind]], [[artificial intelligence]] and different systemic and meta-systemic approaches with a strong contribution from physicists and mathematicians.

The basic concrete objective of all these approaches is to develop a model of mind/intelligence which could be implemented on a computer and could be considered sufficiently "human-like" to be mistaken for another human mind by a naive observer{{Dubious|date=April 2010}}.

==Philosophy of mind perspective==
'''A simple concrete example''':
If someone pricks you with a pin, you will most likely feel pain. That instance of feeling pain is an instantiation of the property ''being in (or a) pain''.
It is important to distinguish between the predicate 'is a pain' which is a linguistic entity, and the property denoted by the predicate. This becomes important in the [[philosophy of mind]] when the two are confused, especially concerning [[reductionism|intertheoretic reductionism]] and [[ontological]] [[reductionism]] {{Why|date=April 2010}}.
