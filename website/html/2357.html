'''''Argo''''' is an unmanned deep-towed undersea video camera sled developed by Dr. [[Robert Ballard]] through [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute]]'s Deep Submergence Laboratory.  ''Argo'' is most famous for its role in the 1985 discovery of the wreck of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']].  ''Argo'' was also used in the discovery of the wreck of the German battleship ''[[German battleship Bismarck|Bismarck]]''.

The towed sled, capable of operating depths of 6,000 meters (20,000 feet), meant 98% of the ocean floor was within reach. The original Argo used to find Titanic was 15 feet long, 3.5 feet tall, and 3.5 feet wide and weighed about 4,000 pounds in air. It had an array of cameras looking forward and down, and [[strobe light|strobes]] and [[incandescent light]]ing to illuminate the ocean floor.<ref name="Titanic discovery">{{cite web|url=http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=7542|title=Ships & Vehicles Used in 1985 Discovery of ''Titanic''|publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>
