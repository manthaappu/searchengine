'''Z-URC''' is combination of [[Z-wave]] and [[universal remote|universal remote controls]]. This allows users to not only enable their consumer electronics but their [[home automation|home automated devices]] as well<ref>[http://www.z-wave.com/modules/AboutZ-Wave/ Z-wave]</ref>.

==Z-wave==
'''Z-wave''' is a low power RF wireless solution to home electronics that uses mesh networking technology<ref>[http://www.zen-sys.com/modules/Zensys/ Zensys]</ref>. It is a technology that allows users to send signals at a sub-gigahertz level that avoids any interference from normal obstructions such as a router<ref>[http://www.z-wave.com/modules/AboutZ-Wave/ Z-wave]</ref>. The normal maximum range is 300 ft. for a single device however depending on the number of Z-wave enabled devices the range is endless since this technology works by relaying the commands through any of the Z-wave enabled devices (ie light switches, remotes, thermostats, etc.) until it reaches its destination<ref>[http://www.z-wave.com/modules/AboutZ-Wave/ Z-wave]</ref>. Users also can check the status of the Z-wave enabled device, and receive confirmation that the device has received the user's commands<ref>[http://www.zwaveworld.com/zwavedemo.php Z-wave World]</ref>.

==Universal Remote Control==
'''Universal Remote Control (URC)''' is a remote control that can be programmed to operate many consumer electronics such as a user's TV, DVD Player, home theater systems, speakers, projectors, cable boxes, DVRs, DSS receivers, etc. Therefore a user can have one remote for all their electronics at home (depending if the URC is 16-in-1, 8-in-1, 2-in-1, etc.)
