'''Dan Geer''' is a [[computer security]] analyst and [[risk management]] specialist. He is recognized for raising awareness of critical computer and network security issues before the risks were widely understood, and for ground-breaking work on the [[economics of security]]. 

Geer is currently the [[chief information security officer]] for [[In-Q-Tel]], a not-for-profit [[venture capital]] firm that invests in technology to support the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].<ref>[http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1196 Dan Geer leaves Verdasys for In-Q-Tel], by Ryan Naraine, ''ZDNet'', May 28, 2008. Accessed 2008-07-09.</ref> 

In 2003, Geer's 24-page report entitled [http://cryptome.org/cyberinsecurity.htm "Cyber''In''security: The Cost of Monopoly"] was released by the [[Computer and Communications Industry Association]] (CCIA). The paper argued that [[Microsoft]]'s dominance of desktop computer operating systems is a threat to [[national security]]. Geer was fired (from consultancy @Stake) the day the report was made public.<ref>"Critique of Microsoft eyed in firing: Ex-tech officer claims report cost his job", by Jay Fitzgerald, ''Boston Herald'', September 27, 2003. [http://cryptome.org/cyberinsecurity.htm Reprint]. Accessed 2008-07-09.</ref> Geer has cited subsequent changes in the Vista operating system (notably a [[Address space randomization|location-randomization]] feature) as evidence that Microsoft "accepted the paper."<ref>[http://www.csoonline.com/article/441013 Dan Geer Helping CIA], ''CSOonline.com'', August 4, 2008.</ref>
