'''GEOS''' ('''''G'''raphic '''E'''nvironment '''O'''perating '''S'''ystem'') is an [[operating system]] from Berkeley Softworks (later [[GeoWorks]]). Originally designed for the [[Commodore 64]] and released in [[1986]], it provided a [[graphical user interface]] for this popular [[8-bit]] computer. This version  of GEOS is currently owned and distributed by Click Here Software Co.

GEOS closely resembled early versions of [[Mac OS]] and included a graphical [[word processor]] (geoWrite) and paint program (geoPaint). For many years, [[Commodore International|Commodore]] bundled GEOS with its redesigned and cost reduced C64, the C64C. At its peak, GEOS was the third most popular operating system in the world in terms of units shipped, trailing only [[MS-DOS]] and Mac OS.

Other GEOS-compatible software packages were available from Berkeley Softworks or from third parties, including a reasonably sophisticated [[desktop publishing]] application called geoPublish and a spreadsheet called geoCalc. While geoPublish was not as sophisticated as [[Adobe PageMaker|Aldus Pagemaker]] and geoCalc not as sophisticated as [[Microsoft Excel]], the packages provided reasonable functionality, and [[Berkeley Softworks]] founder [[Brian Dougherty (programmer)|Brian Dougherty]] claimed the company ran its business [[Eating_one's_own_dog_food|using its own software]] on Commodore 8-bit computers for several years.

Enhanced versions of GEOS later became available for the [[Commodore 128]] and the [[Apple II family]]. A lesser-known version was also briefly released for the [[Commodore Plus/4]].

Written by a group of programmers, led by Dougherty, who cut their teeth on limited-resource [[video game console|video game machines]] such as the [[Atari 2600]], GEOS was revered for what it could accomplish on machines with 64–128 [[kilobyte|kB]] of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]] memory and 1–2 [[megahertz|MHz]] of 8-bit processing power.

Unlike many pieces of [[proprietary software]] for the C64 and C128, GEOS took full advantage of many of the add-ons and improvements available for these systems. Commodore's [[Commodore 1351|1351]] [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] was supported by GEOS, as were its various [[Commodore REU|RAM expansion units]]. GEOS 128 also fully supported the C128's 640×200 high-resolution [[MOS Technology 8563|VDC]] display mode through a compatible [[RGB]] monitor.

The C64 version of GEOS incorporated a built-in [[fast loader]], called ''diskTurbo'', that significantly increased the speed of drive access on the slow [[Commodore 1541|1541]]. (GEOS 128 could take advantage of the C128's enhanced "burst mode" in conjunction with the [[Commodore 1571|1571]] and [[Commodore 1581|1581]] drives.)

Via Berkeley's special geoCable interface converter or other third-party interfaces to connect standard [[RS-232]] or [[Centronics]] printers to the Commodore serial bus, GEOS supported a wide variety of printers, including [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] [[Printer Control Language|PCL]] printers and the [[Apple LaserWriter]]. This ability to print to high-end printers was a major factor in making GEOS a desktop publishing platform.

The Apple II version of GEOS was released as [[freeware]] in August [[2003]]. The Commodore 64/128 versions followed in February [[2004]]. The Apple II version is freely available for download from [http://www.breadbox.com Breadbox]. 

The latest GEOS desktop suite for IBM PC compatibles is [[Breadbox Ensemble]]. Revivals were seen in the [[OmniGo]] handhelds, [[Brother Industries|Brother]] GeoBook line of laptop-appliances, and the [[New Deal Office]] package for PCs. Related code found its way to earlier '[[Zoomer]]' PDAs, creating an unclear lineage to [[Palm, Inc.]]'s later work. [[Nokia]] used GEOS as a base operating system for their [[Nokia Communicator]] series, before switching to [[EPOC (computing)|EPOC]] ([[Symbian]]).
