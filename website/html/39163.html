<html> <head> <title>VXL</title></head><body>VXL, the '''Vision-something-Library'',' is a collection of [[open source]] C++ libraries for [[Computer Vision]]. The idea is to replace X with one of many letters, ie. G (VGL) is a geometry library, N (VNL) is a numerics library, I (VIL) is an image processing library, etc. These libraries can be used for general scientific computing as well as computer vision.  Some examples of usage can be found at http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/vxl/wiki/Q%26A
