<html> <head> <title>Stub Series Terminated Logic</title></head><body>'''Stub Series Terminated Logic''' ('''SSTL''')  is a group of electrical standards for driving [[transmission line]]s commonly used with [[DRAM]] based [[DDR]] memory IC's and memory modules . Primarily designed for driving the [[DDR SDRAM|DDR (double-data-rate) SDRAM]] modules used in [[computer memory]]. However, they are also used in other applications, notably, some [[PCI Express]] PHYs and other high-speed devices.

Three voltage levels for SSTL are defined:
*SSTL_3, 3.3 V, defined in EIA/JESD8-8 1996 
*SSTL_2, 2.5 V, defined in EIA/JESD8-9B 2002 
*SSTL_18, 1.8 V, defined in EIA/JESD8-15
*SSTL_15, 1.5 V, (Upcoming for [[DDR3]])

All SSTL voltage specs reference a voltage that is exactly VDDQ/2. For example, the VREF for an SSTL_18 signal is exactly 0.9 Volts.

Terminations can be:

*Class I (one series resistor at the source and one parallel resistor at the load) 
*Class II (one series resistor at the source and two parallel resistors, one at each end).
*Class III (asymmetrically parallel terminated)
*Class IV (asymmetrically doubly parallel terminated)
