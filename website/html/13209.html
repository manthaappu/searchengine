'''Facial expression capture''' is a process of using visual or mechanical means to manipulate computer generated characters with input from [[human]] [[face]]s, or to recognize [[emotion]]s from a user. Digital video-based methods are becoming increasingly preferred, as mechanical systems tend to be cumbersome and difficult to use.

==Technology==

Using [[digital camera]]s, the input user's expressions are processed to provide the head pose, which allows the software to then find the eyes, nose and mouth.  The face is initially calibrated using a neutral expression. Then depending on the architecture, the eyebrows, eyelids, cheeks, and mouth can be processed as differences from the neutral expression. This is done by looking for the edges of the lips for instance and recognizing it as a unique object. Often contrast enhancing makeup or markers are worn, or some other method to make the processing faster. Like voice recognition, the best techniques are only good 90 percent of the time, requiring a great deal of tweaking by hand, or tolerance for errors.

Since computer generated characters don't actually have [[muscle]]s, different techniques are used to achieve the same results. Some animators create bones or objects that are controlled by the capture software, and move them accordingly, which when the character is rigged correctly gives a good approximation. Since faces are very elastic this technique is often mixed with others, adjusting the weights differently for the [[skin]] elasticity and other factors depending on the desired expressions.

==Usage==

Several commercial companies are developing products that have been used, but are rather expensive.

It is expected that this will become a major input device for computer games once the software is available in an affordable format, but the hardware and software do not yet exist, despite the research for the last 15 years producing results that are almost usable.
