'''CS-Script''' ([http://www.csscript.net www.csscript.net])  is a CLR ([[Common Language Runtime]]) based scripting system which uses ECMA-compliant C# as a programming language. CS-Script currently targets Microsoft implementation of CLR (.NET 2.0/3.0/3.5) with limited support on Mono.

CS-Script as well as a few other .NET languages (e.g. Boo) is a [[Type system|statically typed]] language and it allows unlimited access to .NET/CLR functionality with ''plain vanilla'' C# syntax. 

CS-Script as a scripting environment offers stand alone script execution as well as hosting the script engine from CLR application.

Because of statically typed nature of the script execution CS-Script demonstrates no performance degradation comparing to the compiled managed binaries.

CS-Script relies heavily on existing .NET development tools (e.g. MS [[Microsoft Visual Studio|Visual Studio]], Sharp Develop) allowing editing and debugging scripts within traditional .NET [[Integrated development environment|Development environment]].

CS-Script has been used in a number of open-source and proprietary products of different scale and complexity (e.g. FlashDevelop, MediaPortal).
