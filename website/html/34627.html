<html> <head> <title>Sleep (operating system)</title></head><body>A [[computer program]] ([[process (computing)|process]], [[task (computers)|task]], or [[Thread (computer science)|thread]]) may '''sleep''', which places it into an [[process state|inactive state]] for a period of time. Eventually the expiration of an interval [[timer]], or the receipt of a [[signal (computing)|signal]] or [[interrupt]] causes the program to resume execution.

== Usage ==
A typical ''sleep'' [[system call]] takes a time value as a parameter, specifying the minimum amount of time that the process is to sleep before resuming execution. The parameter typically specifies seconds, although some operating systems provide finer resolution, such as milliseconds or microseconds.
=== Windows ===
On Windows 2000 and newer, the <code>Sleep()</code> [[function (computer science)|function]] takes a single parameter of the number of milliseconds to sleep.

The <code>sleep()</code> function is included in the [[kernel32.dll]], but no sleep command ([[executable]]) is natively available for scripts ([[batch files]]). It can be found in collections of Windows utilities like Windows 2003 Resource Kit.

===Unix ===
On [[Unix-like]] operating systems, the <code>sleep()</code> function is called providing a single parameter of type unsigned integer of the number of seconds to sleep.

=== C/C++ Examples ===
In Windows OS:
<source lang="c">
while (myInt <= 100)
{
    Sleep(2*1000);  // Sleep for 2 seconds
}
</source>

In Unix:
<source lang="c">
while (myInt <= 100)
{
    sleep(2);  // Sleep for 2 seconds
}
</source>

== Low Level Functionality ==
Sleep causes the thread or process to enter the '''Not Runnable''' state. This allows the CPU to suspend the thread or process and continue executing other threads or processes until the sleep has finished, and the thread or process is allowed to continue executing. The sleep system call is non-interruptible, which differs from the [[Wait (system call)|Wait]] system call, which can be interrupted.<ref>[http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=47127 Sleep vs. Wait (1)]</ref><ref>[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1036754/difference-between-wait-and-sleep Sleep vs. Wait (2)]</ref>

== Applications of Sleep ==
Some [[daemon (computer software)|system programs]] that never terminate execute an [[event loop]], going to sleep at the start of each cycle and waiting for some event to awaken them. Once an event is received, the program services the event, then returns to the beginning of the next wait cycle.

Other programs periodically [[polling (computer science)|poll]] for events by going to sleep and resuming execution after a specific interval of time. Once execution is resumed, the program polls for events or status changes, and then services any that occurred while it was asleep. After servicing the events, the program then goes to sleep again for the next time interval. Certain kinds of ''[[watchdog timer|heartbeat]]'' events or ''keep-alive'' signals can be generated by these kinds of programs.

===Uninterruptible sleep===
An uninterruptible sleep state is a sleep state that cannot handle a signal (such as waiting for disk or network IO (input/output)).

When the process is sleeping uninterruptibly, the signal will be noticed when the process returns from the system call or trap.

In Unix-like systems the command 'ps -l' uses code "D" for the uninterruptible sleep state of a process.

Such processes cannot be killed even with 'kill -9' command, and the only nonsophisticated way to get rid of them is to reboot the system.
