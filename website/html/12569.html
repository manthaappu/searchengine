<html> <head> <title>Eurocarbdb</title></head><body>'''EuroCarbDB''' is an [[European Union|EU]]-funded initiative for the creation of software and standards for the systematic collection of [[carbohydrate]] structures and their experimental data. The project includes a database of known carbohydrate structures and experimental data, specifically [[mass spectrometry]], [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] and [[NMR]] data, accessed via a [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/eurocarb/home.action web interface] that provides for browsing, searching and contribution of structures and data to the database. The project has also produces a number of associated [[bioinformatics]] tools for carbohydrate researchers:
* GlycanBuilder, a Java applet for drawing glycan structures
* GlycoWorkbench, a standalone Java application for semi-automated analysis and annotation of glycan mass spectra
* GlycoPeakfinder, a webapp for calculating glycan compositions from mass data 

The [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/eurocarb/home.action online version of EuroCarbDB] is hosted by the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]]. Eurocarbdb is also an actively developed [[open source]] project.
