'''Knowledge management software''' (KM Software) is a subset of [[Enterprise content management]] software and which contains a range of software that specialises in the way information is collected, stored and/or accessed. The concept of [[knowledge management]] is based on a range of practices used by an [[individual]], a [[business]], and a large [[corporation]] to identify, create, represent and redistribute [[information]] for a range of purposes. Software that enables an information practice or range of practices at any  part of the processes of information management can be deemed to be called [[information management]] software. A subset of information management software that emphasizes an approach to build knowledge out of information that is managed or contained is often called [[knowledge management]] software.

KM Software in most cases provides a means of individuals, small groups or mid-sized businesses with ways to innovate, build new knowledge in the group, and/or improve customer experience. [[Knowledge management]] tools (software) includes a range of about 1,500 or more different approaches<ref>

</ref> to collect and contain information to then build knowledge that can be searched through specialised search tools including concept building tools and or visual search tools that present information in a connected manager not originally conceptualised by those collecting or maintaining the information database.

==Range of Knowledge Management Software==
KM Software ranges from small software packages for an individual to use, such as [[brainstorming]] software, to [[Business Intelligence|highly specialised enterprise software]] suitable for use by hundreds of employees. Often KM Software provides a key resource for employees working in [[customer service]] or telephone support industries, or sectors of large corporations.

KM software, in general, enables the combination of unstructured information sources, such as individual word processed documents and/or [[Portable Document Format|.pdf formats]], [[email]], [[Graphics|graphic illustrations]], unstructured [[Memorandum|notes]], [[Hyperlink|website links]], [[invoice]]s, and other information bearing collections, such as a simple thought, through to a combination of millions of interactions from a website, and through that combination enables the seeker to obtain knowledge that otherwise would not have been discovered.

==Groupware==
In Europe through the 1990s,<ref>

</ref> KM Software was almost synonymous with groupware and groupware in this context is most popularly IBM's [[IBM Lotus Notes|Lotus Notes]]. However, as Internet connections deliver faster Internet, such as through broadband, many [[On-demand]] or [[Software as a Service]] products have evolved and are now leading suppliers of KM software (such as [[Knowledge Plaza]] in Europe).

==Visual Search==
One of the departures from the almost standard [[Keyword (Internet search)|keyword search approach]] are those group of companies developing [[Visual search|visual search techniques]]. A common visual search approach is the [[Tree search|tree traversal]] where a folder is opened and inside the display of that folder are further sub-folders. This [[Tree traversal #Traversal methods|tree traversal approach]] relies on the naming of folders to provide a rich enough indication as to what is contained in the next folder or level of folders.
