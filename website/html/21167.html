A '''Large Technical System''' (LTS) is a system or network of enormous proportions or complexity.  The study of LTSs is a subdiscipline of the [[History of Science and Technology]], and was very popular in the 1990s.

The book ''[[Rescuing Prometheus]]'' by [[Thomas P. Hughes]] documents the development of four such systems, including the [[Boston]] [[Big Dig (Boston, Massachusetts)|central artery tunnel]] and the [[Internet]].
