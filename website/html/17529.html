'''IFSHLP.SYS''' ([[Installable File System]] Helper) is an [[MS-DOS]] device driver included with [[Microsoft Windows]]. It enables Windows to make direct file system calls bypassing MS-DOS methods and use native [[32-bit file access]] for both local and network devices.

IFSHLP first shipped with [[Windows 3.1x#Windows for Workgroups 3.11|Windows for Workgroups 3.11]] and was also used in [[Windows 9x]].

The purpose of the IFS Helper is to ensure that no 3rd-party drivers intercept [[MS-DOS API|INT 21H]] calls; to achieve this, the IFSHLP.SYS is insured to be the first in the driver chain that intercepts DOS file access. If no other real-mode drivers are installed, IFSHLP will report that to the IFS Manager (IFSMGR.VXD in Windows 9x) and 32-bit file access will be enabled.
