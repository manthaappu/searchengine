[[Statistics]], like all mathematical disciplines, does not generate valid conclusions from nothing. In order to generate interesting conclusions about real [[statistical population]]s, it is usually required to make some background assumptions. These must be made with care, because inappropriate assumptions can generate wildly inaccurate conclusions.

The most commonly applied statistical assumptions are:{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

#independence of observational error from potential confounding effects
#exact or approximate normality of observations: The assumption of normality is often erroneous, because many populations are not normal. However, it is standard practice to assume that the sample mean from a random sample is normal, because of the [[central-limit theorem]]<!-- and simulation studies. See Hoffman-Jorgensen's ''Probability Theory with a view towards statistics''. -->.   (see [[normal distribution]])
#linearity of graded responses to quantitative stimuli (see [[linear regression]])

==Types of assumptions==

Statistical assumptions can be categorised into a number of different types:
*Non-modelling assumptions. Statistical analyses of data involve making certain types of assumption, whether or not a formal statistical model is used. Such assumptions underlie even [[descriptive statistics]].
**Population assumptions. A statistical analysis of data is made on the basis that the observations available derive from either a single population or several different populations, each of which is in some way meaningful. Here a "population" is informally a set of other possible observations that might have been made. The assumption here is a simple one, to the effect that the observer should know that the observations obtained are representative of the problem, topic or class of objects being studied.
**Sampling assumptions. These relate to the way in which observations have been gathered and may often involve an assumption of [[random selection]] of some type.<ref>McPherson, 1990 (Section 3.3)</ref>
*Modelling assumptions. These may be divided into two types:
**Distributional assumptions. Where a [[statistical model]] involves terms relating to [[random errors]] assumptions may be made about the [[probability distribution]] of these errors.<ref>McPherson, 1990 (Section 3.4.1)</ref> In some cases, the distributional assumption relates to the observations themselves.
**Structural assumptions. Statistical relationships between variables are often modelled by equating one variable to a function of another (or several others), plus a [[random error]]. Models often involve making a structural assumption about the form of the functional relationship here: for example, as in [[linear regression]]. This can be generalised to models involving relationships between underlying unobserved [[latent variable]]s.
**Cross-variation assumptions. These assumptions involve the [[joint probability distribution]]s of either the observations themselves or the random errors in a model. Simple models may include the assumption that observations or errors are [[statistically independent]].

==Checking assumptions==
Given that the validity of conclusions drawn from a statistical analysis depend on the validity of any assumptions made, it is clearly important that these assumptions should be reviewed at some stage. In some instances, for example where data are lacking, this may have to be restricted to just making a judgement about whether an assumption is reasonable. This can be expended slightly to trying to judge what effect a departure from the assumptions might have. Where more extensive data are available, various types of procedure for statistical model validation are available, in particular for [[regression model validation]].
