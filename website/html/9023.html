<html> <head> <title>DMExpress</title></head><body>'''DMExpress''' is an [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] tool designed primarily for performance. It processes data using proprietary algorithms instead of the database engine. It is able to generate code in C, C++, Visual Basic, Kornshell and SQL to carry out ETL tasks <ref>[http://products.databasejournal.com/dbtools/dar/1099337641.html Database tools - DMExpress]</ref>. It can integrate from multiple sources to multiple targets, and supports all the major database engines, including [[Oracle database|Oracle]], [[Sybase]], [[IBM DB2|DB2]], [[Informix]], [[Microsoft SQL Server]] and [[Teradata]].

Released in November 2004, DMExpress uses "patented algorithms, state-of-the-art parallel processing technology, and dynamic optimization" to achieve high performance (press release). It "extracts data at very high speed from any source database or flat file, applies any kind of record level transformation and/or field level transformation, and then loads the data into any target database or flat file". The speed comes primarily from highly specialised sorting technology previously developed by the company and adapted to the task of ETL<ref>[http://www.decideo.fr/DMExpress,-un-ETL-pointu-propose-par-Syncsort-plutot-pour-les-grandes-entreprises_a1101.html ETL with DMExpress]</ref>.
