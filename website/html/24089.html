'''Mercury''' ({{pron-en|ˈmɜrkjʉri}}, [[Latin]]: '''Mercurius''' {{audio|La-cls-Mercurius.ogg|listen}}) was a messenger,<ref>[http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/Hermes.html Theoi.com]</ref> and a god of trade, the son of [[Maia Maiestas]] and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] in [[Roman mythology]]. His name is related to the Latin word ''merx'' ("merchandise"; compare ''merchant'', ''commerce'', etc.), ''mercari'' (''to trade''), and ''merces'' (''wages'').<ref>http://www.behindthename.com/name/mercury</ref> In his earliest forms, he appears to have been related to the [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan deity]] [[Turms]], but most of his characteristics and mythology were borrowed from the analogous Greek deity, [[Hermes]]. Latin writers rewrote Hermes' myths and substituted his name with that of Mercury. However there are at least two myths that involve Mercury that are Roman in origin. In [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', Mercury reminds [[Aeneas]] of his mission to found the city of Rome. In [[Ovid]]'s  ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', Mercury is assigned to escort the nymph [[Larunda]] to the underworld. Mercury, however, fell in love with Larunda and made love to her on the way; this act has also been interpreted as a rape. Larunda thereby became mother to two children, referred to as the [[Lares]], invisible [[household god]]s.

Mercury has influenced the name of many things in a variety of scientific fields, such as the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], and the element [[mercury (element)|mercury]], which it was formally associated. The word ''[[wikt:mercurial|mercurial]]'' is commonly used to refer to something or someone erratic, volatile or unstable, derived from Mercury's swift flights from place to place. 

==Worship==

Mercury did not appear among the [[numina|numinous]] ''[[di indigetes]]'' of early [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]]. Rather, he subsumed the earlier [[Dei Lucrii]] as Roman religion was [[syncretism|syncretized]] with [[Religion in ancient Greece|Greek religion]] during the time of the [[Roman Republic]], starting around the 4th century BC. From the beginning, Mercury had essentially the same aspects as [[Hermes]], wearing winged shoes [[talaria]] and a winged [[petasos]], and carrying the [[caduceus]], a herald's staff with two entwined snakes that was [[Apollo]]'s gift to Hermes. He was often accompanied by a [[cockerel]], herald of the new day, a ram or goat, symbolizing [[fertility]], and a tortoise, referring to Mercury's legendary invention of the [[lyre]] from a tortoise shell.

Like Hermes, he was also a messenger of the gods and a god of trade, particularly of the [[grain]] trade. Mercury was also considered a god of abundance and commercial success, particularly in [[Gaul]]. He was also, like Hermes, the Romans' [[psychopomp]], leading newly-deceased souls to the afterlife. Additionally, [[Ovid]] wrote that Mercury carried [[Morpheus (mythology)|Morpheus]]' dreams from the valley of [[Hypnos|Somnus]] to sleeping humans.<ref name="Littleton">Littleton, C. Scott (Ed.) (2002). ''Mythology: The Illustrated Anthology of World Myth and Storytelling'' (pp. 195, 251, 253, 258, 292). London: Duncan Baird Publishers. ISBN 1-904292-01-1.</ref>

Mercury's temple in the [[Circus Maximus]], between the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] and [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] hills, was built in 495 BC.  This was a fitting place to worship a swift god of trade and travel, since it was a major center of commerce as well as a racetrack. Since it stood between the [[plebs|plebeian]] stronghold on the Aventine and the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] center on the Palatine, it also emphasized the role of Mercury as a [[meditation|mediator]].

Because Mercury was not one of the early deities surviving from the [[Roman Kingdom]], he was not assigned a ''[[flamen]]'' ("priest"), but he did have a major festival on May 15, the [[Mercuralia]]. During the Mercuralia, merchants sprinkled water from his sacred well near the [[Porta Capena]] on their heads.

==Syncretism==
[[Image:Tricephale Carnavalet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A three-headed image of a [[Celtic mythology|Celtic deity]] found in Paris; interpreted as Mercury and now believed to represent [[Lugus]]<ref>Bas-relief discovered in Paris in 1867 and preserved at the [[Carnavalet Museum]], from J.-L. Courcelle-Seneuil, ''Les Dieux gaulois d'après les monuments figurés'' (The Gallic Gods According to the Figurative Monuments), Paris, 1910.</ref>]]

When they described the gods of Celtic and Germanic tribes, rather than considering them separate deities, the Romans interpreted them as local manifestations or aspects of their own gods, a cultural trait called the ''[[interpretatio Romana]]''. Mercury in particular was reported as becoming extremely popular among the nations the [[Roman Empire]] conquered; [[Julius Caesar]] wrote of Mercury being the most popular god in Britain and Gaul, regarded as the inventor of all the arts.<ref>De Bello Gallico 6.17</ref> This is probably because in the Roman [[syncretism]], Mercury was equated with the [[Celtic mythology|Celtic god]] [[Lugus]], and in this aspect was commonly accompanied by the Celtic goddess [[Rosmerta]]. Although Lugus may originally have been a deity of light or the sun (though this is disputed), similar to the Roman [[Apollo]], his importance as a god of trade and commerce made him more comparable to Mercury, and Apollo was instead equated with the Celtic deity [[Belenus]].<ref name="Littleton"/>

Romans associated Mercury with the [[Germanic paganism|Germanic god]] [[Wodanaz|Wotan]], by ''[[interpretatio Romana]]''; 1st-century Roman writer [[Tacitus]] identifies him as the chief god of the Germanic peoples.<ref>Germania 9</ref>

In Celtic areas, Mercury was sometimes portrayed with three heads or faces, and at [[Tongeren]], [[Belgium]], a statuette of Mercury with three [[phallus|phalli]] was found, with the extra two protruding from his head and replacing his nose; this was probably because the number [[3 (number)|3]] was considered magical, making such statues good luck and fertility charms. The Romans also made widespread use of small statues of Mercury, probably drawing from the ancient Greek tradition of [[herma]]e markers.

==Mercury's net in Ludovico Ariosto's Orlando Furioso==
[[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] had created a net out of unbreakable steel so that he could catch [[Venus]], the Goddess of Beauty, and [[Mars]], the God of War, in the act of making love because he was jealous of their relationship. Vulcan managed to catch them but, afterwards, Mercury stole the net from the blacksmith God so that he could catch [[Chloris#Chloris_.28Nymph.29|Cloris]], a nymph who he admired. Cloris' job is to fly after the Sun while it rises, and to scatter lilies, roses and violets behind it. Mercury lay in wait for at least several days until he caught her wing in the net over an unnamed great river in Ethiopia, most likely the Awash/Awasi river. Mercury then gives the net to the temple of Anubis at Canopus  to protect the sacred spot, but it was stolen 3,000 years later by [[Caligorant]], who goes on to destroy the temple and city. [[Caligorant]] is an important character in Ariosto's Orlando Furioso.<ref>Ariosto, Ludovico. "Canto XV Lines 47-64." Orlando Furioso. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1998. Print.</ref>
