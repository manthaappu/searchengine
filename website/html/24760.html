The '''Mizar system''' consists of a language for writing strictly formalized mathematical definitions and [[mathematical proof|proofs]], a [[computer program]] which is able to check proofs written in this language, and a library of definitions and proved theorems which can be referenced and used in new articles.  Mizar has goals similar to those of the [[QED project]] proposed by [[Robert S. Boyer|Bob Boyer]] around 1993.  Mizar is proprietary.<ref name="not-open-source">[http://old.nabble.com/TPHOLs-becomes-ITP-%28fwd%29-td19435554.html#a19493250 Mailing list discussion] referring to the close-sourcing of Mizar.</ref>

==History==
The system was created beginning in 1973 by [[Andrzej Trybulec]] and is maintained at [[Białystok University]], [[Poland]], the [[University of Alberta]], [[Canada]], and [[Shinshu University]], [[Japan]].

Mizar articles are written in ordinary [[ASCII]]. The Mizar language is close enough to the mathematical vernacular that mathematicians can read and understand Mizar articles almost immediately; it is formal enough that proofs can be checked automatically.  All steps in a proof have to be justified, and it has been estimated that a Mizar article is about four times as long as an equivalent mathematical paper written in ordinary style.

The proof checker uses classical logic, is written in [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], and can be downloaded and freely used for non-commercial purposes. It runs on [[IBM PC compatible|PC platform]]s, [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[FreeBSD]] and [[Linux]], and [[Mac OS X]]/[[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]. The source code is available only to members of the Association of Mizar Users.<ref>[http://mizar.uwb.edu.pl/sum/ Association of Mizar Users<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The Mizar distribution includes the Mizar Mathematical Library (MML) consisting of many definitions and theorems which can be referred to in newly written articles. These new articles, after having been reviewed and checked automatically, can be published in the associated Journal of Formalized Mathematics<ref name="Journal of Formalized Mathematics">[http://fm.mizar.org/ Journal of Formalized Mathematics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and then become part of the MML.

The MML  is built on the axioms of the [[Tarski-Grothendieck set theory]]. As of February 2010, it contained about 9500 definitions and 49,500 theorems.<ref>see [http://mmlquery.mizar.org] for up-to-date statistics</ref> Examples are the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]], [[König's lemma]], [[Brouwer fixed point theorem]], [[Gödel's completeness theorem]], and facts about the [[Cantor set]].

Even though semantically all objects MML talks about are [[set (mathematics)|sets]], the language nevertheless allows one to define and use syntactical types: a variable may for example be declared of type <tt>Nat</tt> if it stands for a [[natural number]], or of type <tt>Group</tt> if it denotes a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. This makes the notation more convenient and closer to the way mathematicians think of symbols.

Browsable abstracts of MML articles are available as the Journal of Formalized Mathematics<ref name="Journal of Formalized Mathematics"/> and MML Query<ref>[http://mmlquery.mizar.org MML Query (home page)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> implements a search engine for MML.
