'''LGA 1156''', also known as '''Socket H'''<ref>[http://www.intel.com/cd/channel/reseller/apac/eng/431106.htm Socket Transition Guidance]</ref><ref>[http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/43/11/431103_431103.pdf Intel Core i7 & i5 Compatibility Sheet]</ref> or '''H1''', is an [[Intel]] desktop [[CPU socket]].  LGA stands for [[Land Grid Array]].

LGA 1156, along with [[LGA 1366]], was designed to replace [[LGA 775]]. LGA 1156 is very different from LGA 775.  LGA 775 processors were connected to a [[northbridge (computing)|northbridge]] using the [[Front Side Bus]].  With LGA 1156, the features that were traditionally on a northbridge are integrated onto the processor.  The LGA 1156 socket allows the following connections to be made from the processor to the rest of the system:

* PCI-Express 2.0 x16 for communication with a graphics card.  Some processors allow this connection to be divided into two x8 lanes to connect two graphics cards.  Some motherboard manufacturers use [[Nvidia|Nvidia's]] NF200 chip to allow even more graphics cards to be used.
* [[Direct Media Interface|DMI]] for communication with the [[Platform Controller Hub]] (PCH).  This consists of a PCI-Express 2.0 x4 connection.
* [[Flexible Display Interface|FDI]] for communication with the [[Platform Controller Hub|PCH]]. This consists of two [[DisplayPort]] connections.
* Two memory channels for communication with DDR3 SDRAM.  The clock speed of the memory that is supported will depend on the processor.

All LGA 1156 processors and motherboards made to date are interoperable, making it possible to switch between a Celeron, Pentium, Core i3 or Core i5 with integrated graphics and a Core i5 or Core i7 without graphics. However, using a chip with integrated graphics on a P55 motherboard will (in addition to likely requiring a BIOS update) not allow use of the on-board graphics processor, and likewise, using a chip without integrated graphics on a H55, H57 or Q57 motherboard will not allow use of the motherboard's graphics ports.<ref>http://techreport.com/articles.x/18216/3</ref>

==Supported chipsets==
The Desktop chipsets that support LGA 1156 are Intel's H55, H57, [[Intel P55|P55]], and Q57. Server chipsets supporting the socket are Intel's 3400, 3420 and 3450
