He has not been generally recognised for this achievement because his work was by definition [[classified information]], and therefore not released to the public at the time.

==Life==
In 1968, Cocks won Silver at the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] while at [[Manchester Grammar School]]. Cocks went on to study mathematics as an undergraduate at [[King's College, Cambridge]] and then did graduate work at the [[University of Oxford]], where he specialised in [[number theory]], but left to join CESG, an arm of GCHQ, in September 1973.

At GCHQ, Cocks was told about [[James H. Ellis]]' "[[non-secret encryption]]" and further that since it had been suggested in the late 1960s, no one had been able to find a way to actually implement the concept. Cocks was intrigued, thought about it overnight, and invented, in 1973, what has become known as the [[RSA]] encryption algorithm, realising Ellis' idea. GCHQ appears not to have been able to find a way to use the idea, and in any case, treated it as [[classified information]], so that when it was reinvented and published by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman in 1977, Cocks' prior achievement remained unknown until 1997.

In 2001, Cocks developed one of the first secure [[ID-based cryptography|identity based encryption]] (IBE) schemes, based on assumptions about [[quadratic residues]] in composite groups.  The [[Cocks IBE scheme]] is not widely used in practice due to its high degree of [[ciphertext expansion]].  However, it is currently one of the few IBE schemes which do not use [[pairing|bilinear pairings]], and rely for security on more well-studied mathematical problems.

As of 2003, Clifford Cocks held the post of Chief Mathematician at GCHQ. He was made a Companion of the [[Order of the Bath]] in 2008 (the citation describes him as "Counsellor, Foreign and Commonwealth Office"),<ref name="London Gazette"/> and was awarded an honorary degree from [[Bristol University]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2008/5830.html |title=Honorary degrees awarded |accessdate=2008-03-07 |publisher=[[Bristol University]]}}</ref>
