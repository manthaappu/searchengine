The '''Spanish Supercomputing Network''' (RES, Red Espa침ola de Supercomputaci칩n) is a scientific network created by the Spanish Education Ministry. The network is composed by several supercomputers distributed over Spain. This institution tries to provide the computing resources needed by researchers in [[Spain]] and [[Europe]].

Nowadays, the network comprises seven supercomputers:
* [[Altamira Supercomputer|Altamira]] in [[IFCA]], ([[University of Cantabria]], [[Cantabria]]).
* [[CesarAugusta]] in [[University of Zaragoza]], ([[Zaragoza]]).
* [[LaPalma]] in [[IAC]], ([[Canarias]]).
* [[Magerit]] in [[CeSViMa]], ([[Technical University of Madrid]], [[Madrid]]).
* [[MareNostrum]] in [[Barcelona Supercomputing Center | BSC]], ([[Polytechnic University of Catalonia]], [[Barcelona]]).
* [[Picasso (supercomputer)|Picasso]] in [[University of Malaga]], ([[Malaga]]).
* [[Tirant]] in [[University of Valencia]], ([[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]).
* [[Atlante (supercomputer)|Atlante]] in [[ITC]], ([[Canarias]])

All supercomputers are clones with different number of JS20 or JS21 blades.

== History ==
Spanish Supercomputing Network was created in March, [[2007]] to increase the needs of computing resources in Spain. To achieve this, [[Magerit]] and [[MareNostrum]] supercomputers were upgraded and the old nodes from [[MareNostrum]] supercomputer were used to create five nodes ([[Altamira (supercomputer)|Altamira]], [[CesarAugusta]], [[LaPalma]], [[Picasso (supercomputer)|Picasso]], [[Tirant]]) of the network.

In [[2009]] [[Atlante (supercomputer)|Atlante]] supercomputer joined the network. The software of the supercomputers was upgraded to the same level.

== Use of the resources ==
An Access Committee (a group of 44 researchers who assess the importance of each project) controls the access to the computing resources:
*Every researcher who wants to use the network must send a project to the Access Committee
*All projects are evaluated by the access committee.
*The best projects are accepted. The committee assigns several resources of one of the supercomputers during 4 months.

If one project needs more computing resources, the leader of the project can ask for resources in the next 4 months period.

Each institution controls 20% of the resources of its node. [[CeSViMa]] controls about 40% of the computer resources of [[Magerit]] due to the nodes owned by the [[Technical University of Madrid]].
