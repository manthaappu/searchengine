<html> <head> <title>Entitative graph</title></head><body>An '''entitative [[graph (mathematics)|graph]]''' is an element of the [[graph theory|graphical]] [[syntax]]  for [[logic]] that [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] developed under the name of '''qualitative logic''' beginning in the 1880's, taking the coverage of the [[formal system|formalism]] only as far as the [[propositional calculus|propositional or sentential]] aspects of logic are concerned.  See 3.468, 4.434, and 4.564 in Peirce's ''Collected Papers''.

The [[syntax]] is:
*The blank page;
*Single letters, phrases;
*Objects (subgraphs) enclosed by a [[simple closed curve]] called a ''cut''. A cut can be empty.

The [[semantics]] are:
*The blank page denotes '''False''';
*Letters, phrases, subgraphs, and entire graphs can be '''True''' or '''False''';
*To surround objects with a cut is equivalent to Boolean [[Complement (mathematics)|complementation]]. Hence an empty cut denotes '''Truth''';
*All objects within a given cut are tacitly joined by [[disjunction]].

A "proof" manipulates a graph, using a short list of rules, until the graph is reduced to an empty cut or the blank page. A graph that can be so reduced is what is now called a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] (or the complement thereof). Graphs that cannot be simplified beyond a certain point are analogues of the [[satisfiable]] [[formula]]s of [[first-order logic]].

Peirce soon abandoned the entitative graphs for the [[existential graph]]s, whose sentential (''alpha'') part is [[dual]] to the entitative graphs. He developed the existential graphs until they became another formalism for what are now termed [[first-order logic]] and [[normal modal logic]]. 

The [[Laws of form|primary algebra]] of [[G. Spencer-Brown]] is isomorphic to the entitative graphs.
