It is one of the earliest known works on [[air pollution]]. 

Evelyn was appointed to the newly formed [[Royal Society]], and both Society and pamphlet are celebrated in the 1663
"[[s:Ballad_of_Gresham_College|"Ballad of Gresham College]]". Stanza 23 (given here in modern English) describes how Evelyn
<blockquote>[...] shows that 'tis the [[coal#Etymology and folklore|sea-coal]] smoke<br> 
That always London does environ, <br>
Which does our lungs and spirits choke, <br>
Our hanging spoil, and rust our iron. <br>
Let none at ''Fumifuge'' be scoffing <br>
Who heard at Church our Sunday's coughing. </blockquote>

The pamphlet suggests that burning wood, particularly aromatic woods, will be less harmful to the lungs and recommends relocating some of London's more polluting industries outside the capital, in particular [[limekiln|lime-burning]] and [[brewing]].
