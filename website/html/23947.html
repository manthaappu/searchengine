'''Diagnostic sonography''' ('''ultrasonography''') is an [[ultrasound]]-based diagnostic [[medical imaging|imaging]] technique used for visualizing subcutaneous body structures including [[tendons]], [[muscles]], joints, vessels and internal organs for possible pathology or [[lesion]]s. [[Obstetric ultrasonography|Obstetric sonography]] is commonly used during [[pregnancy]] and is widely recognized by the public.

In physics, the term "ultrasound" applies to all [[acoustic energy]] (longitudinal, [[mechanical wave]]) with a frequency above the audible range of human hearing. The audible range of sound is 20 hertz-20 kilohertz. Ultrasound is frequency greater than 20 kilohertz.

Typical diagnostic sonographic scanners operate in the frequency  range of 1 to 18 megahertz, though frequencies up to 50-100 megahertz has been used experimentally in a technique known as biomicroscopy in special regions, such as the anterior chamber of eye.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The above frequencies are  hundreds of times greater than the limit of human hearing, which is typically accepted as 20 kilohertz. The choice of frequency is a trade-off between spatial resolution of the image and imaging depth: lower frequencies produce less resolution but image deeper into the body. 

Sonography (ultrasonography) is widely used in [[medicine]]. It is possible to perform both [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] and therapeutic procedures, using ultrasound to guide interventional procedures (for instance [[biopsy|biopsies]] or drainage of fluid collections). [[Sonographer]]s are medical [[professional]]s who perform scans for diagnostic purposes. Sonographers typically use a hand-held probe (called a transducer) that is placed directly on and moved over the patient.  

Sonography is effective for imaging soft tissues of the body. Superficial structures such as [[muscle]]s, [[tendon]]s, [[testes]], [[breast]] and the [[neonatal]] brain are imaged at a higher [[frequency]] (7-18 MHz), which provides better axial and lateral [[Angular resolution|resolution]]. Deeper structures such as liver and kidney are imaged at a lower frequency 1-6 MHz with lower axial and lateral resolution but greater penetration.

Medical sonography is used in the study of many different systems:

Other types of uses include:

*[[Intervenion]]al; [[biopsy]], emptying fluids, intrauterine {{dn|Transfusion|transfusion}} ([[Hemolytic disease of the newborn]])
*[[Contrast-enhanced ultrasound]]

A general-purpose sonographic machine may be used for most imaging purposes. Usually specialty applications may be served only by use of a specialty transducer.  Most ultrasound procedures are done using a transducer on the surface of the body, but improved diagnostic confidence is often possible if a transducer can be placed inside the body.  For this purpose, specialty transducers, including endovaginal, endorectal, and transesophageal transducers are commonly employed.  At the extreme of this, very small transducers can be mounted on small diameter catheters and placed into blood vessels to image the walls and disease of those vessels.

== Therapeutic applications ==
Therapeutic applications use ultrasound to bring heat or agitation into the body. Therefore much higher energies are used than in diagnostic ultrasound. In many cases the range of frequencies used are also very different.

*Ultrasound sources may be used to generate regional heating and mechanical changes in biological tissue, e.g. in [[occupational therapy]], [[physical therapy]] and [[experimental cancer treatment|cancer treatment]].

== From sound to image ==
The creation of an image from sound is done in three steps - producing a [[sound wave]], receiving [[Echo (phenomenon)|echoes]], and interpreting those echoes.

=== Producing a sound wave ===
[[Image:AlokaPhoto2006a.jpg|frame|right|Medical sonographic instrument]]

A sound wave is typically produced by a [[piezoelectric]] [[Ultrasonic sensor|transducer]] encased in a housing which can take a number of forms. Strong, short electrical pulses from the ultrasound machine make the transducer ring at the desired frequency. The [[frequencies]] can be anywhere between 2 and 18 [[Megahertz|MHz]]. The sound is focused either by the shape of the transducer, a lens in front of the transducer, or a complex set of control pulses from the ultrasound scanner machine ([[Beamforming]]). This focusing produces an arc-shaped sound wave from the face of the transducer. The wave travels into the body and comes into focus at a desired depth.

Older technology transducers focus their beam with physical lenses. Newer technology transducers use [[phased array]] techniques to enable the sonographic machine to change the direction and depth of focus. Almost all piezoelectric transducers are made of [[ceramic]].

Materials on the face of the transducer enable the sound to be transmitted efficiently into the body (usually seeming to be a rubbery coating, a form of [[impedance matching]]). In addition, a water-based gel is placed between the patient's skin and the probe.

The sound wave is partially reflected from the layers between different tissues. Specifically, sound is reflected anywhere there are density changes in the body: e.g. blood cells in blood plasma, small structures in organs, etc.  Some of the reflections return to the transducer.

=== Receiving the echoes ===
The return of the sound wave to the transducer results in the same process that it took to send the sound wave, except in reverse. The return sound wave vibrates the transducer, the transducer turns the vibrations into electrical pulses that travel to the ultrasonic scanner where they are processed and transformed into a digital image.

=== Forming the image ===
The sonographic scanner must determine three things from each received echo:
# How long it took the echo to be received from when the sound was transmitted.
# From this the focal length for the phased array is deduced, enabling a sharp image of that echo at that depth (this is not possible while producing a sound wave).
# How strong the echo was. It could be noted that sound wave is not a click, but a pulse with a specific carrier frequency. Moving objects change this frequency on reflection, so that it is only a matter of electronics to have simultaneous [[Medical ultrasonography#Doppler sonography|Doppler sonography]].

Once the ultrasonic scanner determines these three things, it can locate which pixel in the image to light up and to what intensity and at what [[hue]] if frequency is processed (see [[redshift]] for a natural mapping to hue).

Transforming the received signal into a digital image may be explained by using a blank spreadsheet as an analogy. First picture a long, flat transducer at the top of the sheet. Send pulses down the 'columns' of the spreadsheet  (A, B, C, etc.). Listen at each column for any return echoes. When an echo is heard, note how long it took for the echo to return. The longer the wait, the deeper the row (1,2,3, etc.). The strength of the echo determines the brightness setting for that cell (white for a strong echo, black for a weak echo, and varying shades of grey for everything in between.) When all the echoes are recorded on the sheet, we have a greyscale image.

=== Displaying the image ===
Images from the sonographic scanner can be displayed, captured, and broadcast through a computer using a [[frame grabber]] to capture and digitize the analog video signal. The captured signal can then be post-processed on the computer itself.<ref>http://www.epiphan.com/solutions_new/?arid=42 Capture and Store Gynecological Ultrasounds</ref>

== Sound in the body ==
[[Image:UltrasoundProbe2006a.jpg|frame|right|Linear Array Transducer]]
Ultrasonography ([[sonography]]) uses a probe containing one or more acoustic [[transducer]]s to send pulses of sound into a material. Whenever a sound wave encounters a material with a different density (acoustical impedance), part of the sound wave is reflected back to the probe and is detected as an echo. The time it takes for the [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]] to travel back to the probe is measured and used to calculate the depth of the tissue interface causing the echo. The greater the difference between acoustic impedances, the larger the echo is. If the pulse hits gases or solids, the density difference is so great that most of the acoustic energy is reflected and it becomes impossible to see deeper.

The frequencies used for medical imaging are generally in the range of 1 to 18 MHz. Higher frequencies have a correspondingly smaller wavelength, and can be used to make sonograms with smaller details. However, the attenuation of the sound wave is increased at higher frequencies, so in order to have better penetration of deeper tissues, a lower frequency (3-5 MHz) is used.

Seeing deep into the body with sonography is very difficult. Some acoustic energy is lost every time an echo is formed, but most of it (approximately <math>\textstyle 0.3 \frac{\mbox{dB}}{\mbox{cm depth}\cdot\mbox{MHz}}</math>) is lost from acoustic absorption.

The speed of sound varies as it travels through different materials, and is dependent on the [[Acoustic impedance|acoustical impedance]] of the material.  However, the sonographic instrument assumes that the acoustic velocity is constant at 1540 m/s. An effect of this assumption is that in a real body with non-uniform tissues, the beam becomes somewhat de-focused and image resolution is reduced.

To generate a [[wiktionary:2d|2D]]-image, the ultrasonic beam is swept. A transducer may be swept mechanically by rotating or swinging. Or a 1D [[phased array]] transducer may be use to sweep the beam electronically. The received data is processed and used to construct the image. The image is then a 2D representation of the slice into the body.

[[3D computer graphics|3D]] images can be generated by acquiring a series of adjacent 2D images. Commonly a specialised probe that mechanically scans a conventional 2D-image transducer is used. However, since the mechanical scanning is slow, it is difficult to make 3D images of moving tissues. Recently, 2D phased array transducers that can sweep the beam in 3D have been developed. These can image faster and can even be used to make live 3D images of a beating heart.

[[Doppler effect|Doppler]] ultrasonography is used to study blood flow and muscle motion. The different detected speeds are represented in color for ease of interpretation, for example leaky heart valves: the leak shows up as a flash of unique color. Colors may alternatively be used to represent the amplitudes of the received echoes.

==Modes of sonography==

Several different modes of ultrasound are used in medical imaging.<ref>The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine, 2nd Edition Volume 1 A-B. Page no.4</ref> These are:
*'''A-mode''': A-mode is the simplest type of ultrasound.  A single transducer scans a line through the body with the echoes plotted on screen as a function of depth. Therapeutic ultrasound aimed at a specific tumor or calculus is also A-mode, to allow for pinpoint accurate focus of the destructive wave energy.
*'''B-mode''': In B-mode ultrasound, a linear array of transducers simultaneously scans a plane through the body that can be viewed as a two-dimensional image on screen.
*'''M-mode''': M stands for motion. In m-mode a rapid sequence of B-mode scans whose images follow each other in sequence on screen enables doctors to see and measure range of motion, as the organ boundaries that produce reflections move relative to the probe.
*'''Doppler mode''': This mode makes use of the Doppler effect in measuring and visualizing blood flow
**'''Color doppler''': Velocity information is presented as a color coded overlay on top of a B-mode image
**'''Continuous doppler''': Doppler information is sampled along a line through the body, and all velocities detected at each time point is presented (on a time line)
**'''Pulsed wave (PW) doppler''': Doppler information is sampled from only a small sample volume (defined in 2D image), and presented on a timeline
**'''Duplex''': a common name for the simultaneous presentation of 2D and (usually) PW doppler information. (Using modern ultrasound machines color doppler is almost always also used, hence the alternative name '''Triplex'''.)
Midwives generally use this type of system.

==Expansions==
An additional expansion or additional technique of ultrasound is '''biplanar ultrasound''', in which the probe has two 2D planes that are perpendicular to each other, providing more efficient localization and detection.<ref name=reves/> Furthermore, an '''omniplane''' probe is one that can rotate 180° to obtain multiple images.<ref name=reves> Page 161 (part II > Two-dimensional Echocardiography) in: {{cite book |author=Reves, J. G.; Estafanous, Fawzy G.; Barash, Paul G. |title=Cardiac anesthesia: principles and clinical practice |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-2195-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}} [http://books.google.se/books?id=45DKiUj1hLUC]</ref> In [[3D ultrasound]], many 2D planes are digitally added together to create a 3-dimensional image of the object. In [[contrast-enhanced ultrasound]], microbubble contrast agents enhance the ultrasound waves, resulting in increased contrast.

=== Doppler sonography ===
{{Seealso|Doppler echocardiography}}
[[Image:SpectralDopplerA.jpg|thumb|right|Spectral Doppler of Common Carotid Artery]]
[[Image:ColourDopplerA.jpg|thumb|right|Colour Doppler of Common Carotid Artery]]
[[Image:Doppler ultrasound analyzer of blood velocity.jpg|thumb|right|Computer-enhanced [[transcranial doppler]].]]
Sonography can be enhanced with Doppler measurements, which employ the [[Doppler effect]] to assess whether structures (usually blood) are moving towards or away from the probe, and its relative velocity. By calculating the frequency shift of a particular sample volume, for example flow in an artery or a jet of blood flow over a heart valve, its speed and direction can be determined and visualised. This is particularly useful in cardiovascular studies (sonography of the vascular system and heart) and essential in many areas such as determining reverse blood flow in the liver vasculature in [[portal hypertension]].  The Doppler information is displayed graphically using spectral Doppler, or as an image using [[color Doppler]] (directional Doppler) or [[power Doppler]] (non directional Doppler). This Doppler shift falls in the audible range and is often presented audibly using stereo speakers: this produces a very distinctive, although synthetic, pulsating sound.

Most modern sonographic machines use pulsed Doppler to measure velocity.  Pulsed wave machines transmit and receive  series of pulses.  The frequency shift of each pulse is ignored, however  the relative phase changes of the pulses are used to obtain the frequency shift (since frequency is the rate of change of phase).  The major advantages of pulsed Doppler over continuous wave is that distance information is obtained (the time between the transmitted and received pulses can be converted into a distance with knowledge of the speed of sound) and gain correction is applied.  The disadvantage of pulsed Doppler is that the measurements can suffer from [[aliasing]].  The terminology "Doppler ultrasound" or "Doppler sonography", has been accepted to apply to both pulsed and continuous Doppler systems despite the different mechanisms by which the velocity is measured.

It should be noted here that there are no standards for the display of color Doppler.  Some laboratories insist on showing arteries as red and veins as blue, as medical illustrators usually show them, even though, as a result, a tortuous vessel may have portions with flow toward and away relative to the transducer.   This can result in the illogical appearance of blood flow that appears to be in both directions in the same vessel.  Other laboratories use red to indicate flow toward the transducer and blue away from the transducer which is the reverse of 150 years of astronomical literature on the [[Doppler effect]].  Still other laboratories prefer to display the sonographic Doppler color map more in accord with the prior published physics with the [[red shift]] representing longer waves of echoes (scattered) from blood flowing away from the transducer; and with blue representing the shorter waves of echoes reflecting from blood flowing toward the transducer.   Because of this confusion and lack of standards in the various laboratories, the sonographer must understand the underlying acoustic physics of color Doppler and the physiology of normal and abnormal blood flow in the human body.<ref name=" Red Shift">{{cite web | title=Wikipedia: “Red Shift” | url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift| accessdate=January 25, 2008}}</ref><!--

=== Contrast media ===
{{Main|Contrast-enhanced ultrasound}}
The use of microbubble contrast media in medical sonography to improve ultrasound signal [[backscatter]] is known as [[contrast-enhanced ultrasound]]. This technique is currently used in [[echocardiography]], and may have future applications in molecular imaging and drug delivery.

=== Compression ultrasonography ===
Compression ultrasonography is a technique used for diagnosing [[deep vein thrombosis]] and combines ultrasonography of the deep veins with venous compression.<ref name=medscape>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/410882_2 medscape.com > The Diagnostic Approach to Deep Venous Thrombosis: Diagnostic Tests for Deep Vein Thrombosis] Semin Respir Crit Care Med. 2000;21(6). 2000 Thieme Medical Publishers</ref> The technique can be used on deep veins of the upper and lower extremities, with some laboratories limiting the examination to the [[common femoral vein]] and the [[popliteal vein]], whereas other laboratories examine the deep veins from the inguinal region to the calf, including the calf veins.<ref name=medscape/>

Compression ultrasonography in B-mode has both high [[sensitivity and specificity]] for detecting proximal deep vein thrombosis in symptomatic patients. The sensitivity lies somewhere between 90 to 100% for the diagnosis of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis, and the specificity ranges between 95 to 100%.<ref name=medscape/>

==Attributes==
As with all imaging modalities, ultrasonography has its list of positive and negative attributes.
===Strengths ===
* It images [[muscle]], [[soft tissue]], and bone surfaces very well and is particularly useful for delineating the interfaces between solid and fluid-filled spaces.
* It renders "live" images, where the operator can dynamically select the most useful section for diagnosing and documenting changes, often enabling rapid diagnoses.  Live images also allow for ultrasound-guided biopsies or injections, which can be cumbersome with other imaging modalities.
* It shows the structure of organs.
* It has no known long-term side effects and rarely causes any discomfort to the patient.
* Equipment is widely available and comparatively flexible.
* Small, easily carried scanners are available; examinations can be performed at the bedside.
* Relatively inexpensive compared to other modes of investigation, such as [[X-ray computed tomography|computed X-ray tomography]], [[Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry|DEXA]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging]].
* [[Image resolution#Spatial resolution|Spatial resolution]] is better in high frequency ultrasound transducers than it is in most other imaging modalities.
* Through the use of an [[Ultrasound research interface]], an ultrasound device can offer a relatively inexpensive, real-time, and flexible method for capturing data required for special research purposes for tissue characterization and development of new image processing techniques

=== Weaknesses ===
* Sonographic devices have trouble penetrating [[bone]]. For example, sonography of the adult brain is very limited though improvements are being made in transcranial ultrasonography.
* Sonography performs very poorly when there is a gas between the transducer and the organ of interest, due to the extreme differences in [[acoustic impedance]]. For example, overlying gas in the gastrointestinal tract often makes ultrasound scanning of the [[pancreas]] difficult, and lung imaging is not possible (apart from demarcating pleural effusions).
* Even in the absence of bone or air, the depth penetration of ultrasound may be limited depending on the frequency of imaging. Consequently, there might be difficulties imaging structures deep in the body, especially in obese patients.
*Body habitus has a large influence on image quality, image quality and accuracy of diagnosis is limited with obese patients, overlying  subcutaneous fat attuates the sound beam and a lower frequency tranducer is required (with lower resolution)  
The method is operator-dependent. A high level of skill and experience is needed to acquire good-quality images and make accurate diagnoses.
* There is no scout image as there is with CT and MRI. Once an image has been acquired there is no exact way to tell which part of the body was imaged.

==Risks and side-effects==
Ultrasonography is generally considered a "safe" imaging modality.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Merritt | first=CR | title=Ultrasound safety: what are the issues? |journal=Radiology | volume=173 | issue=2 | pages=304–306 |date=1 November 1989| pmid=2678243 | url=http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/reprint/173/2/304 | accessdate=2008-01-22 }}</ref> However slight detrimental effects have been occasionally observed (see below).
Diagnostic ultrasound studies of the foetus are generally considered to be safe during pregnancy. This diagnostic procedure should be performed only when there is a valid medical indication, and the lowest possible ultrasonic exposure setting should be used to gain the necessary diagnostic information under the "as low as reasonably achievable" or [[ALARA]] principle.

World Health Organizations technical report series 875(1998).<ref>{{cite WHO|title=Training in Diagnostic Ultrasound: essentials, principles and standards|pages=2 | year=1998 | url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_875.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> supports that ultrasound is harmless:
"Diagnostic ultrasound is recognized as a safe, effective, and highly flexible imaging modality capable of providing clinically relevant information about most parts of the body in a rapid and cost-effective fashion". Although there is no evidence ultrasound could be harmful for the foetus, US Food and Drug Administration views promotion, selling, or leasing of ultrasound equipment for making "keepsake foetal videos" to be an unapproved use of a medical device.

===Studies on the safety of ultrasound===

*A study at the [[Yale School of Medicine]] found a correlation between prolonged and frequent use of ultrasound and abnormal neuronal migration in mice.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Ang Jr. | first=ES | coauthors=Gluncic V, Duque A et al. | title=Prenatal exposure to ultrasound waves impacts neuronal migration in mice |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume=103 | issue=34 | pages=12903–10 |year=2006 | pmid=16901978 | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/103/34/12903 | accessdate=2008-01-22 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0605294103 | pmc=1538990 }}</ref>  A meta-analysis of several ultrasonography studies found no statistically significant harmful effects from ultrasonography, but mentioned that there was a lack of data on long-term substantive outcomes such as neurodevelopment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bricker L, Garcia J, Henderson J, ''et al.'' |title=Ultrasound screening in pregnancy: a systematic review of the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and women's views |journal=Health technology assessment (Winchester, England) |volume=4 |issue=16 |pages=i-vi, 1–193 |year=2000 |pmid=11070816 |doi= |url=http://www.hta.ac.uk/execsumm/summ416.htm}}</ref>

== Regulation ==
Diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound equipment is regulated in the USA by the FDA, and worldwide by other national regulatory agencies. The FDA limits acoustic output using several metrics. Generally other regulatory agencies around the world accept the FDA-established guidelines.

Currently New Mexico is the only state in the USA which regulates diagnostic medical sonographers. Certification examinations for sonographers are available in the US from three organizations: [http://www.ardms.org The American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonography],[http://www.cci-online.org Cardiovascular Credentialing International] and the [http://www.arrt.org American Registry of Radiological Technologists].

The primary regulated metrics are MI ([[Mechanical Index]]) a metric associated with the cavitation bio-effect, and TI (Thermal Index) a metric associated with the tissue heating bio-effect. The FDA requires that the machine not exceed limits that they have established. This requires self-regulation on the part of the manufacturer in terms of the calibration of the machine. The established limits are reasonably conservative so as to maintain diagnostic ultrasound as a safe imaging modality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.centrus.com.br/DiplomaFMF/SeriesFMF/doppler/capitulos-html/chapter_02.htm |title=Safety of diagnostic ultrasound in fetal scanning |work= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref>

In India, lack of social security and consequent preference for a male child has popularized the use of ultrasound technology to identify and abort female foetuses. India's Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques act makes use of ultrasound for sex selection illegal,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mohfw.nic.in/THE%20PNDT%20ACT%20%28PRINCIPAL%20ACT%291994.htm |title=PNDT ACT, 1994 |work= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> but unscrupulous Indian doctors and would-be parents continue to discriminate against the girl child.

==History==
===United States===
Ultrasonic energy was first applied to the human body for medical purposes by Dr. [[George Ludwig]] at the Naval Medical Research Institute, [[Bethesda, Maryland]] in the late 1940s.<!--

In 1962, after about two years of work, Joseph Holmes, William Wright, and Ralph Meyerdirk developed the first compound contact B-mode scanner.  Their work had been supported by [[United States Public Health Service|U.S. Public Health Services]] and the [[University of Colorado Denver|University of Colorado]]. Wright and Meyerdirk left the University to form Physionic Engineering Inc., which launched the first commercial hand-held articulated arm compound contact B-mode scanner in 1963. This was the start of the most popular design in the history of ultrasound scanners.<!--

===Sweden===
Medical ultrasonography was used 1953 at [[Lund University]] by [[cardiology|cardiologist]] Inge Edler and [[Carl Hellmuth Hertz]], the son of [[Gustav Ludwig Hertz]], who was a graduate student at the department of [[nuclear physics]].

Edler had asked Hertz if it was possible to use [[radar]] to look into the body, but Hertz said this was impossible. However, he said, it might be possible to use ultrasonography. Hertz was familiar with using ultrasonic 
reflectoscopes for [[nondestructive testing|nondestructive materials testing]], and together they developed the idea of using this method in medicine.

The first successful measurement of heart activity was made on October 29, 1953 using a device borrowed from the ship construction company [[Kockums]] in [[Malmö]]. On December 16 the same year, the method was used to generate an echo-encephalogram (ultrasonic probe of the [[brain]]). Edler and Hertz published their findings in 1954.<ref>Edler I, Hertz CH. ''The use of ultrasonic reflectoscope for the continuous recording of movements of heart walls.'' Kungl Fzsiogr Sallsk i Lund Forhandl. 1954;24:5. Reproduced in Clin Physiol Funct Imaging 2004;24:118-36. PMID 15165281.</ref>

===Scotland===
Parallel developments in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] by Professor [[Ian Donald]] and colleagues at the [[Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital]] (GRMH) led to the first diagnostic applications of the technique. Donald was an [[obstetrics|obstetrician]] with a self-confessed "childish interest in machines, electronic and otherwise", who, having treated the wife of one of the company's directors, was invited to visit the Research Department of boilermakers Babcock & Wilcox at [[Renfrew]], where he used their industrial ultrasound equipment to conduct experiments on various morbid anatomical specimens and assess their ultrasonic characteristics. Together with the medical physicist Tom Brown and fellow obstetrician Dr John MacVicar, Donald refined the equipment to enable differentiation of pathology in live volunteer patients. These findings were reported in ''[[The Lancet]]'' on 7 June 1958<ref>Donald I, MacVicar J, Brown TG. ''Investigation of abdominal masses by pulsed ultrasound.'' [[The Lancet|Lancet]] 1958;1(7032):1188-95. PMID 13550965</ref> as "Investigation of Abdominal Masses by Pulsed Ultrasound" - possibly one of the most important papers ever published in the field of diagnostic [[medical imaging]].

At GRMH, Professor Donald and Dr James Willocks then refined their techniques to obstetric applications including foetal head measurement to assess the size and growth of the foetus.  With the opening of the new Queen Mother's Hospital in [[Yorkhill]] in 1964, it became possible to improve these methods even further. Dr [[Stuart Campbell (Obstetrician and Gynaecologist)|Stuart Campbell]]'s pioneering work on 
foetal cephalometry led to it acquiring long-term status as the definitive method of study of foetal growth.  As the technical quality of the scans was further developed, it soon became possible to study pregnancy from start to finish and diagnose its many complications such as multiple pregnancy, foetal abnormality and ''[[placenta praevia]]''.  Diagnostic ultrasound has since been imported into practically every other area of medicine.
