'''OpenDrive''' is an online storage, online syncing, backup and file management service.

OpenDrive allows users to manage their content stored in the cloud by using website, drive or desktop applications.

Third party applications or websites can access or manage users' files through [[Application programming interface|API]].

==History==
OpenDrive, which started as a virtual drive in 2008 during past few years became a multiplatform solution for online storage, syncing, backup and cloud content management.

Beyond the unique services like selling files, advertising files, a file search engine, direct hotlinking, an API, as well as its virtual drive and virtual desktop applications, OpenDrive provides sharing, syncing, online editing, file collaboration, file versioning and other features to allow the user manage cloud content smarter and faster than ever before.
