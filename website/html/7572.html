From the invention of computer [[programming language]]s up to the mid-1980s, many if not most computer programmers created, edited and stored their programs on [[punched card]]s. The practice was nearly universal with [[IBM]] computers in the era. A punched card is a flexible write-once medium that encodes, most commonly, 80 characters of data. Groups or "decks" of cards form programs and collections of data.  Users could create cards using a desk-sized [[keypunch]] with a typewriter-like keyboard.  A typing error generally necessitated repunching an entire card.  A single character typo could be corrected by duplicating the card up to the error column, typing the correct character and then duplicating the rest of the card. In some companies programmers wrote information on special forms called coding sheets, taking care to distinguish the digit zero from the letter ''O,'' the digit one from the letter ''I,'' 8's from ''Bs,'' 2's from ''Zs,'' and so on. These forms were then converted to cards by keypunch operators and, in some cases, checked by verifiers.

Many early programming languages, including [[Fortran]], [[Cobol]] and the various IBM [[assembler language]]s, used the first 72 columns of a card — a tradition that traces back to the [[IBM 711]] card reader used on the [[IBM 700/7000 series#Scientific Architecture (704/709/7090/7094)|IBM 704/709/7090/7094 series]] (especially the [[IBM 704]], the first mass-produced computer with floating point arithmetic hardware), which could only read [[Punched card#IBM 80 column punched card format|72 of the 80 columns]] in one pass. Columns 73-80 were ignored by the compiler and could be used for identification, such as adding a sequence number so that if the card deck was dropped it could be restored to its proper order using a [[card sorter]]. Drawing a diagonal stripe across the top of the card deck provided a similar check for proper order. Programs were backed up by duplicating the deck or writing it to magnetic tape.

In many mainframe operations, known as '''closed shops''', programmers submitted the program decks, often followed by data cards to be read by the program, to a person working behind a counter in the computer room. Many computer installations used cards with the opposite corner cut (sometimes no corner cut) as "job separators", so that an operator could stack several job decks in the card reader at the same time and be able to quickly separate the decks manually when he removed them from the stacker. These cards (e.g., a [[Job Control Language|JCL]] "JOB" card to start a new job) were often prepunched in large quantities in advance.<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/cards.html Columbia University Computing History: IBM Cards]</ref> This was especially useful when the main computer did not read the cards directly, but instead read their images from [[magnetic tape]] that was prepared offline by smaller computers such as the [[IBM 1401]]. After running it, the computer operator would return the card deck and any hardcopy printed output, typically to one of a set of alphabetically-labelled cubby holes, based on the programmer's last initial.

Overnight and 24 hour turnaround times were not uncommon; however, on a lightly-used system, it was possible to make alterations and rerun a program in a few minutes. Between these extremes it was common to stand in line waiting to submit a deck. Dedicated programmers might stay up all hours to get a few quick turnarounds. Using this expensive equipment—mainframe computer usage was measured in seconds per job — was often charged to a user's account. Other operations, such as those using smaller computers like the [[IBM 650]], [[IBM 1620|1620]] and [[IBM 1130|1130]], were run as an '''open shop''', where programmers had use of the computer for a block of time. A keypunch was usually located nearby for quick corrections. This was all batch-mode processing, as opposed to interactive processing.

  |accessdate = 2008-11-11 }} <br> Article about the programming culture that developed around use of the punched card, following Fisk's experience of "learning the craft" from people around him. Also, how the concept of programming changed significantly as the computer began to multi-task and store programs internally on disk ... observing how the programmer's sense of possession/ownership of a program was somewhat relinquished after he no longer physically "held it in his hands" but trusted the computer to keep it safe for him.
