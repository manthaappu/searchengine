<html> <head> <title>KYPS</title></head><body>'''KYPS''' ('''Keep Your Password Secret''') is a free web-based [[Web service|service]] that enables users to log into websites, which usually require a username/password combination, using [[one-time password]]s. The main difference between KYPS and similar [[password management]] technologies is that the password is never disclosed to the local computer. This makes KYPS effective against password theft by [[spyware]] or [[keyloggers]], particularly when using public computers such as in an [[Internet cafe]] <ref name="csie">[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?isnumber=5170943&arnumber=5170963&count=169&index=17 Accessing Password-Protected Resources without the Password]</ref>. 

The following figure sketches the login method of KYPS. Note that the user's password is not disclosed to the computer he uses. It is, however, disclosed to the KYPS server. The system therefore requires that the user trusts the provider of the service. [[File:Login.gif|center|none|300px|alt=A sketch of the KYPS login method.|A sketch of the KYPS login method.]] 

More details about the internal workings of KYPS were published at the  CSIE 2009 conference.<ref name="csie"/>.
