'''[[Carpet]] [[cleaning]]''', for beautification, and the removal of stains, dirt, grit, sand, and [[allergen]]s can be achieved by several methods, both traditional and modern. Clean carpets are recognized by manufacturers as being more visually pleasing, potentially longer-lasting, and probably healthier than poorly maintained carpets.<ref name=ics5>{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6030975_ITM|title=Opening the Door to the Commercial Market (Carpet Cleaning Basics)|work=ICS Cleaning Specialist|author=Wittkamp, Bob|date=2007-03-01|accessdate=2009-04-02|publisher=Business News Publishing Co.}}</ref>

''Sanitary Maintenance'' magazine reports that carpet cleaning is widely misunderstood, and chemical developers have only within recent decades created new carpet-care technologies. Particularly, encapsulation and other green technologies work better, are easier to use, require less training, save more time and money, and lead to less resoiling than prior methods.<ref name=sm>{{cite news|url=http://www.cleanlink.com/sm/article/A-Deeper-Understanding-Of-CarpetCare-Technology--2455|title=A Deeper Understanding Of Carpet-Care Technology: Encapsulation technology and green products are two of the biggest trends in carpet care, according to industry manufacturers|author=Mollenkamp, Becky|publisher=Sanitary Maintenance|date=2005-01-01|accessdate=2009-04-02}}</ref>

The professional carpet-cleaning industry is primarily educated and unofficially governed by the Institute of Inspection, Cleaning, and Restoration Certification ([[IICRC]]). It is a nonprofit certifying body for the specialized fabric-cleaning industry that sets modern carpet-cleaning standards. It accepts five basic dry and wet professional cleaning methodologies.

==Dry-cleaning==
{{details|Dry carpet cleaning}}
Many dry carpet-cleaning systems rely on specialized machines;<ref name=dry>{{cite web|url=http://www.repair-home.com/Dry_Carpet_Cleaning.html|title=Dry Carpet Cleaning|work=Repair-Home.com|publisher=Beehive Content Works|year=2009|accessdate=2009-04-02}}</ref> dry carpet-cleaning machines include those manufactured by [[Brush and Clean]], [[Host Dry]], and [[Whittaker System]]. These systems are mostly technically "very low moisture" (VLM) systems, relying on dry compounds complemented by application cleaning solutions, and are growing significantly in market share due in part to their very rapid drying time,<ref name=ics3>{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-34824950_ITM|title=Speed Up Your Drying Times: An increasingly common unique selling position for carpet cleaners today is rapid drying, which plays upon the customer's fears and concerns about slow drying, discolorations returning, odor, mildew and GKW (Carpet Cleaning Basics)|work=ICS Cleaning Specialist|author=Wittkamp, Bob|date=2007-03-01|accessdate=2009-04-02|publisher=Business News Publishing Co.}}</ref> a significant factor for 24-hour commercial installations. Dry-cleaning and "very low moisture" systems are also often faster and less labor-intensive than wet-extraction systems.<ref name=ics5/>

Heavily soiled areas require the application of manual spotting, or of pretreatments, preconditioners, or "traffic-lane cleaners", which are detergents or emulsifiers that break the binding of different soils to carpet fibers over a short period of time, commonly sprayed onto carpet prior to the primary use of the dry-cleaning system. One chemical dissolves the greasy films that bind soils and prevent effective soil removal by vacuuming. The solution may add a solvent like [[d-limonene]], [[petroleum]] byproducts, [[glycol ether]]s, or [[butyl]] agents. The amount of time the pretreatment "dwells" in the carpet should be less than 15 minutes, due to the thorough carpet brushing common to these "very low moisture" systems, which provides added agitation to ensure the pretreatment works fully through the carpet.<ref name=ics4>{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7741213_ITM|title=Pre- and Post-Cleaning Carpet Treatments: As you meander down the aisles of your supplier's showroom, you are presented with a wide array of products designed for such specialized purposes as spot removal, odor control or correction, color correction, and sanitizing (Carpet Cleaning Basics)|work=ICS Cleaning Specialist|author=Wittkamp, Bob|date=2004-12-01|accessdate=2009-04-02|publisher=Business News Publishing Co.}}</ref>

===Dry compound===
A [[biodegradable]] absorbent powder and cleaning compound may be spread evenly over carpet and brushed or scrubbed in. For small areas, a household hand brush can work such a compound into carpet pile; dirt and grime is attracted to the compound, which is then vacuumed off, leaving carpet immediately clean and dry. For commercial applications, a specially designed cylindrical counter-rotating brushing system is used, without a vacuum cleaner. Machine scrubbing is more typical, in that hand scrubbing generally cleans only the top third of carpet.<ref name=dry/>

===Encapsulation===
In the 1990s, new [[polymer]]s began literally encapsulating (crystallizing) soil particles into dry residues on contact, in a process now regarded by the industry as a growing, up-and-coming technology;<ref name=sm/> working like "tiny sponges", the deep-cleaning compound crystals dissolve and absorb dirt prior to its removal from the carpet.<ref name=cmc>{{cite news|url=http://www.cleanfax.com|title=Dry Carpet Cleaner|work=CM Cleanfax|date=2005-04-01|accessdate=2009-04-02|page=48}}</ref> Cleaning solution is applied by rotary machine, brush applicator, or compression sprayer. Dry residue is vacuumable immediately, either separately or from a built-in unit of the cleaning-system machine. According to ''ICS Cleaning Specialist'', evidence suggests encapsulation improves carpet appearance, compared to other systems; and it is favorable in terms of high-traffic needs, operator training, equipment expense, and lack of wet residue.<ref name=ics>{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7464080_ITM|work=ICS Cleaning Specialist|title=Encapsulation and Carpet Cleaning (Carpet Cleaning Basics)|author=Wittkamp, Bob|date=2002-10-01|accessdate=2009-04-02|publisher=Business News Publishing Co.}}</ref> Encapsulation also avoids the drying time of carpet shampoos, making the carpet immediately available for use.<ref name=dry/>

The use of encapsulation to create a crystalline residue that can be immediately vacuumed (as opposed to the dry powder residue of [[wet cleaning]] systems, which generally requires an additional day before vacuuming) has recently become an accepted method for commercial and residential carpet maintenance.<ref name=ics2/>

===Bonnet===
After [[club soda]] mixed with cleaning product is deposited onto the surface as mist, a round buffer or "bonnet" scrubs the mixture with rotating motion. This industry machine resembles a floor buffer, with an absorbent spin pad that attracts soil and is rinsed or replaced repeatedly. The bonnet method is not strictly dry-cleaning and involves significant drying time, and usually only addresses the top third of carpet, making it a quick solution rather than a deep cleaning of dirt or odor as considered suitable for valuable carpet.<ref name=dry/> To reduce pile distortion, the absorbent pad should be kept well-lubricated with cleaning solution.

When there is a large amount of foreign material below the carpet backing, extraction with a wet process may be needed. The spin-bonnet method may not be as capable of sanitizing carpet fibers due to the lack of hot water, but a post-cleaning application of an antimicrobial agent is used to make up for this. Compared to steam cleaning, the small amounts of water required with spin-bonnet carpet cleaning favor water-conservation considerations.

==Wet-cleaning==
Wet-cleaning systems naturally require drying time, which has led to customer fears and concerns about very slow drying, the risk of discoloration returning during drying, and odors, bacteria, fungi, molds, and mildews. Balancing the need for rapid drying (attributable to lower flow rate through the cleaning jets of a spray system) and the need to remove the most soil (attributable to higher flow rate) is a key technique that must be mastered by carpet-cleaning technicians.<ref name=ics3/>

Pretreatments similar to those in dry-cleaning and "very low moisture" systems are employed, but require a longer dwell time of 15 to 20 minutes, because of lower amounts of carpet agitation. Ideal pretreatments should rinse easily and leave dry, powdery, or crystalline residue that can be flushed without contributing to resoiling.<ref name=ics4>{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7741213_ITM|title=Pre- and Post-Cleaning Carpet Treatments: As you meander down the aisles of your supplier's showroom, you are presented with a wide array of products designed for such specialized purposes as spot removal, odor control or correction, color correction, and sanitizing (Carpet Cleaning Basics)|work=ICS Cleaning Specialist|author=Wittkamp, Bob|date=2004-12-01|accessdate=2009-04-02|publisher=Business News Publishing Co.}}</ref>

===Steam cleaning===
[[File:Carpet Cleaning Machine Rug Doctor.jpg|thumb|right|A carpet cleaning machine.]]
{{details|Hot water extraction}}
In high-pressure [[hot water extraction]] ("[[steam cleaning]]"),<ref name=ics5/> after preconditioning with an [[alkalinity|alkaline]] agent, agitation with a grooming [[brush]], and appropriate dwell time, a pressurized manual or automatic cleaning tool (such as a wand) passes over the surface several times to thoroughly rinse out all preconditioner, residue, and particulates, and, using an [[acetic acid]] solution, to restore neutral fiber [[pH scale|pH]]. The acid rinse thus neutralizes the alkaline residues, and can contribute to softening cleaned fabrics.<ref name=ics4/>

Rather than soaps, the steam-cleaning system uses detergent-based solutions that dry to a powder or crystal.<ref name=ics2/> The surface is dried to avoid saturation, typically taking 3–4 hours if done correctly; inexperienced carpet-cleaning companies sometimes overwet carpeting, leading to [[mold]] and recurring [[stain]]s (arising from the "wicking" effect, whereby deeper soils are water-driven upward along carpet fibers, thus reconstituting visible stains). Some carpet-cleaning solutions are [[carbonation|carbonated]] to dissolve organic material more effectively. Beyond these treatments, antistaining and antisoiling products can be applied by the carpet owner, and have for this reason become recognized in the carpet-cleaning industry as some of its biggest profit centers.<ref name=ics4/>

Extraction is by far the most important step in this process. Since the hot-water extraction method uses much more water than other methods like bonnet or shampoo cleaning, proper extraction is critical to avoid oversaturation. When carpet is saturated, there is a risk that soils and residue from deep in the carpet fiber and backing will "wick" up to the surface, resulting in browning, or the carpet layers may delaminate.

Hot-water extraction generally involves slower drying times, lower production rates, and more labor-intensive processes than dry carpet cleaning.<ref name=ics5/> Drying time may also be decreased by extra use of fans, air conditioning, and/or outdoor ventilation.<ref name=ics3/>

Older surfaces, such as double jute-backed carpets and loose rugs with natural foundation yarns, could shrink after a wet treatment, leading to suppositions that wet-cleaning could also remove wrinkles. However, this notion is antiquated and this method could also occasionally tear seams or uproot strips. Newer carpets, such as with synthetic backing and foundation yarns, do not shrink, and they smooth easily; in such carpets, wrinkles indicate an underlying problem, such as adhesive, that may need a certified carpet inspector to determine.<ref name=ics2/>

===Shampoo===
Wet shampoo cleaning with rotary machines, followed by thorough wet vacuuming, was widespread until about the 1970s, but industry perception of shampoo cleaning changed with the advent of encapsulation.<ref name=ics/> Hot-water extraction, also regarded as preferable, had not been introduced either. Wet shampoos were once formulated from [[coconut oil]] soaps;<ref name=ics2/> wet shampoo residues can be foamy or sticky, and steam cleaning often reveals dirt unextracted by shampoos.<ref name=ics/> Since no rinse is performed, the powerful residue can continue to collect dirt after cleaning, leading to the misconception that carpet cleaning can lead to the carpet getting "dirtier faster" after the cleaning.<ref name=sm/><ref name=ics2/>

When wet-shampoo chemistry standards converted from coconut oil soaps to synthetic detergents as a base, the shampoos dried to a powder, and loosened dirt would attach to the powder components, requiring vacuuming by the consumer the day after cleaning.<ref name=ics2/>

==Household processes==
Other household carpet-cleaning processes are much older than industry standardization, and have varying degrees of effectiveness as supplements to the more thorough cleaning methods accepted in the industry.

===Vacuum===
{{details|Vacuum cleaner}}
[[Vacuum cleaner]]s use air [[pump]]s to create partial [[vacuum]]s to [[suction|suck]] up dust and dirt, usually from floors and carpets. Filtering systems or [[cyclonic separation|cyclones]] collect dirt for later disposal. Models include upright (dirty-air and clean-air), canister and backpack, wet-dry and pneumatic, and other varieties. Robotic vacuum cleaners have recently become viable as well.

Vacuum-cleaner manufacturers are widespread and include [[Aerus LLC]], [[Bissell Inc.|Bissell]] Carpet Sweepers, [[Black & Decker DustBuster]], [[Dirt Devil]], [[Dyson (company)|Dyson]], [[Electrolux]], [[Eureka (vacuum cleaner)|Eureka]], [[Goblin Vacuum Cleaners]], [[the Hoover Company]], the [[Kirby Company]], [[Nilfisk-Advance]], [[Numatic International Limited]], the [[Oreck Corporation]], [[Regina (company)|Regina]] Vacuum Cleaners, [[Rexair LLC]], [[Samsung Electronics]]

===Stain removal===
[[Tea leaves]] and cut [[grass]] were formerly common for [[floor cleaning]], to collect dust from carpets, albeit with risks of stains. [[Ink]] was removed with [[lemon]] or with [[oxalic acid]] and [[hartshorn]]; oil with [[white bread]] or with [[pipe clay]]; grease [[fat]]s with [[turpentine]]; [[ox gall]] and [[naphtha]] were also general cleaners. [[Ammonia]] and [[chloroform]] were recommended for acid discoloration. [[Benzine]] and [[alum]] were suggested for removing insects;<ref name=hist>{{cite web|url=http://www.burrows.com/carpetcleaning/index.html|title=Historic Carpet Cleaning Methods in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries|accessdate=2009-03-23}}</ref> [[diatomaceous earth]] and material similar to [[cat litter]] are still common for removing infestations. Some traditional methods of stain removal remain successful and ecological. Caution should be addressed when treating natural fibers such as [[wool]].

The longer the stain material remains in the carpet, the higher the chance of permanent color change, even if all the original stain material is removed. Immediately blotting (not rubbing) the stain material as soon as possible will help reduce the chances of permanent color change. Artificial food coloring stains are generally considered permanent stains ([[Kool-Aid]], [[Gatorade]], [[Listerine]], soda, etc.). These may be removed by professionals with heat-transfer stain-reducing chemicals, but carry risks of burning the carpet. Stain removal products can be combined with anti-allergen treatments to kill house [[dust mites]].

===Other===
Carpet rods, [[rattan]] rugbeaters, and carpet-beating machines for beating out dust, and also [[broom]]s, [[brush]]es, [[dustpan]]s, and shaking and hanging were all carpet-cleaning methods of the 19th century; brooms particularly carry risks of wear.<ref name=hist/>

===Misconceptions===
Robert Wittkamp (1942–2007), IICRC-certified master cleaning technician with 30 years' expertise in carpet cleaning, commented that [[old wives' tales]] persist and thrive within the industry. For instance, the concept that walking barefoot on a carpet may lead to damage from body oils has not been supported or disproven by standardized reports or testing or by industry evidence.<ref name=ics2>{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6909517_ITM|work=ICS Cleaning Specialist|title=Myths and Misconceptions (Carpet Cleaning Basics)|work=ICS Cleaning Specialist|author=Wittkamp, Bob|date=2003-05-01|accessdate=2009-04-02|publisher=Business News Publishing Co.}}</ref>
