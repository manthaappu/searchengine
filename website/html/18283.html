==History==
The ISACA was founded in the USA in 1967,<ref>http://www.isaca.org/Content/NavigationMenu/About_ISACA/Overview_and_History/Overview_and_History.htm, ISACA Overview and History, Retrieved 02 October 2007</ref> when a group of individuals with jobs auditing controls in the computer systems, which were becoming increasingly critical to the operations of their organizations, recognized the need for a centralized source of information and guidance in the field. In 1969, Stuart Tyrnauer, employed by the (then) Douglas Aircraft Company, incorporated the entity as the EDP Auditors Association, serving as its founding Chairman for the first three years. In 1976 the association formed an education foundation to undertake large-scale research efforts to expand the knowledge and value of the IT governance and control field.

==Current status==

They work in nearly all industry categories.  There is a network of ISACA chapters with 170 chapters established in over 160 countries.
