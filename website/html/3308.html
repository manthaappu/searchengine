<html> <head> <title>Bandelet (computer science)</title></head><body>'''Bandelets''' are an [[orthonormal]] [[basis]] that is adapted to geometric boundaries.  Bandelets can be interpreted as a warped [[wavelet]] basis.  The motivation behind bandelets is to perform a transform on functions defined as smooth functions on smoothly bounded domains.  As bandelet construction utilizes [[wavelets]], many of the results follow.  Similar approaches to take account of geometric structure were taken for [[contourlet]]s and [[curvelet]]s.
