It was essentially a cryptographic scheme involving a partial transposition of the letters of the [[Malayalam]] [[alphabet]]. The scheme had been extensively used by [[Marthanda Varma|King Marthanda Varma]] (1706–1758) of [[Travancore Kingdom]] and his spies both for oral and written communication of messages.<ref name="Unni"/> It was a fixed one-time unchangeable code in as much as it did not employ any key in its implementation in contrast to modern methods of substitution ciphers involving the utilisation of a key for generating a system of codes. ''Mūlabhadra'' is the only such  scheme known to have been used in governance in this part of India during the medieval period.{{Fact|date=May 2010}}
