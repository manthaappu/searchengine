The '''Craft Access System''' was a system developed by [[AT&T]] in the late 1980s that allowed [[telephone]] employees to access a given work order system (e.g., [[LMOS]]) by means of various pocket-PC like devices (Craft Access Terminals) which connected to the landline telephone system. Various spoofs still exist today, although they have developed considerably.
