==Background==
The dailymotion.com [[domain name]] was registered one month after [[YouTube|youtube.com]] was registered.

Dailymotion allows users to browse and upload videos by searching tags, channels or user-created groups; the search system also introduces results based on things other users have searched for. The maximum size of a video file is 2 gigabytes. The length of the video file is also limited to 20 minutes, except for the MotionMakers and the Official Users.

Videos uploaded by users to Dailymotion are converted to the [[VP6]] [[codec]] at a resolution of 320×240. Audio on Dailymotion videos is encoded as [[MP3]] at 96 [[kbit/s]] in [[stereo]].

In 2007, Dailymotion signed a major agreement with the [[Canal+]] network to broadcast its television series in full on the site. All Canal+ videos are shown on an encrypted channel of the site with anti-piracy safeguards. Within a year, the site's revenue had increased to €10 million and they had an estimated 8 million unique visitors per month in France.<ref>{{cite news | author = Gonzalès, Paule | title = Dailymotion signe avec la major du cinéma Warner | work = Le Figaro | language = French | date = 2008-10-04 | page = 30 | url = http://www.lefigaro.fr/medias/2008/10/04/04002-20081004ARTFIG00248-dailymotion-signe-avec-la-major-du-cinema-warner-.php | accessdate = 2010-04-11}}</ref>

The partnership gave Dailymotion the financial backing it needed to upgrade its servers to handle [[High Definition video]] and showcase its MotionMaker videos. In February 2008, the HD quality (1280 × 720 pixels and 1.58 to 1.85 Mb/s) was made available to the MotionMaker users. In October 2008, the HQ quality (512 × 384 pixels, 30 images per second, [[H.264]] is used for images and AAC at 96 kb/s for the sound) was made available to regular users.

On June 2, 2009, Dailymotion<ref>http://blog.dailymotion.com/2009/05/27/watch-videowithout-flash/</ref> announced on their blog that they were going to introduce [[HTML 5]] and that their existing 300,000 videos were going be converted to [[Ogg]] Theora + Vorbis. This ensures that a user does not need a Flash plug-in to view videos on Dailymotion but needs to have an HTML 5-compatible browser such as [[Firefox]] 3.5 or [[Google Chrome]] 3, or Webkit Based Espial Browser 6. Only MotionMaker videos are re-encoded in Ogg.

==MotionMaker and Official User==
MotionMaker is a group for the original content creators. Official User is a group for the official content producers (record labels, film studios, news media, television channels, sports associations, political parties...).

A MotionMaker or an Official User can :
* Customize his/her profile.
* Upload videos of unlimited length.
* Upload HD quality videos.
* Benefit of an increased visibility.
* Have a OfficialContent/CreativeContent overlay affixed on his video thumbnails.

== Hidden Features ==
Using [http://www.stupeflix.com/ Stupeflix]' technology, Dailymotion provides a tool for its users to create video slideshows. The link to the slideshow creation tool can be found from the option menu > settings > extra. Creating a sideshow takes a maximum of 30 pictures, and a music file. Stupeflix' [[slideshow]]s are rendered in a [[MP4]] video format, not [[Flash]].

==Blocking of Dailymotion==
===Tunisia===
According to the article '''Tunisia: Video-sharing website Dailymotion Blocked!''' written by [[Reporters sans Frontières]] (Paris) April 11, 2007, Omar Mestiri, an editor of the opposition online newspaper "Kalima", is a victim of judicial harassment. Reporters Without Borders has said that a libel suit could result in a three-year prison sentence. RWB organization also called on the authorities to stop blocking Dailymotion, which has been inaccessible in Tunisia since April 1, 2007.

Reporters Without Borders said:
{{cquote|The lawsuit against Mestiri is absurd because it is based on an online article that cannot even be accessed from within Tunisia ... But we take this case very seriously. The three and a half year sentence imposed on lawyer Mohammed Abbou in April 2005 for an article posted online showed how the Tunisian courts are controlled by the government and how a libel suit can lead to a heavy sentence.}}

The press freedom organisation added:
{{cquote|The censorship of Dailymotion's website shows that the government, which is as paranoid about the Internet as it is about the traditional press, is ready to ban tens of thousands of inoffensive videos in order to block a handful it does not like.}}

The suit against Mestiri was brought by Tunisian lawyer Mohammed Baccar over an article posted on September 5, 2006 accusing him of fraud and forgery. Mestiri was summoned by the deputy state prosecutor to respond to a charge of libel on March 29. Mestiri's lawyers have challenged the suit's legal basis on the grounds that Kalima's site is blocked in Tunisia and the article couldn't have been accessed there.

===Libya===
Despite the relatively few videos about [[Libya]] in Dailymotion, it was blocked there by March 2010.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

==Copyright protection==
Dailymotion with the help of Audible Magic, implemented an [[acoustic fingerprinting]] system that can detect copyrighted videos and not publish them.<ref>http://www.dailymotion.com/press/AudibleMagic-Dailymotion.pdf</ref> Dailymotion is also the first video sharing website to implement a video fingerprinting solution supplied by INA.<ref>http://www.dailymotion.com/press/PR_20080225_ina_implementation_final.pdf</ref>
