<html> <head> <title>AuthIP</title></head><body>'''AuthIP''' is a [[Microsoft]] [[Proprietary protocol|proprietary]] extension of the [[Internet key exchange|IKE]] [[cryptographic protocol]]. AuthIP is supported in [[Windows Vista]] and later on the client and [[Windows Server 2008]] and later on the server. AuthIP adds a second authentication to the standard IKE authentication which, according to Microsoft, increases security and deployability of [[IPsec]] [[VPN]]s. AuthIP adds support for user-based authentication by using Kerberos v5 or SSL certificates.

AuthIP is not compatible with [[IKEv2]], an [[IETF]] standard with similar characteristics; however [[Windows 7]] and [[Windows Server 2008 R2]] also support IKEv2.
