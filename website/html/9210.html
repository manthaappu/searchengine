'''Daniel Alan Spielman''' (born March 1970, [[Philadelphia]], [[USA]]<ref name=bb>[http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/bio.txt Brief bio]</ref>) is professor of [[Applied Mathematics]] and [[Computer Science]] at [[Yale University]] (since 2006). 

Daniel Spielman received his B.A. in mathematics and computer science from Yale University in 1992 and his Ph.D. in applied mathematics (dissertation: ''Computationally Efficient Error-Correcting Codes and Holographic Proofs'') from MIT in 1995. He taught in the 
Mathematics Department at MIT during 1996-2005.

In 2008 he was awarded the [[Gödel Prize]] for his joint work on [[smoothed analysis]] of algorithms.<ref>[http://www.cs.yale.edu/people/spielman.html Daniel Spielman profile] at Yale University.</ref>

In 2010, he was awarded the [[Nevanlinna Prize]] for "for smoothed analysis of Linear Programming, algorithms for graph-based codes and applications of graph theory to Numerical Computing"<ref>{{cite|url=http://www.icm2010.org.in/imu-prizes/prize-winners-2010/rolf-nevanlinna-prize-daniel-spielman|title=Rolf Nevanlinna Prize – Daniel Spielman|publisher=ICM 2010|accessdate=21 August 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> and the same year he was named a Fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]].<ref>http://www.acm.org/press-room/news-releases/2010/fellows-2010</ref>

He holds several patents in the area of coding theory with the U.S. Patent Office.
