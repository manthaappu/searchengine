A '''nonbroadcast multiple access network''' ('''NBMA''') is a [[computer network]] to which multiple hosts are attached, but data is transmitted only directly from one computer to another single host over a [[virtual circuit]] or across a [[switched fabric]]. NBMA networks do not support [[multicast]] or [[Broadcasting (computing)|broadcast]] traffic. Some common examples of nonbroadcast network technologies include [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM), [[Frame Relay]], [[X.25]], and home power line networking.

==Power line networks==
The [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] standard provides a specification for creating a high-speed (up to 1 Gigabit/s) [[local area network]] using existing home [[Power line communication|power lines]], phone lines and [[Ethernet over coax|coaxial cables]].

Because of [[multipath propagation]], power lines use frequency-selective channels. Channel frequency response is different for each pair of transmitter and receiver, so modulation parameters are unique for each transmitter and receiver pair. Since each pair of devices uses a different modulation scheme for communication, other devices may not be able to demodulate the information sent between them.
