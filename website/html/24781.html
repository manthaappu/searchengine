The '''Mobile 3D Graphics API''', commonly referred to as '''M3G''', is a specification defining an [[Application programming interface|API]] for writing [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programs that produce [[3D computer graphics]]. It extends the capabilities of the [[Java ME]], a version of the [[Java (software platform)|Java platform]] tailored for [[embedded device]]s such as [[mobile phone]]s and [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s. The [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] interface consists of 30 [[Class (computer science)|classes]] that can be used to draw complex animated three-dimensional scenes. M3G was developed under the [[Java Community Process]] as JSR 184.  {{As of|2007}}, the current version of M3G is 1.1, but version 2.0 is in development as JSR 297.

== Goals of M3G ==

M3G was designed to meet the specific needs of mobile devices, which are constricted in terms of memory, and processing power, and which often lack an [[Floating point unit|FPU]] and graphics hardware such as a [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]]. The API's architecture allows it to be implemented completely inside [[Computer software|software]] or to take advantage of the hardware present on the device.

== M3G is not Java 3D ==

M3G should not be mistaken for [[Java 3D]], which extends the capabilities of the [[Java SE]]. Java 3D is designed for [[Personal computer|PCs]] that have more memory and greater processing power than mobile devices. M3G and Java 3D are two separate and incompatible APIs designed for different purposes.

== Immediate and Retained Modes ==

M3G provides two ways for developers to draw 3D graphics: ''immediate mode'' and ''retained mode''. In immediate mode, graphics commands are issued directly into the graphics pipeline and the rendering engine executes them immediately. When using this method, the developer must write code that specifically tells the rendering engine what to draw for each [[Frame (film)|animation frame]]. A camera, and set of lights is also associated with the scene, but is not necessarily part of it. In immediate mode it is possible to display single objects, as well as entire scenes (or worlds, with a camera, lights, and background as parts of the scene).

Retained mode always uses a [[scene graph]] that links all geometric objects in the 3D world in a [[tree structure]], and also specifies the camera, lights, and background. Higher-level information about each object &mdash; such as its geometric structure, position, and appearance &mdash; is retained from frame to frame.

== Other Features ==

The M3G standard also specifies a file format for 3D model data, including animation data. This allows developers to create content on PCs that can be loaded by M3G on mobile devices.

== Advantages and disadvantages of M3G ==
M3G is a high level 3D API that allows you to get results quickly. With only a few lines of code you can import a scene and animate it. The API is intuitive and has quite sophisticated features. The down side is that it is runs quite slow on a lot of mobile phones. This is mainly because it uses floats and most mobile phones do not have a processor with a floating point unit. Nevertheless, the performance can be acceptable if you optimise your program correctly (especially on newer phones). Alternative proprietary APIs such as [[Mascot Capsule]] run faster (because of its use of fixed point calculations), but aren't as widely supported.
