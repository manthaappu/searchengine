<html> <head> <title>Forwarding equivalence class</title></head><body>A '''Forwarding Equivalence Class''' ('''FEC''') is a term used in [[Multiprotocol Label Switching]] (MPLS) to describe a set of packets with similar and / or identical characteristics which may be forwarded the same way; that is, they may be bound to the same MPLS label.

Characteristics determining the FEC of a higher-layer packet depend on the configuration of the router, but typically this is at least the destination IP address. [[Quality of service]] class is also often used. Thus, a '''Forward Equivalence Class''' tends to correspond to a [[label switched path]] (LSP). The reverse is not true, however: an LSP may be (and usually is) used for multiple FECs.
