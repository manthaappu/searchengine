'''Macintosh Manager''' started as a replacement for [[Apple Computer]]'s [[At Ease]] workstation software.  It originally ran on [[Mac OS 9]] with [[AppleShare IP]], and came with [[Mac OS X Server]] up to version [[Mac OS X v10.3|10.3 Panther]].  In version [[Mac OS X v10.4|10.4 Tiger]], Macintosh Manager was removed.

Macintosh Manager was used to manage classic Mac OS clients. It allows users to arranged into groups and different levels of access to certain features in the Finder. Similar functionality is found in [[Workgroup Manager]] for Mac OS X.
