<html> <head> <title>Navigation research</title></head><body>Whereas originally the term ''[[Navigation]]'' applies to the process of directing a ship to a destination, '''Navigation research''' deals with fundamental aspects of navigation in general. It can be defined as ''"The process of determining and maintaining a course or trajectory to a goal location" (Franz, Mallot, 2000)''.
It concerns basically all moving [[Agent (grammar)|agents]], [[biology|biological]] or artificial, [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomous]] or remote-controlled.

''Franz and Mallot'' proposed a navigation hierarchy ([http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V16-3YHG97R-K&_user=946230&_coverDate=01%2F31%2F2000&_rdoc=9&_fmt=summary&_orig=browse&_srch=%23toc%235666%232000%23999699998%23159597!&_cdi=5666&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_acct=C000049009&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=946230&md5=8c30c4f00f8e97c08651032b4d118e90 ''Robotics and Autonomous Systems 30 (2000), 133-153'']):

There are two basic methods for navigation:

* [[Egocentric navigation]] also known as Idiothetic navigation
* [[Allocentric navigation]] also known as Allothetic navigation

== Robotic navigation ==
{{Main|robotic mapping}}
[[Outdoor]] robots can use GPS in a similar way to [[automotive navigation system]]s.
Alternative systems can be used with [[floor plan]] instead of [[map]]s for [[indoor]] robots, combined with localization wireless hardware.
