The National Grid Initiative of Norway is '''NorGrid'''. The NorGrid initiative aims to establish and maintain a national grid infrastructure in Norway.

The NorGrid project was initially established as a subactivity of the Norwegian infrastructure project [http://www.notur.no/ Notur] for high-performance computing. In March 2007, NorGrid was recognized by the Research Council of Norway as a separate initiative with its own funding.

A detailed description of the mission, organization and status of NorGrid can be found on the [http://www.norgrid.no home pages] for NorGrid.

The coordinating legal entity of the NorGrid initiative is [http://sigma.uninett.no UNINETT Sigma]. NorGrid includes the national Norwegian NREN ([http://www.uninett.no UNINETT]), the University of Bergen ([http://www.uib.no UiB]) and its affiliated research organization [http://www.unifob.no Unifob], the University of Oslo ([http://www.uio.no UiO]) and the University of Troms√∏ ([http://www.uit.no UiT]).

NorGrid collaborates with the '''Nordic Data Grid Facility''' ([http://www.ndgf.org/ NDGF]), a collaboration between the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden), on the operations and support for the Nordic Tier-1 center that is part of the WLCG collaboration. NDGF is hosted by NORDUnet.

NorGrid is funded in part by the Research Council of Norway through the eVITA programme on e-Science.
