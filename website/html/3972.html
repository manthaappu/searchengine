The '''Bistro''' [[programming language]] is [[object oriented]], [[dynamic typing|dynamically typed]], and [[Reflection (computer science)|reflective]]. It is intended to integrate features of [[Smalltalk]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], running as a variant of Smalltalk that runs atop any Java [[virtual machine]] conforming to [[Sun Microsystems]]' Java specification. There were no new developments with Bistro since 2002 <ref name="Official Homepage">[http://bistro.sourceforge.net/ Official project page at SourceForge]</ref>.

Bistro duplicates the vast majority of the syntax and API for [[Smalltalk]], and introduces the package and import concepts from Java. [[Operator overloading|Overloaded operator]]s are available for certain operators; ''++'' and ''--'' are not available overloaded operators.

The syntax for declaring a class's package and import clauses are:

:'''package:''' my.package.subpackage;
:'''import:''' my.package.MyClass;
:'''import:''' my.package.*;

One notable exclusion is the ability to import static methods from other classes.
