'''[[Computer engineering]]''' (CE) is the design and development of computer systems. It is often considered a hybrid between [[Electrical Engineering]] and [[Computer Science]] due to the utilization of both [[Computer hardware|hardware]] and [[Computer software|software]] technologies in the field. 

The following outline is provided as an overview of and introduction to computer engineering:
