In [[linguistic morphology]], '''stemming''' is the process for reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their [[Word stem|stem]], base or [[root (linguistics)|root]] form &ndash; generally a written word form. The stem need not be identical to the [[morphological root]] of the word; it is usually sufficient that related words map to the same stem, even if this stem is not in itself a valid root. [[Algorithm]]s for stemming have been studied in [[computer science]] since 1968. Many [[search engine]]s treat words with the same stem as [[synonym]]s as a kind of [[query broadening]], a process called '''conflation'''.

Stemming programs are commonly referred to as '''stemming algorithms''' or '''stemmers'''.

==Examples==
A stemmer for [[English language|English]], for example, should identify the [[string literal|string]] "cats" (and possibly "catlike", "catty" etc.) as based on the root "cat", and "stemmer", "stemming", "stemmed" as based on "stem". A stemming algorithm reduces the words "fishing", "fished", "fish", and "fisher" to the root word, "fish".

==History==
The first ever published stemmer was written by Julie Beth Lovins in 1968.<ref>Julie Beth Lovins (1968). Development of a stemming algorithm. Mechanical Translation and Computational Linguistics '''11''':22â€“31.</ref> This paper was remarkable for its early date and had great influence on later work in this area.

A later stemmer was written by [[Martin Porter]] and was published in the July 1980 issue of the journal ''Program''. This stemmer was very widely used and became the de-facto standard algorithm used for English stemming.  Dr. Porter received the [[Tony Kent Strix award]] in 2000 for his work on stemming and information retrieval.

Many implementations of the Porter stemming algorithm were written and freely distributed; however, many of these implementations contained subtle flaws. As a result, these stemmers did not match their potential. To eliminate this source of error, Martin Porter released an official [http://tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer/ free-software implementation] of the algorithm around the year 2000. He extended this work over the next few years by building [[Snowball programming language|Snowball]], a framework for writing stemming algorithms, and implemented an improved English stemmer together with stemmers for several other languages.

==Algorithms==
There are several types of stemming algorithms which differ in respect to performance and accuracy and how certain stemming obstacles are overcome.

===Brute-force algorithms===

[[Brute-force search|Brute force]] stemmers employ a [[lookup table]] which contains relations between root forms and inflected forms. To stem a word, the table is queried to find a matching inflection. If a matching inflection is found, the associated root form is returned.

Brute force approaches are criticized for their general lack of elegance in that no algorithm is applied that would more quickly converge on a solution. In other words, there are more operations performed during the search than should be necessary. Brute force searches consume immense amounts of storage to host the list of relations (relative to the task). The algorithm is only accurate to the extent that the inflected form already exists in the table. Given the number of words in a given language, like English, it is unrealistic to expect that all word forms can be captured and manually recorded by human action alone. Manual training of the algorithm is overly time-intensive and the ratio between the effort and the increase in accuracy is marginal at best.

Brute force algorithms do overcome some of the challenges faced by the other approaches. Not all inflected word forms in a given language "follow the rules" appropriately. While "running" might be easy to stem to "run" in a suffix stripping approach, the alternate inflection, "ran", is not. Suffix stripping algorithms are somewhat powerless to overcome this problem, short of increasing the number and complexity of the rules, but brute force algorithms only require storing a single extra relation between "run" and "ran". While that is true, this assumes someone bothered to store the relation in the first place, and one of the major problems of improving brute force algorithms is the coverage of the language.

Brute force algorithms are initially very difficult to design given the immense number of relations that must be initially stored to produce an acceptable level of accuracy (the number can span well into the millions). However, brute force algorithms are easy to improve in that decreasing the stemming error is only a matter of adding more relations to the table. Someone with only a minor experience in linguistics is capable of improving the algorithm, unlike the suffix stripping approaches which require a solid background in linguistics.

For technical accuracy, some programs may use suffix stripping to generate the lookup table given a text corpus, and then only consult the lookup table when stemming. This is not regarded as a brute force approach, although a lookup table is involved.

====The production technique====
Some programs attempt to automatically generate the table of root and inflected forms. A production algorithm attempts to infer the probable inflections for a given word. For example, if the word is "run", then the algorithm might automatically generate the forms "running" and "runs".  In the traditional sense of the concept of stemming, this algorithm is its reverse process. Rather than try and remove suffixes, the goal of a production algorithm is to generate suffixes.  Later, a brute force algorithm can simply query the automatically generated table of word relations to find the root form of a word.

There are many types of heuristic, experimental techniques for identifying inflected forms of words. Some algorithms work phonetically, looking at the final syllables in a word. Some are rather brute force, using rules that seem a lot like normalization rules, by inspecting the last few characters. Others are similar to the process of lemmatisation, which takes advantage of the additional knowledge about the part of speech of the given word to limit what types of suffixes are considered when generating inflections for the word.

Distinguishing this technique from the other approaches is not very important. The other approaches share much of the same logic, but are simply working in the opposite direction. Some stemming approaches may employ both a production technique to generate inflections, and a suffix stripping approach to identify root forms together.

One drawback of the production technique is that there is no guarantee the inflection is real. For example, a technique might join together "run" and "ly" to create the word "runly". "runly" is not a real word. Granted, it is highly unlikely that "runly" will ever be used as input to a stemming algorithm since it is not a real word, so this error may not affect the result and therefore the accuracy of a stemming algorithm. However, such errors do populate the table of relations, and each additional entry can increase the time required to perform the lookup of an inflection to find its corresponding root form.

===Suffix-stripping algorithms===

Suffix stripping algorithms do not rely on a lookup table that consists of inflected forms and root form relations. Instead, a typically smaller list of "rules" are stored which provide a path for the algorithm, given an input word form, to find its root form. Some examples of the rules include:

* if the word ends in 'ed', remove the 'ed'
* if the word ends in 'ing', remove the 'ing'
* if the word ends in 'ly', remove the 'ly'

Suffix stripping approaches enjoy the benefit of being much simpler to maintain than brute force algorithms, assuming the maintainer is sufficiently knowledgeable in the challenges of linguistics and morphology and encoding suffix stripping rules. Suffix stripping algorithms are sometimes regarded as crude given the poor performance when dealing with exceptional relations (like 'ran' and 'run'). The solutions produced by suffix stripping algorithms are limited to those [[lexical category|lexical categories]] which have well known suffixes with few exceptions. This, however, is a problem, as not all parts of speech have such a well formulated set of rules. Lemmatisation attempts to improve upon this challenge.

====Additional algorithm criteria====
Suffix stripping algorithms may differ in results for a variety of reasons. One such reason is whether the algorithm constrains whether the output word must be a real word in the given language. Some approaches do not require the word to actually exist in the language lexicon (the set of all words in the language). Alternatively, some suffix stripping approaches maintain a database (a large list) of all known morphological word roots that exist as real words. These approaches check the list for the existence of the term prior to making a decision. Typically, if the term does not exist, alternate action is taken. This alternate action may involve several other criteria. The non-existence of an output term may serve to cause the algorithm to try alternate suffix stripping rules. It can be the case that two or more suffix stripping rules apply to the same input term, where there becomes an ambiguity in which rule to apply. The algorithm may assign (by human hand or stochastically) a priority to one rule or another. Or the algorithm may reject one rule application because it results in a non-existent term whereas the other overlapping rule does not. For example, given the English term ''friendlies'', the algorithm may identify the ''ies'' suffix and apply the appropriate rule and achieve the result of ''friendl''. ''friendl'' is likely not found in the lexicon, and therefore the rule is rejected.

One improvement upon basic suffix stripping is the use of suffix substitution. Similar to a stripping rule, a substitution rule replaces a suffix with an alternate suffix. For example, there could exist a rule that replaces ''ies'' with ''y''. How this affects the algorithm varies on the algorithm's design. To illustrate, the algorithm may identify that both the ''ies'' suffix stripping rule applies as well as the suffix substitution rule. Since the stripping rule results in a non-existent term in the lexicon, but the substitution rule does not, the substitution rule is applied instead. In this example, ''friendlies'' becomes ''friendly'' instead of ''friendl''. Diving further into the details, a common technique is to apply rules in a cyclical fashion (recursively, as computer scientists would say). After applying the suffix substitution rule in this example scenario, a second pass is made to identify matching rules on the term ''friendly'', where the ''ly'' stripping rule is likely identified and accepted. In summary, ''friendlies'' becomes (via substitution) ''friendly'' which becomes (via stripping) ''friend''.

This example also helps illustrate the difference between a rule based approach and a brute force approach. In a brute force approach, the algorithm would search for ''friendlies'' in the set of hundreds of thousands of inflected word forms and ideally find the corresponding root form ''friend''. In the rule based approach, the three rules mentioned above would be applied in succession to converge on the same solution. Chances are that the rule based approach was faster.

===Lemmatisation algorithms===

A more complex approach to the problem of determining a stem of a word is [[lemmatisation]]. This process involves first determining the [[part of speech]] of a word, and applying different normalization rules for each part of speech. The part of speech is first detected prior to attempting to find the root since for some languages, the stemming rules change depending on a word's part of speech.

This approach is highly conditional upon obtaining the correct lexical category (part of speech). While there is overlap between the normalization rules for certain categories, identifying the wrong category or being unable to produce the right category limits the added benefit of this approach over suffix stripping algorithms. The basic idea is that, if we are able to grasp more information about the word to be stemmed, then we are able to more accurately apply normalization rules (which are, more or less, suffix stripping rules).

===Stochastic algorithms===

[[Stochastic]] algorithms involve using probability to identify the root form of a word. Stochastic algorithms are trained (they "learn") on a table of root form to inflected form relations to develop a probabilistic model. This model is typically expressed in the form of complex linguistic rules, similar in nature to those in suffix stripping or lemmatisation. Stemming is performed by inputting an inflected form to the trained model and having the model produce the root form according to its internal ruleset, which again is similar to suffix stripping and lemmatisation, except that the decisions involved in applying the most appropriate rule, or whether or not to stem the word and just return the same word, or whether to apply two different rules sequentially, are applied on the grounds that the output word will have the highest probability of being correct (which is to say, the smallest probability of being incorrect, which is how it is typically measured).

Some lemmatisation algorithms are stochastic in that, given a word which may belong to multiple parts of speech, a probability is assigned to each possible part. This may take into account the surrounding words, called the context, or not. Context-free grammars do not take into account any additional information. In either case, after assigning the probabilities to each possible part of speech, the most likely part of speech is chosen, and from there the appropriate normalization rules are applied to the input word to produce the normalized (root) form.

===''n''-gram analysis===
To further explain, consider the well known technique of ''n-gram analysis''. Here the term gram is a unit of measurement of text that may refer to a single character, a single syllable, or a single word. Which one applies is dependent upon which author or programmer is describing the algorithm (and their background, as a linguist is more likely to be referring to syllables, but a computer scientist characters and a software company words). The prefix '''n''' is, as usual in computer science jargon, representing 'any number of', or a 'variable number of'. There are frequently used subsets of n-grams, such as bigrams (a.k.a digrams, bi-grams, di-grams), representing a sequence of two grams (two characters or two words or two syllables in a row, consecutively in the text). Trigrams (three units) are also popular.

In language modeling, one could write a software program that stores a large table of all word bigrams found in a large body of text (called a corpus). The algorithm would scan word by word, like a sliding window, across the text from the beginning, storing two word sequences as it moves along until the last word of the last document is reached. On the output, one has what is called a bigrams table. Each row in the table may be called a tuple, storing the first word, and then the second word. Additional characteristics may be stored about each bigram, such as its frequency (the total count of the times the whole bigram was discovered) in whatever body of texts was used to generate the table. The table may also store the frequency of each individual word. For example, this sentence contains bigrams like "for example" and "this sentence".

From the table an algorithm can garner the probability of the second word following the first word by assessing each word's frequency and the frequency of the bigrams and perhaps other criteria like the total number of bigrams or the total number of bigrams where the first word is the same. For example, one would be able to state conclusions like: the presence of the word '''post''' indicates a probability of the following word being '''office''' of 50%, because the sequence occurred this way 50% of the time in the text (where '''post''' occurred with and without '''office''' following it).

In the bi-gram relationship, the first word can be understood as the context that describes the second word. It qualifies the second word, providing additional insight into its meaning. Humans use the technique of examining the context of words to determine the meaning of written words quite frequently. Words can have multiple meanings, called senses. The bigram-provided context provides a way to distinguish which sense of the word is used (well, most of the time, as literary puns and the like are the obvious exception). As mentioned elsewhere, the stemming algorithm can use this context as additional information to assist in determining the outcome of the algorithm (whether or not the current word is stemmed, which of one or more possible stems is appropriate, whether to use substitution or stripping, whether the word is a verb or noun or some other lexical category, etc). Because the algorithm used probabilities in determining the outcome, it is a stochastic algorithm.

Entering into the realm of stochastic algorithms may greatly complicate the stemming algorithm, making it much harder to develop, distribute and maintain. There is considerable debate over its benefits. If a simple suffix stripper can get to about 80% accuracy from a few days or weeks of programming, then how much more valuable is it that a context-driven n-gram stemmer can achieve 90% accuracy given several months of work? There are also many problems with stochastic stemmers. What if the body of text used to derive the probabilities of the bigrams is not a representative sample of all documents ever written in a given language (and it is likely not)? What if the algorithm's bigram table 'becomes corrupted', by learning from 'bad text'? Reconfiguring a brute force algorithm that employs a lookup table is as simple as going in and removing a row from the table. But how does one reconfigure a probabilistic network (this is analogous to some of the problems behind neural networks)? Such obstacles are researched in computer science.

===Hybrid approaches===

Hybrid approaches use two or more of the approaches described above in unison. A simple example is a [[probabilistic suffix tree|suffix tree]] algorithm which first consults a lookup table using brute force. However, instead of trying to store the entire set of relations between words in a given language, the lookup table is kept small and is only used to store a minute amount of "frequent exceptions" like "ran => run". If the word is not in the exception list, apply suffix stripping or lemmatisation and output the result.

===Affix stemmers===
In [[linguistics]], the term [[affix]] refers to either a [[prefix]] or a [[suffix]]. In addition to dealing with suffixes, several approaches also attempt to remove common prefixes. For example, given the word ''indefinitely'', identify that the leading "in" is a prefix that can be removed. Many of the same approaches mentioned earlier apply, but go by the name '''affix stripping'''.

===Matching algorithms===
Such algorithms use a stem database (for example a set of documents that contain stem words). These stems, as mentioned above, are not necessarily valid words themselves (but rather common sub-strings, as the "brows" in "browse" and in "browsing"). In order to stem a word the algorithm tries to match it with stems from the database, applying various constraints, such as on the relative length of the candidate stem within the word (so that, for example, the short prefix "be", which is the stem of such words as "be", "been" and "being", would not be considered as the stem of the word "beside").

==Language challenges==
While much of the early academic work in this area was focused on the English language (with significant use of the Porter Stemmer algorithm), many other languages have been investigated.<ref>[http://www.clef-campaign.org/2007/working_notes/DolamicCLEF2007.pdf] Dolamic, Savoy: Stemming Approaches for East European Languages (CLEF 2007)</ref><ref>[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1141277.1141523 ]  Savoy:  Light stemming approaches for the French, Portuguese, German and Hungarian languages (SAC 2006) ISBN 1-59593-108-2</ref><ref>[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/10049677/ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0] Popovic & Willett:  The Effectiveness of Stemming for Natural-Language Access to Slovene Textual Data (1992) Journal of the [[American Society for Information Science]]</ref><ref>[http://staff.science.uva.nl/~mdr/Publications/Files/clef2005-proc-adhoc.pdf] Stemming in Hungarian at CLEF 2005</ref><ref>[http://InformationR.net/ir/12-3/paper315.html] Viera, A.F.G. & Virgil, J.: Uma revisÃ£o dos algoritmos de radicalizaÃ§Ã£o em lÃ­ngua portuguesa (2007) Information Research, 12(3) paper 315.</ref>

Hebrew and Arabic are still considered difficult research languages for stemming. English stemmers are fairly trivial (with only occasional problems, such as "dries" being the third-person singular present form of the verb "dry", "axes" being the plural of "axe" as well as "axis"); but stemmers become harder to design as the morphology, orthography, and character encoding of the target language becomes more complex. For example, an Italian stemmer is more complex than an English one (because of more possible verb inflections), a Russian one is more complex (more possible noun declensions), a Hebrew one is even more complex (due to non-catenative morphology and a writing system without vowels; and the requirement of prefix stripping.  Hebrew stems can be two, three or four characters; but not more.), and so on, while a stemmer for Hungarian would be easier to implement due to the precise rules in the language for flexion.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}.

===Multilingual stemming===
Multilingual stemming applies morphological rules of two or more languages simultaneously instead of rules for only a single language when interpreting a search query. Commercial systems using multilingual stemming exist.<ref>[http://www.coveo.com/en/Support/articles/Information%20-%20CES4-060330-3%20-%20Understanding%20Stemming.htm "Understanding Stemming"]. Coveo Knowledge Base (2006)</ref>

==Error metrics==
There are two error measurements in stemming algorithms, '''overstemming''' and '''understemming'''. Overstemming is an error where two separate inflected words are stemmed to the same root, but should not have been - a [[false positive]]. Understemming is an error where two separate inflected words should be stemmed to the same root, but are not - a [[false negative]]. Stemming algorithms attempt to minimize each type of error, although reducing one type can lead to increasing the other.
<!-- add some examples, please -->

==Applications==
===Information retrieval===
Stemmers are common elements in [[Information Retrieval|query systems]] such as [[World Wide Web|Web]] [[search engine]]s, since a user who runs a query on "daffodils" would probably also be interested in documents that contain the word "daffodil" (without the s). The effectiveness of stemming for English query systems were soon found to be rather limited, however, and this has led early [[Information retrieval]] researchers to deem stemming irrelevant in general.<ref>Ricardo Baeza-Yates and Berthier Ribeiro-Neto (1999). ''Modern Information Retrieval''. ACM Press/Addison Wesley.</ref> An alternative approach, based on searching for [[n-gram]]s rather than stems, may be used instead. Also, recent research has shown greater benefits for retrieval in other languages.<ref>Jaap Kamps, Christof Monz, Maarten de Rijke and BÃ¶rkur SigurbjÃ¶rnsson (2004).

=== Use in commercial products ===
Many commercial companies have been using stemming since at least the 1980s and have produced algorithmic and lexical stemmers in many languages.<ref>[http://www.dtsearch.com/CS_DeveloperTools.html#languages] International Developer Tools. dtSearch</ref><ref>[http://technet2.microsoft.com/Office/en-us/library/87065c9d-d39d-479d-909b-02160ec6d7791033.mspx?mfr=true] Building Multilingual Solutions by using Sharepoint Products and Technologies. Microsoft Technet</ref>

The Snowball stemmers have been compared with commercial lexical stemmers with varying results.<ref>[http://www.clef-campaign.org/2003/WN_web/19.pdf  CLEF 2003: Stephen Tomlinson compared the Snowball stemmers with the Hummingbird lexical stemming (lemmatization) system.]</ref><ref>[http://www.clef-campaign.org/2004/working_notes/WorkingNotes2004/21.pdf CLEF 2004: Stephen Tomlison "Finnish, Portuguese and Russian Retrieval with Hummingbird SearchServer"]</ref>

[[Google search]] adopted word stemming in 2003.<ref>[http://www.google.com/support/bin/static.py?page=searchguides.html&ctx=basics#stemming The Essentials of Google Search]. Web Search Help Center. [[Google|Google Inc.]]</ref> Previously a search for "fish" would not have returned "fishing".  Other software search algorithms vary in their use of word stemming.  Programs that simply search for substrings obviously will find "fish" in "fishing" but when searching for "fishes" will not find occurrences of the word "fish".
