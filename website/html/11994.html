'''Elonex PLC''' is a computer hardware and related IT services company based in [[Coleshill, Warwickshire]], UK, that develops, sells and supports computers, consumer electronics and related IT services.

The original Elonex brand was founded in 1986, in [[Finchley]], North London, by Israel Wetrin, and rapidly grew to become one of the UK's biggest computer hardware supplier by the mid-1990s. At its peak the company's turnover reached over Â£100 million per year.<ref name=PhillipsTimJuly2006>{{Citation

In 2006, Elonex voluntarily went into administration and the brand name Elonex was licensed to a subsidiary of office consumables supplier Applied Film Industries Company (Afic) for an undisclosed sum. The new company was registered as Elonex LTD.<ref name=AkassJul2006>{{Citation

In 2007, the Elonex brand reemerged again as the Elonex brand owner reassigned the license from the short lived Elonex ltd to a group led by ex IBM VP Stuart Smith. Stuart Smith confirmed that the only connection between his version of Elonex and the original company was simply that the famous brand was licensed for use in the UK for a specific period.The Elonex brand was then used for a number of sourced products for niche UK markets. None of Elonex's original technology and patents were purchased by Stuart Smith as all intellectual property was left with the International Holding company.<ref name=HailstoneMay2007>{{Citation
