The transitions of a Stream X-Machine are labelled by functions of the form φ: ''Mem'' × ''In'' → ''Out'' × ''Mem'', that is, which compute an output value and update the memory, from the current memory and an input value.

Because of the intuitive interpretation of Stream X-Machines as "processing agents with inputs and outputs", they have attracted increasing interest, because of their utility in modelling real-world phenomena.  The SXM model has important applications in fields as diverse as [[computational biology]], [[software testing]] and [[Computational economics|agent-based computational economics]].

== The Stream X-Machine ==

A Stream X-Machine (SXM) is an extended [[finite state machine]] with auxiliary memory, inputs and outputs.  It is a variant of the general [[X-machine]], in which the fundamental data type ''X'' = ''Out''* × ''Mem'' × ''In''*, that is, a tuple consisting of an output stream,  the memory and an input stream. A SXM separates the ''control flow'' of a system from the ''processing'' carried out by the system.  The control is modelled by a [[finite state machine]] (known as the ''associated automaton'') whose transitions are labelled with processing functions chosen from a set Φ (known as the ''type'' of the machine), which act upon the fundamental data type.

Each processing function in Φ is a partial function, and can be considered to have the type φ: ''Mem'' × ''In'' → ''Out'' × ''Mem'', where ''Mem'' is the memory type, and ''In'' and ''Out'' are respectively the input and output types.  In any given state, a transition is ''enabled'' if the domain of the associated function φ<sub>i</sub> includes the next input value and the current memory state.  If (at most) one transition is enabled in a given state, the machine is ''deterministic''.  Crossing a transition is equivalent to applying the associated function φ<sub>i</sub>, which consumes one input, possibly modifies the memory and produces one output.  Each recognised path through the machine therefore generates a list φ<sub>1</sub> ... φ<sub>n</sub> of functions, and the SXM composes these functions together to generate a relation on the fundamental data type |φ<sub>1</sub> ... φ<sub>n</sub>|: ''X'' → ''X''.

=== Relationship to X-machines ===

The Stream X-Machine is a variant of [[X-machine]] in which the fundamental data type ''X'' = ''Out''* × ''Mem'' × ''In''*.  In the original [[X-machine]], the φ<sub>i</sub> are general ''relations'' on ''X''.  In the Stream X-Machine, these are usually restricted to ''functions''; however the SXM is still only deterministic if (at most) one transition is enabled in each state.

A general [[X-machine]] handles input and output using a prior encoding function α: ''Y'' → ''X'' for input, and a posterior decoding function β: ''X'' → ''Z'' for output, where ''Y'' and ''Z'' are respectively the input and output types.  In a Stream X-Machine, these types are streams:

  ''Y'' = ''In''*
  ''Z'' = ''Out''*

and the encoding and decoding functions are defined as:

  α(''ins'') = (<>, ''mem''<sub>0</sub>, ''ins'')
  β(''outs'', ''mem''<sub>n</sub>, <>) = ''outs''

where ''ins: In''*, ''outs: Out''* and ''mem''<sub>i</sub>: ''Mem''.  In other words, the machine is initialized with the whole of the input stream; and the decoded result is the whole of the output stream, provided the input stream is eventually consumed (otherwise the result is undefined).

Each processing function in a SXM is given the abbreviated type φ<sub>SXM</sub>: ''Mem'' × ''In'' → ''Out'' × ''Mem''.  This can be mapped onto a general [[X-machine]] relation of the type φ: X → X if we treat this as computing:

  φ(''outs'', ''mem''<sub>i</sub>, ''in'' :: ''ins'') = (''outs'' :: ''out'', ''mem''<sub>i+1</sub>, ''ins'')

where <code>::</code> denotes concatenation of an element and a sequence.  In other words, the relation extracts the head of the input stream, modifies memory and appends a value to the tail of the output stream.

=== Processing and Testable Properties ===

Because of the above equivalence, attention may focus on the way a Stream X-Machine processes inputs into outputs, using an auxiliary memory.  Given an initial memory state ''mem''<sub>0</sub> and an input stream ''ins'', the machine executes in a step-wise fashion, consuming one input at a time, and generating one output at a time.  Provided that (at least) one recognised path ''path'' = φ<sub>1</sub> ... φ<sub>n</sub> exists leading to a state in which the input has been consumed, the machine yields a final memory state ''mem''<sub>n</sub> and an output stream ''outs''.  In general, we can think of this as the relation computed by all recognised paths:  | ''path'' | : ''In''* → ''Out''*. This is often called the ''behaviour'' of the Stream X-Machine.

The behaviour is deterministic, if (at most) one transition is enabled in each state.  This property, and the ability to control how the machine behaves in a step-wise fashion in response to inputs and memory, makes it an ideal model for the specification of software systems.  If the specification and implementation are both assumed to be Stream X-Machines, then the implementation may be tested for conformance to the specification machine, by observing the inputs and outputs at each step.  Laycock first highlighted the utility of single-step processing with observations for testing purposes.<ref name="Lay93" />

Holcombe and Ipate developed this into a practical theory of software testing<ref name="HolIp98" /> which was fully compositional, scaling up to very large systems.<ref name="IpHol98">F. Ipate and M. Holcombe (1998) 'A method for refining and testing generalised machine specifications'. ''Int. J. Comp. Math.'' '''68''', pp. 197-219.</ref>  A proof of correct integration<ref name="IpHol97" /> guarantees that  testing each component and each integration layer separately corresponds to testing the whole system.  This divide-and-conquer approach makes ''exhaustive'' testing feasible for large systems.

The testing method is described in a separate article on the [[X-Machine Testing|Stream X-Machine testing methodology]].
