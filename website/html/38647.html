'''USN Journal''' (shorthand form of '''U'''pdate '''S'''equence '''N'''umber '''Journal''', also known as '''Change Journal''')<ref name="ms-web-msdn-msj-1">{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/msj/0999/journal/journal.aspx|title=Keeping an Eye on Your NTFS Drives: the Windows 2000 Change Journal Explained|last1=Cooperstein|first1=Jeffrey |last2=Richter|first2=Jeffrey|date=September 1999|work=Microsoft Systems Journal (MSJ)|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=10 June 2009}}</ref> is a function of recording the changes on [[NTFS]] volumes.

When [[Windows 2000]] was released, [[Microsoft]] created [[NTFS]] version 3.0, which included several new features and improvements over older versions of the [[file system]]. One of these was a new system management feature that is very useful for certain types of [[application software|application]]s. Under Windows 2000, NTFS 3.0 [[Disk partitioning|partitions]] can be set to keep track of changes to files and directories on the [[volume (computing)|volume]], providing a record of when and what was done to the various objects. When enabled, the system records all changes made to the volume in the USN Journal, which is the name also used to describe the feature itself.

USN Journals work in a fairly simple manner. One journal is maintained for each NTFS volume, and it begins as an empty [[Computer file|file]]. Whenever a change is made to the volume, a record is added to the file. Each record is identified by a [[64-bit]] Update Sequence Number or USN. (For this reason Change Journals are sometimes called USN Journals.) Each record in the Change Journal contains the USN, the name of the file, and information about what the change was.

The Change Journal describes the changes that took place, but does not include all the [[data]] or details associated with the change. For this reason the Change Journal cannot be used to undo operations on files within NTFS.
