The '''counterpropagation network''' is a hybrid network. It consists of an outstar network and a competitive filter network. It was developed in 1986 by [[Robert Hecht-Nielsen]]. It is guaranteed to find the correct weights, unlike regular back propagation networks that can become trapped in local minimums during training.

The input layer [[neurode (neural network)|neurode]] connect to each neurode in the hidden layer. The hidden layer is a Kohonen network which categorizes the pattern that was input. The output layer is an [[outstar]] array which reproduces the correct output pattern for the category.

Training is done in two stages. The hidden layer is first taught to categorize the patterns and the weights are then fixed for that layer. Then the output layer is trained. Each pattern that will be input needs a unique node in the hidden layer, which is often too large to work on real world problems.
