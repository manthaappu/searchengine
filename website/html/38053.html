'''Trance JIT''' is a [[MorphOS]] [[Just-in-time compilation|JIT]] [[compiler]], or code translator, for running [[68k]] applications within the MorphOS environment. It has been part of the MorphOS operating system since MorphOS 1.4.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ann.lu/comments2.cgi?view=1060418084&category=files | title=MorphOS 1.4 available | date=9 August 2003 | accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref>

MorphOS itself has a fully integrated 68k emulator for running many Amiga applications. (Amiga programs were almost exclusively compiled for the 68k processor, while MorphOS itself is [[PowerPC]]). Trance supplements this functionality by adding JIT compilation, increasing the speed of the emulation even further. It does not interfere with the full integration of 68k and PowerPC tasks MorphOS provides.<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | title = MorphOS?

Trance exists in the form of an executable, run during boot, and a shared library. Although it is not technically part of the kernel, and MorphOS can be run without it, Trance is considered a fundamental part of MorphOS and one of its most powerful features.

Compatibility of Trance is considered to be very high and there are few to no 68k instruction sequences or applications which cause it any problems. It is also considered to be very fast, with users noticing few differences between 68k programs and native PowerPC code.

Trance was developed by [[Ralph Schmidt]] and Teemu Suikki, with minor support from other MorphOS team members, Mark Olsen, Sigbjørn Skjæret and Harry Sintonen.
