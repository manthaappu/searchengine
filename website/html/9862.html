==History==

In 1965 Donald Welbourn, Director in Industrial Co-operation at Cambridge University [http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/125/achievements/duct/index.htm], saw the possibility of using computers to assist pattern makers to solve the problems of modelling difficult 3D shapes. Early sponsorship was provided by [[Ford]], and after agreement to distribute via Control Data in Germany, customers included Volkswagen and Daimler Benz, requiring the establishment of a [[Birmingham]] based development centre from 1977.

In 1989, the company was bought from Delta Group in a buyout led by [[Managing Director]] Hugh Humphreys. The company was renamed Delcam International in 1991, changed its status to [[Public Limited Company|plc]] and moved to a new purpose built building in [[Small Heath, Birmingham|Small Heath]]. In July 1997, Delcam plc was floated on the [[Alternative Investment Market]] to expand international operations, resulting in the establishment of over 70 offices.

In 2005 Delcam acquired [[Salt Lake City]] based Engineering Geometry Systems.<ref>[http://www.cs.utah.edu/gdc/projects/alpha1 GDC: Project: Alpha_1<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 2006 the company acquired the PartMaker CAM solution business from IMCS of [[Philadelphia]]; and Crispin Dynamics Ltd of [[Leicester]] England.

==Delcam TV ==
Delcam has launched its own online TV channel, Delcam TV, on www.delcam.tv.  Delcam is believed to be the first CADCAM company to invest significantly in this new marketing medium.

Customer testimonials are featured covering design, manufacturing and inspection across a range of industries such as aerospace, automotive, orthotics, dental, robotics, sculpting, jewellery, coin-making and signmaking.  These examples show viewers how Delcam users have revolutionised their businesses with the company’s comprehensive software solutions.  As well as illustrating the diversity of Delcam’s user base across the world, the testimonials may also inspire viewers to explore new business opportunities with the software.

Existing Delcam users can benefit from product videos showing the latest developments in the software and highlighting tips and tricks to further improve their productivity.  Content can be viewed online or downloaded to be played on a range of media players.  Viewers can share videos with friends and colleagues directly from Delcam TV.  Delcam TV also supports the Apple iPhone and iPod platforms, ensuring content is easily accessible for users on the move.

As might be expected from the world’s leading specialist supplier of CAM software, many of the videos feature different aspects of machining.  New material from Delcam’s machine tool partners will soon be added to demonstrate to users how Delcam’s software solutions can increase the productivity and quality of their equipment.

"More and more of our prospective customers are using the internet to gather information on different CADCAM systems,” explained Delcam’s Multimedia Manager, Fabio De Rosa.  "We believe that our new TV channel will provide even more evidence of the need for companies to consider Delcam software when they are looking at improving their CADCAM system.”

==Boris==
Delcam's logo incorporates a computer-modelled spider named Boris.  This was produced as an experiment to render hairs in Delcam's CAD software in 1984.  Upon seeing a machined version at a show, the [[Managing Director]] Hugh Humphreys decided to take it home and use it within the company's logo.<ref>http://www.delcam.com/general/about/boris.asp Boris' History</ref>
