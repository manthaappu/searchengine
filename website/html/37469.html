'''The Sleuth Kit''' (TSK) is a library and collection of [[Unix]]- and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based tools and utilities to allow for the forensic analysis of computer systems.  It was written and maintained by digital investigator Brian Carrier.  TSK can be used to perform investigations and data extraction from images of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[Unix]] computers.  The Sleuth Kit is normally used in conjunction with its custom front-end application, [[Autopsy (software)|Autopsy]], to provide a user friendly interface. An alternative, newer interface is [[PTK Forensics]]. Several other tools also use TSK for file extraction.

The Sleuth Kit is a [[Free software|free]], [[open source]] suite that provides a large number of specialized command-line based utilities.

It is based on [[The Coroner's Toolkit]].

==Tools==
Some of the tools included in The Sleuth Kit include:
* '''ils''' lists all [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]] entries, such as an [[Inode]].
* '''blkls''' displays data blocks within a [[Comparison of file systems|file system]] (formerly called dls).
* '''fls''' lists allocated and unallocated file names within a file system.
* '''fsstat''' displays file system statistical information about an image or storage medium.
* '''ffind''' searches for file names that point to a specified metadata entry.
* '''mactime''' creates a timeline of all files based upon their [[MAC times]].
* '''disk_stat''' (currently Linux-only) discovers the existence of a [[Host Protected Area]].
