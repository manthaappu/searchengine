'''[[Construction]]''' is the [[building]] or assembly of any [[infrastructure]] on a site or sites. Although this may be thought of as a single [[Task (project management)|activity]], in fact construction is a feat of [[Human multitasking|multitasking]]. Normally the job is managed by the construction [[Management|manager]], supervised by the [[project manager]], [[design engineer]] or [[project architect]].  While these people work in offices, every construction project requires a large number of [[laborers]], carpenters, and other skilled tradesmen to complete the physical task of construction.  

The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to construction:
