'''Leslie Gabriel Valiant''' (born 28 March 1949) is a [[Great Britain|British]] computer scientist and [[computational theorist]].

He was educated at [[King's College, Cambridge]], [[Imperial College London]], and [[University of Warwick]] where he received his [[Ph.D.]] in computer science in 1974.  He started teaching at [[Harvard University]] in 1982 and is currently the T. Jefferson Coolidge Professor of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics in the [[Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences]].  Prior to [[1982]] he taught at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Leeds University]], and the [[University of Edinburgh]].
 
Valiant is world-renowned for his work in [[theoretical computer science]].  Among his many contributions to [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]], he introduced the notion of [[Sharp-P-complete|#P-completeness]] to explain why [[enumeration]] and reliability problems are intractable.  He also introduced the "probably approximately correct" ([[Probably approximately correct learning|PAC]]) model of machine learning that has helped the field of computational learning theory grow, and the concept of [[holographic algorithm]]s. His earlier work in [[automata theory]] includes an [[CYK algorithm#Valiant's algorithm|algorithm for context-free parsing]], which is (as of 2010) still the asymptotically fastest known. 
He also works in [[computational neuroscience]] focusing on understanding memory and learning.

He received the [[Nevanlinna Prize]] in 1986, the [[Knuth Prize]] in 1997, and the [[EATCS Award]] in 2008.  He is a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] (London), a Fellow of the [[American Association for Artificial Intelligence]], and a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (USA).

One of his significant research papers was proving, along with [[Vijay Vazirani]], [[Boolean satisfiability problem#Extensions of SAT|UNIQUE-SAT]] ∈ [[P (complexity)|P]] → [[NP (complexity)|NP]] = [[RP (complexity)|RP]] ([[Valiant–Vazirani theorem]]).
