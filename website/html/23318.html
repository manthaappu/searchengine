A '''major stationary source''' is a source that emits more than a certain amount of a [[pollutant]] as defined by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA). The amount of pollutants allowed for certain new sources is defined by the EPA's [[New Source Performance Standard]]s (NSPS).

A '''stationary source''' in air quality terminology is any fixed emitter of air pollutants, such as [[fossil fuel]] burning [[power plant]]s, [[petroleum refineries]], [[Petrochemical|petrochemical plants]], [[Food processing|food processing plants]] and other heavy industrial sources.

A '''mobile source''' in air quality terminology is a non-stationary source of air pollutants, such as automobiles, buses, trucks, ships, trains, aircraft and various other vehicles.
