'''Ahmed Hassan Zewail''' ({{lang-ar|أحمد حسن زويل}}) (born February 26, 1946 in [[Damanhour]], [[Egypt]]) is an [[Egypt]]ian-[[United States|American]] scientist, and the winner of the 1999 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work on [[femtochemistry]]. He is the Linus Pauling Chair Professor Chemistry and Professor of Physics at the [[California Institute of Technology]].

== Birth and education ==
Ahmad Zewail was born on February 26, 1946 in [[Damanhour]] and raised in [[Disuq]]. He received bachelor's degree and MS degree from the [[University of Alexandria]] before moving from [[Egypt]] to the United States to complete his PhD at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] with advisor Dr. [[Robin Hochstrasser]]. He completed a post-doctoral fellowship at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] with advisor Dr. [[Charles B. Harris]].

== Academic career ==
After some post doctorate work at [[UC-Berkeley]], he was awarded a faculty appointment at [[Caltech]] in 1976, where he has remained since. He became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States in 1982, and in 1990, he was made the first ''[[Linus Pauling]] Chair in Chemical Physics''.

Dr. Zewail has been nominated and will participate in President Barack Obama's Presidential Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). The council will talk about education, science, defense, energy, the economy, and technology.

== Research ==
Zewail's key work has been as the pioneer     of [[femtochemistry]]&mdash;i.e. the study of [[chemical reaction]]s across [[femtosecond]]s. Using a rapid [[ultrafast]] [[laser]] technique (consisting of [[ultrashort pulse|ultrashort]] laser flashes), the technique allows the description of reactions on very short time scales - short enough to analyse transition states in selected chemical reactions.

In 1999, Zewail became the third ethnic [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] to receive the [[Nobel Prize]], following Egyptian president [[Anwar Al-Sadat]] (1978 in Peace) and [[Naguib Mahfouz]] (1988 in Literature). Other international awards include the [[Wolf Prize]] in Chemistry (1993) awarded to him by the [[Wolf Foundation]], the Tolman Medal (1997), the [[Robert A. Welch Award]] (1997), and the [[Priestley Medal]] from the [[American Chemical Society]] in 2011.<ref>"Zewail Wins 2011 Priestley Medal", Chemical & Engineering News, p 5, June 21, 2010.</ref>  In 1999, he received Egypt's highest state honor, the [[Order of the Nile|Grand Collar of the Nile]].

Zewail was awarded a PHD Honoris Causa by [[Lund University]] in Sweden in May 2003 and is a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] awarded him an [[Honorary degree|Honorary]] [[Doctor of Science|Doctorate in Science]] in 2006. In May 2008, Zewail received a PhD Honoris Causa from [[Complutense University of Madrid]]. In February, 2009, Zewail was awarded an honorary PhD in arts and sciences by the [[University of Jordan]].<ref name="JT">{{cite web|url=http://jordantimes.com/?news=14610&searchFor=zewail|title=Egyptian Nobel laureate calls for ‘scientific renaissance’ in Arab world|last=Kheetan|first=Thameen|date=26 February 2009|work=Jordan Times|accessdate=2009-02-28}}</ref> In May 2010, he received a PhD Honoris Causa in Humane Letters from [[Southwestern University]].

Zewail is married, and has four children.

== Political work ==
In his June 4, 2009 speech at [[Cairo University]], US President [[Barack Obama]] announced a new Science Envoy program as part of a "new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world." In January, 2010 Ahmed Zewail, [[Elias Zerhouni]], and [[Bruce Alberts]] became the first US science envoys to Islam, visiting Muslim-majority countries from North Africa to Southeast Asia.<ref>[http://www.america.gov/st/scitech-english/2010/February/20100115082753lcnirellep0.1611902.html America.gov]</ref>

When asked about the rumors that he might run for Egyptian presidential election in 2011 and his political ambitions, Ahmed Zewail Said: "I am a frank man .. I have no political ambition, as I have stressed repeatedly that I only want to serve Egypt in the field of science and die as a scientist."<ref name="Zewail: I have no political ambitions ..
