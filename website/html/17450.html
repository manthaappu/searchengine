'''IDL''' ('''I'''nterface '''D'''escription '''L'''anguage) is a software [[interface description language]] (also referred to as  Interface Descriptor Language) created by [[William Wulf]] and John Nestor of [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and David Lamb of [[Queen's University, Canada]].

Like other interface description languages, IDL defined interfaces in a language- and machine- independent way, allowing the specification of interfaces between components written in different languages, and possibly executing on different machines using [[remote procedure calls]].
