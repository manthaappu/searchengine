A '''block-oriented terminal''' is a type of [[computer terminal]] that communicates with its host in blocks of data, usually chunks of text, as opposed to a [[character-oriented terminal]] that communicates with its host one character at a time. The [[IBM 3270]] is perhaps the most common implementation of a block-oriented terminal.

The host sends to the terminal a description of the fields to be displayed. The terminal processes and then displays the page. When the user submits data, like updates in a [[database]] entry, an entire field is sent to the host in one burst. This behavior has the advantage of causing less [[Load (computing)|system load]] on the host and less [[network traffic]] than [[character-oriented terminal]]s. They are also more responsive to the user, especially over slow connections, since editing within a field is done locally on the terminal itself.
