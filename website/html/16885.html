'''Home automation''' (also called '''domotics''') is the residential extension of "[[building automation]]". It is automation of the home, housework or household activity.  Home automation may include centralized control of lighting, [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilation and air conditioning), appliances, and other systems, to provide improved convenience, comfort, energy efficiency and security. [[Home automation for the elderly and disabled]] can provide increased quality of life for persons who might otherwise require caregivers or institutional care. 

A home automation system integrates electrical devices in a house with each other. The techniques employed in home automation include those in building automation as well as the control of domestic activities, such as [[home cinema|home entertainment systems]], [[houseplant]] and yard watering, pet feeding, changing the ambiance "scenes" for different events (such as dinners or parties), and the use of [[domestic robot]]s. Devices may be connected through a [[computer network]] to allow control by a [[personal computer]], and may allow remote access from the [[internet]]. 

Typically, a new home is outfitted for home automation during construction, due to the accessibility of the walls, outlets, and storage rooms, and the ability to make design changes specifically to accommodate certain technologies. Wireless systems are commonly installed when outfitting a pre-existing house, as they reduce wiring changes. These communicate through [[Power line communication|the existing power wiring]], [[radio]], or [[infrared]] signals with a central controller. Network sockets may be installed in every room like [[AC power]] receptacles. 

Although automated ''[[Home of the future|homes of the future]]'' have been staple exhibits for World's Fairs and popular backgrounds in science fiction, complexity, competition between vendors, multiple incompatible standards <ref>http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles%2F1995%2Fmar95%2Fpcn0323%2Fpcn0323.asp retrieved 2010 09 02</ref> and the resulting expense have limited the penetration of home automation to homes of the wealthy or ambitious hobbyists.

==Overview and benefits ==
In modern construction in industrialized nations, homes have been wired for electrical power, telephones, TV outlets (cable or antenna), and a doorbell. 

Many household tasks were automated by the development of special appliances.  For instance, automatic [[washing machine]]s were developed to reduce the manual labor of cleaning clothes, and [[water heater]]s reduced the labor necessary for [[bathing]].

Other traditional household tasks, like food preservation and preparation have been automated in large extent by [[Food processing|moving them into factory settings]], with the development of pre-made, [[convenience food|pre-packaged foods]], and in some countries, such as the United States, increased reliance on commercial food preparation services, such as [[fast food]] restaurants.  Volume and the factory setting allows forms of automation that would be impractical or too costly in a home setting.  Standardized foods enable possible further automation of handling the food within the home.

The use of gaseous or liquid fuels, and later the use of electricity enabled increased automation in heating, reducing the labor necessary to fuel [[stove|heaters]] and [[kitchen stove|stove]]s.  Development of [[thermostat]]s allowed more automated control of heating, and later cooling.  

A [[remote control]] for moving vessels and vehicles was first patented by [[Nikola Tesla]] in 1898.<ref name="tesla-tv">{{cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=0613809.PN.&OS=PN/0613809&RS=PN/0613809 |title=U.S. Patent 613809: Method of and apparatus for controlling mechanism of moving vessels and vehicles|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office |date=1898-11-08 |accessdate=2010-06-16}}</ref> 

World's Fairs in Chicago (1934),  New York (1939) and (1964–65)<ref name=Mann05>William C. Mann (ed.) ''Smart technology for aging, disability and independence : the state of the
science'',John Wiley and Sons, 2005 0-471-69694-3, pp. 34-66</ref> depicted electrified and automated homes.  In 1966 Jim Sutherland, an engineer working for Westinghouse Electric, developed a home automation system called "ECHO IV"; this was a private project and never commercialized.<ref>http://www.drdobbs.com/184404040;jsessionid=IM5NJPJYWXAOFQE1GHPCKH4ATMY32JVN

With the invention of the [[microcontroller]], the cost of electronic control fell rapidly. Remote and intelligent control technologies were adopted by the building services industry and appliance manufacturers worldwide, as they offer the end user easily accessible and/or greater control of their products.

As the number of controllable appliances in the home rises, the ability of these devices to interconnect and communicate with each other digitally becomes a useful and desirable feature. The consolidation of control or monitoring signals from appliances, fittings or basic services is an aim of home automation. 

In simple installations this may be as straightforward as turning on the lights when a person enters the room. In advanced installations, rooms can sense not only the presence of a person inside but know who that person is and perhaps set appropriate lighting, temperature, music levels or television channels, taking into account the day of the week, the time of day, and other factors.

Other automated tasks may include setting the [[air conditioning]] to an [[energy saving]] setting when the house is unoccupied, and restoring the normal setting when an occupant is about to return. More sophisticated systems can maintain an [[inventory]] of products, recording their usage through bar codes, or an [[RFID]] tag, and prepare a shopping list or even automatically order replacements.

Home automation can also provide a remote interface to home appliances or the automation system itself, via telephone line, wireless transmission or the internet, to provide control and monitoring via a [[smart phone]] or [[web browser]].

An example of a remote monitoring in home automation could be when a smoke detector detects a fire or smoke condition, then all lights in the house will blink to alert any occupants of the house to the possible fire. If the house is equipped with a [[home cinema|home theatre]], a home automation system can shut down all audio and video components to avoid distractions, or make an audible announcement. The system could also call the home owner on their mobile phone to alert them, or call the fire department or alarm monitoring company.

== System ==
{{prose|date=September 2010}}
The elements of a domotics system are:
* [[Programmable Logic Controller|hardware controllers]] or software controllers

There have been many attempts to standardise the forms of hardware, electronic and communication interfaces needed to construct a home automation system. Some standards use additional communication and control wiring, some embed signals in the existing [[Electric power transmission|power circuit]] of the house, some use [[Radio frequency|radio frequency (RF)]] signals, and some use a combination of several methods. Control wiring is hardest to retrofit into an existing house. Some appliances include USB that is used to control it and connect it to a domotics network. Bridges translate information from one standard to another, ''e.g.'', from X10 to European Installation Bus.

===Centralising control===
Besides the upcoming standardisation of home automation hardware, there is also the issue of the control software. In older systems (and some contemporary ones), the control of each home automation system needed to be done separately, and there was thus no central control system. This sometimes led to a great amount of remote controls, one being needed to control each individual part of the system. However, with the new generation of home automation systems, central control can be foreseen. Software such as [[Fast Track Team]] Home Personality Software Greeter 1.0 (aka "Cleopatra"),<ref>[http://www.electronichouse.com/article/an_avatar_is_born/C203/ Cleopatra]</ref>, [[e-Home Automation]], ... allows the control to happen from a single computer or television screen, and/or even from a smart phone (ie iPhone).<ref>[http://www.e-homeautomation.com E-home automation: centralised control, iPhone functionality]</ref>

== Tasks ==
=== HVAC ===
[[HVAC|Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC)]] solutions include temperature and [[humidity]] control. This is generally one of the most important aspects to a homeowner. An Internet-controlled [[thermostat]], for example, can both save money and help the environment, by allowing the homeowner to control the building's heating and air conditioning systems remotely. <!-- or you could just push down the temperature when you leave for vacation-->

=== Lighting ===
[[Lighting control system]]s can be used to control household electric lights. 
* Extinguish all the lights of the house
* Replace manual switching with Automation of on and off signals for any or all lights
* Regulation of electric illumination levels according to the level of ambient light available
* Change the ambient colour of lighting via control of [[LED]]s or electronic dimmers

Natural lighting control involves controlling window shades, LCD shades, draperies and awnings.

=== Audio and video  ===
This category includes audio and video switching and distribution.  Multiple audio or video sources can be selected and distributed to one or more rooms.

=== Security ===
Control and integration of [[security systems]]. 

With Home Automation, the consumer can select and watch [[cameras]] live from an Internet source to their home or business. Security cameras can be controlled, allowing the user to observe activity around a house or business right from a [[visual display unit|Monitor]] or [[touch panel]]. Security systems can include motion sensors that will detect any kind of unauthorized movement and notify the user through the security system or via cell phone. 

This category also includes control and distribution of security [[cameras]] (see [[surveillance]]).

* Detection of possible [[intrusion]]
** [[sensor]]s of detection of movement
** sensors of magnetic contact of [[door]]/[[window]]
** sensors of glass breaking
** sensors of pressure changes
* [[Simulation]] of presence.
* Detection of fire, gas leaks, water leaks (see [[fire alarm]] and [[gas alarm]])
* Medical [[alert]]. Teleassistance.
* Precise and safe closing of [[Window blind|blinds.]]

=== Intercoms ===
An [[intercom]] system allows communication via a [[microphone]] and [[loud speaker]] between multiple rooms. Integration of the [[intercom]] to the [[telephone]], or of the video door entry system to the television set, allowing the residents to view the door camera automatically.

=== Robotics ===
* Control of [[home robot]]s, using if necessary domotic [[electric beacon]].
* Home robot communication (i.e. using [[WiFi]]) with the domotic network and other home robots.

=== Other systems ===
[[File:Cat feeder.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A homemade Internet-enabled cat feeder.]]
Using special hardware, almost any device can be monitored and controlled automatically or remotely, including:

*[[Coffee pot]]
*[[Garage door]]
*Pet feeding and watering
*[[Irrigation sprinkler|Plant watering]]
*Pool pump(s) and heater, Hot tub and Spa
*[[Sump Pump]]

==Costs==
An automated home can be a very simple grouping of controls, or it can be heavily automated where any appliance that is plugged into electrical power is remotely controlled. Costs mainly include equipment, components, furniture, and custom installation.<ref name="Costs 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.totalavcontrol.co.uk |title=Home automation costs |publisher=Totalavcontrol.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-02-18}}</ref>  

Ongoing costs include electricity to run the control systems, maintenance costs for the control and networking systems, including troubleshooting, and eventual cost of upgrading as standards change.  Increased complexity may also increase maintenance costs for networked devices.

Learning to use a complex system effectively may take significant time and training.

Control system security may be difficult and costly to maintain, especially if the control system extends beyond the home, for instance by wireless or by connection to the internet or other networks.

== Smart Grid ==

Home automation technologies are viewed as integral additions to the [[Smart grid]]. The ability to control lighting, appliances, HVAC as well as [[Smart Grid]] applications (load shedding, demand response, real-time power usage and price reporting) <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.insteonsmartgrid.com/About-Us.html|accessdate= 2009-11-20| title= About Us|publisher=InsteonSmartGrid.com}}</ref> will become vital as Smart Grid initiatives are rolled out.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} Green Automation is the term coined to describe energy management strategies in home automation when data from smart grids is combined with home automation systems to use resources either at there cheapest prices or most available. For example taking advantage of high solar panel out put in the middle of the day to run washing machines automatically.
