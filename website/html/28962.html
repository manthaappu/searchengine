'''Peter Elias''' (November 23, 1923 – December 7, 2001) was a pioneer in the field of [[information theory]]. Born in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]], he was a member of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] faculty from 1953 to 1991.

In 1955, Elias introduced [[convolutional code]]s as an alternative to [[block code]]s. He also established the [[binary erasure channel]] and proposed [[list decoding]] of error-correcting codes as an alternative to unique [[Decoding methods|decoding]].

He died at 78 of [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]].
