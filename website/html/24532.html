'''MidnightBSD''' is a free [[Unix-like]], desktop-oriented [[operating system]] based on [[FreeBSD]] 6.1. It borrows heavily from the [[NEXTSTEP]] [[graphical user interface]].

== History and development ==
MidnightBSD began as a fork from [[FreeBSD]] in 2005.  The founder of the project, Lucas Holt, wished to create a BSD derived desktop operating system.  He was familiar with several live CD projects, but not the work on [[PC-BSD]] or [[DesktopBSD]].  At the same time, he also had an interest in [[GNUstep]].  The two ideas were folded into a plan to create a user friendly desktop environment.
MidnightBSD 0.1 was released based on the efforts of Lucas Holt, Caryn Holt, D. Adam Karim,  Phil Pereira of bsdnexus, and Christian Reinhardt.  This release features a modified version of the FreeBSD ports system.  The ports system evolved into "mports" which includes fake support, generation of packages before installation, license tagging, and strict rules about package list generation and modification of files outside the destination.  Many of these features were introduced in MidnightBSD 0.1.1.  

Christian Reinhardt replaced Phil Pereira as the lead "mports" maintainer prior to the release of MidnightBSD 0.1.  D. Adam Karim acted as the security officer for the first release.  All [[release engineering]] is handled by Lucas Holt.  

0.2 introduced a refined mports system with over 2000 packages.  The [[Portable C Compiler]] was added on i386 in addition to the [[GNU Compiler Collection]].   Other changes include enabling ipfw and sound card detection on startup, newer versions of many software packages including Bind, GCC, OpenSSH, and Sendmail, as well as a Live CD creation system.

Currently, the project is focusing on finishing the Magus build cluster software, creating a new installer, finishing the new package installation and management tools called mport, and beginning work on the 0.3 release.  The next release will feature some enhancements found in [[FreeBSD]] 7.0 and [[DragonFly BSD]].

== Etymology ==
MidnightBSD is named after Lucas and Caryn Holt's cat, Midnight.  Midnight is a ten pound black [[Turkish Angora]].

== License ==
MidnightBSD is released under several licenses. The kernel code and most newly created code is released under the two-clause [[BSD license]]. There are parts under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]], [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]], [[ISC license|ISC]],  and [[Beerware]] licenses, along with three- and four-clause BSD licenses.
