''AmigaOne''' is a series of [[computer platform]], intended to run [[AmigaOS]] [[AmigaOS 4.0|version 4.0]] created by [[Hyperion Entertainment]]. Earlier models were produced by [[Eyetech]], and were based on the [[Teron]] series of [[PowerPC]] POP [[Motherboard|mainboards]]. In January 2010, [[A-Eon Technology]] announced a new computer, the [[AmigaOne X1000]], which they have claimed will feature a dual core PowerPC motherboard, and is also intended to run AmigaOS 4.x.  It has been announced that the forthcoming AmigaOne X1000 will be distributed by AmigaKit.

==History==
Originally, AmigaOne was the name of a project for new [[Amiga]] hardware, managed by [[Eyetech]] and designed by the German company Escena GmbH. The AmigaOne motherboard was to be available in two models, the AmigaOne-1200 and the AmigaOne-4000. It was to have connectors for an optionally attached [[Amiga 1200]] or an [[Amiga 4000]] respectively, in order to use the old custom chips of an Amiga. This AmigaOne project was cancelled in 2001, mostly due to the inability to find or design a suitable [[Northbridge (computing)|northbridge]] chip.

After the Escena design was abandoned, Eyetech sought an alternative solution. The result was that in 2002 they decided to use the [[Teron CX]] PowerPC evaluation motherboard for a product named "AmigaOnepointfive" which eventually became the AmigaOne SE. Later, the [[Teron PX]] motherboard was marketed by Eyetech as the Amiga One XE, followed by the Teron Mini which was marketed as Micro-A1 (also known as µ-A1). The Teron is based on [[IBM]]'s PowerPC Open Platform specification, and uses the U-Boot firmware.

The main difference between the [[ATX]]-format AmigaOne SE and XE was that the AmigaOne SE had a soldered-on 600 MHz [[PowerPC G3#PowerPC 750CXe|PowerPC 750CXe]] processor, whereas the AmigaOne XE used a CPU board attached to a MegArray connector on the motherboard. While the MegArray connector is physically similar to the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Power Mac G4]] CPU daughtercard connector, it is not electrically compatible. There were [[PowerPC G3|G3]] and [[PowerPC G4|G4]] options with a maximum clock frequency of 800 MHz and 933 MHz. The G4 module originally used a Freescale [[PowerPC G4#PowerPC_7450_.22Voyager.22.2F.22V.27ger.22|7451]] processor which was later changed to a Freescale [[PowerPC G4#PowerPC 7445.2F7455 .22Apollo 6.22|7455]], both without level 3 cache. The G4 CPU runs hotter and requires a better heatsink than that supplied on some machines. Consequently, the G4 was often supplied underclocked to run at 800 MHz. In 2007 Acube offered 1.267 GHz 7457(See below). The last Teron motherboard used by Eyetech was the Teron Mini series of motherboards, which were somewhat similar to the Teron PX but made in a [[Mini-ITX]] formfactor and with some additions, such as onboard graphics, and a better [[PowerPC G3#PowerPC 750GX|750GX]] CPU. The Micro-A1 was announced in two configurations, under the Micro-A1 I (Industrial) and Micro-A1 C (Consumer) labels. Only the C configuration was produced.

Both AmigaOneG3-XE and AmigaOneG4-XE have four 32-bit PCI-slots (3x 33 MHz, 1x 66 MHz) and one AGP-2x slot. The Micro-A1 has only one 32-bit PCI-slot and an integerated Radeon 7000 via AGP with dedicated 32 MB VRAM.

When the AmigaOne boards first became available, OS4 was not ready: they were supplied with various Linux distributions. From April 2004 onwards, boards were shipped with a "developer prerelease" version of OS4.

The full version of OS4 was launched in early 2007 for AmigaOne computers only, with the [[PowerUP (accelerator)|PowerUP]] version being released in December 2007. [[AmigaOS 4.1]] for AmigaOne has been released on September 2008.

==Operating systems==
*Linux for PowerPC
*[[AmigaOS 4]] versions 4.0, 4.1.

==Current status==
MAI Logic Inc. went bankrupt, and consequently the supply of a major part for the Eyetech AmigaOnes dried up. Eyetech Group Ltd stopped the sales of the MicroA1 due to the naturally ensuing lack of bridge chips.

In January 2010, a new company, A-Eon, announced a new AmigaOne model, the [[AmigaOne X1000]].

==AmigaOne clones and compatibles==
The [[Sam440]] mainboard (complete with PPC CPU) is an embedded motherboard launched by [[Acube Systems]] in September 2007. [[AmigaOS 4]] was released for the Sam440 in October 2008.

In January 2009, [[AmigaOS 4]] was released for the [[Pegasos]] 2 (G3 and G4) computer platform.
