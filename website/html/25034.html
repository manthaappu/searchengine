<html> <head> <title>Monomial</title></head><body>In [[mathematics]],  in the context of [[polynomial]]s, the word '''monomial''' means one of two different things:
*The first meaning is a product of powers of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]], or formally any value obtained by finitely many multiplications of a variable. If only a single variable <math>x</math> is considered this means that any monomial is either 1 or a power <math>x^n</math> of <math>x</math>, with <math>n</math> a positive integer. If several variables are considered, say, <math>x</math>, <math>y</math>, <math>z</math>, then each can be given an exponent, so that any monomial is of the form <math>x^a y^b z^c</math> with <math>a,b,c</math> nonnegative integers (taking note that any exponent 0 makes the corresponding factor equal to 1). 
*The second meaning of monomial includes monomials in the first sense, but also allows multiplication by any constant, so that <math>-7x^5</math> and <math>(3-4i)x^4yz^{13}</math> are also considered to be monomials (the second example assuming polynomials in <math>x</math>, <math>y</math>, <math>z</math> over the complex numbers are considered). 

== Comparison of the one definitions ==
With either definition, the set of monomials is a subset of all polynomials that is closed under multiplication.

Both uses of this notion can be found, and in many cases the distinction is simply ignored, see for instance examples for the first<ref>{{cite book | last = Cox | first = David | authorlink = | coauthors = John Little, Donal O'Shea | title = Using Algebraic Geometry | publisher = Springer Verlag | date = 1998 | location = | pages = 1 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-387-98487-9 }}</ref> and second<ref>{{Springer|id=M/m064760|title=Monomial}}</ref> meaning, and an [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/Monomial.html unclear definition]. In informal discussions the distinction is seldom important, and tendency is towards the broader second meaning. When studying the structure of polynomials however, one often definitely needs a notion with the first meaning. This is for instance the case when considering a [[monomial basis]] of a [[polynomial ring]], or a [[monomial order]]ing of that basis. An argument in favor of the first meaning is also that no obvious other notion is available to designate these values (the term '''power product''' is in use, but it does not make the absence of constants clear either), while the notion ''term'' of a polynomial unambiguously coincides with the second meaning of monomial. For an isolated polynomial consisting of a single term, one could if necessary use the uncontracted form ''mononomial'', analogous to [[binomial]] and [[trinomial]]. 

''The remainder of this article assumes the first meaning of "monomial".''

==As bases==

The most obvious fact about monomials is that any polynomial is a [[linear combination]] of them, so they can serve as [[basis vector]]s in a [[vector space]] of polynomials - a fact of constant implicit use in mathematics.

==Number==
The number of monomials of degree ''d'' in ''n'' variables is the number of [[multicombination]]s of ''d'' elements chosen among the ''n'' variables (a variable can be chosen more than once, but order does not matter), which is given by the [[multiset coefficient]] <math>\textstyle{\left(\!\!{n\choose d}\!\!\right)}</math>. This expression can also be given in the form of a [[binomial coefficient]], as a [[polynomial expression]] in ''d'', or using a [[Pochhammer symbol#Alternate notations|rising factorial power]] of {{nowrap|''d'' + 1}}:
:<math>\left(\!\!{n\choose d}\!\!\right) = \binom{n+d-1}{d} = \binom{d+(n-1)}{n-1}
  = \frac{(d+1)\times(d+2)\times\cdots\times(d+n-1)}{1\times2\times\cdots\times(n-1)} = \frac{1}{(n-1)!}(d+1)^{\overline{n-1}}.</math>
The latter forms are particularly useful when one fixes the number of variables and lets the degree vary. From these expressions one sees that for fixed ''n'', the number of monomials of degree ''d'' is a polynomial expression in ''d'' of degree <math>n-1</math> with leading coefficient <math>\tfrac1{(n-1)!}</math>.

For example, the number of monomials in three variables (<math>n=3</math>) of degree ''d'' is <math>\textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}(d+1)^{\overline2} = \textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}(d+1)(d+2)</math>; these numbers form the sequence 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ... of [[triangular number]]s.

==Notation==

Notation for monomials is constantly required in fields like [[partial differential equation]]s. If the variables being used form an indexed family like <math>x_1</math>, <math>x_2</math>, <math>x_3</math>, ..., then ''[[multi-index notation]]'' is helpful: if we write 

:<math>\alpha = (a, b, c)</math>

we can define 
:<math>x^{\alpha} = x_1^a\, x_2^b\, x_3^c</math>

and save a great deal of space.

==Geometry==

In [[algebraic geometry]] the varieties defined by monomial equations <math>x^{\alpha} = 0</math> for some set of α have special properties of homogeneity. This can be phrased in the language of [[algebraic group]]s, in terms of the existence of a [[group action]] of an [[algebraic torus]] (equivalently by a multiplicative group of [[diagonal matrix|diagonal matrices]]). This area is studied under the name of ''[[Toric geometry|torus embedding]]s''.
