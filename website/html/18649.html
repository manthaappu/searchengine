<html> <head> <title>Integrated Nuclear Fuel Cycle Information System</title></head><body>'''Integrated Nuclear Fuel Cycle Information System (iNFCIS)''' is a set of databases related to the [[nuclear fuel cycle]] maintained by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA). The main objective of iNFCIS is to provide information on all aspects of nuclear fuel cycle to various researchers, analysts, energy planners, academicians, students and the general public. Presently iNFCIS includes several modules. iNFCIS requires free registration for on-line access.
==Background==
Nuclear fuel cycle consist of a number of steps which are critical in supporting a nuclear power programme. This included [[nuclear fuel|fuel]] supply related activities in the front end and used or spent fuel related activities in the back-end. Reliable and accurate statistical data on world wide nuclear fuel cycle activities is desired by the nuclear community for national policy making, international co-operation and studies pertaining to sustainable global energy futures.  
The IAEA provides up-to-date fuel cycle information to Member States, organizations and stakeholders, so as to understand, plan and develop nuclear fuel cycle programmes and activities. iNFCIS, a web based system comprising several nuclear fuel cycle related databases, is one source of such information.<ref>{{cite web

==Data sources==
IAEA over years has accumulated a large volume of data on nuclear fuel cycle activities through its regular technical meetings and publications, wherein contributions from Member States and leading international experts has been assimilated. IAEA had initiated electronic preservation of this data more than 20 years back, and since the last 10 years it has been made freely available through the public Internet. 
The data is regularly updated through direct inputs from the Member States, by consultants engaged by the IAEA or from open sources. All data is reviewed by consultants continuously to maintain high quality.

==Modules==
iNFCIS presently includes the follow databases and a simulation tool:

*The '''Nuclear fuel cycle information system''' (NFCIS) is a scenario based computer tool for the estimation of nuclear fuel cycle material and service requirements developed by the IAEA. NFCSS is developed based on a model designed to estimate long-term nuclear fuel cycle requirements and actinide arisings. 
*The '''World distribution of uranium deposits database''' (UDEPO) is an on-line database of uranium deposits around the world maintained by the IAEA.
*The '''Post irradiation examination facilities database''' (PIEDB) is a catalogue of hot laboratories maintained by the IAEA.
*The '''Minor actinide property database''' (MADB) is a bibliographic database of physico-chemical properties of selected [[minor actinide]] compounds and alloys.
*The '''Nuclear fuel cycle simulation system''' (NFCSS) is a scenario based tool to estimate material flow in the nuclear fuel cycle.
