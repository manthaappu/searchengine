<html> <head> <title>Structural complexity theory</title></head><body>In [[computational complexity theory]] of [[computer science]], the '''structural complexity theory''' or simply '''structural complexity''' is the study of [[complexity class]]es, rather than computational complexity of individual problems and algorithms. It involves the research of both internal structures of various complexity classes and the relations between different complexity classes.<ref name=jha>[[Juris Hartmanis]], "New Developments in Structural Complexity Theory" (invited lecture), Proc. 15th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming,  1988 (ICALP 88), ''[[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]]'', vol. 317 (1988), pp. 271-286.</ref>

The theory has emerged as a result of (still failing) attempts to resolve the first and still the most important question of this kind, the [[P = NP problem]]. Most of the research is done basing on the assumption of P != NP and on a more far-reaching conjecture that the [[polynomial time hierarchy]] of complexity classes is infinite.<ref name=jha/>

Major directions of research in this area include:<ref name=jha/>
*study of implications stemming from various unsolved problems about complexity classes
*study of various types of resource-restricted [[reduction (complexity)|reduction]]s and the corresponding [[complete language]]s
*study of consequences of various restrictions on and mechanisms of storage and access to data.
