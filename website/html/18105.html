<html> <head> <title>Independence system</title></head><body>In [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] mathematics, an '''independence system''' ''S'' is a pair (''E'', '''I'''), where ''E'' is a finite [[Set (mathematics)|set]] and '''I''' is a collection of [[subset]]s of ''E'' (called the '''independent sets''') with the following properties:
# The [[empty set]] is independent, i.e., ∅ ∈ '''I'''.  (Alternatively, at least one subset of ''E'' is independent, i.e., '''I''' ≠ ∅.)
# Every subset of an independent set is independent, i.e., for each ''E' '' ⊆ ''E'', ''E'' ∈ '''I''' → ''E' '' ∈ '''I'''.  This is sometimes called the '''hereditary property'''.

Adding the '''augmentation property''' or the '''independent set exchange property''' yields a [[matroid]].
