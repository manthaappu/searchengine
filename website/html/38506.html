In [[biological classification]], a '''type genus''' is a representative [[genus]], as with regard to a [[Family (biology)|biological family]]. The term and concept is used much more often and much more formally in [[zoology]] than it is in [[botany]], and the definition is dependent on the [[nomenclature Codes|nomenclatural ''Code'']] that applies:

* In [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|zoological nomenclature]], a type genus is "The nominal [[genus]] that is the [[name-bearing type]] of a nominal family-group taxon." 

* In [[botanical nomenclature]], the phrase  "type genus" is used, unofficially, as a term of convenience. In the ''[[ICBN]]'' this phrase has no status. Although the code also uses type specimens for ranks up to family (all ranks must bear the name of the genus in which their types are placed), but does not refer to the genus containing that type as a "Type genus". Names above the rank of family are not under any nomenclatural restriction according to the ICBN, except where it comes to their endings.

::Example: "''[[Vicia|Faba]]'' is the type genus of the family [[Fabaceae]]" is another way of saying that the family name Fabaceae is based on the generic name ''Faba''.
