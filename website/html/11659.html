'''ecto''' is a commercial [[weblog]] client for [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows]].   It allows one to compose and store blog entries on the local desktop computer, then upload them to a weblog host.  ecto interacts with popular server software such as [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]], [[Moveable Type]], and [[Wordpress]], among others.   The developer believes the additional flexibility of the desktop operating system allows the client to incorporate features lacking in web-based clients.<ref>[http://infinite-sushi.com/software/ecto/ Software website]</ref>  For example, ecto incorporates spell checking, easy insertion of images, and text formatting.  ecto employs the standard controls the operating system provides to all applications.   It can also [[trackback]] to other blogs and add categories and tags to a blog entry.  The Macintosh version integrates with [[iTunes]] and [[iPhoto]].

The Windows variant of ecto was reviewed at ''Reviewsaurus'', which despite noting ecto as one of the most respected blogging clients, gave it a more critical review for its lack of a single pane interface, and lack of FTP support.<ref>{{cite web
