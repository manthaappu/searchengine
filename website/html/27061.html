<html> <head> <title>Oblivious transfer</title></head><body>In [[cryptography]], an '''oblivious transfer''' protocol (often abbreviated '''OT''') is a type of protocol in which a sender transfers one of potentially many pieces of information to a receiver, but remains oblivious as to what piece (if any) has been transferred.

The first form of oblivious transfer was introduced in 1981 by [[Michael O. Rabin]]{{ref|Note1}}.  In this form, the sender sends a message to the receiver with [[probability]] 1/2, while the sender remains oblivious as to whether or not the receiver received the message.  Rabin's oblivious transfer scheme is based on the [[RSA]] cryptosystem.  A more useful form of oblivious transfer called '''1-2 oblivious transfer''' or "1 out of 2 oblivious transfer," was developed later by [[Shimon Even]], [[Oded Goldreich]], and [[Abraham Lempel]]{{ref|Note2}}, in order to build protocols for [[secure multiparty computation]]. It is generalized to "1 out of n oblivious transfer" where the user gets exactly one database element without the server getting to know which element was queried, and without the user knowing anything about the other elements that were not retrieved. The latter notion of oblivious transfer is a strengthening of [[private information retrieval]] where one does not care about database's privacy.

[[Claude Crépeau]] showed that Rabin's oblivious transfer is equivalent to 1-2 oblivious transfer.{{ref|Note3}}

Further work has revealed oblivious transfer to be a fundamental and important problem in cryptography.  It is considered one of the critical problems in the field, because of the importance of the applications that can be built based on it. In particular, it is a `complete' for [[secure multiparty computation]]: that is given an implementation of oblivious transfer it is possible
to securely evaluate any polynomial time computable function without any additional primitive.{{ref|Note4}}

==Rabin's oblivious transfer protocol==

In Rabin's oblivious transfer protocol, the sender generates an RSA public modulus ''N''=''pq'' where ''p'' and ''q'' are large [[prime number]]s, and an exponent ''e'' [[relatively prime]] to (''p''-1)(''q''-1).  The sender encrypts the message ''m'' as ''m''<sup>''e''</sup> mod ''N''.  

# The sender sends ''N'', ''e'', and ''m''<sup>''e''</sup> mod ''N'' to the receiver.
# The receiver picks a random ''x'' modulo ''N'' and sends ''x''<sup>2</sup> mod ''N'' to the sender. Note that gcd(''x,N'')=1 with overwhelming probability, which ensures that there are 4 square roots of ''x''<sup>2</sup> mod ''N''.
# The sender finds a square root ''y'' of ''x''<sup>2</sup> mod ''N'' and sends ''y'' to the receiver.

If the receiver finds ''y'' is neither ''x'' nor -''x'' modulo ''N'', the receiver will be able to [[integer factorization|factor]] ''N'' and therefore decrypt ''m''<sup>''e''</sup> to recover ''m'' (see [[Rabin encryption]] for more details).  However, if ''y'' is ''x'' or -''x'' mod ''N'', the receiver will have no information about ''m'' beyond the encryption of it.  Since every [[quadratic residue]] modulo ''N'' has four square roots, the probability that the receiver learns ''m'' is 1/2.

==1-2 oblivious transfer==

In a 1-2 oblivious transfer protocol, the sender has two messages ''m''<sub>0</sub> and ''m''<sub>1</sub>, and the receiver has a bit ''b'', and the receiver wishes to receive ''m''<sub>''b''</sub>, without the sender learning ''b'', while the sender wants to ensure that the receiver receive only one of the two messages.
The protocol of Even, Goldreich, and Lempel (which the authors attribute partially to [[Silvio Micali]]), is general, but can be instantiated using RSA encryption as follows.

==1-n oblivious transfer and k-n oblivious transfer==

A 1-n oblivious transfer protocol can be defined as a natural generalization of a 1-2 oblivious transfer protocol. Specifically, a sender has ''n'' messages, and the receiver has an index ''i'', and the receiver wishes to receive the ''i''-th among the sender's messages, without the sender learning ''i'', while the sender wants to ensure that the receiver receive only one of the ''n'' messages. Intuitively, it can also be considered as the effect of adding an additional database's privacy requirement to some existing [[private information retrieval]] protocol. 

The existence of 1-n oblivious transfer protocols from any private information retrieval protocol was first established by [[Giovanni Di Crescenzo]], [[Tal Malkin]] and [[Rafail Ostrovsky]] in [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/dicrescenzo00single.html]. Additional constructions of 1-n oblivious transfer protocols also related to private information retrieval, were proposed, e.g., by [[Moni Naor]] and [[Benny Pinkas]] [http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~bennyp/PAPERS/ot.ps], [[William Aiello]], [[Yuval Ishai]] and [[Omer Reingold]] [http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~reingold/publications/AIR.PS], [[Sven Laur]] and [[Helger Lipmaa]] [http://research.cyber.ee/~lipmaa/papers/ll07].

[[Gilles Brassard|Brassard]], [[Claude Crépeau|Crépeau]] and [[Jean-Marc Robert|Robert]] further generalized this notion to k-n oblivious transfer{{ref|Note5}}, wherein the receiver obtains a set of "k" messages from the "n" message collection.  The set of k messages may be received simultaneously ("non-adaptively"), or they may be requested consecutively, with each request based on previous messages received{{ref|Note6}}.

==Generalized oblivious transfer==
k-n Oblivious transfer is a special case of Generalized oblivious transfer, which was presented by Ishai and Kushilevitz in {{ref|Note7}}. In that setting, the sender has a set ''U'' of ''n'' messages, and the transfer constraints are specified by a collection ''A'' of permissible subsets of ''U''.
The receiver may obtain any subset of the messages in ''U'' that appears in the collection ''A''. The sender should remain oblivious of the selection made by the receiver, while the receiver cannot learn the value of the messages outside the subset of messages that he chose to obtain. The collection ''A'' is monotone decreasing, in the sense that it is closed under containment (i.e., if a given subset ''B'' is in the collection ''A'', so are all of the subsets of ''B'').
The solution proposed by Ishai and Kushilevitz uses parallel invocations of 1-2 oblivious transfer while making use of a special model of private protocols. Later on, other solutions that are based on secret sharing were published --- one by Bhavani Shankar, Kannan Srinathan, and C. Pandu Rangan in {{ref|Note8}}, and another by Tamir Tassa in {{ref|Note9}}.

==Origins==
In the early seventies [[Stephen Wiesner]] introduced a primitive called '''multiplexing''' in his seminal paper "Conjugate Coding",
which was the starting point of [[quantum cryptography]]{{ref|Note0}}. Unfortunately it took more than ten years to be published. Even though
this primitive was equivalent to what was later called ''1-2 oblivious transfer'', Wiesner did not see its application to cryptography.
