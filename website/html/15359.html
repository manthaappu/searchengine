<html> <head> <title>Global Explorer ROV</title></head><body>'''Global Explorer ROV''' is a unique deep water [[remotely operated vehicle]] that has made numerous dives below 9,000' on science and survey expeditions for [[National Geographic]], [[NOAA]] and other important research organizations. It was designed and developed by Deep Sea Systems Inc.<ref>[http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/02arctic/logs/sep5/sep5.html Getting to the Bottom...of Arctic Seafloor Communities] by Bodil Bluhm, September 5, 2002.</ref>

In August, 2007, Global Explorer ROV was instrumental in locating the [[USS Grunion]], which, with seventy men on board, disappeared during WWII and had been listed by the US Navy as "missing in action, cause unknown". The expedition to locate the submarine was financed and arranged by the family of the commander of the USS Grunion, Lt. Cmdr. [[Mannert L. Abele]].
