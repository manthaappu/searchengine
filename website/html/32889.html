'''SMX''' (from '''Server Macro Expansion''') is a [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] processing language designed to embed macros in web pages. Originally shipped with the popular Internet Factory's Commerce Builder software, it has been ported as an [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] module.

==Overview==
SMX was designed to embed macros in HTML/XML pages. It originally shipped with the Internet Factory's Commerce Builder software, a relatively popular web server in the early days of the Internet, due to the ease with which a developer could produce an [[e-commerce]] website.

Rather than re-implement websites in more popular languages, like [[Perl]] or [[PHP]], a small group of SMX fans decided to re-implement the language itself as an [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] module.

A good example of a macro is '''%counter()'''.  This embeds a simple incremental counter on an HTML page.  To include the results of a [[SQL]] query on a page, you can simply type '''%sql(<dsn>,<query>,%col(1)<br />)''' in the middle of an [[XHTML]] page.

Owing to the high-level nature of the language, SMX can greatly reduce the programming effort required to build dynamic or database-driven web sites.

==Syntax==
Unlike many programming languages, SMX syntax is simple and consistent.  All functions begin with a % sign, followed by the name of the function, followed either a single % sign or a parenthetical list of arguments.

Arguments can be quoted using double-quotes.  Backslashes can be used to escape commas and double-quotes.  A single quote at the beginning of an argument turns off interpretation of code in that argument (similar to [[LISP]]).

Everything that isn't code, is, by default, output.  To change this behavior, use the %nil or %null macros.

===Sample code===
====Hello World====
Here is a [[Hello World]] code example:

<pre><nowiki>
%expand%
Hello World!
</nowiki></pre>

Using variables to create output

<pre><nowiki>
%expand%
%set(name,World)
Hello %name%!
</nowiki></pre>
====Forms processing====

<pre><nowiki>
%expand%
%if(%form(expr)
    ,<p>Result is: %expr(%form(expr))</p>
)
<form action="%client-url%" method=post>
Simple math expression: <input name=expr>
</form>
</nowiki></pre>

====Page counter====

<pre><nowiki>
%expand%
%counter(hits) hits
</nowiki></pre>

====Database guestbook====
<pre><nowiki>
%expand%
%if(%not(%exists(/tmp/gbook.sq3))
        ,%sql(sqlite:/tmp/gbook.sq3,CREATE TABLE guests (name text, comment text))
)
%if(%and(%form(name),%form(comment))
    ,%sql(sqlite:/tmp/gbook.sq3,"INSERT INTO guests (name, comment) VALUES (%sqlq(%form(name)),%sqlq(%form(comment)))")
)
%sql(sqlite:/tmp/gbook.sq3,SELECT * FROM guests
        ,<p>%html-quote(%col(name)) said %html-quote(%col(comment))<hr>
         <p>
         <form action="%client-url%" method=post>
         <br>Name: <input name=name>
         <br>Comment: <input name=comment>
         <br><input type=submit>
         </form>
)
</nowiki></pre>
