The '''no-broadcast theorem''' is a result in [[quantum information science|quantum information theory]]. In the case of [[pure state|pure quantum states]], it is a [[theorem|corollary]] of the [[no cloning theorem]]: since [[quantum state]]s cannot be copied in general, they cannot be broadcast. For mixed states, it generalizes no-cloning.

The no-cloning theorem says that it is impossible to create two copies of a state given a single copy of the state. 

The no-broadcast theorem says that, given a single copy of a state, it is impossible to create a state such that one part of it is the same as the original state and the other part is also the same as the original state.  I.e., given an initial state <math>\rho_1</math> it is impossible to create a state <math>\rho_{AB}</math> such that <math>Tr_A\rho_{AB}=\rho_1</math> and <math>Tr_B\rho_{AB}=\rho_1</math>.  Although here we work with mixed states, a broadcasting machine would have to work on any pure state ensemble of <math>\rho_1</math>.
