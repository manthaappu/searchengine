<html> <head> <title>Conference on Automated Deduction</title></head><body>The '''Conference on Automated Deduction''' ('''CADE''') is the premier [[academic conference]] on [[Automated theorem proving|automated deduction]] and related fields. The first CADE was organized in 1974 at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]] near [[Chicago]]. Most CADE meetings have been held in [[Europe]] and the [[USA]]. However, conferences have been held all over the world. Since 1996, CADE has been held yearly, and since 2001 it has occasionally merged with other conferences to form the  [[International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning]] (IJCAR).

In 1996, CADE Inc. was formed as a non-profit sub-corporation of the [[Association for Automated Reasoning]] to organize the previously individually organized conferences.
