== Introduction ==

As it is defined in [[the Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]]:<ref name="CDP">
R. Audi (general editor). The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, second edition; Cambridge University Press 1999.</ref> "''Paradigm, as used by Thomas Kuhn ([[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]], 1962), a set of scientific and metaphysical beliefs that make up a theoretical framework within which scientific theories can be tested, evaluated and if necessary revised''."

Triune Continuum Paradigm is a paradigm for general system modeling in the sense of this definition.<ref name="AN08">A. Naumenko. [http://www.triunecontinuum.com/documents/Naumenko-TCP-Encyclopedia-08.pdf "Triune Continuum Paradigm"], in ''Encyclopedia of Information Science and Technology'', second edition, Vol. VIII, pp. 3821-3825; M. Khosrowpour (Ed.), Information Science Reference, IGI Global, September 2008. ISBN 978-1-60566-026-4.</ref> The paradigm defines a set of scientific foundations (principles) within which [[Conceptual framework|conceptual frameworks]] used for system modeling in different contexts can be built, tested, evaluated and if necessary revised. 

Thus, for an existent modeling framework, the paradigm allows to test the framework against its principles and to show the framework's deficiencies (if any), explaining how to fix the deficiencies in a possible revision of the framework. And if the goal is to build a new system modeling framework, then the paradigm provides its guidelines on how to do it assuring the resulting quality of the framework. 

According to Herrera et al.,<ref name="SIH05">S.I. Herrera, M.M. Clusella, G.N. Tkachuk, P.A. Luna. [https://dspace.jaist.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/10119/3844/1/20172.pdf "How System Models Contributes to the Design of Information Systems"], Proceedings of the First World Congress of the International Federation for Systems Research (IFSR 2005): The New Roles of Systems Sciences For a Knowledge-based Society; Kobe, Japan, November 2005.</ref> Triune Continuum Paradigm is a complete theoretical base that can be used for building or for improvement of modern modeling frameworks that are employed for system modeling in different contexts, in particular in [[software development]] and in the engineering of [[enterprise information systems]].

== Foundations and their implications ==
The Triune Continuum Paradigm is based on the three theories: on [[semantic theory of truth|Tarski's Theory of Truth]], on [[Ramified Theory of Types|Russell's Theory of Types]] and on the Theory of Triune Continuum.<ref name="AN05">A. Naumenko. [http://www.triunecontinuum.com/documents/Naumenko-PHISE-05.pdf "A report on the Triune Continuum Paradigm and on its foundational theory of Triune Continuum"], ''PHISE'05, the 1-st International Workshop on Philosophical Foundations of Information Systems Engineering. Proceedings of the CAiSE'05 Workshops'', Vol. 2, pp. 439-450; J. Castro, E. Teniente (Eds.); Porto, Portugal, June 2005. FEUP edições. ISBN 972-752-077-4.</ref> The three theories were applied for the case of general system modeling, which produced the corresponding three principles that compose the paradigm:<ref name="AN08"></ref> 
* The first principle assures ''coherency'' and ''unambiguity'' within modeling interpretations of a single modeling framework.
* The second principle assures ''internal consistency'' of descriptions and specifications that are constructed with the aid of a modeling framework.
* The third principle allows to introduce and to justify the minimal set of modeling concepts that is ''necessary'' and ''sufficient'' to cover the representation scope of a modeling framework on the most abstract level (on the level that corresponds to the first order propositions in Russell's Theory of Types).

== Applications of the paradigm ==
The Triune Continuum Paradigm can be applied in practice either to improve an existing system modeling framework or to design a new system modeling framework for a given purpose.

The paradigm was applied in the domain of [[Software engineering|software]] and [[systems engineering]], in particular, to formalize foundations of [[RM-ODP]] conceptual framework.<ref name="ANAW07">A. Naumenko, [[Alain Wegmann|A. Wegmann]]. "Formalization of the RM-ODP foundations based on the Triune Continuum Paradigm", ''Computer Standards & Interfaces'', Volume 29, Issue 1, pp. 39-53, Elsevier B.V., 2007. ISSN: 0920-5489. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csi.2005.10.001 10.1016/j.csi.2005.10.001]</ref> As it was described by Dijkman,<ref name="RMD06">R.M. Dijkman. [http://doc.utwente.nl/51104/1/thesis_Dijkman.pdf ''Consistency in multi-viewpoint architectural design'']. PhD thesis 06-80, Centre for Telematics and Information Technology, University of Twente, 2006. Page 16.</ref> Naumenko in 2002 defined an abstract syntax for RM-ODP in a language called [[Alloy (specification language)|Alloy]] that uses a set theoretic [[formal semantics]].  

The paradigm was also applied to define a formal metamodel for [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]].<ref name="ANAW02">A. Naumenko, [[Alain Wegmann|A. Wegmann]]. "A Metamodel for the Unified Modeling Language". ''"UML" 2002 - The Unified Modeling Language: Model Engineering, Concepts, and Tools. The 5th International Conference''; pp. 2-17.; J.-M. Jézéquel, H. Hussmann, S. Cook (Eds.); Dresden, Germany, September/October 2002. LNCS 2460. Springer-Verlag 2002. ISBN 3-540-44254-5. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-45800-X_2 10.1007/3-540-45800-X_2]</ref> According to Lano,<ref name="KL06">K. Lano. [http://modeva.itee.uq.edu.au/accepted_papers/paper_4_3.pdf "Using B to verify UML Transformations"], Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Model design and Validation (MODEVA 2006), B. Baudry, D. Hearnden, N. Rapin, J. G. Süß (Eds.), pp. 46-61; Genova, Italy, October 2006.</ref> the lack of grounded interpretation for UML concepts was identified in this application.

The application for RM-ODP was employed in the definition of SEAM method for [[Enterprise Architecture]] allowing for enterprise modeling in which all the systems are systematically represented with the same modeling ontology.<ref name="AWLLGRBW07">[[Alain Wegmann|A. Wegmann]], L.-S. Lê, G. Regev, B. Wood. "Enterprise modeling using the foundation concepts of the RM-ODP ISO/ITU standard".
