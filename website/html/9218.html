'''DansGuardian''', written by [[SmoothWall|SmoothWall Ltd]] and others, is [[content-control software]]: software designed to control which websites users can access. It also includes virus filtering and usage monitoring  features. DansGuardian must be installed on a [[Unix]] or [[GNU/Linux]] computer, such as a server computer; its filtering extends to all computers in an organization, including [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Mac OS X|Macintosh]] computers. DansGuardian is used by schools, businesses, value-added [[Internet service provider]]s, and others.<ref>[http://dansguardian.org/?page=whousesit "Who Uses DansGuardian?"]</ref>

== Features ==
=== Virus filtering ===

DansGuardian can use [[ClamAV]] to scan for, and block, [[computer virus|viruses]], in the files that users download.

=== Usage monitoring ===

DansGuardian saves log files showing who has visited which webpage.  These files can be reviewed manually or with the help of [[log analysis]] software.

=== Open source ===

DansGuardian is one of the few widely used content control systems that makes its [[source code]] available, thus avoiding some of the criticisms associated with content control system proxies being "[[Black box (systems)|black box]]" systems.

== Technical details ==
DansGuardian is distributed under the [[GPLv2]] free software license, and written using the [[C++]] programming language. It primarily runs in [[GNU/Linux]] and other [[Unixes]]. It is entirely command line and web-based, and meant to be used in conjunction with a web proxy such as [[Squid cache|Squid]]. The [[Ubuntu Christian Edition]] GNU/Linux distribution includes a graphical user interface (GUI) tool for configuring DansGuardian, but the tool does not work as well as the configuration tools included with [[SmoothWall]] Guardian, and other web filters. Although there is a graphical user interface available for Ubuntu, called WebContentControl, which installs and configures DansGuardian, [[FireHol]] and [[TinyProxy]] easily.<ref>[https://launchpad.net/webcontentcontrol/ WebContentControl Website]</ref>

== Legal details ==

In the [[United States]], DansGuardian satisfies the requirements of [[Children's Internet Protection Act]].

== Proprietary versions ==

Two proprietary versions of DansGuardian exist; SmoothGuardian is a module for [[SmoothWall]] Limited Firewalls, and SmoothWall Network Guardian is a stand-alone product.<ref>[http://www.smoothwall.net SmoothWall Limited]</ref>  The SmoothWall implementation of DansGuardian represents a [[Becta]] certified web filtering system.<ref>[http://localauthorities.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=pf&catcode=ls_pict_08&rid=13219 Becta Accredited Suppliers]</ref>

== Forks ==

There is now a fork of Dansguardian Project called MinD. Its name is a recursive acronym for MinD is not Dansguardian. The "Toy" version of MinD is a fork of Dansguardian Project version 2.10.1.1 with some improvements.
