{{compactTOC2}}

==A==
* '''Abstract''' - An indicator applied to a [[classifier]] (e.g., [[Actor (UML)|actor]], [[Class (computer science)|class]], [[use case]]) or to some features of a classifier (e.g., a class's operations) showing that the feature is incomplete and is intended not to be instantiated, but to be specialized by other definitions.
* '''[[Abstraction (computer science)|Abstract class]]''' - A class that does not provide a complete declaration, perhaps because it has no implementation method identified for an operation. By declaring a class as ''abstract'', one intends to prohibit direct instantiation of the class. An abstract class cannot directly instantiate [[Object (computer science)|object]]s; it must be inherited from before it can be used.
*[[Abstract data type]]
* '''Abstract operation''' - Unlike attributes, class operations can be abstract, meaning that there is no provided implementation. Generally, a class containing an abstract operation should be marked as an abstract class.  An Operation must have a method supplied in some specialized Class before it can be used.
* '''Abstraction''' is the process of picking out common features and deriving essential characteristics from [[Object (computer science)|object]]s and [[procedure]] [[entity|entities]] that distinguish it from other kinds of entities. 
* '''Action''' - An action is the fundamental unit of behaviour specification and represents some transformation or processing in the modeled system, such as invoking a method of a class or a sub activity
* '''Action sequence''' - 
* '''Action state''' - 
* '''Action steps''' - 
* '''Activation''' - the time during which an object has a method executing. It is often indicated by a thin box or bar superimposed on the Object's lifeline in a Sequence Diagram
* '''[[Activity diagram]]''' - a diagram that describes procedural logic, business process or work flow. An activity diagram contains a number of Activities and connected by Control Flows and Object Flows.
* '''Active class''' - a [[Class (computer science)|class]] defining active objects
* '''Active object''' - an [[Object (computer science)|object]] running under its own [[Thread (computer science)|thread]]
* '''Activity''' - carrying out behaviour in a [[State diagram|State machine diagram]]
** '''Do''' - a type of Activity which may be interrupted, as opposed to normal Activities which may not be interrupted
** '''Internal''' - an Activity that is executed within a State
*** '''Entry''' - an Activity that is executed when a State is entered
*** '''Exit''' - an Activity that is executed when a State is exited
* '''Activity final''' - the end point of an [[activity diagram]]. When a thread reaches an Activity Final node, all the threads of the activity terminate. (Contrast with Flow Final node, which marks the end of one thread.)
* '''[[Actor (UML)|Actor]]''' - a [[role]] that a [[User (computing)|user]] takes when invoking a [[use case]]. Also see [[actor modeling]].
* '''[[Object composition#Aggregation|Aggregation]]''' - a special type of association used to represent a stronger relationship between two classes than a regular association; typically read as "owns a", as in, "Class A owns a Class B".  A [[hierarchy]] of [[Class (computer science)|class]]es where the child [[Object (computer science)|object]] may or may not continue to exist if the parent object is destroyed; see 'composition'
* '''Artifact''' - items that model physical pieces of information in your system, such as a user's manual, training material, or password file
* '''[[Association (object-oriented programming)|Association]]''' - a relationship with 2 or more ends, where each end is on a class (or other classifier). Each end is called a Role, and may have a role name, Multiplicity, and may be Navigable.
* '''Association class''' - a [[Class (computer science)|class]] that describes an association.
* '''Asynchronous''' - The sender of an asynchronous message does not wait for a response.
* '''[[attribute (computing)|Attribute]]''' - a significant piece of data owned by a Class, often containing values describing each instance of the class. Besides the attribute name and a slot for the attribute value, an attribute may have specified Visibility, Type, Multiplicity, Default value, and Property-string.

{{compactTOC2}}

==C==

* '''Call''' - 
* '''Cardinality''' - the current number of occurrences of a Property. The cardinality must be a value that is allowed by the multiplicity
* '''Child''' - 
* '''[[Class (computer science)|Class]]''' - the primary declarative construct of [[Object-Oriented Programming]]; a cohesive unit of Attributes and Operations; a compile-time template for an Object
* '''[[Class diagram]]''' - a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes and the relationships between the classes.
* '''[[classifier (UML)|Classifier]]''' - a category of UML elements that have some common features, such as attributes or methods.
* '''Client''' - 
* '''Collaborate''' - 
* '''[[Communication diagram]]''' 
* '''Component''' - A component represents a software module (source code, binary code, executable, DLL, etc.) with a well-defined interface. The interface of a component is represented by one or several interface elements that the component provides. Components are used to show compiler and run-time dependencies, as well as interface and calling dependencies among software modules. They also show which components implement a specific class.
* '''[[Component diagram]]''' 
* '''[[Composite structure diagram]]''' 
* '''[[Object composition|Composition]]''' - a specific type of relationship describing how one Object is ''composed of'' another Object; a form of [[Aggregation]] where the child [[Object (computer science)|object]] is destroyed if the parent object is destroyed.
* '''Condition''' - 
* '''Connection''' - 
* '''Constraint''' - natural language, programming language or Object Constraint Language boolean condition which may not be false if a Class is to be considered valid
* '''Containment''' - containment by value and containment by reference. Containment by value implies that an object contains another object; containment by reference implies that an object contains a pointer to another object.

{{compactTOC2}}

==D==
* '''Decision''' - a point in an [[Activity diagram]] where a Flow splits into several, mutually exclusive, Guarded flows. A Merge marks the end of the optional behaviour started by the Decision
* '''[[Dependency (UML)|Dependency]]''' - a dependency exists between two defined elements if a change to the definition of one would result in a change to the other. In UML this is indicated by a line pointing from the dependent to the independent element.
* '''[[Deployment diagram]]''' 
* '''Derived property''' - a property that can be calculated or inferred from other properties
* '''Diagram''' - a visual representation of a subset of features of a UML Model
* '''Directed relationship''' - 
* '''Domain''' - a logical grouping that explicitly declares a [[rule]] which defines ownership of [[object]]s based upon some [[Data type|type]] or [[property]].

==E==
* '''Edge''' - a synonym for Flow
* '''Entity''' - 
* '''[[Enumeration]]''' - a set of constant values for a new data type

* '''Fork''' - a point in an [[Activity diagram]] where a Flow of logic splits into several concurrent Flows (Threads)
* '''Found Message''' - starting point for a [[Sequence diagram]]

{{compactTOC2}}

==G==
* '''[[Generalization]]''' - a relationship between a ''specific classifier'' (typically a [[Class (computer science)|class]]) to a more ''general classifier'' asserting that the ''general classifer'' contains common features among both the ''specific classifier'' and the ''general classifier''.  Features include, for example, properties, and constraints. The use of generalization is often logically restricted to cases where the specific classifier is a "kind-of" or "sort-of" the general classifier: for example, a Boxer is a "kind-of" Dog.  When the classifiers involved are [[software engineering]] classes, generalization usually involves reusing code; it is often implemented using [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]], where the more specific code reuses the more general code.
* '''Generalization Tree''' - Several specialized classifiers may point to the same general classifier, forming a generalization tree, where the general classifer contains common features shared by all the specialized versions. As generalization is a relationship, it is possible for a classifer to participate in several generalizations, often being on the specific end or on the general end, forming a [[directed acyclic graph]] (DAG) (i.e., no loops). 
* '''Generic''' - 
* '''Guard''' - a [[Boolean logic|boolean]] test that must be satisfied for a Flow of an [[activity diagram]] or a Transition of a [[State diagram|state machine diagram]] to be allowed to start

==H==

* '''History pseudostate''' - points to the initial [[State (computer science)|state]] of an [[Object (computer science)|object]] where no previous state history was saved

==I==

* '''[[Interface (computer science)|Interface]]''' - a defined communication boundary.

{{compactTOC2}}

==L==
* '''Lifeline''' - indicates a participating Object or Part in a [[Sequence diagram]]. The Lifeline may show activation, Object creation, and Object deletion.   
* '''Link''' - a relationship between objects. While an Object is an instantiation of a Class a Link can be seen as an instantiation of an Association. 

==M==
* '''Merge''' - a point in an [[Activity diagram]] marking the end of the optional behavior started by a Decision
* '''Message''' - a signal from one object (or similar entity) to another, often with parameters. Often implemented as a call to a Method, including the Constructor and Destructor, of an Object in a [[Sequence diagram]].

* model - 
* [[Model-driven architecture]] (MDA) - 
* '''[[Multiplicity (UML)|Multiplicity]]''' - a specification of the number of possible occurrences of a property, or the number of allowable elements that may participate in a given relationship.  In UML 1.x, it was also possible to have a discrete list of values, but this was eliminated in UML 2.0.
** '''Mandatory''' - A required multiplicity, the lower bound is at least one, usually 1..1 or 1 
** '''Optional'''  - The lower bound is at most zero, usually, 0..1
** '''Many'''      - A multiplicity with no upper limit, either 0..* or *
** '''Forbidden''' - No elements allowed, 0..0 (in UML 2.2)

{{compactTOC2}}

==N==

* '''Navigable''' - the ability for objects of a Class at one end of an Association to retrieve Objects from the other end. Associations need not be navigable.
* '''Node''' - 
* '''Note''' - It is an explanatory part of UML models. A note is a symbol for rendering constraints and comments attached to an element. 

==O==
* '''Object''' - a runtime instance of a Class. Objects are rarely shown on diagrams (because there are usually too many) unless they are used to illustrate some scenario, test, etc. Such Objects are often shown with the Attributes of the Class populated with sample data
* '''[[Object Constraint Language]] (OCL)''' - a declarative language for describing rules and constraints that apply to UML models 
* '''[[Object diagram]]''' 
* '''Operation''' - the signature of a Method of a Class; consists of the Operation Name, Visibility, Parameter list, Return Type, and Property-string

** '''loop''' - the fragment iterates according to a [[guard condition]]. 
** '''neg''' - an invalid interaction.
** '''opt''' - single alternative with a [[guard condition]]. 
** '''par''' - each fragment is run in parallel.

** private (-): available only within the Class in which it was defined. This is the most limited visibility
** protected (#): available within the Class in which it was defined, and within any subclass of this class
** package (~): available only within the Package which directly contains the defining Class
