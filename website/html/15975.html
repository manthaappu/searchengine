H1ghlander competed in the 2005 [[DARPA Grand Challenge]] on October 8, qualifying in the pole position and finished in 7 hours and 14 minutes, placing 3rd out of the five vehicles to complete the 132 mile (212 km) course.

==Cultural references==
The Hummer driven by Denzel Washington in the movie ''[[Déjà Vu (2006 film)|Déjà Vu]]'' was heavily based on H1ghlander, sharing a similar gimbal dome on the top, SICK laser sensors in the same positions, a camera tube on the side of the vehicle, and many other visual similarities.
