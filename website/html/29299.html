When a [[programming language]] is originally designed without any syntax to nest function calls, '''pipeline programming''' is a simple syntax change to add it.  The programmer connects notional program modules into a flow structure, by analogy to a physical pipeline carrying reaction products through a [[chemical plant|chemical]] or other plant.  The best-known example is the [[pipeline (Unix)|UNIX pipe system]], but many high level software design tools (such as the [[openDX]] display suite) provide a [[GUI]] pipeline programming tool that helps visualize data flow through the program.  A [[Data Flow Diagram]] (DFD) maps well to pipeline programming. Note that exception handling can be one of the weak points{{Clarify|date=May 2010}}.
