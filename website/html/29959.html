<html> <head> <title>Principle of rationality</title></head><body>In the context of [[knowledge-based systems]], Newell (in 1982) proposed the following '''principle of rationality''':

: "If an agent has knowledge that one of its actions will lead to one of its goals, then the agent will select that action."

This principle is employed by agents at the [[knowledge level]] to move closer to a desired goal.
