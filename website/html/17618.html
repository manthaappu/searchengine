The '''Input-Process-Output Model''' also known as the ''IPO+S Model'' is a [[functional model]] and [[conceptual schema]] of a general [[system]]. An IPO chart identifies a programâ€™s inputs, its outputs, and the processing steps required to transform the inputs into the outputs.

== Overview ==
The IPO model has many interdisciplinary applications, and is used to convey systems [[fundamentals]] in [[Information Technology|IT]] overview [[education]] and as a brainstorming, preliminary investigation tool in [[systems development process]]es such as the [[Systems Development Life Cycle|SDLC]]. It consists of at least three, and sometimes four, distinct components.  In contemporary [[Information Technology]], it is almost always discussed as a four component model in which the fourth is a named optional.

The components of the IPO model are defined as:
* I: [[Input/output|Input]] - The information, ideas, and resources used
* P: [[Processing]] - Actions taken upon/using input or stored material
* O: [[Output]] - Results of the processing that then exit the system
* S: [[Computer storage|Storage]] - Location(s) where material inside the system is/are placed for possible use at a later time

== Sub-components ==
Sub-components of a system can also have their own set of inputs and outputs that may differ from those of the larger system.  Typically, outputs of a subcomponent are either input for another sub-component or become part of the ultimate output of the larger system.  Whether or not a system is being considered at the [[macroscopic|macro]] or [[micro]] level determines what a specific item in a system is considered, and this variable level of detail is referred to as [[Scope (programming)|scope]].  [[Explicit]] discussions on scope are more common in a technological discussion as sub-units are considered more discretely in the [[natural sciences]].  In [[ecosystems]], for example, sub-units are  impacts as opposed to [[Object (computer science)|object]]s, [[Namespace (computer science)|namespaces]], [[Method (computer science)|method]]s, and [[Scale (computing)|scale]].  Exceptions to this convention are when [[Nominal data|nominal]] [[data point]]s must be encoded for a [[scientific model]] simulation.
