<html> <head> <title>Wristwatch computer</title></head><body>A '''wristwatch computer''' is a [[wearable computer]] that fits like a wristwatch. It may offer features similar to a [[PDA]], [[palmtop]] or [[tablet computer]]. Similar terms which refer to the same concept are '''wrist computer''', '''computer watch''', '''wrist-top''', '''wrist PDA''' and '''Wrist Worn PC''' ('''WWPC''').

Such devices may include features such an [[accelerometer]], [[thermometer]],  [[altimeter]], [[barometer]], [[compass]], [[chronograph]], [[dive computer]], [[calculator]], [[cell phone]], [[GPS]], [[graphical display]], [[Computer speaker|speaker]], [[scheduler]], [[watch]], etc. It may communicate with a [[wireless headset]], [[heads-up display]], [[insulin pump]], [[microphone]], [[modem]], or other external device.

Any [[computer]] has a data processor, memory, input and output. It may collect information from internal or external sensors. It may control, or retrieve data from, other instruments or computers. It may support wireless technologies like [[Bluetooth]], [[WiFi]], and [[GPS]]. However, it is possible a "wristwatch computer" may just serve as a front end for a remote system, as in the case of watches utilizing cellular technology or WiFi.

==1970s-1980s==
[[Seiko]], a Japanese watch company, was one of the first to develop wrist computing technology. The first digital watch, which debuted in 1972, was the [[Pulsar (watch)|Pulsar]] manufactured by [[Hamilton Watch Company]]. "Pulsar" became a brand name which would later be acquired by Seiko in 1978. In 1982, a Pulsar watch (NL C01) was released which could store 24 digits, making it most likely the first watch with user-programmable memory, or "memorybank" watch.<ref name="history">{{Cite web|last=Doensen|first=Pieter |title=Q.5 Watches with Memory and Database|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~doensen/q5.html|work=WATCH. History of the modern wrist watch. Pieter Doensen. |accessdate=17 September 2010}}</ref>   With the introduction of personal computers in the 1980s, Seiko began to develop watches with computing ability. The '''Data 2000''' watch (1983) came with an external keyboard for data-entry. Data was synced from the keyboard to the watch via electro-magnetic coupling (wireless docking). The name stems from its ability to store 2000 characters.<ref name="seiko"/> The '''D409''' was the first Seiko model with on-board data entry (via a miniature keyboard) and featured a [[dot matrix]] display.<ref name="seiko">{{Cite web|title=Seiko Computer Watch Fun|url=http://pocketcalculatorshow.com/nerdwatch/fun2.html|accessdate=17 September 2010}}</ref> Its memory was tiny, at only 112 digits.<ref name="history"/> It was released in 1984 in gold, silver and black.<ref>{{Cite web|title=SEIKO D-409|url=http://www.digitalwatchlibrary.com/DWL/1work/seiko-d409-5009/|publisher=Digital Watch Library}}</ref> These models were followed by many others by Seiko during the 1980s, most notably the "RC Series":

===Seiko RC series===
The '''RC-1000 Wrist Terminal''' was the first Seiko model to interface with a computer, and was released in 1984.<ref name="seiko"/> It was compatible with most of the popular PCs of that time, including Apple II,II+ and IIe, the Commodore 64, IBM PC, NEC 8201, Tandy Color Computer, Model 1000, 1200, 2000 and TRS-80 Model I, III, 4 and 4p.

The '''RC-20 Wrist Computer''' was released in 1985.<ref name="seiko"/> It had a SMC84C00 8-bit Z-80 microprocessor; 8K of ROM and 2K of RAM. It had applications for scheduling, memos, and world time and a four-function calculator app. The dot-matrix LCD displayed 42x32 pixels, and more importantly, was touch-sensitive. Like the RC-1000, it could be connected to a personal computer, in this case through a proprietary cable. It was also notable in that it could be programmed, although its small display and limited storage severely limited application development.<ref name="seiko"/>

The '''RC-4000 PC Datagraph''' also released in 1985, was dubbed the "world's smallest computer terminal".<ref name="seiko"/> It had 2K of storage. The '''RC-4500''' (1985), also known as the WristMac, had the same features as the RC-4000, but came in a variety of bright, flashy colors.

===Other brands===

During the 1980s, Casio began to market a successful line of "computer watches", in addition to its [[calculator watch]]es. Most notable was the [[Casio data bank]] series. There was also the [[Nelsonic game watch]]es and many other novelty "game watches" produced by Casio and other companies.

==Linux watch==
In June 2000, [[IBM]] displayed a prototype for a wristwatch that ran [[Linux]]. The original version had only 6 hours of battery life, which was later extended to 12.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Shankland  |first=Stephen|title= IBM clocks in with new Linux watch|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1040-254658.html|accessdate=15 September 2010|newspaper=[[Cnet.com]]|date=23 March 2001 }}</ref> It featured 8MB of memory and ran Linux 2.2.<ref name="IBM">{{Cite web|title=  Linux on a Wrist Watch|url=http://researchweb.watson.ibm.com/WearableComputing/linuxwatch/lcdwatch/factsheet.html|publisher=IBM|accessdate=15 September 2010}}</ref> The device was later upgraded with an accelerometer, vibrating mechanism, and fingerprint sensor. IBM began to collaborate with [[Citizen Watch Co.]] to create the "WatchPad". The WatchPad 1.5 features 320 x 240 [[QVGA]] display and runs Linux 2.4.<ref name="watchpad">{{Cite web|title=WatchPad 1.5 |url=http://www.trl.ibm.com/projects/ngm/index_e.htm|publisher=IBM|accessdate=15 September 2010}}</ref> It also features calender software, [[bluetooth]], 8MB of DRAM and 16MB of flash memory.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kanellos  |first=Michael|title= Linux watch: Only time will tell|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1040-274286.html&tag=cd_pr|accessdate=15 September 2010|newspaper=[[Cnet.com]]|date=11 October 2001}}</ref><ref name="PCWORLD">{{Cite news|last=Miyake|first=Kuriko |title=Is That a PC on Your Wrist?|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/65623/is_that_a_pc_on_your_wrist.html|accessdate=15 September 2010|newspaper=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]|date=11 October 2001}}</ref> Citizen was hoping to market the watch to students and businessmen, with a retail price of around $399.<ref name="PCWORLD"/> However, the project was discontinued sometime around 2001-2002.

The '''ZYPAD''' is a wristwatch computer which fits on a user's wrist like a [[bracer]] and offers interface port features similar to laptop computer.<ref name="zypad">{{Cite web|title= ZYPAD WL 11XX|url=http://www.zypad.com/zypad/wearablecomputers.aspx?pg=Zypad%20WL%201100|publisher=zypad.com|accessdate=16 September 2010}}</ref> It was developed by Parvus, a military contractor, and [[Eurotech]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Zypad WL1000|url=http://www.parvus.com/product/overview.aspx?prod=ZypadWL1000|publisher=Parvus|accessdate=16 September 2010}}</ref> It is arguable whether it qualifies as a watch, but it is referred to as a "Wrist Worn PC". It is able to run either [[Embedded Linux|Linux]] or [[Windows CE]], and can sense motion, allowing such possibilities of use such as going into standby mode when a user lowers his/her arm. It can determine its position by [[dead reckoning]] as well as via GPS. It supports [[Bluetooth]], [[IrDA]], and [[WiFi]].<ref name=zypad />
