'''Sourceware Archive Group''' (SWAG) is a free collection of classified source code and sample programs written in [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]].<ref name="htmswag">{{cite web |first=Jim |last=McKeeth |title=Main SWAG HTML Index |url=http://www.bsdg.org/SWAG/ |accessdate=2008-04-12}}</ref>

On 29 November 1997 the last version of SWAG was released,<ref name="htmswag" /> an HTML edition of which is now hosted by [[Jim McKeeth]].

Although most contents in the SWAG seem out-of-date, they are believed to be still useful today, since many things are implemented nearly the same way as in the past.<ref name="htmswag" />

== Modern forms ==
Though SWAG itself has stopped updating, a number of its equivalents are still available and made good use of today.

There are many websites offering source code, sample programs written in pure Pascal, [[Object Pascal]] or [[Delphi programming language|Delphi]], many of whom provide huge libraries of [[Visual Component Library|VCL]] components [[Software license|licensed]] in many forms, since [[Borland Delphi|Delphi]] is the most widely used development tool in the modern Pascal/Object Pascal community.

Semi-homemade [[Compact disc|discs]] containing similar contents have been sold in [[China]] and was popular in the early 2000s. However, such discs are now rarely sold probably due to the popularization of [[internet]].

With the development of [[Free Pascal]] and [[Lazarus (software)|Lazarus]], and their introduce of [[Free Component Library]] (FCL) and [[Lazarus Component Library]] (LCL), FCL- and LCL-oriented components are also steadily growing.
