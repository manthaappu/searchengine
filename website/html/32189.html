'''Robert W Floyd''' (June 8, 1936 &ndash; September 25, 2001) was an eminent [[computer scientist]]. 

Born in [[New York]], Floyd finished school at age 14.  At the [[University of Chicago]], he received a [[Bachelor's degree]] in [[liberal arts]] in 1953 (when still only 17) and a second Bachelor's degree in [[physics]] in 1958.  

Floyd became a staff member of the Armour Research Foundation (now IIT Research Institute) at [http://www.iit.edu/ Illinois Institute of Technology] in the 1950s. Becoming a computer operator in the early 1960s, he began publishing many noteworthy papers and was appointed an associate professor at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] by the time he was 27 and became a full professor at [[Stanford University]] six years later.  He obtained this position without a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]

His contributions include the design of [[Floyd's algorithm]], which efficiently finds all shortest paths in a [[graph theory|graph]], and work on [[parsing]]. In one isolated paper he introduced the important concept of error diffusion for rendering images, also called [[Floyd–Steinberg dithering]] (though he distinguished dithering from diffusion).

A significant achievement was pioneering the field of [[program verification]] using [[logical assertion]]s with the 1967 paper ''Assigning Meanings to Programs''. This was an important contribution to what later became [[Hoare logic]].

Floyd worked closely with [[Donald Knuth]], in particular as the major reviewer for Knuth's seminal book ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'', and is the person most cited in that work.  He was the co-author, with Richard Beigel, of the textbook ''The Language of Machines: an Introduction to Computability and Formal Languages'' (1994, W.H. Freeman and Company, ISBN 978-0716782667).

He received the [[Turing Award]] in 1978 "for having a clear influence on methodologies for the creation of efficient and reliable software, and for helping to found the following important subfields of computer science: the theory of [[parsing]], the [[semantics of programming languages]], automatic [[program verification]], automatic [[program synthesis]], and [[analysis of algorithms]]".

Floyd married and divorced twice, and had four children.  His hobbies included hiking and he was an avid [[backgammon]] player:

{{quote|We once were stuck at the Chicago O’Hare airport for hours, waiting for our flight to leave, owing to a snow storm. As we sat at our gate, Bob asked me, in a casual manner, “do you know how to play backgammon?” I answered I knew the rules, but why did he want to know? Bob said since we had several hours to wait perhaps we should play a few games, for small stakes of course. He then reached into his briefcase and removed a backgammon set.

My Dad taught me many things. One was to be wary of anyone who suggests a game of pool for money, and then opens a black case and starts to screw together a pool stick. I figured that this advice generalized to anyone who traveled with their own backgammon set. I told Bob that I was not going to play for money, no way. He pushed a bit, but finally said fine. He proceeded instead to give me a free lesson in the art and science of playing backgammon.

I was right to pass on playing him for money—at any stakes. The lesson was fun. I found out later that for years he had been working on learning the game. He took playing backgammon very seriously, studied the game and its mathematics, and was a near professional. I think it was more than a hobby. Like his research, Bob took what he did seriously, and it is completely consistent that he would be terrific at backgammon.|[[Richard J. Lipton]]|''Gödel’s Lost Letter and P=NP'' (blog), August 28, 2010}}
