<html> <head> <title>Language engineering</title></head><body>'''Language engineering''' is the creation of [[natural language processing]] systems whose cost and outputs are measurable and predictable as well as establishment of language regulators, such as formal or informal agencies, committees, societies or academies as language regulators.
Although this is usually referred to as [[language planning]], the word [[engineering]] is used to refer specifically to linguistic design or developing new structures to meet contemporary needs.<ref> Language: An Introduction, Lehmann, W.P., 1983, Random House </ref>  It is a distinct field contrasted to natural language processing and [[computational linguistics]].<ref> [http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1351324999002144] A definition and short history of Language Engineering, Hamish Cunnigham,Natural Language Engineering  (1999), 5: 1-16 Cambridge University Press</ref> A recent trend of language engineering is the use
of Semantic Web technologies for the creation, archival, processing, and retrieval of machine processable language data.<ref>Shiyong Lu, Dapeng Liu, Farshad Fotouhi, Ming Dong, Robert Reynolds, Anthony Aristar, Martha Ratliff, Geoff Nathan, Joseph Tan, and Ronald Powell, “Language Engineering for the Semantic Web: a Digital Library for Endangered Languages”, Information Research, 9(3), April, 2004.</ref>
