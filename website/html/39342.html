'''Eighth Edition Unix''', also known as '''Version 8 Unix''' or '''V8''', was a version of the [[Research Unix]] [[operating system]] developed and used internally at [[Bell Labs]] and a select number of universities. It was "released" in February 1985, ran on [[VAX]] hardware, and was a variant of [[Berkeley Software Distribution|4.1cBSD]] with some [[UNIX System V#SVR2|System V.1 (SVR2)]] features (notably the [[shell (computing)|shell]]). V8 was the successor to [[Version 7 Unix|V7]] and the predecessor to [[Version 9 Unix|V9]].

V8 is perhaps best remembered for its [[regular expression]] (RE) matching library, which established a [[de facto]] standard for RE syntax until a [[POSIX]] standard was developed. It also introduced the [[STREAMS]] I/O mechanism, the <tt>[[Procfs|/proc]]</tt> filesystem, kernel support for [[interpreter directive]]s, and several other features later incorporated into [[UNIX System V#SVR3|System V.2 (SVR3)]] and subsequent versions of Unix.

V8 also featured a [[Distributed file system|network file system]], which permitted access to other machines' entire filesystem trees. For example, the file <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> on [[Server (computing)|server]] <tt>foovax</tt> would be accessible to [[Client (computing)|client]] machines as <tt>/n/foovax/etc/passwd</tt>.

''[[The Unix Programming Environment]]'' was prepared on a VAX-11/750 running a preliminary version of V8 Unix. [http://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2003-June/000628.html]
