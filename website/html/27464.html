'''Open API''' (often referred to as OpenAPI new testnology) is a word used to describe sets of technologies that enable websites to interact with each other by using SOAP, Javascript and other web technologies. While its possibilities aren't limited to web-based applications, it's becoming an increasing trend in so-called Web 2.0 applications.

The term [[API]] stands for Application Programming Interface.

==Introduction==

The term "Open API" has been recently in use by recent trends in [[social media]] and [[Web 2.0]].  It is currently a heavily sought after solution to interconnect websites in a more fluid user-friendly manner.  [[Social networking]] sites like [[MySpace]] and [[Bebo]] currently do not have any open API's but with the growing trend and demand for [[social network aggregator]] websites like [[PeopleAggregator]], [[Spokeo]] and [[Socialurl|SocialURL]] there will become more prevalent for these social networks to start considering the opportunities to take a leadership role in this  endeavor. Open API also applies to collaborative services environments where managed service providers can also outsource specific services to other providers via systems integration. For example, companies like [[Level Platforms]] provide an open API to adapt to any business offering within the managed service environment.

With the advent of the [http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&story=21 Facebook Platform], launched June 1st 2007, Facebook incorporated an open api into its business model

[[OpenSocial]] is currently being developed by Google in conjunction with MySpace and other social networks including Bebo.com Engage.com, Friendster, hi5, Hyves, imeem, LinkedIn, MySpace, Ning, Oracle, orkut, Plaxo, Salesforce.com, Six Apart, Tianji, Viadeo, and XING. The ultimate goal is for any social website to be able to implement the APIs and host third party social applications.

"Open API" is also becoming very popular among technical software, for collaboration between different trades such as architects and engineers. Since there is different software for designing structures, buildings, these trades find a way to use each other's work through "Open API". For example, an architect can draw in CAD software and engineers can implement these plans into their software.
