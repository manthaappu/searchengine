<html> <head> <title>Sign extension</title></head><body>'''Sign extension''' is the operation, in [[computer]] [[arithmetic]], of increasing the number of [[bit]]s of a [[binary number]] while preserving the number's [[sign (mathematics)|sign (positive/negative)]] and value. This is done by appending digits to the [[most significant bit|most significant]] side of the number, following a procedure dependent on the particular [[signed number representation]] used.

For example, if six bits are used to represent the number "<code>00 1010</code>" (decimal positive 10) and the sign extend operation increases the [[word (computer science)|word length]] to 16 bits, then the new ([[endianness|big endian]], i.e. the left-most bit is the most significant bit) representation is simply "<code>0000 0000 0000 1010</code>".  Thus, both the value and the fact that the value was positive are maintained.

If ten bits are used to represent the value "<code>11 1111 0001</code>" (decimal negative 15) using [[two's complement]], and this is sign extended to sixteen bits, the new representation is "<code>1111 1111 1111 0001</code>".  Thus, by padding the left side with ones, the negative sign and the value of the original number are maintained.

In the [[x86 instruction listings|x86 instruction set]], used by most home [[IBM PC compatible|PC]]s, there are two ways of doing sign extension:
* using the instructions <tt>cbw</tt>, <tt>cwd</tt>, <tt>cwde</tt>, and <tt>cdq</tt> (convert byte to word, doubleword, extended doubleword, and quadword, respectively; in the x86 context, a byte has 8 bits, a word 16 bits, a doubleword and extended doubleword 32 bits, and a quadword 64 bits);
* using one of the sign extended moves, accomplished by the <tt>movsx</tt> ("move with sign extension") family of instructions.
