'''LIRC''' ([[Linux]] [[Infrared remote control]]) is an [[open source]] package that allows users to receive and send [[infrared]] signals with a [[Linux]]-based computer system.

There is a [[Microsoft Windows]] equivalent of LIRC called WinLIRC.

With LIRC and an IR receiver the user can control their computer with almost any infrared remote control (e.g. a TV remote control). The user may for instance control DVD or music playback with their remote control.

One GUI frontend is KDELirc, built on the [[KDE]] libraries.
