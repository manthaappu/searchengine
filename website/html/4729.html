The '''Burmese Python''' (''Python molurus bivittatus'') is the largest subspecies of the [[Python molurus|Indian Python]] and one of the 6 largest [[snake]]s in the world, native to a large variation of tropic and subtropic areas of [[Southern Asia|Southern]]- and [[Southeast Asia]]. They are often found near water and are sometimes semi-aquatic, but can also be found in trees.  Wild individuals average {{convert|3.7|m|ft|sigfig=2}} long,<ref name=Smith>M. A.

== Description ==
Burmese Pythons are light-coloured snakes with many brown blotches bordered in black down the back. The perceived attractiveness of their skin pattern contributes to their popularity with both reptile keepers and the leather industry. The pattern is similar in colour, but different in actual pattern to the [[African Rock Python]] (''[[Python sebae]]''), sometimes resulting in confusion of the two species outside of their natural habitats. 

In the wild, Burmese pythons grow  to {{convert|3.7|m|ft|sigfig=2}} on average,<ref name="Smith"/><ref name="Campden"/> while specimens of more than {{convert|4|m|ft|sigfig=2}} are uncommon.<ref name=SaintGirons>H.

There are also dwarf forms on [[Java]], [[Bali]] and [[Sulawesi]]. At Bali they reach an average length of {{convert|2|m|ft|sigfig=2}} <ref name=McKay>J. L.

==Geographic range and habitat==
[[Image:Natural Range of Python molurus6.jpg|thumb|left|Natural Distribution of the Burmese Python (green) and the [[Indian Python]] (red) and interference area (yellow).]]  
The Burmese Python is found throughout Southern- and Southeast Asia including Eastern [[India]], [[Nepal]], Western [[Bhutan]], Southeast [[Bangladesh]], [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], Northern continental [[Malaysia]], Southern [[China]] and in [[Indonesia]] on [[Java]], Southern [[Sulawesi]], [[Bali]] and [[Sumbawa]].<ref>D. G. Barker, T. M. Barker: „The Distribution of the Burmese Python, Python molurus bivittatus“; Bulletin of the Chicago Herpetological Society 43(3):33-38, 2008 [http://www.vpi.com/sites/vpi.com/files/Barkers.pdf]</ref> This python is an excellent swimmer and needs a permanent source of water. It can be found in [[grassland]]s, marshes, swamps, rocky foothills, woodlands, river valleys, and jungles with open clearings. They are good climbers and have [[prehensile]] tails.

The captive breeding of Burmese Pythons in the Americas has led to some rather serious problems. People who grow tired of their pythons, or whose pythons have grown too large to be kept in their houses, have been known to release their pets into the wild rather than have them re-homed or even humanely euthanized. This has been particularly problematic in [[Florida]], along with possible zoo and household escapees from [[Hurricane Andrew]], where a large number of pythons have made their way to the [[Everglades]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1958657_1958656_1958659,00.html | work=Time | title=Top 10 Invasive Species | date=2010-02-02 | accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref> They have thrived there, begun to reproduce prolifically, and become an [[invasive species]]. Over 1330 (US Natural Park Service website - Dec 31 2009<ref>http://www.nps.gov/ever/naturescience/burmesepython.htm</ref>) have been captured in the Everglades.  Since they have been known to eat endangered birds and alligators, these snakes present a new danger to an already fragile ecosystem. In February 2008, USGS scientists published a projected range map for the US, based on average climate data of the snake's home range and [[global warming]] projections, which predicted that these snakes could eventually migrate to and flourish in as much as a third of the continental [[United States]] by the end of the 21st century.<ref name="USGS">[[U.S. Department of the Interior]], [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (2008-02-20).

PLoS ONE 3(8): e2931. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0002931</ref>

== Behavior ==
Burmese Pythons are mainly [[nocturnal]] [[rainforest]] dwellers.<ref name="Burmese Python">{{Cite web|url=http://digimorph.org/specimens/Python_molurus/|title=Python molurus, Burmese Python|accessdate=2007-07-25|publisher=Digital Morphology|year=2003|author=Dr. Susan Evans|work=The deep Scaly Project}}</ref> When younger they are equally at home on the ground and in trees, but as they gain girth they tend to restrict most of their movements to the ground. They are also excellent swimmers, being able to stay submerged for up to half an hour. Burmese Pythons spend the majority of their time hidden in the underbrush. In the northern parts of its range it may [[brumate]] for some months during the cold season in a hollow tree, a hole in the riverbank or under rocks. Brumation<ref>[http://www.kingsnake.com/articles/Glossary.html Glossary of commonly used terms<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> is biologically distinct from hibernation. While the behaviour has similar benefits, specifically to endure the winter without moving, it also involves preparation of both male and female reproductive organs for the upcoming breeding season.

Burmese Pythons breed in the early spring, with females laying clutches which average 12&ndash;36 eggs in March or April. She will remain with the eggs until they hatch, wrapping around them and twitching her muscles in such a way as to raise the ambient temperature around the eggs by several degrees. Once the hatchlings use their [[egg tooth]] to cut their way out of their eggs, there is no further maternal care. The newly hatched will often remain inside their egg until they are ready to complete their first shedding of skin, after which they hunt for their first meal.

==Diet==
Like all [[snake]]s, Burmese Pythons are [[carnivore|carnivorous]]. Their [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] consists primarily of appropriately-sized [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s. The snake uses its sharp rearward-pointing teeth to seize its prey, then wraps its body around the prey, at the same time contracting its muscles, killing the prey by [[constriction]]. They are often found near human habitation due to the presence of [[rat]]s, [[mice]] and other [[vermin]] as a food source. However, their equal affinity for domesticated birds and mammals means that they are often treated as pests. In captivity their diet consists primarily of commercially-available, appropriately-sized rats, and graduates to larger items such as [[rabbit]]s and [[poultry]] as they grow. Exceptionally large pythons may even require larger food items such as [[pig]]s or [[goat]]s, and are known to have attacked and eaten [[alligator]]s in Florida, where they are an invasive species.<ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/10/1006_051006_pythoneatsgator.html National Geographic : Python Bursts After Eating Gator]</ref>

===Digestion===
The digestive response of Burmese Pythons to such large prey has made them a model species for digestive physiology. A fasting python will have a reduced stomach volume and acidity, reduced intestinal mass and a 'normal' heart volume. After ingesting prey, the entire digestive system undergoes a massive remodelling, with rapid hypertrophy of the intestines, production of stomach acid, and a 40% increase in mass of the ventricles of the heart in order to fuel the digestive process.

==Conservation==
Wild populations are considered to be "[[threatened species|threatened]]" and are listed on Appendix II of [[Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna|CITES]]. All the giant pythons (including the [[Python molurus|Indian Python]], the [[Python sebae|African Rock Python]], and the [[Python reticulatus|Reticulated Python]]) have historically been slaughtered to supply the world [[leather]] market, as well as for folk medicines, and captured for the pet trade. Some are also killed for food, particularly in China.

In [[Hong Kong]], it is a [[List of protected species in Hong Kong|protected species]] under Wild Animals Protection Ordinance Cap 170..

==Captivity==
Burmese Pythons are often sold as pets, and are made popular by their attractive colour and apparently easy-going nature. However, these animals have a rapid growth rate, and will often exceed 2.1 meters (7 feet) in length in a year if cared for and fed properly. By age 4, they will have reached their adult size, though they continue growing very slowly throughout their lives, which may exceed 20 years. 

Although this species has a reputation for docility, they are very powerful animals, capable of inflicting severe bites or even killing a keeper by [[constriction]].<ref>http://www.anapsid.org/coloburm.html Thirteen Foot Burmese Python Kills Owner</ref> They also consume large amounts of food, and due to their size, require large, often custom-built, secure enclosures, which can be very expensive. As a result some are released to the wild by pet owners.

A secondary problem with feeding Burmese pythons is that many owners believe if a snake acts hungry, that it should be fed. As Burmese pythons are opportunistic feeders, they will eat almost any time food is offered, and often act hungry even when they have recently eaten. This often leads to overfeeding, and [[obesity]]-related problems are common in captive Burmese pythons.

===Handling===
[[Image:Reptilia audience members handling burmese python dsc 0083.jpg|thumb|l|Audience volunteers holding an adult Burmese python.]]

Although pythons are typically afraid of people, due to their high stature (especially given that snakes are usually low to the ground), and will generally avoid people, special care is still required when handling them. A three-metre long Burmese python can easily kill a [[child]]<ref>http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/python+kills+Florida+toddler/1751606/story.html Pet python kills Florida toddler</ref> and a five-metre long (around 16.5 feet) Burmese python is certainly capable of overpowering and killing a fully grown adult, so it is not advisable to handle such a large snake alone. If the snake does wrap around an individual, others should be present to unwind the snake, starting at the tail. Many reptile [[zoo]]s demonstrate proper snakehandling technique. Usually the demonstrator handles the head, while volunteers can handle the rest of the snake's body. Snakes should be supported firmly but gently.

===Variations===
[[Image:Caramel burmese python.JPG|left|thumb|Caramel Burmese Python.]]
The Burmese python is frequently captive-bred for colour, pattern, and more recently size. Its [[albino]] form is especially popular and is the most widely available morph. They are white with patterns in butterscotch yellow and burnt orange. There are also "labyrinth" specimens, which have mazelike patterns; khaki-coloured "green"; and "granite", which have many small angular spots. Breeders have recently begun working with an island lineage of Burmese pythons. Early reports indicate that these "dwarf" Burmese have slightly different colouring and pattern from their mainland relatives and do not grow much over {{convert|2.1|m|ft|sigfig=1}} long. One of the most sought-after of these variations is the [[leucistic]] Burmese. This particular variety is very rare, and has only recently (2008/2009) been reproduced in captivity as the super-form of the codominant hypomelanistic trait. This snake is entirely bright white with no pattern and black eyes, thus precluding it from being a true albino. The caramel Burmese python has caramel-coloured pattern with "milk-chocolate" eyes.
