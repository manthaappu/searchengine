{{Flynn's Taxonomy}}
In [[computing]], '''MISD''' ('''M'''ultiple '''I'''nstruction, '''S'''ingle '''D'''ata) is a type of [[parallel computing]] [[computer architecture|architecture]] where many functional units perform different operations on the same data. [[Pipeline (computing)|Pipeline]] architectures belong to this type, though a purist might say that the data is different after processing by each stage in the pipeline. Fault-tolerant computers executing the same instructions redundantly in order to detect and mask errors, in a manner known as [[Replication (computer science)|task replication]], may<!-- incoherent with the definition of MIMD above... "_different_ operations" --> be considered to belong to this type. Not many instances of this architecture exist, as [[MIMD]] and [[SIMD]] are often more appropriate for common data parallel techniques.  Specifically, they allow better scaling and use of computational resources than MISD does.

Some argue that a [[systolic array]] is an example of a MISD structure.<ref>Quinn, Michael J.
