'''Neuroscience''' is the [[science|scientific study]] of the [[nervous system]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Neuroscience|work=Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/neuroscience}}</ref> Traditionally, neuroscience has been seen as a branch of [[biology]]. However, it is currently an [[interdisciplinary]] [[science]] that collaborates with other fields such as [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[engineering]], [[computer science]], [[philosophy]], and [[medicine]]. The term neurobiology is usually used interchangeably with the term neuroscience, although the former refers specifically to the [[biology]] of the [[nervous system]], whereas the latter refers to the entire science of the nervous system.

The scope of neuroscience has broadened to include different approaches used to study the [[molecular biology|molecular]], [[cellular neuroscience|cellular]], [[neural development|developmental]], [[neuroanatomy|structural]], [[neurophysiology|functional]], [[evolutionary neuroscience|evolutionary]], [[computational neuroscience|computational]], and [[neurological disorders|medical]] aspects of the nervous system. The techniques used by [[neuroscientist]]s have also expanded enormously, from molecular and cellular studies of individual [[neuron|nerve cells]] to [[brain mapping|imaging]] of sensory and motor tasks in the [[brain]]. Recent theoretical advances in neuroscience have also been aided by the study of [[neural network]]s.

Given the increasing number of neuroscientists that study the nervous system, several prominent neuroscience organizations have been formed to provide a forum to all neuroscientists and educators. For example, the [[International Brain Research Organization]] was founded in 1960,<ref>{{cite web|year=2010|title=History of IBRO|work=International Brain Research Organization|url=http://www.ibro.info/Pub/Pub_Main_Display.asp?LC_Docs_ID=2343}}</ref> the [[European Brain and Behaviour Society]] in 1968,<ref>{{cite web|year=2009|title=About EBBS|work=European Brain and Behaviour Society|url=http://www.ebbs-science.org/cms/general/about-ebbs.html}}</ref> and the [[Society for Neuroscience]] in 1969.<ref>{{cite web|title=About SfN|work=Society for Neuroscience|url=http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=about_sfn}}</ref>

==History==
{{See also|History of neuroscience}}
[[File:Gray739.png|right|thumb|250px|Illustration from ''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'' (1918) of a lateral view of the [[human brain]], featuring the [[hippocampus]] among other neuroanatomical features]]
The study of the nervous system dates back to [[ancient Egypt]]. Evidence of [[trepanation]], the surgical practice of either drilling or scraping a hole into the skull with the aim of curing headaches or [[Mental illness|mental disorders]] or relieving cranial pressure, being performed on patients dates back to [[Neolithic]] times and has been found in various cultures throughout the world. Manuscripts dating back to 1700BC indicated that the [[Egyptians]] had some knowledge about symptoms of brain damage.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mohamed W|year=2008|title=The Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus: Neuroscience in Ancient Egypt|work=IBRO History of Neuroscience|url=http://www.ibro.info/Pub/Pub_Main_Display.asp?LC_Docs_ID=3199}}</ref>

Early views on the function of the brain regarded it to be a "cranial stuffing" of sorts. In Egypt, from the late [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] onwards, the brain was regularly removed in preparation for [[Mummy|mummification]]. It was believed at the time that the [[heart]] was the seat of intelligence. According to [[Herodotus]], the first step of mummification is to "take a crooked piece of iron, and with it draw out the brain through the nostrils, thus getting rid of a portion, while the skull is cleared of the rest by rinsing with drugs."<ref>{{cite book|author=Herodotus|year=440BCE|title=The Histories: Book II (Euterpe)|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.mb.txt}}</ref>

The view that the heart was the source of consciousness was not challenged until the time of [[Hippocrates]]. He believed that the brain was not only involved with sensation—since most specialized organs (e.g., eyes, ears, tongue) are located in the head near the brain—but was also the seat of intelligence. [[Plato]] too speculated that the brain was the seat of the rational part of the soul.<ref>{{cite book|author=Plato|year=360BCE|title=Timaeus|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/timaeus.1b.txt}}</ref> [[Aristotle]], however, believed that the heart was the center of intelligence and that the brain served to cool the blood. This view was generally accepted until the Roman physician [[Galen]], a follower of Hippocrates and physician to [[Gladiator|Roman gladiators]], observed that his patients lost their mental faculties when they had sustained damage to their brains.

In [[al-Andalus]], [[Abu al-Qasim|Abulcasis]], the father of modern [[surgery]], developed material and technical designs which are still used in [[neurosurgery]]. [[Averroes]] suggested the existence of [[Parkinson's disease]] and attributed [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]] properties to the [[retina]]. [[Ibn Zuhr|Avenzoar]] described [[meningitis]], intracranial [[thrombophlebitis]], [[Mediastinal germ cell tumor|mediastinal tumours]] and made contributions to modern [[neuropharmacology]]. [[Maimonides]] wrote about [[Neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatric]] disorders and described [[rabies]] and [[Deadly nightshade|belladonna]] intoxication.<ref name="Martin-Araguz A">{{cite journal|author=Martin-Araguz A, Bustamante-Martinez C, Fernandez-Armayor Ajo V, Moreno-Martinez JM|year=2008|title=Neuroscience in al-Andalus and its influence on medieval scholastic medicine|journal=Revista de Neurología|volume=34|issue=9|pages=877–892|url=http://www.revneurol.com/sec/resumen.php?i=i&id=2001382&vol=34&num=09|pmid=12134355}}</ref> Elsewhere in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], [[Vesalius]] (1514–1564) and [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) also made several contributions to neuroscience.

Studies of the brain became more sophisticated after the invention of the [[microscope]] and the development of a [[staining|staining procedure]] by [[Camillo Golgi]] during the late 1890s. The procedure used a [[silver chromate]] salt to reveal the intricate structures of individual [[neuron]]s. His technique was used by [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]] and led to the formation of the [[neuron doctrine]], the hypothesis that the functional unit of the brain is the neuron. Golgi and Ramón y Cajal shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1906 for their extensive observations, descriptions, and categorizations of neurons throughout the brain. The neuron doctrine was supported by experiments following [[Luigi Galvani]]'s pioneering work in the electrical excitability of muscles and neurons. In the late 19th century, [[Emil du Bois-Reymond]], [[Johannes Peter Müller]], and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] demonstrated that neurons were electrically excitable and that their activity predictably affected the electrical state of adjacent neurons.

In parallel with this research, work with brain-damaged patients by [[Paul Broca]] suggested that certain regions of the brain were responsible for certain functions. At the time, Broca's findings were seen as a confirmation of [[Franz Joseph Gall]]'s theory that language was localized{{clarify|date=November 2010}} and certain [[mental process|psychological functions]] were localized in the [[cerebral cortex]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Greenblatt SH|year=1995|title=Phrenology in the science and culture of the 19th century|journal=Neurosurg|volume=37|issue=4|pages=790–805|url=http://journals.lww.com/neurosurgery/Abstract/1995/10000/Phrenology_in_the_Science_and_Culture_of_the_19th.25.aspx|pmid=8559310}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Bear MF, Connors BW, Paradiso MA|year=2001|title=Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain|edition=4th|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philedelphia, PA|isbn=0781739446}}</ref> The [[Functional specialization (brain)|localization of function]] hypothesis was supported by observations of [[epilepsy|epileptic]] patients conducted by [[John Hughlings Jackson]], who correctly inferred the organization of the [[motor cortex]] by watching the progression of seizures through the body. [[Carl Wernicke]] further developed the theory of the specialization of specific brain structures in language comprehension and production. Modern research still uses the [[Brodmann areas|Brodmann]] [[Cytoarchitectonics of the cerebral cortex|cerebral cytoarchitectonic map]] (referring to study of [[cell structure]]) anatomical definitions from this era in continuing to show that distinct areas of the cortex are activated in the execution of specific tasks.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kandel ER, Schwartz JH, Jessel TM|year=2000|title=[[Principles of Neural Science]]|edition=4th|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY|isbn=0838577016}}</ref>

In 1952, [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley]] presented a mathematical model for transmission of electrical signals in neurons of the giant axon of a squid, [[action potentials]], and how they are initiated and propagated, known as the [[Hodgkin-Huxley model]].  In 1961-2, Richard FitzHugh and J. Nagumo simplified Hodgkin-Huxley, in what is called the [[FitzHugh–Nagumo model]].  In 1962, [[Bernard Katz]] modeled neurotransmission across the space between neurons known as [[synapses]].  In 1981 Catherine Morris and Harold Lecar combined these models in the [[Morris-Lecar model]].  In 1984, J. L. Hindmarsh and R.M. Rose further modeled neurotransmission.

Beginning in 1966, [[Eric Kandel]] and [[James Schwartz]] examined the biochemical analysis of changes in neurons associated with learning and memory storage.

==Foundations of modern neuroscience==
[[Image:neuron colored.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Photograph of a [[staining|stained neuron]] in a chicken embryo]]
The [[scientific method|scientific study]] of the [[nervous system]] increased significantly during the second half of the twentieth century, principally due to revolutions in [[molecular biology]], [[electrophysiology]], and [[computational neuroscience]]. It has become possible to understand, in much detail, the complex processes occurring within a single [[neuron]]. However, how [[neural network|networks of neurons]] produce complex [[cognition]]s and [[behavior]]s is still poorly understood.

{{cquote|The task of neural science is to explain behavior in terms of the activities of the brain. How does the brain marshal its millions of individual nerve cells to produce behavior, and how are these cells influenced by the environment...? The last frontier of the biological sciences—their ultimate challenge—is to understand the biological basis of consciousness and the mental processes by which we perceive, act, learn, and remember. — [[Eric Kandel]], ''Principles of Neural Science'', 4th ed.}}

The nervous system is composed of a network of [[neuron]]s and other supportive cells (e.g., [[glial cell]]s). Neurons form functional circuits, each responsible for specific functions of behavior at the [[organism]]al level. Thus, neuroscience can be studied at many different levels, ranging from the molecular and cellular levels to the systems and cognitive levels.

At the molecular level, the basic questions addressed in [[molecular neuroscience]] include the mechanisms by which neurons express and respond to molecular signals and how [[axons]] form complex connectivity patterns. At this level, tools from [[molecular biology]] and [[genetics]] are used to understand how neurons develop and how genetic changes affect biological functions. The [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], molecular identity, and physiological characteristics of neurons and how they relate to different types of behavior are also of considerable interest.

At the cellular level, the fundamental questions addressed in [[cellular neuroscience]] include the mechanisms of how neurons process [[cell signaling|signals]] physiologically and electrochemically. They address how signals are processed by [[dendrite]]s, [[soma (biology)|somas]] and [[axon]]s, and how [[neurotransmitter]]s and electrical signals are used to process signals in a neuron.{{clarify|date=November 2010}} Another major area of neuroscience is directed at investigations of the [[neural development|development]] of the nervous system. These questions include the [[Regional specification|patterning and regionalization]] of the nervous system, neural [[stem cell]]s, [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of neurons and glia, [[Neural development#Neuronal migration|neuronal migration]], axonal and dendritic development, [[Growth factor|trophic interactions]], and [[Synaptogenesis|synapse formation]].

At the systems level, the questions addressed in [[systems neuroscience]] include how neural circuits are formed and used anatomically and physiologically to produce functions such as [[reflex]]es, [[sensory integration]], [[motor coordination]], [[circadian rhythm]]s, [[emotion|emotional responses]], [[learning]], and [[memory]]. In other words, they address how these neural circuits function and the mechanisms through which behaviors are generated. For example, systems level analysis addresses questions concerning specific sensory and motor modalities: how does [[Visual perception|vision]] work? How do [[songbirds]] learn new songs and [[bat]]s localize with [[ultrasound]]? How does the [[somatosensory system]] process tactile information? The related fields of [[neuroethology]] and [[neuropsychology]] address the question of how neural substrates underlie specific [[Ethology|animal]] and [[human behavior|human]] behaviors. [[Neuroendocrinology]] and [[psychoneuroimmunology]] examine interactions between the nervous system and the [[endocrinology|endocrine]] and [[immunology|immune]] systems, respectively.

At the cognitive level, [[cognitive neuroscience]] addresses the questions of how [[mental process|psychological functions]] are produced by neural circuitry. The emergence of powerful new measurement techniques such as [[neuroimaging]] (e.g., [[fMRI]], [[Positron emission tomography|PET]], [[SPECT]]), [[electrophysiology]], and [[Human genome|human genetic analysis]] combined with sophisticated [[experimental techniques]] from [[cognitive psychology]] allows [[neuroscientist]]s and [[psychologist]]s to address abstract questions such as how human cognition and emotion are mapped to specific neural substrates.

Neuroscience is also allied with the [[social sciences|social]] and [[behavioral sciences|behavioral]] sciences as well as nascent interdisciplinary fields such as [[neuroeconomics]], [[decision theory]], and [[social neuroscience]] to address complex questions about interactions of the brain with its environment.

==Neuroscience and medicine==
[[Image:Structural.gif|right|thumb|250px|Parasagittal [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] of the head of a patient with benign familial [[macrocephaly]]]]
[[Neurology]], [[psychiatry]], [[neurosurgery]], [[psychosurgery]], and [[neuropathology]] are medical specialties that specifically address the diseases of the nervous system. These terms also refer to clinical disciplines involving diagnosis and treatment of these diseases. Neurology works with diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems, such as [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) and [[stroke]], and their medical treatment while psychiatry focuses on [[Affect (psychology)|affective]], [[behavior]]al, [[cognition|cognitive]], and [[perception|perceptual]] disorders. Neuropathology focuses upon the classification and underlying pathogenic mechanisms of central and peripheral nervous system and muscle diseases, with an emphasis on morphologic, microscopic, and chemically observable alterations. Neurosurgery and psychosurgery work primarily with surgical treatment of diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems. The boundaries between these specialties have been blurring recently as they are all influenced by [[Research|basic research]] in neuroscience. Brain imaging also enables objective, biological insights into mental illness, which can lead to faster diagnosis, more accurate prognosis, and help assess patient progress over time.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lepage M|year=2010|title=Research at the Brain Imaging Centre|work=Douglas Mental Health University Institute|url=http://www.douglas.qc.ca/page/imagerie-cerebrale?locale=en}}</ref>

[[Integrative neuroscience]] makes connections across these specialized areas of focus.

==Major branches==
Modern neuroscience education and research activities can be very roughly categorized into the following major branches, based on the subject and scale of the system in examination as well as distinct experimental or curricular approaches. Individual neuroscientists, however, often work on questions that span several distinct subfields.

In 1990s, neuroscientist [[Jaak Panksepp]] coined the term "affective neuroscience" to emphasize that research of emotion should be a branch of the neurosciences, distinguishable from the nearby fields of cognitive neuroscience or behavioral neuroscience.<ref>{{cite book|author=Panksepp J|chapter=A role for "affective neuroscience" in understanding stress: the case of separation distress circuitry|editor=Puglisi-Allegra S, Oliverio A|isbn=0792306821|location=Dordrecht, Netherlands|pages=41&ndash;58|publisher=Kluwer Academic|title=Psychobiology of Stress|year=1990}}</ref> More recently, the social aspect of the emotional brain has been integrated in what is called "social-affective neuroscience" or simply social neuroscience.

==Future directions==
{{Main|Unsolved problems in neuroscience}}
At this time in neuroscience research, several major questions remained unsolved, especially in [[cognitive neuroscience]]. For example, neuroscientists have yet to fully explain the neural basis of [[neural correlates of consciousness|consciousness]], learning, memory, perception, sensation, and sleep. Several questions regarding the development and evolution of the brain remain unsolved.{{Which?|date=November 2010}} Researchers have also yet to fully delineate the neural bases of mental disorders such as addiction, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and psychotic disorders (e.g., schizophrenia). Neuroscientific research on [[Neuroscience of free will|free will]] is also in the early stages of understanding.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Free Will as an Open Scientific Problem|author=Balaguer M|year=2009|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262013543|location=Cambridge, MA}}</ref> Thus, neuroscientists are continuously collaborating with other scientists and researchers to address many of these unresolved problems.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hemmen JL, Sejnowski TJ|year=2006|title=23 Problems in Systems Neuroscience|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York NY|url=http://papers.cnl.salk.edu/PDFs/23%20Problems%20in%20Systems%20Neuroscience%202005-2921.pdf|isbn=0195148223}}</ref> Finally, proponents{{who|date=November 2010}} of the [[science of morality]] maintain that neuroscience will play an important role in the search for optimal moral systems.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Koizumi H|year=2007|title=The Concept of “Brain-Science and Ethics|publisher=Journal Seizon and Life Sciences}}</ref>

==Public education and outreach==
In addition to conducting traditional research in laboratory settings, neuroscientists have also been involved in the [[public awareness of science|promotion of awareness and knowledge]] about the nervous system among the general public and government officials. Such promotions have been done by both individual neuroscientists and large organizations. For example, individual neuroscientists have promoted neuroscience education among young students by organizing the International Brain Bee (IBB), which is an academic competition for high school or secondary school students worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the International Brain Bee|work=The International Brain Bee|url=http://www.internationalbrainbee.com/about_bee.html}}</ref> In the United States, large organizations such as the [[Society for Neuroscience]] have promoted neuroscience education by developing a primer called Brain Facts,<ref>{{cite web|title=Brain Facts: A Primer on the Brain and Nervous System|work=Society for Neuroscience|url=http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=brainfacts}}</ref> collaborating with members of public education{{clarify|date=November 2010}} to develop Neuroscience Core Concepts for K-12 teachers and students,<ref>{{cite web|title=Neuroscience Core Concepts: The Essential Principles of Neuroscience|work=Society for Neuroscience|url=http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=core_concepts}}</ref> and cosponsoring a campaign with the Dana Foundation called Brain Awareness Week to increase public awareness about the progress and benefits of brain research.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brain Awareness Week Campaign|work=The Dana Foundation|url=http://www.dana.org/brainweek/}}</ref>

Finally, neuroscientists have also collaborated with other education experts to study and refine educational techniques to optimize learning among students, an emerging field called [[educational neuroscience]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Goswami U|year=2004|title=Neuroscience, education and special education|journal=Br J of Spec Educ|volume=31|issue=4|language=|pages=175&ndash;183|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0952-3383.2004.00352.x/abstract|doi=10.1111/j.0952-3383.2004.00352.x}}</ref> Federal Agencies in the United States, such as the [[National Institute of Health]] (NIH) and [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF), have also funded research that pertain to best practices in teaching and learning of neuroscience concepts.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}
