'''SilverFast''' is software for [[Image scanning|scanning]] and [[image processing]], developed by [[LaserSoft Imaging]].

== History ==
SilverFast was introduced at the [[Hannover]] [[CeBIT]] fair in 1995. Version 2.0 was presented at the CeBIT at 1996 and version 3.0 was finished in December 1996. Version 6.6 has been available since May 2008. It is the only software supporting the [[Heidelberger Druckmaschinen|Heidelberg]] high-end Scanner on [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] 2000, XP, Vista and 7. Some scanner manufacturers bundle their hardware with SilverFast. The [[European Digital Press Association]] named SilverFast the "Best colour management software of the year 2008" for improving the [[Dynamic_range#Photography|dynamic range]] of most scanners and for creating [[ICC profile]]s automatically.<ref>[http://www.edpassociation.com/website/awards/history/category/lasersoft.html Awards: History by brands: LASERSOFT], European Digital Press Association, retrieved December 26, 2010.</ref>

=== SilverFast ===
SilverFast is for scanning and processing photos, documents, and slides. It can be used as a [[standalone software|stand-alone]] application, as a [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]], or as a universal [[TWAIN]] module. Versions include:
* SilverFast SE<ref>Sally Wiener Grotta and Daniel Grotta, [http://www.macworld.com/article/142438/2009/08/silverfast.html "With SilverFast SE, your scans look more like the originals,"] ''[[Macworld]]'' August 25, 2009, reprinted from ''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]''.</ref> and SE Plus (beginners / with [[Multi-Exposure]])
* SilverFast Ai and Ai Studio (professional and expert users)
* SilverFast Ai IT8 and Ai Studio IT8 (incorporating [[IT8]]-target for [[ICC profile|ICC profiling]])
* SilverFast X-Ray (a special version of SilverFast Ai designed to digitize [[Radiography|radiographic films]] for scientific and medical radiography)

=== SilverFast DC ===
[[Image:SilverFast DC Pro.png|thumb|250px|Screenshot: SilverFast DC Pro]]
SilverFast DC is a [[standalone software|stand-alone]] software solution for digital camera image processing. It contains features for reading the image data from the camera, for processing, optimizing, and archiving the images on the computer, as well as for printing the edited images.
* SilverFast DC SE - for Beginners
* SilverFast DC Pro - for Professionals
* SilverFast DC Pro Studio - for Experts

* SilverFast DC VLT - the Virtual Light Table

All DC versions include a virtual [[light table]] for organizing, managing, and manipulating the images (for example [[color temperature]] regulation, [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]] adjustment, and [[Red-eye effect|red-eye]] correction). The user can create photo archives and albums, add comments to images, generate [[Contact print|contact sheets]] of the complete view port, and produce or print single pictures in high resolution and in variable sizes.

SilverFast DC Pro has the functionality of the scanner-software SilverFast Ai for digital images. Supported are the standard image formats like [[JPEG]] and [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]], but also the unprocessed [[raw image format]]. Because of [[high dynamic range]], raw images are an ideal base for image processing. The access to the raw data permits manual color correction or sharpening instead of using the camera's automatic adjustment, which often does not work perfectly. SilverFast DC supports [[Digital Negative (file format)|Adobe DNG]] and many camera models by the most popular manufacturers, some of them optimized by special camera profiles.<ref name=DC_camera_list/> With the included [[IT8]]-target, individual [[ICC profile]]s can be self-made for every camera.

SilverFast DC Pro contains additional features like the automated color optimization AACO, support for [[JPEG 2000]], unsharpmasking USMPlus, CloneTool, and an improved PrinTao module with text and layout functions.

=== SilverFast HDR ===
SilverFast HDR ([[High dynamic range imaging|High Dynamic Range]]) is a software for processing 48-bit [[Raw image format|RAW images]]. Many newer scanners are able to output the image directly with all existing data instead of breaking it down to 24-bit. This 48-bit raw image can then be saved immediately and digital processing performed later.
* SilverFast HDR<ref>Patrick Wagner, [http://www.filmscanner.info/en/SilverFast_HDR.html Software test report SilverFast HDR] by [http://www.filmscanner.info/ filmscanner.info/ScanDig], retrieved December 26, 2010.</ref>
* SilverFast HDR IT8 - with [[IT8]]-target for [[ICC profile|ICC profiling]]
* SilverFast HDR Studio - with additional features

SilverFast HDR contains the functionality of SilverFast Ai for 48-bit raw data, such as defining output size and [[Image resolution|resolution]], auto-adjusting of highlights and shadows, three-part histogram, gradation curves, selective color correction, [[unsharp masking]], color cast removal slider, [[Color_printing#Color_separation_process|color separation]], and [[CMYK color model|CMYK]]-preview. SilverFast HDR can be used as a native [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] for [[Adobe Photoshop]], as a universal [[TWAIN]] module, or as a [[standalone program|stand-alone]] application.

The HDR Studio version provides additional features like AACO (Auto-Adaptive Contrast Enhancement), [[JPEG 2000]], USMPlus (Unsharp Mask Plus), CloneTool and PrinTao.

==== HDRi (64Bit RAW data with infrared channel) ====
With version 6.6.1 any SilverFast HDR version supports the RAW data format [[HDRi (data format)|HDRi]]. These 64-bit HDRi color files and 32-bit HDRi greyscale files contain additional 16-bit infrared RAW data besides the 48-bit color RAW data and 16-bit greyscale RAW data respectively. Therefore, a scanner with an infrared channel available to the software is necessary. This RAW format can keep any readable image information for later post-processing. For example, the removal of dust and scratches with iSRD can now be done afterwards.

=== SilverFast Archive Suite ===
The SilverFast Archive Suite combines the two programs SilverFast Ai IT8 and SilverFast HDR Studio with an integrated color management system. This package is suitable for archiving slides, negatives, and photos, whereas the post processing can take place anytime after scanning.<ref>[http://web.me.com/johnbarclayphoto/John_Barclay_Photo/Blog/Entries/2010/5/6_SIlverfast_Archive_Suite_Test_Report.html Archive Suite Test Report] by photographer John Barclay, May 6, 2010, retrieved December 26, 2010.</ref>

* SilverFast Archive Suite - consisting of SilverFast Ai IT8 and SilverFast HDR Studio and [[IT8]] calibration targets

=== SilverFast PrintTao ===
[[Image:SilverFast PrinTao.jpg|thumb|250px|Screenshot: SilverFast PrinTao]]
PrinTao is a software for printing images and documents. [[Style sheet (desktop publishing)|Templates]] can be used to make workflow easier and faster by reducing the number of similar and repetitive worksteps. PrinTao contains several predefined templates to which the user can add self-made ones.
Some other features:
* Positioning of pictures automatically or manually on the preview with the aid of grids and auxiliary lines
* [[Image scaling|Scaling]], Mirroring, Rotation, layout of pictures
* Inserting text in or around a picture
* Adding copyright information to pictures
* Adding IPTC or [[Exchangeable image file format|EXIF]] meta data.
The PrinTao module is already included in the SilverFast Ai / DC / HDR Studio versions.

=== Optional features ===
As marked in the table above, some products are available with the following additional features:

==== Multi-Exposure (ME) ====
"Multi-Exposure" is an exposure blending technique for scanning transparent originals like slides, negatives, and film strips with increased [[Dynamic_range#Photography|dynamic range]].<ref>[http://www.silverfast.com/PDF/TestReport_ME_DWueller.pdf Test Report: SilverFast Multiexposure and Scanner Dynamic Range] by Dietmar Wueller, Image Engineering, February 5, 2007, retrieved December 26, 2010 (pdf)</ref> This is accomplished by scanning the original multiple times with different [[Shutter speed|exposure times]], increasing the dynamic range and preserving detail in the light and shadow areas of the image.<ref>Patrick Wagner, [http://www.filmscanner.info/en/FragenSilverFast.html#MultiExposure Which kind of quality increase does MultiExposure provide?], FAQ, Scan Software Silverfast, filmscanner.info/ScanDig, retrieved December 26, 2010.</ref> Multi-Exposure does not work with reflective originals and differs from "Multi-Sampling," which also scans multiple times but with unaltered exposure.

==== PhotoProof ====
PhotoProof is a tool for color-true and binding processing of images from digital cameras. The image optimization is done in the [[RGB color space]]. When activating PhotoProof, the user will immediately see a [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] simulation of the image by means of RGB softproofing on the calibrated monitor. Thereafter a color-true contact proof can be created on any suitable, calibrated output device. The user just has to choose the [[ICC profile]] for the printer and the [[FOGRA]] media wedge to be embedded. The embedded media wedge is used as a reference for a true-to-color proof.

==== ColorServer ====
ColorServer executes the processes of color conversion, [[Image scaling|scaling]], sharpening, [[Color_printing#Color_separation_process|separation]], and optimization of image data automatically (even [[batch processing]]) in the 48-bit color space. The possibility of saving [[High dynamic range imaging|high dynamic range]] images in the [[JPEG 2000]] format assures maximum compression of image data without loss of quality. JPEG 2000 also allows a compression ratio of 10:1 without any visible loss of image quality.

== IT8 calibration ==
[[Image:IT8target.jpg|thumb|250px|IT8.7/1 target by [[LaserSoft Imaging]]]]
The process chain (original - scanner / digital camera - monitor - printer) requires device calibration for accurate color reproduction. [[IT8]] calibration runs automatically in SilverFast, using a combination of [[barcode]] technology and auto-alignment. SilverFast also utilizes the scanner as a measuring device to create an [[ICC profile]] for printer calibration.<ref>[http://www.silverfast.com/PDF/printer_calibration_review_en.pdf Nadir Magazine: scanner- and printer-Calibration with SilverFast Ai IT8] by Agostino Maiello</ref>

== Supported devices ==
The SilverFast website lists over 325 supported scanners<ref>[http://www.silverfast.com/product/en.html Products supported by SilverFast], LaserSoft Imaging</ref> and 214 supported digital cameras.<ref name=DC_camera_list>{{cite web |title=List of digital cameras supported by SilverFast |url=http://www.silverfast.com/show/dc-cameras-raw/en.html }}</ref>
Inexpensive (sub-US$100) Microsoft Windows-only 35mm USB scanners sold under various names are generally not supported. Each scanner model requires a separate license.

== Heidelberg drum scanner ==
SilverFast Ai Studio supports high-end prepress [[Image scanner#Drum|drum scanners]] made by [[Heidelberger Druckmaschinen|Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG]] (Linotype - Hell) on  Microsoft Windows 2000, XP, Vista and 7, as well as Mac OS X 10.3-10.5 operating systems. Supported models include the Chromagraph 3300/3400, Tango/XL, Topaz, Nexscan, and Primescan.
