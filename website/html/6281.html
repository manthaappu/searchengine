==Purpose==
The problem with having a complicated [[Electronic circuit| circuit]] (i.e. one with many elements, such as [[logic gate| logical gates]]) is that each element takes up physical space in its implementation and costs time and money to produce in itself.

==Example==
While there are many ways to minimize a circuit, this is an example that minimizes (or simplifies) a boolean function. Note that the boolean function carried out by the circuit is directly related to the algebraic expression from which the function is implemented.<ref>M. Mano, C. Kime. "Logic and Computer Design Fundamentals" (Fourth Edition). Pg 54</ref>
Consider the circuit used to represent <math>(A \wedge \bar{B}) \vee (\bar{A} \wedge B)</math>. It is evident that two negations, two conjunctions, and a disjunction are used in this statement. This means that to build the circuit one would need two [[Inverter (logic gate)|inverters]], two [[AND gate]]s, and an [[OR gate]].

We can simplify (minimize) the circuit by applying logical identities or using intuition. Since the example states that A is true when B is false or the other way around, we can conclude that this simply means <math>A \neq B</math>. In terms of logical gates, [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] simply means an [[XOR gate]] (exclusive or). Therefore, <math>(A \wedge \bar{B}) \vee (\bar{A} \wedge B) \iff A \neq B</math>. Then the two circuits shown below are equivalent:

You can additionally check the correctness of the result using a [[truth table]].
