'''Blue Obelisk''' is an informal group of chemists who promote [[Open Data]], [[Open Source]], and [[Open Standards]]; it was initiated by [[Peter Murray-Rust]] and others in 2005.<ref>The Blue Obelisk, [[Chemistry Development Kit#CDK News|CDK News]], 2005, 2, 43&ndash;46</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Guha | first1 = R | last2 = Howard | first2 = MT | last3 = Hutchison | first3 = GR | last4 = Murray-Rust | first4 = P | last5 = Rzepa | first5 = H | last6 = Steinbeck | first6 = C | last7 = Wegner | first7 = J | last8 = Willighagen | first8 = EL | title = The Blue Obelisk-interoperability in chemical informatics | journal = Journal of chemical information and modeling | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 991â€“8 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16711717 | doi = 10.1021/ci050400b }}</ref> Multiple open source [[cheminformatics]] associate themselves with the Blue Obelisk, among which, in alphabetical order, [[Bioclipse]], [[Chemistry Development Kit]], [[JChemPaint]], [[JOELib]], [[Kalzium]], [[Openbabel]], [http://www.opensmiles.org/ OpenSMILES], and [http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/ UsefulChem].

The project has handed out personal awards for achievements in promoting Open Data, Open Source and Open Standards. Among those who received a Blue Obelisk Award are Christoph Steinbeck (2006), Geoff Hutchinson (2006), Bob Hanson (2006), Egon Willighagen (2007), Jean-Claude Bradley (2007), Ola Spjuth (2007), Noel O'Boyle (2010), Rajarshi Guha (2010), Cameron Neylon (2010), Alex Wade (2010), Nina Jeliazkova (2010), [[Henry Rzepa]] (2011), and Dan Zaharevitz (2011).<ref>http://blueobelisk.sourceforge.net/wiki/Blue_Obelisk_Awards</ref>
