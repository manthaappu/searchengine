A '''homophone''' is a word that is [[Pronunciation|pronounced]] the same as another word but differs in meaning. The words may be [[Spelling|spelled]] the same, such as [[wikt:rose#Noun|''rose'']] (flower) and [[wikt:rose#Verb|''rose'']] (past tense of "rise"), or differently, such as ''[[Carat (unit)|carat]]'', ''[[caret]]'', and ''[[carrot]]'', or ''to'', ''two'', and ''too''. Homophones that are spelled the same are also both [[homographs]] and [[homonyms]].<ref>According to the strict sense of homonyms as words with the same spelling ''and'' pronunciation; however, homonyms according to the loose sense common in nontechnical contexts are words with the same spelling ''or'' pronunciation, in which case all homophones are also homonyms. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/homonym?r=66 Random House Unabridged Dictionary entry for "homonym"] at Dictionary.com</ref> Homophones that are spelled differently are also called '''heterographs'''. The term "homophone" may also apply to units longer or shorter than words, such as phrases, letters or groups of letters that are pronounced the same as another phrase, letter or group of letters.

The word derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''homo-'' (ὁμο-), "same", and ''phōnḗ'' (φωνή), "voice, utterance".   The opposite is ''heterophone''s: similar, but not phonetically identical words that have the same meaning.

==In wordplay and games==
Homophones are often used to create [[pun]]s and to deceive the reader (as in [[crossword|crossword puzzles]]) or to suggest multiple meanings. The last usage is common in [[poetry]] and creative [[literature]]. An example of this is seen in [[Dylan Thomas]]'s radio play ''Under Milk Wood'': "The shops in mourning" where ''mourning'' can be heard as ''mourning'' or ''morning''. Another vivid example is [[Thomas Hood]]'s use of 'birth' & 'berth' and "told' & 'toll'd' (tolled) in his poem "Faithless Sally Brown":

:His death, which happen'd in his berth,
:At forty-odd befell:
:They went and told the sexton, and
:The sexton toll'd the bell.
In some accents, various sounds have [[phonemic differentiation|merged]] in that they are no longer distinctive, and thus words that differ only by those sounds in an accent that maintains the distinction (a [[minimal pair]]) are homophonous in the accent with the merger. Some examples from [[English language|English]] are:
:''pin'' and ''pen'' in many [[Southern American English|southern American accents]].
:''merry'', ''marry'', and ''Mary'' in most American accents.
:The pairs ''do'', ''due'' and ''forward'', ''foreword'' are homophonous in most American accents but not in most British accents.
:The pairs ''talk'', ''torque'', and ''court'', ''caught'' are distinguished in [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]] accents such as [[Scottish English]] and most dialects of American English, but are homophones in many non-rhotic accents such as British [[Received Pronunciation]].

Homophones of multiple words or phrases (as sometimes seen in [[word game]]s) are also known as "[[oronym]]s". This term was coined by [[Gyles Brandreth]] and first published in his book ''The Joy of Lex'' (1980), and it was used in the [[BBC]] programme ''Never Mind the Full Stops'', which also featured Brandreth as a guest.

Examples of "oronyms" (which may only be true homophones in certain dialects of English) include:
:"ice cream" vs. "I scream" (as in the popular song "I scream. You scream. We all scream for ice cream.")
:"euthanasia" vs. "[[Youth in Asia]]"
:"depend" vs. "deep end"
:"the sky" vs. "this guy" (most notably as a [[mondegreen]] in [[Purple Haze]] by [[Jimi Hendrix]])
:"four candles" vs. "fork handles"
:"sand which is there" vs. "sandwiches there"
:"example" vs. "egg sample"
:"some others" vs. "some mothers"
:"night rain" vs. "night train"
:"minute" vs. "my newt"
:"Long Island" vs. "lawn guy land"

In his Appalachian comedy routine, American comedian [[Jeff Foxworthy]] frequently uses oronyms which play on exaggerated "country" accents. Notable examples include:

:Initiate: "My wife ate two sandwiches, ''initiate'' [and then she ate] a bag o' tater chips."<br>Mayonnaise: "''Mayonnaise'' [Man, there is] a lot of people here tonight."<br>Innuendo: "Hey dude I saw a bird fly ''innuendo'' [in your window]."<br>Moustache: "I ''Moustache'' [must ask] you a question..."

[[Malapropism]]s, which often create a similar comic effect, are usually near-homophones. See also [[Eggcorn]].

==Use in psychological research==
===Pseudo-homophones===
Pseudo-homophones are [[pseudoword]]s that are [[phonetic]]ally identical to a word. For example, groan/grone and crane/crain are pseudo-homophone pairs, whereas plane/plain is a homophone pair since both letter strings are recognised words. Both types of pairs are used in [[lexical decision task]]s to investigate [[word recognition]].<ref>Martin, R. C. (1982). The pseudohomophone effect: The role of visual  similarity in nonword decisions. Quarterly Journal of Experimental
Psychology, 34A, 395-409.</ref>

===Use as ambiguous information===
Homophones where one spelling is of a threatening nature and one is not (''e.g.'' slay/sleigh, war/wore) have been used in studies of [[anxiety]] as a test of cognitive models that those with high anxiety tend to interpret ambiguous information in a threatening manner.<ref>Mogg K, Bradley BP, Miller T, Potts H, Glenwright J, Kentish J (1994). Interpretation of homophones related to threat: Anxiety or response bias effects? ''Cognitive Therapy and Research'', '''18'''(5), 461-77</ref>
