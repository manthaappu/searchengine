'''Text Mode Demo Contest''' (TMDC) is a semi-annual [[text mode]] [[demo (computer programming)| demo]] competition organized by [[tAAt ry]] and held over the internet. The inherent limitations of text mode graphics create unique challenges for [[demosceners]]. To help promote the event, a text mode invitation [[Demo (computer programming)|demo]] is released ahead of the competition. The competition is held between the 11.11 and the 12.12 every year. One charming aspect of the Text Mode Demo Competition is the technical limitation of the Text Mode. For some demosceners this is a strange thing, other like the challenging factor about it and therefore see this as some good oldschool-flavored democoding.

In early 2008, after TMDC 10, Jari Komppa officially announced he would no longer organize TMDC. Shortly after, some members of the Northern Dragons - themselves long-time participants of the compo - decided, with the agreement of tAAt, to revive the competition.
