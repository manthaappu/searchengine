Y in the emblem refers to the [[Fixed point combinator]] and the reappearance of the picture in itself refers to the [[recursion]].]]

The '''Knights of the Lambda Calculus''' is a semi-fictional organization of expert [[Lisp programming language|LISP]] and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] [[Hacker (computing)|hacker]]s. The name refers to the [[lambda calculus]], a mathematical formalism invented by [[Alonzo Church]], with which LISP is intimately connected, and references the [[Knights Templar]].

There is no actual organization that goes by the name ''Knights of the Lambda Calculus''; it mostly only exists as a [[hacker culture]] in-joke. The concept most likely originated at [[MIT]]. For example, in the [[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs]] [http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/ video lectures], one of the lecturers presents the audience with the button, saying they are now members of this special group. However, a "well-known LISPer" has been known to give out buttons with Knights insignia on them, and some people have claimed to have membership in the Knights.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/K/Knights-of-the-Lambda-Calculus.html | title = Knights of the Lambda Calculus | work = Jargon File | last = Raymond | first = Eric | accessdate = 2009-05-02 }}</ref>

==In popular culture==

A group that evolved from or is similar to them, called ''The Knights of Eastern Calculus'' make a major appearance in the [[anime]] series [[Serial Experiments Lain]]. References to [[MIT]] professors and other American computer scientists are prominent in Episode 11 of the series. At one point in the anime, Lain is seen with code displayed on her handheld device that appears to be LISP.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://web.mit.edu/anime/www/resources_mitinanime.shtml | title = MIT Anime Club :: Appearance of MIT in Anime}}</ref>
