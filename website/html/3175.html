'''BSD/OS''' (originally called '''BSD/386''' and sometimes known as '''BSDi''') was a proprietary version of the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] [[operating system]] developed by [[Berkeley Software Design]], Inc. (BSDi).

BSD/OS had a reputation for reliability in [[server (computing)|server]] roles; the renowned Unix programmer and author [[W. Richard Stevens]] used it for his own personal [[web server]] for this reason.<ref>[http://www.kohala.com/start/rstevensfaq.html Rich Stevens' FAQ]</ref>

==History==
BSDi was formed in 1991 by members of the [[Computer Systems Research Group]] (CSRG) at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] to develop and sell a proprietary version of BSD Unix for [[PC compatible]] systems with [[Intel 386]] (or later) processors. This made use of work previously done by [[Bill Jolitz]] to port BSD to the PC platform.

BSD/386 1.0 was released in March 1993. The company sold licenses and support for it, taking advantage of terms in the [[BSD License]] which permitted use of the BSD software in proprietary systems, as long as credit was given to the University. The company in turn contributed code and resources to the development of non-proprietary BSD operating systems.
In the meantime, Jolitz had left BSDi and independently released an [[open source]] BSD for PCs, called [[386BSD]].

BSD/386 licenses (including [[source code]]) were priced at $995, much less than [[AT&T]] [[UNIX System V]] source licenses, a fact highlighted in their advertisements.<ref name=McKusick>McKusick, M. K. (1999). Twenty Years of Berkeley Unix - From AT&T-Owned to Freely Redistributable. Retrieved July 27, 2006, from http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/kirkmck.html</ref>  As part of the settlement of [[USL v. BSDi]], BSDI substituted code that had been written for the University's 4.4 BSD-Lite release for disputed code in their OS, effective with release 2.0. By the time of this release, the "386" designation had become dated, and BSD/386 was renamed "BSD/OS". Later releases of BSD/OS also supported [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] [[SPARC]]-based systems.

The marketing of BSD/OS became increasingly focused on [[Internet]] server applications. However, the increasingly tight market for [[Unix-like operating system|Unix-compatible software]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s hurt sales of BSD/OS. On one end of the market, it lacked the certification of [[the Open Group]] to bear the UNIX trademark, and the sales force and hardware support of the larger Unix vendors.  Simultaneously, it lacked the negligible acquisition cost of the open source BSDs and [[GNU/Linux]]. BSD/OS was acquired by [[Wind River Systems]] in April 2001<ref>[http://www.windriver.com/news/press/pr.html?ID=436 Press release: ''Wind River to Acquire BSDi Software Assets, Extending Development Platforms to Include Robust UNIX-based Operating Systems for Embedded Devices'']</ref>. Wind River discontinued sales of BSD/OS at the end of 2003, with support terminated at the end of 2004.
