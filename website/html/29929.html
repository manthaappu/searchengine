In [[computer science]], '''primitive data type''' can refer to either of the following concepts:{{Fact|date=May 2009}}
* a ''basic type'' is a [[data type]] provided by a [[programming language]] as a basic building block. Most languages allow more complicated ''[[composite type]]s'' to be recursively constructed starting from basic types.
* a ''built-in type'' is a data type for which the programming language provides built-in support.

In most programming languages, all basic data types are built-in. In addition, many languages also provide a set of composite data types. Opinions vary as to whether a built-in type that is not basic should be considered "primitive".{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

Depending on the language and its implementation, primitive data types may or may not have a one-to-one correspondence with objects in the computer's memory. However, one usually expects operations on basic primitive data types to be the fastest language constructs there are.{{Fact|date=May 2009}} Integer addition, for example, can be performed as a single machine instruction, and some [[central processing unit|processors]] offer specific instructions to process sequences of characters with a single instruction. In particular, the [[C (programming language)|C]] standard mentions that "a <nowiki>'plain'</nowiki> int object has the natural size suggested by the architecture of the execution environment". This means that <code>int</code> is likely to be 32 bits long on a 32-bit architecture. Basic primitive types are almost always [[value type]]s.

Most languages do not allow the behavior or capabilities of primitive (either built-in or basic) data types to be modified by programs. Exceptions include [[Smalltalk]], which permits all data types to be extended within a program, adding to the operations that can be performed on them or even redefining the built-in operations.

==Overview==
The actual range of primitive data types that is available is dependent upon the specific programming language that is being used. For example, in [[C (programming language)|C]], [[string (computer science)|strings]] are a composite but built-in data type, whereas in modern dialects of [[BASIC]] and in [[JavaScript]], they are assimilated to a primitive data type that is both basic and built-in.

Classic basic primitive types may include:
* [[character (computing)|Character]] (<code>character</code>, <code>char</code>);
* [[integer (computer science)|Integer]] (<code>integer</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>byte</code>) with a variety of [[precision (computer science)|precisions]];
* [[Floating-point number]] (<code>float</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>real</code>, <code>double precision</code>);
* [[fixed-point arithmetic|Fixed-point number]] (<code>fixed</code>) with a variety of [[precision (computer science)|precisions]] and a programmer-selected [[order of magnitude|scale]].
* [[Boolean datatype|Boolean]] having the values '''true''' and '''false'''.
* [[reference (computer science)|Reference]] (also called a ''[[pointer (computing)|pointer]]'' or ''handle''), a small value referring to another object's address in memory, possibly a much larger one.

More sophisticated types which can be built-in include:
* [[Tuple]]s in [[ML (programming language)|ML]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]]
* [[Linked list]]s in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]
* [[Complex number]]s in [[Fortran]], [[C (programming language)#C99|C (C99)]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Perl 6]]
* [[Rational number]]s in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Perl 6]]
* [[Hash table]]s in various guises, in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]]
* [[First class function]]s, [[closure (computer science)|closures]], [[continuation]]s in languages that support [[functional programming]] such as [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[ML (programming language)|ML]], [[Perl 6]] and [[C Sharp 3.0|C# 3.0]]

==Specific primitive data types==
===Integer numbers===
An integer data type can hold a whole number, but no fraction. Integers may be either signed (allowing negative values) or unsigned (nonnegative values only). Unsigned Integer types are in general not available for [[Java (programming language)|Java]]<ref name=unsignedjava>{{cite web|url=http://www.darksleep.com/player/JavaAndUnsignedTypes.html|title=Java and unsigned int, unsigned short, unsigned byte, unsigned long, etc. (Or rather, the lack thereof) |date=2009-11-05 |first=Sean R.|last=Owens|accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref>. Typical sizes of integers are:

Literals for integers consist of a sequence of digits. Most programming languages disallow use of commas for [[digit grouping]], although [[Fortran]] (77, 90, and above, fixed form source but not free form source) allows embedded spaces, and [[Perl]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], and [[D (programming language)|D]] allow embedded [[underscore]]s. Negation is indicated by a minus sign (−) before the value. Examples of integer literals are:

* 42
* 10000
* −233000

===Booleans===
A [[Boolean datatype|boolean]] type, typically denoted "bool" or "boolean", is a single-bit type that can be either "true" or "false". In some languages (e.g., [[C++]]), boolean values may be implicitly converted to integers, usually according to the mapping false → 0 and true → 1 (for example, <code>true + true</code> would be a valid expression evaluating to 2), but other languages (e.g., [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]]) disallow this.

===Floating-point numbers===
A [[floating-point]] number represents a limited-precision [[rational number]] that may have a fractional part. These numbers are stored internally in a format equivalent to [[scientific notation]], typically in [[binary numeral system|binary]] but sometimes in [[decimal]]. Because floating-point numbers have limited precision, only a subset of [[real number|real]] or [[rational number|rational]] numbers are exactly representable; other numbers can be represented only approximately.

Many languages have both a [[single precision]] (often called "float") and a [[double precision]] type.

Literals for floating point numbers include a decimal point, and typically use "e" or "E" to denote scientific notation. Examples of floating-point literals are:

* 20.0005
* 99.9
* −5000.12
* 6.02e23

Some languages (e.g., [[Fortran]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]]) also have a [[complex number]] type comprising two floating-point numbers: a real part and an imaginary part.

===Fixed-point numbers===
A [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] number represents a limited-precision [[rational number]] that may have a fractional part. These numbers are stored internally in a scaled-integer form, typically in [[binary numeral system|binary]] but sometimes in [[decimal]]. Because fixed-point numbers have limited precision, only a subset of [[real number|real]] or [[rational number|rational]] numbers are exactly representable; other numbers can be represented only approximately. Fixed-point numbers also tend to have a more limited range of values than [[floating point]], and so the programmer must be careful to avoid overflow in intermediate calculations as well as the final results.

===Characters and strings===

A [[character (computing)|character]] type (typically called "char") may contain a single [[letter (alphabet)|letter]], [[numerical digit|digit]], [[punctuation mark]], or [[control character]]. Some languages have two or more character types, for example a single-byte type for [[ASCII]] characters and a multi-byte type for [[Unicode]] characters. The term "character type" is normally used even for types whose values more precisely represent [[code unit]]s, for example a [[UTF-16]] code unit as in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[JavaScript]].

Characters may be combined into [[string (computer science)|strings]]. The string data can include numbers and other numerical symbols but will be treated as text.

In most languages, a string is equivalent to an array of characters or code units, but [[Java (programming language)|Java]] treats them as distinct types (<code>java.lang.String</code> and <code>char[]</code>). Other languages (such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and many dialects of [[BASIC]]) have no separate character type; strings with a length of one are normally used to represent (single code unit) characters.

Literals for characters and strings are usually surrounded by [[quotation marks]]: sometimes, single quotes (') are used for characters and double quotes (") are used for strings.

Examples of character literals in C syntax are:
* 'A'
* '4'
* '$'
* '\t' ([[tab key|tab character]])

Examples of string literals in C syntax are:
* "A"
* "Hello World"

===Numeric data type ranges===
Each numeric data type has its maximum and minimum value known as the [[range (computer science)|range]]. Attempting to store a number outside the range may lead to compiler/runtime errors, or to incorrect calculations (due to [[truncation]]) depending on the language being used.

The range of a variable is based on the number of bytes used to save the value, and an integer data type is usually able to store <math>2^n</math> values (where <math>n</math> is the number of [[bit]]s that contribute to the value). For other data types (e.g. [[floating point]] values) the range is more complicated and will vary depending on the method used to store it. There are also some types that do not use entire bytes, e.g. a boolean that requires a single [[bit]], and represents a [[binary numeral system|binary]] value (although in practice a byte is often used, with the remaining 7 bits being redundant). Some programming languages (such as [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]) also allow the opposite direction, that is, the programmer defines the range and precision needed to solve a given problem and the compiler chooses the most appropriate integer or floating point type automatically.
