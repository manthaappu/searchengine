A '''kludge''' (or '''kluge''') is a [[workaround]], a [[quick-and-dirty]] solution, a clumsy or inelegant, yet effective, solution to a problem, typically using parts that are cobbled together. This term is diversely used in fields such as [[computer science]], [[aerospace engineering]], [[Internet slang]], and [[evolutionary neuroscience]].

==Linguistics==
The present word has alternate spellings (''[[Wikt:kludge|kludge]]'' and ''[[Wikt:kluge|kluge]]'') and pronunciations ({{IPA-en|ˈklʌdʒ|IPA}} and {{IPA-en|ˈkluːdʒ|}}, rhyming with ''fudge'' and ''stooge'' respectively), and several proposed [[etymologies]]. 

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2nd ed., 1989) '''kludge''' entry cites one source for this word's earliest recorded usage, definition, and [[etymology]]: Jackson W. Granholm's 1962 "How to Design a Kludge" article, which appeared in the American [[computer magazine]] ''[[Datamation]]''<ref>{{cite

<blockquote>'''kludge''' ({{IPA-en|kluːdʒ|}}) Also '''kluge'''. [J. W. Granholm's jocular invention: see first quot.; cf. also ''bodge'' v., ''fudge'' v.]<ref>This ''OED2'' defines these two ''kludge'' [[Cognate (etymology)|cogates]] as ''bodge'' "to patch or mend clumsily" and ''fudge'' "to fit together or adjust in a clumsy, makeshift, or dishonest manner".</ref><br>
'An ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a distressing whole' (Granholm); esp. in ''Computing'', a machine, system, or program that has been improvised or 'bodged' together; a hastily improvised and poorly thought-out solution to a fault or 'bug'. …<br>
The word 'kludge' is...derived from the same root as the German ''Kluge''..., originally meaning 'smart' or 'witty'.... 'Kludge' eventually came to mean 'not so smart' or 'pretty ridiculous'. </blockquote>
The German surname [[Kluge]] derives from [[Wikt:klug#German|klug]] "prudent; wise". Although the ''OED2'' notes Granholm was "jocular", it accepts his ironic etymology from a fictional "Fink and Wiggles" for [[Funk & Wagnalls]] lexicographer. 
<blockquote>A phone call to Phineas Burling can be revealing. Phineas Burling is the Chief calligrapher with the Fink and Wiggles Publishing Company, Inc. Fink and Wiggles are, of course, the well known publishers of the NEW MULTILINGUAL DICTIONARY. According to Burling, the word "kludge" first appeared in the English language in the early fifteen-hundreds. It was imported into the geographic region of the lowlands between King's Lynn (then Bishop's Lynn) and the Isle of Ely by Dutch settlers arriving there to reclaim tidelands of the Wash as rutabaga fields. … <br>
The word "kludge" is, according to Burling, derived from the same root as the German "klug" (Dutch ''kloog'', Swedish ''Klag'', Danish ''Klog'', Gothic ''Klaugen'', Lettish ''Kladnis'' and Sanskrit ''Veklaunn''), originally meaning "smart" or "witty". In the typical machinations of language in evolutionary growth, the word "Kludge" eventually came to mean "not so smart" or "pretty ridiculous". Today the leading definition given by the NEW MULTILINGUAL is, "An ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a distressing whole." <br>
It is in this latter sense that "Kludge" is used by computer hardware men. Today "kludge" forms one of the most beloved words in design terminology, and it stands ready for handy application to the work of anyone who gins up 110-volt circuitry to plug into the 220 VAC source. The building of a Kludge, however, is not work for amateurs. There is a certain, indefinable, masochistic finesse that must go into true Kludge building. The professional can spot it instantly. The amateur may readily presume that "that's the way computers are".<ref>{{cite book

This ''OED2'' entry also includes the verbal '''kludge''' "to improvise with a kludge or kludges" and '''kludgemanship''' "skill in designing or applying kludges".

The [[Jargon File]] (a.k.a. ''The New Hacker's Dictionary''), which is a [[glossary]] of [[internet slang]] maintained by [[Eric S. Raymond]], differentiates ''kludge'' from ''kluge'' and cites usage examples predating 1962. 
<blockquote>'''kludge''' <br>
1. /kluhj/ n. Incorrect (though regrettably common) spelling of ''kluge'' (US). These two words have been confused in American usage since the early 1960s, and widely confounded in Great Britain since the end of World War II.<br>
2. [TMRC] A ''crock'' that works. (A long-ago ''Datamation'' article by Jackson Granholme [sic] similarly said: "An ill-assorted collection of poorly matching parts, forming a distressing whole.") <br>
3. v. To use a kludge to get around a problem. "I've kludged around it for now, but I'll fix it up properly later."<ref name="jargon">{{cite web

This Jargon File entry notes ''kludge'' apparently derives via British military slang from [[Scots language|Scots]] ''kludge'' or ''kludgie'' meaning "a common toilet", and became confused with U.S. ''kluge'' during or after World War II. 
<blockquote>'''kluge''': /klooj/ [from the German 'klug', clever; poss. related to Polish & Russian 'klucz' (a key, a hint, a main point)] <br>
1. n. A [[Rube Goldberg]] (or [[Heath Robinson]]) device, whether in hardware or software. <br>
2. n. A clever programming trick intended to solve a particular nasty case in an expedient, if not clear, manner. Often used to repair bugs. Often involves ad-hockery and verges on being a crock. <br>
3. n. Something that works for the wrong reason. <br>
4. vt. To insert a kluge into a program. "I've kluged this routine to get around that weird bug, but there's probably a better way." <br>
5. [WPI] n. A feature that is implemented in a rude manner.<ref name="jargon"/> </blockquote>
This entry notes ''kluge'', which is now often spelled ''kludge'', "was the original spelling, reported around computers as far back as the mid-1950s and, at that time, used exclusively of hardware kluges". The Jargon File gives possible etymologies from [[navy|naval]] slang (cf. [[jury rig]]) or printing equipment.

First, ''kluge'' "was common Navy slang in the WWII era for any piece of electronics that worked well on shore but consistently failed at sea". A 1947 article in the ''New York Folklore Quarterly'' recorded the classic [[shaggy dog story]] "'Murgatroyd the Kluge Maker' then current in the Armed Forces, in which a 'kluge' was a complex and puzzling artifact with a trivial function."<ref>{{cite book

|volume=III, No. 4
|pages=285–297
|author=Agnes Nolan Underwood
|date=Winter 1947
|publisher=New York Folklore Society}}</ref> When Murgatroyd enlists into the Navy, he gives "kluge maker" as his occupation. Because none of the officers knows what a kluge is, Murgatroyd ascends through the ranks, eventually becoming "kluge maker, first class". When an admiral demands that Murgatroyd build him a kluge, he constructs a strange object with springs in all directions. He then drops it over the side of the ship into the ocean, where it goes "kkluuge".

Second, the "Kluge paper feeder" was an automatic paper feeder for [[printing press]]es, which was first manufactured by [[Brandtjen and Kluge]] in 1919. It supposedly had a [[Rube Goldberg machine]] reputation, and was "temperamental, subject to frequent breakdowns, and devilishly difficult to repair — but oh, so clever!"

The Jargon File further includes '''kluge around''' "to avoid a bug or difficult condition by inserting a kluge", '''kluge up''' "to lash together a quick hack to perform a task". After Granholm's 1962 "How to Design a Kludge" article popularized the ''kluge'' variant ''kludge'', both were interchangeably used and confused. The Jargon File concludes:
<blockquote>The result of this history is a tangle. Many younger U.S. hackers pronounce the word as /klooj/ but spell it, incorrectly for its meaning and pronunciation, as 'kludge'. … British hackers mostly learned /kluhj/ orally, use it in a restricted negative sense and are at least consistent. European hackers have mostly learned the word from written American sources and tend to pronounce it /kluhj/ but use the wider American meaning! Some observers consider this mess appropriate in view of the word's meaning. </blockquote>

Other suggested [[folk etymologies]] or [[backronyms]] for ''kludge'' or ''kluge'' is from '''k'''lumsy, '''l'''ame, '''u'''gly, '''d'''umb, but '''g'''ood '''e'''nough, or '''k'''lutzy, '''l'''ashup, '''u'''nder, '''g'''oing, '''e'''ngineering.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

== In aerospace engineering ==
In aerospace design a kluge was a temporary design using separate commonly available components that were not flight worthy to proof the design and enable concurrent software development while the integrated components were developed and manufactured. The term was in common enough use to appear in a fictional movie about the US space program.<ref>[[Marooned (film)]]. 1969. Dialog between space crew and Ted approximately 30 minutes into the movie, following capsule power down. Ted says, "I'm in Huntsville kludging up a simulator of the XRV." The film was based on the [[Marooned (novel)|1964 novel]] of the same name.</ref>

Perhaps the ultimate kludge was the first [[United States|US]] [[space station]], [[Skylab]]. Its two major components, the Saturn Workshop and the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]], began their development as separate projects (the SWS was kludged from the [[S-IVB]] stage of the [[Saturn 1B]] and [[Saturn V]] launch vehicles, the ATM was kludged from an early design for the descent stage of the [[Apollo Lunar Module]]). Later the SWS and ATM were folded into the [[Apollo Applications Program]], but the components were to have been launched separately, then docked together in orbit. In the final design, the SWS and ATM were launched together, but for the single-launch concept to work, the ATM had to pivot 90 degrees on a truss structure from its launch position to its on-orbit orientation, clearing the way for the crew to dock its [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] at the axial docking port of the Multiple Docking Adapter.

The Airlock Module's manufacturer, [[McDonnell Douglas]], even recycled the hatch design from its [[Project Gemini|Gemini spacecraft]] and kludged what was originally designed for the conical Gemini Command Module onto the cylindrical Skylab Airlock Module.  The Skylab project, managed by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]], was seen by the Manned Spacecraft Center (later [[Johnson Space Center]]) as an invasion of its historical role as the NASA center for manned spaceflight.  Thus, MSC personnel missed no opportunity to disparage the Skylab project, calling it "the kludge."

== In computer science ==

In modern [[computer science|computing]] terminology, a kludge (or often a "[[hack (technology)|hack]]") is a solution to a problem, doing a task, or fixing a system (whether hardware or software) that is inefficient, inelegant, or even unfathomable, but which nevertheless (more or less) works. To ''kludge around something'' is to avoid a [[Computer bug|bug]] or some difficult condition by building a kludge, perhaps relying on properties of the bug itself to assure proper operation. It is somewhat similar in spirit to a [[workaround]], only without the grace. A kludge is often used to change the behavior of a system after it is finished, without having to make fundamental changes. Sometimes to keep backwards compatibility, but often simply because it is easier. That ''something'' was often originally a [[Crock (slang)|crock]], which is why it must now be [[Hack (technology slang)|hacked]] to make it work. Note that a hack might be a kludge, but that 'hack' could be, at least in computing, ironic praise, for a quick fix solution to a frustrating problem.<ref>{{cite book

A kludge is often used to fix an unanticipated problem in an earlier kludge; this is essentially a kind of [[cruft]].

Something might be a kludge if it fails in [[corner case]]s, but this is a less common sense as such situations are not expected to come up in typical usage. More commonly, a kludge is a poorly working [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] which was expected to work well. An intimate knowledge of the context (i.e., problem domain and/or the kludge's execution environment) is typically required to build a corner case kludge. As a consequence, they are sometimes ironically praised.

An anecdotal example of a kludge involved a computer part supposedly manufactured in the [[Soviet Union]] during the 1960s. The part needed slightly delayed receipt of a signal to work. Rather than setting up a timing system, the kludge was to make the internal wires extra-long, increasing the distance and thus increasing the time the electrical signal took to reach its destination.

A variation on this use of kludge is evasion of an unknown problem or bug in a [[computer program]]. Rather than continue to struggle to find out exactly what is causing the bug and how to fix it, the programmer may hack the problem by the simple kludge of writing new code which compensates. For example, if a variable keeps ending up doubled in a certain code area, add code which divides by two when it is used, after the original code has been executed.

In computer networking, use of [[Network address translation|NAT]] (Network Address Translation) (RFC 1918) or [[Port address translation|PAT]] (Port Address Translation) to cope with the  shortage of [[Internet Protocol|IPv4]] addresses is an example of a kludge. Another common example are [[quickstart]]s like those shipped with [[OpenOffice.org]], [[Real Player]], [[Quicktime]] and [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] products, in which a bloated program that normally takes a long time to load is kept in memory to reduce the delay in starting it.

In [[FidoNet]] terminology, the term "kludge" refers to a piece of control data embedded inside a message.

==In evolutionary neuroscience==
The ''kludge'' or ''kluge'' metaphor has been adapted in fields such as [[neuroscience]] and [[evolutionary biology]], particularly in reference to the [[human brain]].

The neuroscientist [[David Linden]] discusses how [[intelligent design]] proponents have misconstrued brain anatomy.
<blockquote>The transcendent aspects of our human experience, the things that touch our emotional and cognitive core, were not given to us by a Great Engineer. These are not the latest design features of an impeccably crafted brain. Rather, at every turn, brain design has been a kludge, a workaround, a jumble, a pastiche. The things we hold highest in our human experience (love, memory, dreams, and a predisposition for religious thought) result from a particular agglomeration of ad hoc solutions that have been piled on through millions of years of evolution history. It's not that we have fundamentally human thoughts and feelings ''despite'' the kludgy design of the brain as molded by the twists and turns of evolutionary history. Rather, we have them precisely ''because'' of that history.<ref>{{cite book

The research psychologist [[Gary Marcus]]'s book ''Kluge: The Haphazard Construction of the Human Mind'' compares evolutionary kluges with engineering ones like [[manifold vacuum]]-powered [[windshield wipers]] – when you accelerated or drove uphill, "Your wipers slowed to a crawl, or even stopped working altogether."

<blockquote>For instance, the vertebrate eye's [[retina]] that is installed backward, facing the back of the head rather than the front. As a result, all kinds of stuff gets in its way, including a bunch of wiring that passes through the eye and leaves us with a pair of blind spots, one in each eye.<ref>{{cite book

== Other uses ==
In the science fiction television series ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'', genetically engineered human beings called [[Nietzschean (Andromeda)|Nietzschean]]s use the term disparagingly to refer to genetically unmodified humans.
