In [[statistics]], '''overdispersion''' is the presence of greater variability ([[statistical dispersion]]) in a data set than would be expected based on a given simple statistical model.

A common task in applied [[statistics]] is choosing a [[parametric model]] to fit a given set of empirical observations. This necessitates an assessment of the [[goodness of fit|fit]] of the chosen model. It is usually possible to choose the model parameters in such a way that the theoretical [[population mean]] of the model is approximately equal to the [[sample mean]]. However, especially for simple models with few parameters, theoretical predictions may not match empirical observations for higher [[moment (mathematics)|moment]]s. When the observed [[variance]] is higher than the variance of a theoretical model, '''overdispersion''' has occurred. Conversely, '''underdispersion''' means that there was less variation in the data than predicted. Overdispersion is a very common feature in applied data analysis because in practice, populations are frequently [[heterogeneous]] contrary to the assumptions implicit within widely used simple parametric models.

==Examples==

===Poisson===
Overdispersion is often encountered when fitting very simple parametric models, such as those based on the [[Poisson distribution]]. The Poisson distribution has one free parameter and does not allow for the variance to be adjusted independently of the mean. The choice of a distribution from the Poisson family is often dictated by the nature of the empirical data. For example, [[Poisson regression]] analysis is commonly used to model [[count data]]. If overdispersion is a feature, an alternative model with additional free parameters may provide a better fit. In the case of the count data, a Poisson mixture model like the [[negative binomial distribution]] can be used instead where the mean of the Poisson distribution can itself be thought of as a random variable drawn - in this case - from the [[gamma distribution]] thereby introducing an additional free parameter (note the resulting negative binomial distribution has 2 parameters).

===Binomial===
As a more concrete example, it has been observed that the random number of boys born to each family do not &mdash; as might be expected &mdash; conform faithfully to a [[binomial distribution]]. Instead, each family seems to skew the sex ratio of their children in favor of either boys or girls (see, for example the [[Triversâ€“Willard hypothesis]] for one possible explanation) i.e. there are too many all boy families, too many all girls families, and not enough families close to the population 51:49 boy-to-girl mean ratio thereby yielding an estimated variance that is larger than predicted by the binomial model. 

In this case, the [[beta-binomial model]] is an popular and analytically tractible alternative to the binomial that captures the overdispersion absent from the binomial model thereby providing a better fit to the observed data. To capture the heterogeneity of the families, one can think of the p parameter (proportion of boys) in the binomial model as itself a random variable (i.e. [[random effects model]]) drawn for each family from a [[beta distribution]] as the mixing distribution. The resulting compound distribution (Beta-Binomial) has an additional free parameter.

Another common model for overdispersion - when some of the observations are not [[Bernoulli distribution|Bernoulli]] - arises from introducing a [[normal distribution|normal random variable]] into a [[logistic regression|logistic model]]. Software is widely available for fitting this type of [[multilevel model]]. In this case, if the variance of the normal variable is zero, the model reduces to the classical (undispersed) [[logistic regression]]. Note that this model has an additional free parameter - namely the variance of the normal variable.

It should be noted with respect to Binomial random variables that the concept of overdispersion only makes sense if n>1 (i.e. overdispersion is nonsensical for Bernoulli random variables).

==Differences in terminology between disciplines==
Over- and underdispersion are terms which have been adopted in branches of the [[biological science]]s. In [[parasitology]], the term 'overdispersion' is generally used as defined here &mdash; meaning a distribution with a higher than expected variance. 

In some areas of [[ecology]], however, meanings have been transposed, so that overdispersion is actually taken to mean more even (lower variance) than expected. This confusion has caused some ecologists to suggest that the terms 'aggregated', or 'contagious', would be better used in ecology for 'overdispersed' <ref>Greig-Smith, P. 1983 [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f2fghtp8lA0C&dq=Quantitative+Plant+Ecology&source=gbs_navlinks_s| Quantitative Plant Ecology] ''University of California Press''</ref>. Such preferences are creeping into [[parasitology]] too<ref>Poulin, R. (2006) [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8336.html Evolutionary Ecology of Parasites] ''Princeton University Press''</ref>. Generally this suggestion has not been heeded, and confusion persists in the literature. 

Furthermore in [[demography]] overdispersion is often evident in the analysis of death count data, but demographers prefer the term 'unobserved [[heterogeneity]]'.
