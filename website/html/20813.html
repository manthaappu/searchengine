The '''Konami Justifier''' was a [[light gun]] used in numerous [[video arcade]] and [[home console]] games developed and/or published by [[Konami]] and [[Sega]]. Konami manufactured variations of the gun for the [[Sega Genesis]], [[Sega CD]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Nintendo]], and [[PlayStation]] consoles.  The gun was similar in appearance to a [[Colt Python]]. During the early 1990s, it was controversial in that it was realistic and used in equally realistic, violent video games. It was used as an example in the United States of America (US) congressional hearings of 1992 to 1993.  The Sega and Nintendo versions include a blue revolver looking gun that connects to the console and a rare pink Justifier of similar design that plugs into either blue gun rather than into the console.  The Sony version of the lightgun (Sony ID: SLEH-00005, SLUH-00017) is green in color and only works in the first controller slots on the original design of the PlayStation 2. The Sony version was the first light gun on the PlayStation, the second being the [[GunCon]], which was designed by [[Namco]].
