This of Pearson Education. This of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, in the above mentioned educational book; Part 4, Chapter 11, page 307, Paragraph 6.</ref> --> is a law passed by the [[United States Congress]] in 1986, intended to reduce [[Security cracking|cracking]] of computer systems and to address federal computer-related offenses. The Act (codified as {{USC|18|1030}}) governs cases with a compelling federal interest, where computers of the federal government or certain financial institutions are involved, where the crime itself is interstate in nature, or where computers are used in interstate and foreign commerce.  

It was amended in 1988, 1994, 1996, in 2001 by the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], 2002, and in 2008 by the [[Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act]]. Subsection (b) of the act punishes anyone who not just commits or attempts to commit an offense under the Act, but also those who conspire to do so.
