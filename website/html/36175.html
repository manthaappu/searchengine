:'' '''Superscope''' is also the name of an anamorphic [[widescreen]] process<ref>[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/aspectratio.htm The WideScreen Museum: Aspect Ratio and Useable Image Area]</ref> and of an extension [[Microsoft]] has added to its [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP Server]]''<ref>[http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/3967ddab-0b28-4959-8b4d-3052c178731b1033.mspx?mfr=true Using superscopes: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.cramsession.com/articles/get-article.asp?aid=252 DHCP Server Superscopes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The '''Super Scope''', or '''Nintendo Scope''' in Europe and [[Australia]],<ref>[http://mo5.com/musee/fiche.php?id=545 French page that states "Nintendo Scope" as name]</ref><ref>[http://img413.imageshack.us/img413/5189/1003852.jpg an image of the boxart retrieved by an Australian page, which states "Nintendo Scope" and "Pal Version"]</ref> is the official [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Nintendo]] [[light gun]]. It was released in the European and North American markets, with a limited release in Japan due to a lack of consumer demand. It is a [[wireless]] gun and uses an [[infrared]] receiver which plugs into the right port of the console, comparable to the [[Menacer]] for the [[Mega Drive|Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]]. It has two action buttons, a pause button, a power switch and is powered by six [[AA battery|AA batteries]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamersgraveyard.com/repository/snes/peripherals/superscope.html |title=Super Scope |accessdate=2007-05-11}}</ref>

==Physical description==
The gun body is a [[bazooka]]-shaped device, just under 2½ feet long. Located about midway on top of the barrel are two buttons, the orange "Fire" button and the grey "Pause" button, and a switch used to turn the Super Scope off or select regular or turbo mode. In the middle on either side are two clips for attaching the sight. On the far end of the gun, on the bottom, is a six inch grip with another button labeled "Cursor".

On the end is the infrared transmitter and the lens, approximately {{convert|1|in|mm|0}} in diameter, which picks up the light from a TV. The sight mount is shaped like a wide, very shallow "U", about five inches long. The end that faces toward the shoulder mount end of the Super Scope has a round open cylinder holder, where the eyepiece goes. The other end has a short, narrow tube, which forms the sight when one looks through the eyepiece that is in-line across from it. The end of the eyepiece is very simple: it is a cylinder with the diameter of a quarter, with a removable rubber piece through which the shooter looks. The sight is designed so that the aim will be correct at a distance of {{convert|3|m|ft|0}}. The sensor is a small box, 2½" by 2½" by 1", with a standard [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] controller cord attached. On the front is an oval-shaped black area, receding back from the two sides to a red sensor about the size of a [[dime (United States coin)|dime]].

All of the Super Scope games made by Nintendo have a soft-reset to the game's main title. This is accomplished by pausing the game, then, while holding CURSOR, the FIRE button must be pressed twice.

==Detecting a target hit==
The Super Scope makes use of the scanning process used in [[cathode ray tube]] monitors, as CRTs were the only affordable TV monitors until the late 1990s. In short, the screen is drawn by a scanning [[electron]] beam that travels horizontally across each line of the screen from top to bottom. A fast [[photodiode]] will see any particular area of the screen illuminated only briefly as that point is scanned, while the [[Eye|human eye]] will see a consistent image due to [[persistence of vision]].

The Super Scope takes advantage of this in a fairly simple manner: it simply outputs a '0' signal when it sees the television [[raster scan]] and a '1' signal when it does not. Inside the console this signal is delivered to the PPU, which notes which screen [[pixel]] it is outputting at the moment the signal transitions from 1 to 0. At the end of the frame, the game software can retrieve this stored position to determine where on the screen the gun was aimed. All licensed Super Scope games include a calibration mode to account for both electrical delays and maladjustment of the [[Sight (device)|gunsight]].<ref name="snesdev">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |authorlink=Nintendo |title=Super Nintendo Entertainment System Development Manual |year=1995}}</ref>

The Super Scope ignores red light, as do many guns of this type, because red [[phosphor]]s have a much slower rate of decay than green or blue phosphors.<ref name="snesdev"/> Since the Super Scope depends on the short persistence and scan pattern of CRT pixels, it will not function with modern displays (such as [[Plasma display|plasma screens]] or [[Liquid crystal display|LCDs]]) that continuously light each pixel.

===In the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series===
In ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl|Brawl]]'', the Super Scope is an item that can be picked up and used in combat, appearing as a blaster-type weapon. Here, it can be used as a rapid-fire weapon, or charged to release a devastating super shot that can knock opponents off-screen. It is also a collectible trophy in both games.

== Reception ==
{{Refimprove|date=July 2010}}
{{Weasel|date=July 2010}}
The Super Scope had generally negative reviews, and the hardware and games that require this hardware to play had very poor sales.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The Super Scope received many complaints from many gamers indicating that the hardware was heavy and unbalanced making it difficult to use (as compared to the simple lightweight [[NES Zapper]]), high physical risks of severe headaches, eye strain, and arm pain, and the hardware had a very poor battery life.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} It was considered one of Nintendo's Worst Products behind the [[Virtual Boy]] that failed miserably at the market and similarly contributed to severe physical injuries for many gamers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} After Nintendo found out that the Super Scope had very poor sales at the market, they quickly discontinued the hardware in 1995.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
