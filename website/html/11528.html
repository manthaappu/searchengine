<html> <head> <title>EVA (benchmark)</title></head><body>'''EVA''' is a continuously running [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] project for assessing the quality of [[protein structure prediction]] and [[secondary structure prediction]] methods. Methods for predicting both [[secondary structure]] and [[tertiary structure]] - including [[homology modeling]], [[protein threading]], and [[contact order]] prediction - are compared to results from each week's newly solved [[protein structure]]s deposited in the [[Protein Data Bank]]. The project aims to determine the prediction accuracy that would be expected for non-expert users of common, publicly available prediction [[webserver]]s; this is similar to the related [[LiveBench]] project and stands in contrast to the bi-yearly benchmark [[CASP]], which aims to identify the maximum accuracy achievable by prediction experts.
