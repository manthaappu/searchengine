<html> <head> <title>KCDSA</title></head><body>'''KCDSA''' ('''Korean Certificate-based Digital Signature Algorithm''') is a [[digital signature]] algorithm created by a team led by the [[KISA|Korean Information Security Agency]] (KISA).  It is an [[ElGamal signature scheme|ElGamal]] variant, similar to the [[Digital Signature Algorithm]] and [[GOST R 34.10-94]].  The standard algorithm is implemented over <math>GF(p)</math>, but an [[elliptic curve]] variant ('''EC-KCDSA''') is also specified. 

KCDSA requires a collision-resistant [[cryptographic hash function]] that can produce a variable-sized output (from 128 to 256 bits, in 32-bit increments).  [[HAS-160]], another Korean standard, is the suggested choice.
