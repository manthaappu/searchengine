Computer source code is often written by [[computer programmer]]s. Source code is written in a [[programming language]] that usually follows one of two main [[programming paradigm|paradigms]]: [[imperative programming|imperative]] or [[declarative language|declarative]] programming. Source code may be converted into an [[executable file]] (sometimes called an executable program or a binary) by a [[compiler]] and later executed by a [[central processing unit]].

Computer programs may be categorized along functional lines: [[system software]] and [[application software]]. Two or more computer programs may run simultaneously on one computer, a process known as [[computer multitasking|multitasking]].

[[Computer programming]] is the iterative process of writing or editing [[source code]]. Editing source code involves testing, analyzing, and refining, and sometimes coordinating with other programmers on a jointly developed program.  A person who practices this skill is referred to as a computer [[programmer]],  software developer or coder. The sometimes lengthy process of computer programming is usually referred to as [[software development]]. The term [[software engineering]] is becoming popular as the process is seen as an [[engineering]] discipline.

=== Paradigms ===
Computer programs can be categorized by the [[programming language]] [[programming paradigm|paradigm]] used to produce them. Two of the main paradigms are [[imperative programming|imperative]] and [[declarative language|declarative]].

Programs written using an imperative language specify an [[algorithm]] using declarations, expressions, and statements.<ref name="cpl-ch4-75">{{cite book
  | last = Wilson
  | first = Leslie B.
  | title = Comparative Programming Languages, Second Edition
  | publisher = Addison-Wesley
  | year = 1993
  | pages = 75
  | isbn = 0-201-56885-3
}}</ref> A declaration couples a [[variable (programming)|variable]] name to a [[datatype]]. For example: <code> var x: integer; </code>. An expression yields a value. For example: <code> 2 + 2 </code> yields 4. Finally, a statement might assign an expression to a variable or use the value of a variable to alter the program's [[control flow]]. For example: <code>x := 2 + 2; if x = 4 then do_something();</code> One criticism of imperative languages is the side effect of an assignment statement on a class of variables called non-local variables.<ref name = "cpl-ch9-213"/>

Programs written using a declarative language specify the properties that have to be met by the output. They do not specify details expressed in terms of the control flow of the executing machine but of the mathematical relations between the declared objects and their properties. Two broad categories of declarative languages are [[functional language]]s and [[logical language]]s. The principle behind functional languages (like [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]) is to not allow [[side effect (computer science)|side effects]], which makes it easier to reason about programs like mathematical functions.<ref name="cpl-ch9-213">{{cite book

  | year = 1993
  | pages = 213
  | isbn = 0-201-56885-3
}}</ref> The principle behind logical languages (like [[Prolog]]) is to define the problem to be solved — the goal — and leave the detailed solution to the Prolog system itself.<ref name="cpl-ch10-244">{{cite book

}}</ref> The goal is defined by providing a list of subgoals. Then each subgoal is defined by further providing a list of its subgoals, etc. If a path of subgoals fails to find a solution, then that subgoal is [[backtracking|backtracked]] and another path is systematically attempted.

The form in which a program is created may be textual or visual. In a [[visual programming language|visual language]] program, elements are graphically manipulated rather than textually specified.

===Compiling or interpreting===
A ''computer program'' in the form of a [[human-readable]], computer programming language is called [[source code]]. Source code may be converted into an [[executable file|executable image]] by a [[compiler]] or executed immediately with the aid of an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].

Either compiled or interpreted programs might be [[execution (computing)|executed]] in a [[batch processing|batch process]] without human interaction, but interpreted programs allow a user to type [[command (computing)|commands]] in an [[session (computer science)|interactive session]]. In this case the programs are the separate commands, whose execution occurs sequentially, and thus together.  When a language is used to give commands to a software application (such as a [[shell (computing)|shell]]) it is called a [[scripting language]].

Compiled computer programs are commonly referred to as executables, binary images, or simply as [[binary file|binaries]] &mdash; a reference to the [[binary numeral system|binary]] [[file format]] used to store the executable code. Compilers are used to translate source code from a programming language into either [[object file|object code]] or [[machine code]]. Object code needs further processing to become machine code, and machine code is the [[central processing unit]]'s native [[microcode|code]], ready for execution. 

Interpreted computer programs -in a batch or interactive session- are either decoded and then immediately executed or are decoded into some efficient intermediate representation for future execution. [[BASIC]], [[Perl]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] are examples of immediately executed computer programs. Alternatively, [[Java (programming language)|Java]] computer programs are compiled ahead of time and stored as a machine independent code called [[bytecode]]. Bytecode is then executed on request by an interpreter called a [[virtual machine]].

The main disadvantage of interpreters is that computer programs run slower than when compiled. Interpreting code is slower than running the compiled version because the interpreter must [[decode]] each [[statement (programming)|statement]] each time it is loaded and then perform the desired action. However, software development may be faster using an interpreter because testing is immediate when the compiling step is omitted. Another disadvantage of interpreters is that at least one must be present on the computer during computer program execution. By contrast, compiled computer programs need no compiler present during execution.

No properties of a programming language require it to be exclusively compiled or exclusively interpreted. The categorization usually reflects the most popular method of language execution. For example, BASIC is thought of as an interpreted language and C a compiled language, despite the existence of BASIC compilers and C interpreters. Some systems use [[just-in-time compilation]] (JIT) whereby sections of the source are compiled 'on the fly' and stored for subsequent executions.

===Self-modifying programs===
A computer program in [[execution (computers)|execution]] is normally treated as being different from the [[data (computing)|data]] the program operates on. However, in some cases this distinction is blurred when a computer program modifies itself. The modified computer program is subsequently executed as part of the same program. [[Self-modifying code]] is possible for programs written in [[machine code]], [[assembly language]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[COBOL]], [[PL/1]], [[Prolog]] and [[JavaScript]] (the eval feature) among others.

==Execution and storage==<!-- This section is linked from [[Elektronika BK]] -->
Typically, computer programs are stored in [[non-volatile memory]] until requested either directly or indirectly to be [[execution (computers)|executed]] by the computer user. Upon such a request, the program is loaded into [[random access memory]], by a computer program called an [[operating system]], where it can be accessed directly by the central processor. The central processor then executes ("runs") the program, instruction by instruction, until termination. A program in execution is called a [[process (computing)|process]].<ref name="osc-ch4-97">{{cite book

  | isbn = 0-201-50480-4
}}</ref> Termination is either by normal self-termination or by error — software or hardware error.

===Embedded programs===
[[Image:USB_flash_drive.JPG|thumb|230px|left|The [[microcontroller]] on the right of this [[USB flash drive]] is controlled with embedded [[firmware]].]]
Some computer programs are embedded into hardware. A [[stored-program computer]] requires an initial computer program stored in its [[read-only memory]] to [[booting|boot]]. The boot process is to identify and initialize all aspects of the system, from [[processor register]]s to [[device driver|device controllers]] to [[volatile memory|memory]] contents.<ref name="osc-ch2-p30">{{cite book

}}</ref> Following the initialization process, this initial computer program loads the [[operating system]] and sets the [[program counter]] to begin normal operations. Independent of the host computer, a [[Peripheral|hardware device]] might have embedded [[firmware]] to control its operation. Firmware is used when the computer program is rarely or never expected to change, or when the program must not be lost when the power is off.<ref name="sco-ch1-p11">{{cite book

  | isbn = 0-13-854662-2
}}</ref>

===Manual programming===
[[Image:Dg-nova3.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Switches for manual input on a [[Data General Nova]] 3]]
Computer programs historically were manually input to the central processor via switches. An instruction was represented by a configuration of on/off settings. After setting the configuration, an execute button was pressed. This process was then repeated. Computer programs also historically were manually input via [[paper tape]] or [[punched cards]]. After the medium was loaded, the starting address was set via switches and the execute button pressed.<ref name="osc-ch1-p6">{{cite book

  | pages = 6
  | isbn = 0-201-50480-4
}}</ref>

===Automatic program generation===
[[Generative programming]] is a style of [[computer programming]] that creates [[source code]] through [[generic programming|generic]] [[class (computer science)|classes]], [[prototype-based programming|prototypes]], [[template (programming)|templates]], [[aspect (computer science)|aspects]], and [[code generation (compiler)|code generators]] to improve [[programmer]] productivity. Source code is generated with [[programming tool]]s such as a [[template processor]] or an [[integrated development environment]]. The simplest form of source code generator is a [[macro (computer science)|macro]] processor, such as the [[C preprocessor]], which replaces patterns in source code according to relatively simple rules.

[[Software engine]]s output source code or [[markup language|markup code]] that simultaneously become the input to another [[process (computing)|computer process]]. The analogy is that of one process driving another process, with the computer code being burned as fuel. [[Application server]]s are software engines that deliver applications to [[client computer]]s. For example, a [[Wiki software|Wiki]] is an application server that lets users build [[dynamic web page|dynamic content]] assembled from [[article (publishing)|articles]]. Wikis generate [[HTML]], [[CSS]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], and [[JavaScript]] which are then [[interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] by a [[web browser]].

=== Simultaneous execution===
{{seealso|Process (computing)|Multiprocessing}}
Many operating systems support [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] which enables many computer programs to appear to run simultaneously on one computer.  Operating systems may run multiple programs through [[process scheduling]] — a software mechanism to [[context switch|switch]] the CPU among processes often so users can [[time-sharing|interact]] with each program while it runs.<ref name="osc-ch4-100">{{cite book
  | last = Silberschatz
  | first = Abraham
  | title = Operating System Concepts, Fourth Edition
  | publisher = Addison-Wesley
  | year = 1994
  | pages = 100
  | isbn = 0-201-50480-4
}}</ref> Within hardware, modern day multiprocessor computers or computers with multicore processors may run multiple programs.<ref name="mcore">{{cite book

}}</ref>

One computer program can calculate simultaneously more than one operation using [[thread (computer science)|threads]] or separate [[process (computing)|processes]]. [[Multithreading (computer architecture)|Multithreading]] processors are optimized to execute multiple threads efficiently.

== Functional categories ==
Computer programs may be categorized along functional lines. The main functional categories are [[system software]] and [[application software]]. System software includes the [[operating system]] which couples [[computer hardware]] with application software.<ref name = "osc-ch1-1"/> The purpose of the operating system is to provide an environment in which application software executes in a convenient and efficient manner.<ref name="osc-ch1-1">{{cite book
  | last = Silberschatz
  | first = Abraham
  | title = Operating System Concepts, Fourth Edition
  | publisher = Addison-Wesley
  | year = 1994
  | pages = 1
  | isbn = 0-201-50480-4
}}</ref> In addition to the operating system, system software includes [[Utility software|utility programs]] that help manage and tune the computer. If a computer program is not system software then it is application software. Application software includes [[middleware]], which couples the system software with the [[user interface]]. Application software also includes utility programs that help users solve application problems, like the need for sorting.

Sometimes development environments for [[software development]] are seen as a functional category on its own, especially in the context of [[human-computer interaction]] and [[programming language design]]. Development environments gather system software (such as compilers and system's [[batch processing]] scripting languages) and application software (such as [[integrated development environment|IDEs]]) for the specific purpose of helping programmers create new programs.
