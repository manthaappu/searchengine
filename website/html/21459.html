In [[computational linguistics]], lemmatization is the algorithmic process of determining the [[lemma (linguistics)|lemma]] for a given word. Since the process may involve complex tasks such as understanding context and determining the [[part of speech]] of a word in a sentence (requiring, for example, knowledge of the [[grammar]] of a language) it can be a hard task to implement a lemmatizer for a new language.

In many languages, words appear in several ''[[inflected]]'' forms. For example, in English, the verb 'to walk' may appear as 'walk', 'walked', 'walks', 'walking'. The base form, 'walk', that one might look up in a dictionary, is called the ''[[Lemma_%28linguistics%29|lemma]]'' for the word. The combination of the base form with the [[part of speech]] is often called the ''[[lexeme]]'' of the word.

Lemmatization is closely related to [[stemming]]. The difference is that a stemmer operates on a single word ''without'' knowledge of the context, and therefore cannot discriminate between words which have different meanings depending on part of speech. However, stemmers are typically easier to implement and run faster, and the reduced accuracy may not matter for some applications.

For instance:
#The word "better" has "good" as its lemma. This link is missed by stemming, as it requires a dictionary look-up.
#The word "walk" is the base form for word "walking", and hence this is matched in both stemming and lemmatization.
#The word "meeting" can be either the base form of a noun or a form of a verb ("to meet") depending on the context, e.g., "in our last meeting" or "We are meeting again tomorrow".  Unlike stemming, lemmatization does select the right lemma depending on the context.

The following is an example of lemmatization and stemming. Given the following sentence:
  <nowiki>[The] [quick] [brown] [fox] [jumps] [over] [the] [lazy] [dog]</nowiki>

<code>org.apache.lucene.analysis.snowball.SnowballAnalyzer</code> gives the following stems:
  <nowiki>[quick] [brown] [fox] [jump] [over] [lazy] [dog]</nowiki>

the lemmas from the words in the sentence would be as follows:
  <nowiki>[the] [quick] [brown] [fox] [jump] [over] [the] [lazy] [dog]</nowiki>
