<html> <head> <title>Phenomenology (philosophy)</title></head><body>{{Refimprove|date=April 2009}}'''Phenomenology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ''phainómenon'' "that which appears"; and ''lógos'' "study") is a broad [[philosophical movement]] emphasizing the study of conscious experience. It was founded in the early years of the 20th century by [[Edmund Husserl]], expanded together with a circle of his followers at the universities of [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] and [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]] in [[Germany]], and spread across to [[France]], the [[United States]], and elsewhere, often in contexts far removed from Husserl's early work.

Phenomenology, in Husserl's conception, is primarily concerned with the systematic reflection on and analysis of the structures of [[consciousness]], and the [[phenomena]] which appear in acts of consciousness. Philosopher [[Stephen Hicks]]<ref>Hicks, Stephen R.C. (2004). Explaining Postmodernism: Skepticism and Socialism from Rousseau to Foucault. Tempe, AZ: Scholargy Press, ISBN 1-59274-646-5 P. 43-44.</ref> describes Phenomenology as an outgrowth of European [[Kant]]ianism, which must be considered in relation to [[Structural linguistics]]: 

:Neo-Kantianism evolved during the nineteenth century, and by the twentieth century two main forms had emerged. One form was Structuralism, of which [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] was a prominent exponent, representing the broadly rationalist wing of Kantianism. The other was Phenomenology, of which Edmund Husserl was a prominent representative, representing the broadly empiricist wing of Kantianism. Structuralism was a linguistic version of Kantianism, holding that language is a self-contained, non-referential system, and that the philosophical task was to seek out language’s necessary and universal structural features, those features taken to underlie and be prior to the empirical, contingent features of language. Phenomenology’s focus was upon careful examination of the contingent flow of the experiential given, avoiding any existential inferences or assumptions about what one experiences, and seeking simply to describe experience as neutrally and as clearly as possible. In effect, the Structuralists were seeking subjective [[noumenal]] categories, and the Phenomenologists were content with describing the phenomena without asking what connection to an external reality those experiences might have.
Such descriptions in Phenomenology were to take place from a highly modified "first person" viewpoint, studying phenomena not as they appear to "my" consciousness, but to ''any'' consciousness whatsoever. Husserl believed that phenomenology could thus provide a firm basis for all human [[knowledge]], including scientific knowledge, and could establish philosophy as a "rigorous science" of measurable perception. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.

Husserl's conception of phenomenology has been criticised and developed not only by himself, but also by his students [[Edith Stein]] and [[Martin Heidegger]], by [[existentialists]], such as [[Max Scheler]], [[Nicolai Hartmann]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], and by other philosophers, such as [[Paul Ricoeur]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], and sociologists [[Alfred Schütz]] and [[Eric Voegelin]].

==The idea of phenomenology==
In its most basic form, phenomenology attempts to create conditions for the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] study of topics usually regarded as [[subject (philosophy)|subjective]]: consciousness and the content of conscious experiences such as [[judgments]], [[perceptions]], and [[emotions]]. Although phenomenology seeks to be scientific, it does not attempt to study consciousness from the perspective of clinical psychology or neurology. Instead, it seeks through systematic reflection to determine the essential properties and structures of consciousness and [[conscious experience]].

Husserl derived many important concepts central to phenomenology from the works and lectures of his teachers, the philosophers and psychologists [[Franz Brentano]] and [[Carl Stumpf]].<ref>{{citation

An important element of phenomenology that Husserl borrowed from Brentano was [[intentionality]] (often described as "aboutness"), the notion that consciousness is always consciousness ''of'' something. The object of consciousness is called the ''intentional object'', and this object is constituted for consciousness in many different ways, through for instance [[perception]], [[memory]], [[retention and protention]], [[signification]], etc. Throughout these different intentionalities, though they have different structures and different ways of being "about" the object, an object is still constituted as the same identical object; consciousness is directed at the same intentional object in direct perception as it is in the immediately following retention of this object and the eventual remembering of it.

Though many of the phenomenological methods involve various reductions, phenomenology is essentially anti-[[reductionism|reductionistic]]; the reductions are mere tools to better understand and describe the workings of consciousness, not to reduce any phenomenon to these descriptions. In other words, when a reference is made to a thing's ''essence'' or ''idea'', or when one details the constitution of an identical coherent thing by describing what one "really" sees as being only these sides and aspects, these surfaces, it does not mean that the thing is only and exclusively what is described here: The ultimate goal of these reductions is to understand ''how'' these different aspects are constituted into the actual thing as experienced by the person experiencing it. Phenomenology is a direct reaction to the [[psychologism]] and [[physicalism]] of Husserl's time.

Although previously employed by [[Hegel]], it was Husserl’s adoption of this term (circa 1900) that propelled it into becoming the designation of a philosophical school. As a philosophical perspective, phenomenology is its method, though the specific meaning of the term varies according to how it is conceived by a given philosopher. As envisioned by Husserl, phenomenology is a method of philosophical inquiry that rejects the rationalist bias that has dominated Western thought since Plato in favor of a method of reflective attentiveness that discloses the individual’s “lived experience.”<ref>Husserl, Edmund. ''The Crisis of the European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology.'' Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1970, pg. 240.</ref> Loosely rooted in an epistemological device, with [[Sceptic]] roots, called [[epoché]], Husserl’s method entails the suspension of judgment while relying on the intuitive grasp of knowledge, free of presuppositions and intellectualizing.  Sometimes depicted as the “science of experience,” the phenomenological method is rooted in intentionality, Husserl’s theory of consciousness (developed from Brentano).  Intentionality represents an alternative to the representational theory of consciousness which holds that reality cannot be grasped directly because it is available only through perceptions of reality which are representations of it in the mind.  Husserl countered that consciousness is not “in” the mind but rather conscious of something other than itself (the intentional object), whether the object is a substance or a figment of [[imagination]] (i.e. the real processes associated with and underlying the figment).  Hence the phenomenological method relies on the [[phenomenological description|description of phenomena]] as they are given to consciousness, in their [[immediacy (philosophy)|immediacy]].

According to Maurice Natanson (1973, p. 63), ''“The radicality of the phenomenological method is both continuous and discontinuous with philosophy’s general effort to subject experience to fundamental, critical scrutiny:  to take nothing for granted and to show the warranty for what we claim to know.”''<br>
In practice, it entails an unusual combination of discipline and detachment to suspend, or bracket, theoretical explanations and second-hand information while determining one's “naive” experience of the matter.  The phenomenological method serves to momentarily erase the world of speculation by returning the subject to his or her primordial experience of the matter, whether the object of inquiry is a feeling, an idea, or a perception. According to Husserl the suspension of belief in what we ordinarily take for granted or infer by conjecture diminishes the power of what we customarily embrace as objective reality.  According to [[Safranski]] (1998, 72), “[Husserl and his followers’] great ambition was to disregard anything that had until then been thought or said about consciousness or the world [while] on the lookout for a new way of letting the things [they investigated] approach them, without covering them up with what they already knew.”

Heidegger modified Husserl’s conception of phenomenology because of (what he perceived as) his subjectivist tendencies.  Whereas Husserl conceived humans as having been constituted by states of consciousness, Heidegger countered that consciousness is peripheral to the primacy of one’s existence (i.e., the mode of being of [[Dasein]]) which cannot be reduced to one’s consciousness of it.  From this angle, one’s state of mind is an “effect” rather than a determinant of existence, including those aspects of existence that one is not conscious of.  By shifting the center of gravity from consciousness (psychology) to existence (ontology), Heidegger altered the subsequent direction of phenomenology, making it at once both personal and mysterious.  One of the consequences of Heidegger’s modification of Husserl’s conception of phenomenology was its increased relevance to psychoanalysis.  Whereas Husserl gave priority to a depiction of consciousness that was fundamentally alien to the psychoanalytic conception of the unconscious, Heidegger offered a way to conceptualize experience that could accommodate those aspects of one’s existence that lie on the periphery of sentient awareness.<ref>Natanson, M.

==Special terminology==
===Intentionality===
Intentionality refers to the notion that consciousness is always consciousness ''of'' something. The word itself should not be confused with the "ordinary" use of the word intentional, but should rather be taken as playing on the etymological roots of the word. Originally, intention referred to a "stretching out" ("in tension," lat. ''intendere''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intentionality/][http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=intent]), and in this context it refers to consciousness "''stretching out''" towards its object (although one should be careful with this image, seeing as there is not some consciousness first that, subsequently, stretches out to its object. Rather, consciousness ''occurs as'' the simultaneity of a conscious act and its object.) Intentionality is often summed up as "aboutness."

Whether this ''something'' that consciousness is about is in direct perception or in fantasy is inconsequential to the concept of intentionality itself; whatever consciousness is directed at, ''that'' is what consciousness is consciousness of. This means that the object of consciousness doesn't ''have'' to be a ''physical'' object apprehended in [[perception]]: it can just as well be a fantasy or a memory. Consequently, these "structures" of consciousness, i.e., perception, memory, fantasy, etc., are called ''intentionalities''.

The cardinal principle of phenomenology, the term intentionality originated with the [[Scholastics]] in the medieval period and was resurrected by Brentano who in turn influenced Husserl’s conception of phenomenology, who refined the term and made it the cornerstone of his theory of consciousness.  The meaning of the term is complex and depends entirely on how it is conceived by a given philosopher.  The term should not be confused with “intention” or the psychoanalytic conception of unconscious “motive” or “gain.”

===Intuition===
[[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]] in phenomenology refers to those cases where the intentional object is directly present to the intentionality at play; if the intention is "filled" by the direct apprehension of the object, you have an intuited object. Having a cup of coffee in front of you, for instance, seeing it, feeling it, or even imagining it - these are all filled intentions, and the object is then ''intuited''. The same goes for the apprehension of mathematical formulae or a number. If you do not have the object as referred to directly, the object is not intuited, but still intended, but then ''emptily''. Examples of empty intentions can be signitive intentions - intentions that only ''imply'' or ''refer to'' their objects.

===Evidence===
In everyday language, we use the word [[evidence]] to signify a special sort of relation between a state of affairs and a proposition: State A is evidence for the proposition "A is true." In phenomenology, however, the concept of evidence is meant to signify the "subjective achievement of truth." <ref>Robert Sokolowski, ''Introduction to Phenomenology'', Cambridge University Press (2000). Pp. 159-160. This use of the word evidence may seem strange in English, but is more common in German, which is the language Husserl wrote in.</ref> This is not an attempt to reduce the objective sort of evidence to subjective "opinion," but rather an attempt to describe the structure of having something present in intuition with the addition of having it present as ''intelligible'': "Evidence is the successful presentation of an intelligible object, the successful presentation of something whose truth becomes manifest in the evidencing itself." <ref>Sokolowski, ''Introduction'', pp. 160-161.</ref>

===Noesis and Noema===
{{Main|Noema}}
In Husserl's phenomenology, this pair of terms, derived from the Greek ''[[nous]]'' (mind), designate respectively the real content, noesis, and the ideal content, noema, of an intentional act (an act of consciousness). The [[Noesis]] is the part of the act which gives it a particular sense or character (as in judging or perceiving something, loving or hating it, accepting or rejecting it, and so on).  This is real in the sense that it is actually part of what takes place in the consciousness (or psyche) of the subject of the act.  The [[Noesis]] is always correlated with a [[Noema]]; for Husserl the full Noema is a complex ideal structure comprising at least a noematic sense and a noematic core.  The correct interpretation of what Husserl meant by the [[Noema]] has long been controversial, but the noematic sense is generally understood as the ideal meaning of the act <ref>I.e. if A loves B, loving is a real part of A's conscious activity - [[Noesis]] - but gets its sense from the general concept of loving, which has an abstract or ideal meaning, as "loving" has a meaning in the English language independently of what an individual means by the word when they use it.</ref> and the noematic core as the act's referent or object ''as it is meant in the act''.  One element of controversy is whether this noematic object is the same as the actual object of the act (assuming it exists) or is some kind of ideal object.<ref>For a full account of the controversy and a review of positions taken, see David Woodruff Smith, ''Husserl'', Routledge, 2007, pp304-311.</ref>

===Empathy and Intersubjectivity===
{{Main|empathy}}
{{Main|intersubjectivity}}
In phenomenology, [[empathy]] refers to the experience of another human body ''as'' another. While we often identify others with their physical bodies, this type of phenomenology requires that we focus on the [[subjectivity]] of the other, as well as our intersubjective engagement with them. In Husserl's original account, this was done by a sort of [[apperception]] built on the experiences of your own lived-body. The [[lived body]] is your own body as experienced by yourself, ''as'' yourself. Your own body manifests itself to you mainly as your possibilities of acting in the world. It is what lets you reach out and grab something, for instance, but it also, and more importantly, allows for the possibility of changing your point of view. This helps you differentiate one thing from another by the experience of moving around it, seeing new aspects of it (often referred to as making the absent present and the present absent), and still retaining the notion that this is the same thing that you saw other aspects of just a moment ago (it is identical). Your body is also experienced as a duality, both as object (you can touch your own hand) and as your own subjectivity (you experience being touched).

The experience of your own body as your own subjectivity is then applied to the experience of another's body, which, through apperception, is constituted as another subjectivity. You can thus recognise the Other's intentions, emotions, etc. This experience of empathy is important in the phenomenological account of [[intersubjectivity]]. In phenomenology, intersubjectivity constitutes objectivity (i.e., what you experience as objective is experienced as being intersubjectively available - available to all other subjects. This does not imply that objectivity is reduced to subjectivity nor does it imply a relativist position, cf. for instance [[intersubjective verifiability]]).

In the experience of intersubjectivity, one also experiences oneself as being a subject among other subjects, and one experiences oneself as existing objectively ''for'' these [[Other]]s; one experiences oneself as the noema of Others' noeses, or as a subject in another's empathic experience. As such, one experiences oneself as objectively existing subjectivity. Intersubjectivity is also a part in the constitution of one's lifeworld, especially as "homeworld."

===Lifeworld===
{{Main|lifeworld}}
The [[lifeworld]] (German: ''Lebenswelt'') is the "world" each one of us ''lives'' in. One could call it the "background" or "horizon" of all experience, and it is that on which each object stands out as itself (as different) and with the meaning it can only hold for us. The lifeworld is both personal and [[intersubjectivity|intersubjective]] (it is then called a "homeworld"), and, as such, it does not enclose each one of us in a [[solipsism|solus ipse]].

==Husserl's ''Logische Untersuchungen'' (1900/1901)==
In the first edition of the ''Logical Investigations'', still under the influence of Brentano, Husserl describes his position as "descriptive psychology." Husserl analyzes the intentional structures of mental acts and how they are directed at both real and ideal objects. The first volume of the ''Logical Investigations'', the ''Prolegomena to Pure Logic'', begins with a devastating critique of [[psychologism]], i.e., the attempt to subsume the ''a priori'' validity of the laws of logic under psychology. Husserl establishes a separate field for research in logic, philosophy, and phenomenology, independently from the empirical sciences.<ref>On the ''Logical Investigations'', see

==Transcendental phenomenology after the ''Ideen'' (1913)==
Some years after the publication of the ''Logical Investigations'', Husserl made some key elaborations which led him to the distinction between the act of consciousness (''noesis'') and the phenomena at which it is directed (the ''noemata'').
* "noetic" refers to the intentional act of consciousness (believing, willing, etc.)
* "noematic" refers to the object or content (noema) which appears in the noetic acts (the believed, wanted, hated, and loved ...).

What we observe is not the object as it is in itself, but how and inasmuch it is given in the intentional acts. Knowledge of [[essence]]s would only be possible by "bracketing" all assumptions about the existence of an external world and the inessential (subjective) aspects of how the object is concretely given to us. This procedure Husserl called ''epoché''.

Husserl in a later period concentrated more on the ideal, essential structures of consciousness. As he wanted to exclude any hypothesis on the existence of external objects, he introduced the method of phenomenological reduction to eliminate them. What was left over was the pure transcendental ego, as opposed to the concrete empirical ego. Now (transcendental) phenomenology is the study of the essential structures that are left in pure consciousness: this amounts in practice to the study of the noemata and the relations among them. The philosopher [[Theodor Adorno]] criticised Husserl's concept of phenomenological epistemology in his metacritique ''Against Epistemology'', which is anti-[[foundationalism|foundationalist]] in its stance.

Transcendental phenomenologists include [[Oskar Becker]], [[Aron Gurwitsch]], and [[Alfred Schutz]].

==Realist phenomenology==
{{Main|Realist phenomenology}}
After Husserl's publication of the ''Ideen'' in 1913, many phenomenologists took a critical stance towards his new theories. Especially the members of the [[Munich phenomenology|Munich group]] distanced themselves from his new transcendental phenomenology and preferred the earlier realist phenomenology of the first edition of the ''Logical Investigations''.

Realist phenomenologists include [[Adolf Reinach]], [[Alexander Pfänder]], Johannes Daubert, [[Max Scheler]], [[Roman Ingarden]], [[Nicolai Hartmann]], [[Dietrich von Hildebrand]].

==Existential phenomenology==
{{Main|Existential phenomenology}}
Existential phenomenology differs from transcendental phenomenology by its rejection of the [[transcendental|transcendental ego]]. Merleau-Ponty objects to the ego's transcendence of the world, which for Husserl leaves the world spread out and completely transparent before the conscious. Heidegger thinks of a conscious being as always already in the world. Transcendence is maintained in existential phenomenology to the extent that the method of phenomenology must take a presuppositionless starting point - transcending claims about the world arising from, for example, natural or scientific attitudes or theories of the [[ontology|ontological]] nature of the world.

While [[Husserl]] thought of philosophy as a scientific discipline that had to be founded on a phenomenology understood as [[epistemology]], [[Heidegger]] held a radically different view. Heidegger himself states their differences this way:
:''For Husserl, the phenomenological reduction is the method of leading phenomenological vision from the natural attitude of the human being whose life is involved in the world of things and persons back to the [[transcendental]] life of consciousness and its noetic-noematic experiences, in which objects are constituted as correlates of consciousness. For us, phenomenological reduction means leading phenomenological vision back from the apprehension of a being, whatever may be the character of that apprehension, to the understanding of the Being of this being (projecting upon the way it is unconcealed).''<ref name="heideproblems">{{citation

}}</ref>

According to Heidegger, philosophy was not at all a scientific discipline, but more fundamental than science itself. According to him science is only one way of knowing the world with no special access to truth. Furthermore, the scientific mindset itself is built on a much more "primordial" foundation of practical, everyday knowledge. Husserl was skeptical of this approach, which he regarded as quasi-mystical, and it contributed to the divergence in their thinking.

Instead of taking phenomenology as ''prima philosophia'' or a foundational discipline, Heidegger took it as a metaphysical ontology: "''being is the proper and sole theme of philosophy''... this means that philosophy is not a science of beings but of being.".<ref name="heideproblems"/> Yet to confuse phenomenology and ontology is an obvious error. Phenomena are not the foundation or Ground of Being. Neither are they appearances, for as Heidegger argues in ''[[Being and Time]]'', an appearance is "that which shows itself in something else," while a phenomenon is "that which shows itself in itself."

While for Husserl, in the epochè, being appeared only as a correlate of consciousness, for Heidegger being is the starting point. While for Husserl we would have to abstract from all concrete determinations of our empirical ego, to be able to turn to the field of pure consciousness, Heidegger claims that "the possibilities and destinies of philosophy are bound up with man's existence, and thus with temporality and with historicality."<ref name="heideproblems"/>

However, ontological being and existential being are different categories, so Heidegger's conflation of these categories is, according to Husserl's view, the root of Heidegger's error. Husserl charged Heidegger with raising the question of ontology but failing to answer it, instead switching the topic to the Dasein, the only being for whom Being is an issue. That is neither ontology nor phenomenology, according to Husserl, but merely abstract anthropology. To clarify, perhaps, by abstract anthropology, as a non-existentialist searching for essences, Husserl rejected the existentialism implicit in Heidegger's distinction between being (sein) as things in reality and Being (Da-sein) as the encounter with being, as when being becomes present to us, that is, is unconcealed.<ref>I have attempted to respond to the request for clarification of Heidegger's distinction between being and Being. My info source was http://www.uni.edu/boedeker/NNhHeidegger2.doc. It was not copied and pasted but rephrased for copyright reasons.</ref>

Existential phenomenologists include: [[Martin Heidegger]] (1889–1976), [[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975), [[Emmanuel Levinas]] (1906–1995), [[Gabriel Marcel]] (1889–1973), [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (1905–1980), [[Paul Ricoeur]] (1913–2005) and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] (1908–1961).

==Phenomenology and Eastern thought==
Some researchers in phenomenology (particularly in reference to [[Heidegger]]'s legacy) see possibilities of establishing dialogues with traditions of thought outside of the so-called [[Western philosophy]], particularly with respect to [[Eastern philosophy|East-Asian thinking]], and despite perceived differences between "Eastern" and "Western".<ref>See for instance references to Heidegger's "A Dialogue on Language between a Japanese and an Inquirer," in ''On the Way to Language'' (New York: Harper & Row, 1971). Heidegger himself had contacts with some leading Japanese intellectuals, including members of the [[Kyoto School]], notably [[Hajime Tanabe]], [[Kuki Shūzō]] and [[Kiyoshi Miki]].</ref> Furthermore, it has been claimed that a number of elements within phenomenology (mainly Heidegger's thought) have some resonance with Eastern philosophical ideas, particularly with [[Zen Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]].<ref>An account given by Paul Hsao (in ''Heidegger and Asian Thought'') records a remark by Chang Chung-Yuan claiming that "Heidegger is the only Western Philosopher who not only intellectually understands but has intuitively grasped Taoist thought"</ref> According to [[Tomonubu Imamichi]], the concept of ''Dasein'' was inspired &mdash; although Heidegger remains silent on this &mdash; by [[Okakura Kakuzo]]'s concept of ''das-in-der-Welt-sein'' (being in the world) expressed in ''[[The Book of Tea]]'' to describe [[Zhuangzi]]'s philosophy, which Imamichi's teacher had offered to Heidegger in 1919, after having studied with him the year before.<ref name=Imamichi>[[Tomonubu Imamichi]], ''In Search of Wisdom. One Philosopher's Journey'', Tokyo, International House of Japan, 2004 (quoted by Anne Fagot-Largeau during her [http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/p1184676830986.htm lesson] at the [[Collège de France]] on December 7, 2006).</ref>

There are also recent signs of the reception of phenomenology (and Heidegger's thought in particular) within scholarly circles focused on studying the impetus of [[metaphysics]] in the history of ideas in [[Islam]] and [[Early Islamic philosophy]];<ref>See for instance: Nader El-Bizri, ''The Phenomenological Quest between [[Avicenna]] and Heidegger'' (Binghamton, N.Y.: Global Publications SUNY, 2000) ISBN 1586840053</ref> perhaps under the indirect influence of the tradition of the French Orientalist and philosopher [[Henri Corbin]].<ref>A book-series under the title: ''Islamic Philosophy and Occidental Phenomenology in Dialogue'' [http://www.springer.com/series/6137] has been recently established by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] (Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht) in association with the World Phenomenology Institute [http://www.phenomenology.org/]. This initiative has been initiated by the Polish phenomenologist [[Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka]], editor of ''Analecta Husserliana''.</ref>

In addition, the work of Jim Ruddy in the field of comparative philosophy, combined the concept of Transcendental Ego in Husserl's phenomenology with the concept of the primacy of self-consciousness in the work of Sankaracharya. In the course of this work, Ruddy uncovered a wholly new eidetic phenomenological science which he called "convergent phenomenology." This new phenomenology takes over where Husserl left off, and deals with the constitution of relation-like, rather than merely thing-like, or "intentional" objectivity.<ref>See the thesis, "Convergent Phenomenology," presented to the University of Madras, June, 1979.</ref>

==Historical overview of the use of the term==
Phenomenology has at least three main meanings in [[philosophical]] history: one in the writings of [[G.W.F. Hegel]], another in the writings of [[Edmund Husserl]] in 1920, and a third, deriving from Husserl's work, in the writings of his former research assistant [[Martin Heidegger]] in 1927.
*For [[G.W.F. Hegel]], phenomenology is an approach to [[philosophy]] that begins with an exploration of [[phenomena]] (what presents itself to us in conscious experience) as a means to finally grasp the absolute, logical, ontological and metaphysical Spirit that is behind phenomena. This has been called a "''dialectical phenomenology''".
*For [[Edmund Husserl]], phenomenology is "the reflective study of the [[essence]] of consciousness as experienced from the first-person point of view."<ref>{{citation

|last=Smith
|title=Husserl
|publisher=Routledge

}}</ref> Phenomenology takes the intuitive experience of [[phenomena]] (what presents itself to us in phenomenological reflexion) as its starting point and tries to extract from it the essential features of experiences and the [[essence]] of what we experience. When generalized to the essential features of any possible experience, this has been called "''transcendental phenomenology''". [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl's]] view was based on aspects of the work of [[Franz Brentano]] and was developed further by philosophers such as [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Max Scheler]], [[Edith Stein]], [[Dietrich von Hildebrand]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]].
*[[Martin Heidegger]] believed that [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl's]] approach overlooked basic structural features of both the subject and object of experience (what he called their "being"), and expanded phenomenological enquiry to encompass our understanding and experience of Being itself, thus making phenomenology the method (in the first phase of his career at least) of the study of being, [[ontology]].

The difference in approach between [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] and Heidegger influenced the development of [[existential phenomenology]] and [[existentialism]] in [[France]], as is seen in the work of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]]. [[Munich phenomenology|Munich phenomenologists]] (Johannes Daubert, [[Adolf Reinach]], [[Alexander Pfänder]] in [[Germany]] and [[Alfred Schütz]] in Austria), and [[Paul Ricoeur]] have all been influenced. Readings of Husserl and Heidegger have also been crucial elements of the philosophies of [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Bernard Stiegler]].

Although the term "phenomenology" was used occasionally in the [[history of philosophy]] before [[Husserl]], modern use ties it more explicitly to his particular method. Following is a list of thinkers in rough chronological order who used the term "phenomenology" in a variety of ways, with brief comments on their contributions:<ref>Partially based on

* [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804), in the [[Critique of Pure Reason]], distinguished between objects as [[phenomenon|phenomena]], which are objects as shaped and grasped by human sensibility and understanding, and objects as ''things-in-themselves'' or [[noumena]], which do not appear to us in space and time and about which we can make no legitimate judgments.
* [[G.W.F. Hegel]] (1770–1831) challenged Kant's doctrine of the unknowable thing-in-itself, and declared that by knowing phenomena more fully we can gradually arrive at a consciousness of the absolute and spiritual truth of Divinity. Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', published in 1807, prompted many opposing views, including the existential work of [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], as well as the materialist work of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and his many followers.
* [[Franz Brentano]] (1838–1917) seems to have used the term in some of his lectures at [[Vienna]], where [[Edmund Husserl]] studied with him and came under his influence.
* [[Carl Stumpf]] (1848–1936), student of Brentano and mentor to Husserl, used "phenomenology" to refer to an ontology of sensory contents.
* [[Edmund Husserl]] (1859–1938) established phenomenology at first as a kind of "descriptive psychology" and later as a transcendental and [[eidetic]] science of consciousness. He is considered to be the founder of contemporary phenomenology.
* [[Max Scheler]] (1874–1928) developed further the phenomenological method of Edmund Husserl and extended it to include also a reduction of the [[scientific method]]. He influenced the thinking of [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Dietrich von Hildebrand]], and [[Edith Stein]].
* [[Martin Heidegger]] (1889–1976) criticized Husserl's theory of phenomenology and attempted to develop a theory of [[ontology]] that led him to his original theory of [[Dasein]], the non-dualistic human being.
* [[Alfred Schütz]] (1899–1959) developed a phenomenology of the social world on the basis of everyday experience which has influenced major sociologists such as [[Harold Garfinkel]], [[Peter L. Berger|Peter Berger]], and [[Thomas Luckmann]].
* [[Graham Harman]] (1968 - ) Although working from within phenomenology, Harman finds the broad history of phenomenology to be deficient in that it constantly subordinates the independent life of objects to our (human) access to them.  His radical break with the traditional use of terms such as [[intentionality]] as well as a fresh approach to [[metaphysics]], stems from his greatest influences by such as the great phenomenologists [[Alphonso Lingis]], [[Husserl]], [[Ortega y Gasset]], [[Zubiri]], and [[Heidegger]].  Harman's thought is perhaps the first to combine phenomenology with speculative philosophers such as [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]], [[Leibniz]], and the sort of radical thinking typified by [[Speculative Realism]].

Later usage is mostly based on or (critically) related to Husserl's introduction and use of the term. This branch of philosophy differs from others in that it tends to be more "descriptive" than "[[Prescription and description|prescriptive]]".
