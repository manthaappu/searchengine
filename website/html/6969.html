In [[computer programming]], a '''comment''' is a [[programming language]] construct<ref>For purposes of this article, programming language comments are treated as indistinct from comments that appear in [[markup language]]s, [[configuration file]]s and other similar contexts. Moreover, markup language is often closely integrated with programming language code, especially in the context of [[code generation]]. See e.g., {{cite book | last = Ganguli | first = Madhushree | title = Making Use of Jsp | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 0471219746 }}, {{cite book | last = Hewitt | first = Eben | title = Java for Coldfusion Developers | publisher = Pearson Education | location = Upper Saddle River | year = 2003 | isbn = 0130461806}}</ref> used to embed programmer-readable [[annotation]]s in the [[source code]] of a [[computer program]].<ref name="PennyGrubb000">Source code can be divided into ''program code'' (which consists of machine-translatable instructions); and ''comments'' (which include human-readable notes and other kinds of annotations in support of the program code).{{ cite book | last = Penny Grubb | first = Armstrong Takang | title = Software Maintenance: Concepts and Practice | publisher = World Scientific | year = 2003 | isbn = 981238426X | pp = 7, 120–121}}</ref>  Those annotations are potentially significant to programmers but typically ignorable to [[compiler]]s and [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]]s.<ref>Some programming environments include comments as one element of the language syntax that is retained for further processing, instead of discarded once recognized by the language processor.</ref><ref name="CmmtIgnored">Comments must be indicated in a way that allows a source code processor to recognize them as such. This is often simplified by saying comments are "ignored" (after they have been recognized and discarded) by the processor.</ref> Comments are usually added with the purpose of making the source code easier to understand. The syntax and rules for comments vary and are usually defined in a [[programming language specification]] (see the [[comparison of programming languages (syntax)#Comments|syntax of comments in various programming languages]]).

Comments have a wide range of potential uses: from augmenting program code with basic descriptions, to generating external [[documentation generator|documentation]].<ref name="generate">Comments can be processed in various ways to generate documentation external to the source code itself. See e.g., [[Comparison of documentation generators]].</ref> Comments are also used for integration with [[source code management]] systems and other kinds of external [[programming tool]]s.

The flexibility provided by comments often allows for a wide degree of variability and potentially non-useful information inside source code. To address this, many technical commentators and software analysts subscribe to any of several "philosophies" and guidelines regarding the proper use of comments.

== Overview ==

Comments are generally formatted as ''block comments'' (also called ''prologue comments'' or ''stream comments'') or ''line comments'' (also called ''inline comments'').<ref name="JBDixit000">{{cite book | last = Dixit | first = J.B. | title = Computer Fundamentals and Programming in C | publisher = Laxmi Publications | year = 2003 | isbn = 8170088828 }}</ref> 

Block comments [[delimiter#Bracket delimiters|delimit]] a region of source code in which the region is allowed to span multiple lines. This region is specified with a ''start'' delimiter and an ''end'' delimiter. Some programming languages (such as [[MATLAB]]) allow block comments to be recursively nested inside one another, but others (such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]]) do not.<ref name="Higham000">{{cite book

| accessdate  = 2007-07-24
}}</ref>

Line comments either start with a comment delimiter and continue until the end of the line, or in some cases, start at a specific column (character line offset) in the source code, and continue until the end of the line.<ref name="javadude000" />

Some programming languages employ both block and line comments with different comment delimiters.  For example, [[C++]] has block comments delimited by <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> that can span multiple lines and line comments delimited by <code>//</code>. Other languages support only one type of comment. For example, [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] comments are line comments: they start with <code>--</code> and continue to the end of the line.<ref name="javadude000" />

==Uses==

How best to make use of comments is subject to dispute; different commentators have offered varied and sometimes opposing viewpoints.<ref name="Dietrich000">{{cite book

}} discusses comments and the "Science of Documentation" p. 256.</ref>
There are many different ways of writing comments and many commentators who offer sometimes conflicting advice.<ref name="Keyes000" />

=== Code description ===
Comments can be used to summarize code or to explain the programmer's intent. According to this school of thought, restating the code in plain English is considered superfluous; the need to re-explain code may be a sign that it is too complex and should be rewritten.

:"Don't document bad code &ndash; rewrite it."<ref name="BadComment000">''[[The Elements of Programming Style (book)|The Elements of Programming Style]]'', [[Brian Kernighan|Kernighan]] & [[P. J. Plauger|Plauger]]</ref>

:"Good comments don't repeat the code or explain it. They clarify its intent. Comments should explain, at a higher level of abstraction than the code, what you're trying to do."<ref name="GoodComment000">''[[Code Complete]]'', [[Steve McConnell|McConnell]]</ref>

Comments may also be used to explain why a block of code does not seem to fit conventions or best practices.  This is especially true of projects involving very little development time, or in bug fixing.  For example:
<source lang="vb">' Second variable dim because of server errors produced when reuse form data. No
' documentation available on server behavior issue, so just coding around it.
vtx = server.mappath("local settings")
</source>

=== Algorithmic description ===

Sometimes source code contains a novel or noteworthy solution to a specific problem. In such cases, comments may contain an explanation of the methodology. Such explanations may include diagrams and formal mathematical proofs. This may constitute explanation of the code, rather than a clarification of its intent; but others tasked with maintaining the code base may find such explanation crucial. This might especially be true in the case of highly-specialized problem domains; or rarely-used optimizations, constructs or function-calls.<ref name="AlgoComments">{{cite book 
| last      = Spinellis 
| first     = Diomidis 
| title     = Code reading: The Open Source Perspective
| publisher = Addison-Wesley
| year      = 2003
| isbn      = 0201799405
}}</ref>

For example, a programmer may add a comment to explain why an [[insertion sort]] was chosen instead of a [[quicksort]], as the former is, in theory, slower than the latter. This could be written as follows:
<source lang="java">
 list = [f (b), f (b), f (c), f (d), f (a), ...];
 // Need a stable sort. Besides, the performance really does not matter.
 insertion_sort (list);
</source>

=== Resource inclusion ===<!--This header is linked externally, pls. no changey unless you fixy-->

[[Logo]]s, diagrams, and [[flowchart]]s consisting of [[ASCII art]] constructions can be inserted into source code formatted as a comment.<ref name="asciiart000">{{cite web 
| title       = CodePlotter 1.6 - Add and edit diagrams in your code with this 'Visio-like' tool
| url         = http://www.codeproject.com/macro/codeplotter.asp
| accessdate  = 2007-07-24
}}</ref> Further, [[copyright]] notices can be embedded within source code as comments. Binary data may also be encoded in comments through a process known as [[binary-to-text encoding]], although such practice is uncommon and typically relegated to external resource files.

The following code fragment is a simple ASCII diagram depicting the process flow for a [[system administration]] script contained in a [[Windows Script File]] running under [[Windows Script Host]]. Although a section marking the code appears as a comment, the diagram itself actually appears in an [[XML]] [[CDATA]] section, which is technically considered distinct from comments, but can serve similar purposes.<ref name="Niederst000">{{cite book 
| title     = Web Design in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference
| first     = Jennifer
| last      = Niederst
| publisher = O'Reilly
| year      = 2006
| isbn      = 0596009879
}}Sometimes the difference between a "comment" and other syntax elements of a programming or markup language entails subtle nuances. Niederst indicates one such situation by stating: "Unfortunately, XML software thinks of comments as unimportant information and may simply remove the comments from a document before processing it. To avoid this problem, use an XML CDATA section instead."</ref>

<source lang="xml">
<!-- begin: wsf_resource_nodes -->
<resource id="ProcessDiagram000">
<![CDATA[
 HostApp (Main_process)
    |
    V
script.wsf (app_cmd) --> ClientApp (async_run, batch_process)
                |
                |
                V
         mru.ini (mru_history)   
]]>
</resource>
</source>

Although this identical diagram could easily have been included as a comment, the example illustrates one instance where a programmer may opt not to use comments as a way of including resources in source code.<ref name="Niederst000" />

{{anchor|Comment out}} <!-- [[Comment out]] redirects here -->
=== Debugging ===
{{Redirect3|Comment out}}

A common developer practice is to ''comment out'' a [[snippet (programming)|code snippet]], so that it will not be executed in the final program. For example, one might write:
<source lang="C">
 if (opt.equals ("e"))
   opt_enabled = true;
 /*
  if (opt.equals ("d"))
   opt_debug = true;
 // */
 //*
 if (opt.equals ("v"))
    opt_verbose = true;
 // */
</source>
The above code fragment suggests that the programmer opted to disable the debugging option for some reason. This specific comment style is more suitable for debugging. A single slash character in front of the opening delimiter is the switch on en/disabling the block comments.

===Automatic documentation generation===
{{main|Documentation generator}}
[[Programming tool]]s sometimes store documentation and [[metadata]] in comments.<ref>See e.g., {{cite book | last = Wynne-Powell | first = Rod | title = Mac Os X for Photographers: Optimized Image Workflow for the Mac User | publisher = Focal Press | location = Oxford | year = 2008 | isbn = 0240520270 }} page 243</ref> These may include insert positions for automatic header file inclusion, commands to set the file's [[syntax highlighting]] mode,<ref>{{cite book | last = Lamb | first = Linda | title = Learning the VI Editor | publisher = O'Reilly & Associates | location = Sebastopol | year = 1998 | isbn = 1565924266 }} describes the use of modeline syntax in Vim configuration files.</ref> or the file's [[revision control|revision number]].<ref>See e.g., {{cite book | last = Berlin | first = Daniel | title = Practical Subversion, Second Edition | publisher = APress | location = Berkeley | year = 2006 | isbn = 1590597532 }} page 168.</ref> These functional control comments are also commonly referred to as [[annotation]]s. Keeping documentation within source code comments is considered as one way to simplify the documentation process, as well as increase the chances that the documentation will be kept up to date with changes in the code.<ref name="Ambler000">{{cite book 
| title     = The Object Primer: Agile Model-Driven Development with UML 2.0

| last      = Ambler
| publisher = Cambridge University Press

| isbn      = 1397805218
}}</ref>

Examples of documentation generators include the programs [[Javadoc]] for use with [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Ddoc]] for [[D (programming language)|D]], [[Doxygen]] for [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], Java, [[interface description language|IDL]], and [[PHPDoc]] for [[PHP]].

[[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[Visual Basic]] implement a similar feature called "XML Comments" which are read by [[IntelliSense]] from the compiled [[.NET Framework|.NET]] assembly.<ref>{{cite book|last=Murach|title=C# 2005|pages=56}}</ref>

==Normative views==
There are various normative views and long-standing opinions regarding the proper use of comments in source code.<ref>{{cite book | last = Goodliffe | first = Pete | title = Code Craft | publisher = No Starch Press | location = San Francisco | year = 2006 | isbn = 1593271190 }}, {{cite book | last = Smith | first = T. | title = Intermediate Programming Principles and Techniques Using Pascal | publisher = West Pub. Co | location = Belmont | year = 1991 | isbn = 0314663142 }}</ref> Some of these are informal and based on personal preference, while others are published or promulgated as formal guidelines.<ref>See e.g., {{cite book | last = Koletzke | first = Peter | title = Oracle Developer Advanced Forms & Reports | publisher = Osborne/McGraw-Hill | location = Berkeley | year = 2000 | isbn = 0072120487 }} page 65.</ref>

===Need for comments===
Technical commentators have documented varying viewpoints on whether and when comments are appropriate in source code.<ref name="BadComment000" />
<ref name="BadComments001">{{cite web 
| title       = Worst Practice - Bad Comments
| url         = http://www.sqlservercentral.com/columnists/awarren/worstpracticebadcomments.asp

}}</ref> Some commentators assert that source code should be written with few comments, on the basis that the source code should be self-explanatory.<ref name="BadComment000" /> Others suggest code should be extensively commented (it is not uncommon for over 50% of the non-[[whitespace (computer science)|whitespace]] characters in source code to be contained within comments).<ref name="Morelli000">{{cite book

| accessdate  = 2007-07-24
}} Javadoc guidelines specify that comments are crucial to the platform. Further, the appropriate level of detail is fairly well-defined: "We spend time and effort focused on specifying boundary conditions, argument ranges and corner cases rather than defining common programming terms, writing conceptual overviews, and including examples for developers."</ref>

In between these views is the assertion that comments are neither beneficial nor harmful by themselves, and what matters is that they are correct and kept in sync with the source code, and omitted if they are superfluous, excessive, difficult to maintain or otherwise unhelpful.<ref name="techniques001">{{cite book

| isbn      = 0321125185
}}</ref>

=== Level of detail ===
Depending on the intended audience of the code and other considerations, the level of detail and description may vary considerably. 

For example, the following Java comment would be suitable in an introductory text designed to teach beginning programming:

    <source lang="java">
    String s = "Wikipedia"; /* Assigns the value "Wikipedia" to the variable s. */
    </source>

This level of detail, however, would not be appropriate in the context of production code, or other situations involving experienced developers. Such rudimentary descriptions are inconsistent with the guideline: "Good comments ... clarify intent."<ref name="GoodComment000" /> Further, for professional coding environments, the level of detail is ordinarily well-defined to meet a specific performance requirement defined by business operations.<ref name="Javadoc000" />

===Offensive comments===
Sometimes comments in source code are used as a way to relieve stress or to speak unfavorably about development tools, competitors, employers, working conditions, or even the quality of the code itself. Some commentators deem this highly inappropriate and recommend against including potentially offensive remarks in comments, especially if there is any possibility that the source code may later be viewed by anyone besides the original developer responsible for it.<ref name="InsultComments">{{cite book 
| last      = Doar 
| first     = Matthew B. 
| title     = Practical Development Environments

| year      = 2005
| isbn      = 0596007965
}}</ref> The occurrence of this phenomenon can be easily seen from online resources that track [[profanity]] in source code.<ref name="SwearWords">(see e.g., [http://www.vidarholen.net/contents/wordcount/ Linux Swear Count], [http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&lr=&q=fucking Google Code Search]).</ref>

=== Comments in web templates ===
Web development presents a special security challenge related to comments, because it is not uncommon for HTML comments to be viewable in plain text by any user of the application. Sections of code that are "commented out" in HTML templates may therefore present a security [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]].<ref name="InsecureComments">{{cite book 
| last      = Andress

| publisher = CRC Press
| year      = 2003
| isbn      = 0849320429
}}</ref>

==Styles==
There are many stylistic alternatives available when considering how comments should appear in source code. For larger projects involving a team of developers, comment styles are either agreed upon before a project starts, or evolve as a matter of convention or need as a project grows. Usually programmers prefer styles that are consistent, non-obstructive, easy to modify, and difficult to break.<ref name="gnome000">{{cite web 
| title       = Coding Style
| url         = http://developer.gnome.org/doc/guides/programming-guidelines/code-style.html
| accessdate  = 2007-07-24
}}</ref>

The following code fragments in C demonstrate just a tiny example of how comments can vary stylistically, while still conveying the same basic information:
<source lang="c">
/* 
     This is the comment body.
     Variation One.
*/
</source>

<source lang="c">
/***************************\
*                           *
* This is the comment body. *
* Variation Two.            *
*                           *
\***************************/
</source>

Factors such as personal preference, flexibility of programming tools, and other considerations tend to influence the stylistic variants used in source code. For example, Variation Two might be disfavored among programmers who do not have [[source code editor]]s that can automate the alignment and visual appearance of text in comments.

Software consultant and technology commentator Allen Holub<ref name="Holub000">{{cite web 
| title       = Allen Holub
| url         = http://www.holub.com/company/allen_holub.html

}}</ref> is one expert who advocates aligning the left edges of comments:<ref name="Holub001">Allen Holub, ''Enough Rope to Shoot Yourself in the Foot'', ISBN 0-07-029689-8, 1995, McGraw-Hill</ref>

 <source lang="c">
 /* This is the style recommended by Holub for C and C++.
  * It is demonstrated in ''Enough Rope'', in rule 29.
  */
 </source>

 <source lang="c">
 /* This is another way to do it, also in C.
 ** It is easier to do in editors that do not automatically indent the second
 ** through last lines of the comment one space from the first.
 ** It is also used in Holub's book, in rule 31.
 */
 </source>

===End-of-line===
In this form, all the text from the ASCII characters // to the end of the line is ignored.
<source lang="c">
/// begin: Variation Three.
/// -------------------------
/// This is the comment body.
/// -------------------------
</source>

Different styles can be chosen for different areas of code, from individual lines to paragraphs, routines, files, and programs. If the syntax supports both line comments and block comments, one method is to use line comments only for minor comments (declarations, blocks and edits) and to use block comments to describe higher-level abstractions (functions, classes, files and modules).

Sometimes projects try to enforce rules like "one comment every ten lines". These kinds of rules can be counterproductive when too rigorous, but may provide a useful standard of measurement and consistency if the project participants deem it necessary.

===Tags===
Certain [[tag (metadata)|tags]] are used in comments to assist in indexing common issues. Such tags are commonly [[syntax-highlighted]] and can be searched with common programming tools, such as the [[Unix]] [[grep]] utility. Examples of tag conventions include:

* '''FIXME''' to mark potential problematic code that requires special attention and/or review.
* '''NOTE''' to document inner workings of code and indicate potential pitfalls.
* '''TODO''' to indicate planned enhancements.
* '''XXX''' to warn other programmers of problematic or misguiding code.

There is a risk that tags accumulate over time; it is advisable to include the date and the tag owner in the tag comment to ease tracking.<ref name="todoOrNotTodo">{{cite web

==Examples==
===Comparison===
{{main|Comparison of programming languages (syntax)#Comments}}

Typographic conventions to specify comments vary widely. Further, individual programming languages sometimes provide unique variants. For a detailed review, please consult the [[comparison of programming languages (syntax)#Comments|programming language comparison]] article.

===In context===
====BASIC classic====
This [[BASIC]] code fragment is a completely functioning program in which the comments describe what the program does for the benefit of novice programmers.
<source lang="qbasic">
10 REM This BASIC program shows the use of the PRINT and GOTO statements.
15 REM It fills the screen with the word "WIKIPEDIA"
20 PRINT "WIKIPEDIA"
30 GOTO 20
</source>
When run, this program repeatedly prints the word "WIKIPEDIA" (without quotes) in an [[infinite loop]].

====C====
This [[C (programming language)|C]] code fragment demonstrates the use of a prologue comment or "block comment" to describe the purpose of a [[conditional statement]]. The comment explains key terms and concepts, and includes a short signature by the programmer who authored the code.
<source lang="c">
 /*
  * Check if we are over our maximum process limit, but be sure to
  * exclude root. This is needed to make it possible for login and
  * friends to set the per-user process limit to something lower
  * than the amount of processes root is running. -- Rik
  */
 if (atomic_read(&p->user->processes) >= p->rlim[RLIMIT_NPROC].rlim_cur
     && !capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN) && !capable(CAP_SYS_RESOURCE))
     goto bad_fork_free;
</source>
This excerpt is from the <code>fork.c</code> file from the [[Linux kernel]] source.

====ColdFusion====
[[ColdFusion]] uses comments similar to HTML/XML, but instead of two dashes, it uses three. These comments are caught by the ColdFusion engine and not printed to the browser.

<source lang="html4strict">
 <!--- This prints "Hello World" to the browser. --->
 <cfoutput>
   Hello World<br />
 </cfoutput>
</source>

====Fortran IV====
This [[Fortran IV]] code fragment demonstrates how comments are used in that language, with the comments themselves describing the basic formatting rules.
<source lang="Fortran">
C
C Lines that begin with 'C' (in the first or 'comment' column) are comments
C 
       WRITE (6,10)
    10 FORMAT(12H HELLO WORLD)
       END
</source>

====Fortran 90====
This [[Fortran]] code fragment demonstrates how comments are used in that language, with the comments themselves describing the basic formatting rules.
<source lang="Fortran">
!* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
!* All characters after an exclamation mark are considered as comments *
!* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
 
       PRINT "WIKIPEDIA" ! Fortran 90 introduced the option for inline comments.
       END
</source>

====Java====
This [[Java (programming language)|Java]] code fragment shows a block comment used to describe the <code>setToolTipText</code> method. The formatting is consistent with [[Sun Microsystems]] [[Javadoc]] standards. The comment is designed to be read by the Javadoc processor.
<source lang="Java">
 /**
  * Registers the text to display in a tool tip.   The text 
  * displays when the cursor lingers over the component.
  *
  * @param text  the string to display.  If the text is null, 
  *              the tool tip is turned off for this component.
  */
 public void setToolTipText(String text) {
</source>

====Objective Caml====
OCaml uses nestable comments, which is useful when commenting a code block.
<source lang="ocaml">
codeLine(* comment level 1(*comment level 2*)*)
</source>

====Perl====
Line comments in [[Perl]], and many other scripting languages, begin with a hash (#) symbol.  A comment at the beginning, called the [[shebang (Unix)|shebang]], tells the system what interpreter to use.
<source lang="Perl">
#!/usr/bin/perl
my $s = "Wikipedia"; # Sets the variable s to "Wikipedia".
print $s . "\n";     # Add a newline character after printing for shells that do not do so automatically.
</source>

====PHP====
Comments in [[PHP]] can be either in C++ style (both inline and block), or in Perl style.  [[PHPDoc]] is a style adapted from Javadoc and is a common standard for documenting PHP code.

====Python====
Comments in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] use the hash character.  Python programs start with [[shebang|#!]] to tell the operating system which interpreter to use.
<source lang=python>
#!/usr/bin/env python

# this program prints "Hello World" to the screen and then quits. 
print "Hello World!"
</source>

Python also supports [[docstring]]s a special sort of comment usually enclosed in triple-quotes (<nowiki>'''</nowiki>).

<source lang=python>
def foo(x, y):
    '''Frobnicate the bar and baz together with one another'''
    return frob(frob(x), frob(y))
</source>

====Ruby====
Comments in [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]].

Single line commenting: (line starts with hash "#")
<source lang="Ruby">
This is not a comment

#this is commented

This is not a comment
</source>

Multi-line commenting: (comments goes between keywords "begin" and "end")
<source lang="Ruby">
This is not a comment

=begin

whatever goes in here

will be ignored :)

=end

This is not a comment
</source>

====SQL====
Comments in SQL are in single-line-only form, when using two dashes:
<source lang="SQL">
-- This is a single line comment
-- followed by a second line
SELECT COUNT(*) 
       FROM Authors
       WHERE Authors.name = 'Smith'; -- Note: we only want 'smith'
                                     -- this comment appears after SQL code
</source>
The syntax for [[Transact-SQL]] also supports alternative formats for specifying comments.<ref name="MSSQL">{{cite book 
| title     = Microsoft SQL Server 7
| first     = Ronald R.
| last      = Talmage
| publisher = Prima Publishing
| year      = 1999
| isbn      = 0761513892
}}</ref> One format supported by this syntax is identical to the "block comment" style used in the syntax for C++ and Java.
<source lang="SQL">
/*
This is a comment line 1
This is a comment line 2
*/
SELECT COUNT(*)
       FROM Authors
</source>
