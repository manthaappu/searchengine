<html> <head> <title>Properties of polynomial roots</title></head><body>In [[mathematics]], a [[polynomial]] is a function of the form
:<math>
  p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n, \quad x\in \mathbb{C}
</math>
where the coefficients <math>a_0, \ldots, a_n</math> are 
complex numbers and <math>a_n\neq 0</math>. The [[fundamental theorem of algebra]]
states that polynomial ''p'' has ''n'' roots. The aim of this
page is to list various properties of these [[root of a function|roots]]. 

==Continuous dependence of coefficients==
The ''n'' roots of a polynomial of degree ''n'' depend [[continuous function|continuously]] on the coefficients. This means that there are ''n'' continuous functions <math>r_1,\ldots, r_n</math> depending on the coefficients that parametrize the roots with correct multiplicity. 

This result implies that the [[eigenvalues]] of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] depend continuously on the matrix.  A [[Mathematical proof|proof]] can be found in Tyrtyshnikov(1997).

The problem of approximating the roots given the coefficients is [[condition number|ill-conditioned]].  See, for example, [[Wilkinson's polynomial]].

==Complex conjugate root theorem==
{{main|Complex conjugate root theorem}}

The [[complex conjugate root theorem]] states that if the coefficients
of a polynomial are real, then the roots appear in pairs of the type ''a'' ± ''ib''.

For example, the equation ''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0 has roots ±''i''.

== Radical conjugate roots ==
It can be proved that if a polynomial ''P''(''x'') with rational coefficients has ''a'' + √''b'' as a zero, where ''a'', ''b'' are rational and √''b'' is irrational, then ''a'' − √''b'' is also a zero. First observe that 
:<math>\left(x - \left [ a + \sqrt b \right ] \right) \left(x - \left [ a - \sqrt b \right ] \right) = (x - a)^2 - b.</math> 
Denote this quadratic polynomial by ''D''(''x''). Then, by the [[division transformation|division transformation for polynomials]],
:<math>P(x) = D(x)Q(x) + cx + d = ((x - a)^2 - b)Q(x) + cx + d, \,\!</math>
where ''c'', ''d'' are rational numbers (by virtue of the fact that the coefficients of ''P''(''x'') and ''D''(''x'') are all rational). But ''a'' + √''b'' is a zero of ''P''(''x''):
:<math>P\left( a + \sqrt b \right) = c\left(a + \sqrt b \right) + d = (ac + d) + c \sqrt b = 0.</math>
It follows that ''c'', ''d'' must be zero, since otherwise the final equality could be arranged to suggest the irrationality of rational values (and vice versa). Hence ''P''(''x'') = ''D''(''x'')''Q''(''x''), for some quotient polynomial ''Q''(''x''), and ''D''(''x'') is a factor of ''P''(''x'').<ref>{{cite book|author=S.

== Bounds on (complex) polynomial roots==
A very general class of bounds on the magnitude of roots is implied by the [[Rouché theorem]]. If there is a positive real number ''R'' and a coefficient index ''k'' such that
::<math>|a_k|\,R^k > |a_0|+\cdots+|a_{k-1}|\,R^{k-1}+|a_{k+1}|\,R^{k+1}+\cdots+|a_n|\,R^n</math>
then there are exactly ''k'' (counted with multiplicity) roots of absolute value less than ''R''. For ''k=0,n'' there is always a solution to this inequality, for example
*for ''k=n'', 
::<math>R=1+\frac1{|a_n|}\max\{|a_0|,|a_1|,\dots, |a_{n-1}|\}</math> or 
::<math>R=\max\left(1,\,\frac1{|a_n|}\left(|a_0|+|a_1|+\cdots+|a_{n-1}|\right)\right)</math> 
: are upper bounds for the size of all roots,
*for ''k=0'', 
::<math>R=\frac{|a_0|}{|a_0|+\max\{|a_1|,|a_2|,\dots, |a_{n}|\}}</math> or
::<math>R=\frac{|a_0|}{\max(|a_0|,\,|a_1|+|a_2|+\cdots+|a_{n}|)}</math> 
are lower bounds for the size of all of the roots.
*for all other indices, the function
::<math>h(R)=|a_0|\,R^{-k}+\cdots+|a_{k-1}|\,R^{-1}-|a_k|+|a_{k+1}|\,R+\cdots+|a_n|\,R^{n-k}</math>
:is convex on the positive real numbers, thus the minimizing point is easy to determine numerically. If the minimal value is negative, one has found additional information on the location of the roots.

One can increase the separation of the roots and thus the ability to find additional separating circles from the coefficients, by applying the root squaring operation of the [[Graeffe's method|Dandelin-Graeffe iteration]] to the polynomial.

A different approach is by using the [[Gershgorin circle theorem]] applied to some [[companion matrix]] of the polynomial, as it is used in the [[Durand–Kerner method|Weierstraß–(Durand–Kerner) method]]. From initial estimates of the roots, that might be quite random, one gets unions of circles that contain the roots of the polynomial.

==Gauss&ndash;Lucas theorem==
{{main|Gauss&ndash;Lucas theorem}}
The Gauss&ndash;Lucas theorem states that the [[convex hull]] of the roots of a polynomial contains the roots of the [[derivative]] of the polynomial.

A sometimes useful corollary is that if all roots of a polynomial have positive real part, then so do the roots of all derivatives of the polynomial.

A related result is the [[Bernstein's inequality in mathematical analysis|Bernstein's inequality]]. It states that for a polynomial ''P'' of degree ''n'' with derivative ''P′'' we have
:<math>\max_{|z| \leq 1} \big|P'(z)\big| \le n \max_{|z| \leq 1} \big|P(z)\big|.</math>

== Polynomials with real roots==

If <math>a_n x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\ldots+a_1x+a_0</math> is a polynomial such that all of its roots are real, then they are located in the interval with endpoints
:<math>x_\pm=-\frac{a_{n-1}}{n\cdot a_n} \pm \frac{n-1}{n\cdot a_n}\sqrt{a^2_{n-1} - \frac{2n}{n-1}a_n a_{n-2}}</math>.

Example: The polynomial <math>x^4+5x^3+5x^2-5x-6</math> has four real roots -3, -2, -1 and 1. The formula gives
:<math>x_\pm=-\frac{5}{4} \pm \frac{3}{4}\sqrt{\frac{35}{3}}</math>,
its roots are contained in 
: I = [-3,812 ; 1,312].
