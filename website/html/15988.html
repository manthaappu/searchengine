<html> <head> <title>HATEOAS</title></head><body>The '''HATEOAS''' constraint is an acronym for '''Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State'''. This principle is the key differentiator between a [[Representational State Transfer|REST]] and most other forms of [[Client–server model|client server]] system. 

Rather than the [[Action (UML)|actions]] and [[Interface (computer science)|interfaces]] a [[Client (computing)|client]] may use being defined elsewhere, such as in a [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]] file or predefined in the client code, the principle is that the [[hypermedia]] in each [[Server (computing)|server]] [[Output|response]] will contain [[Hyperlink|links]] that correspond to all the actions that the client can currently perform. Therefore, dependent on the current [[State (computer science)|application state]], every server response describes the new actions that are available. The server can change the range of allowable responses in a dynamic way, and a client should adapt its behavior to these changes. 

A client of a RESTful application need only know a single fixed [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] to access it. All future actions should be discoverable dynamically from hypermedia links included in the representations of the [[Resource (Web)|resources]] that are returned from that URL. Standardized [[Internet media type|media types]] are also expected to be understood by any client that might use a RESTful [[Application programming interface|API]]. Application state transitions are driven by a combination of the known processing rules for each media type, client selection from the server-provided choices in representations received, and the user's manipulation of those representations. Thus interactions are driven by hypermedia, rather than by any out-of-band information.<ref name="untangled2008"/>

If necessary, the client’s knowledge of media types, resource communication mechanisms, and user interaction, may be improved on-the-fly by the transmission of code-on-demand from the server to the client as defined elsewhere in the REST architecture.<ref name="Fielding-Ch5"/>

== Origins of the constraint ==
The details of this design constraint were introduced, but not named as such, by Roy Fielding in the doctoral dissertation where he first defined the REST architectural style.<ref name="Fielding-Ch5">Chapter 5 of Fielding's dissertation is [http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm "Representational State Transfer (REST)"].</ref> The concept has been further described by Fielding on his blog.<ref name="untangled2008">{{cite web |url=http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven|title=REST APIs must be hypertext-driven|date=20 Oct 2008|first=Roy T.|last=Fielding|accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref>

The purpose of some of the strictness of this and other REST constraints, Fielding explains, is "software design on the scale of decades: every detail is intended to promote software longevity and independent evolution. Many of the constraints are directly opposed to short-term efficiency. Unfortunately, people are fairly good at short-term design, and usually awful at long-term design."<ref name="untangled2008"/>
