The '''Cray Operating System''' ('''COS''') was [[Cray Research]]'s proprietary [[operating system]] for its [[Cray-1]] (1976) and [[Cray X-MP]] [[supercomputer]]s, and those platforms' main OS until replaced by [[UNICOS]] in the late 1980s. COS was delivered with [[Cray Assembler Language]] (CAL), [[Cray FORTRAN]] (CFT), and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]].

== Design ==

As COS was written by ex-[[Control Data]] employees, its command language and internal organization bore strong resemblance to the [[CDC SCOPE (software)|SCOPE]] operating system on the [[CDC 7600]] and before that EXEC*8 from CDC's earlier ERA/Univac pedigree.  User jobs were submitted to COS via front-end computers via a high-speed channel interface, and so-called ''station software''.  Front end stations were typically large [[IBM]] or [[Control Data]] mainframes.  However the [[DEC VAX]] was also a very popular front-end.  Interactive use of COS was possible through the stations.  But most users simply submitted batch jobs.

Disk-resident datasets used by a user program were 'local' to the individual job.  Once a job completed, its local datasets would be released and space reclaimed.  In order to retain the data between jobs, datasets had to be explicitly made 'permanent'.  [[Magnetic tape]] datasets were also supported on Cray systems which were equipped with an I/O Subsystem.

COS also provided job scheduling and checkpoint/restart facilities to manage large workloads, even across system downtimes (both scheduled and unscheduled.)

Internally, COS was divided into a very small message-passing EXEC, and a number of System Task Processors (STP tasks).  Each STP task was similar in nature to the peripheral processor programs in earlier [[Control Data]] operating systems.

However since the Cray machines did not have peripheral processors, the main central processor executed the operating system code.

While the source for version 1.13 was released as [[public domain]], there are no known saved copies, and thus COS is considered to be lost to time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}
