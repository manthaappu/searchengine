{{Notability|date=January 2011}}The '''UCD Center for Mind and Brain''' is a research and training unit at the [[University of California, Davis]] dedicated to understanding the nature of the human mind from interdisciplinary perspectives.

Scientists currently in the CMB (16 core members) include those interested in a wide range of fundamental questions about how minds are organized. We address these questions using interdisciplinary approaches from social science (anthropology, economics, linguistics, philosophy and psychology), biological science (behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, physiology), engineering science (biomedical and electrical engineering, computer science), and medical science (neurology, psychiatry and medical imaging).

The research mission of the CMB includes investigation of a variety of fundamental issues aimed at answering the fundamental question: How does the mind arise from the biology of the brain? Scientists in the CMB study attention, awareness, cognitive control, language, memory, multisensory integration, music cognition, social cognition, and visual cognition from cognitive neuroscience and developmental perspectives in healthy infants and adults, and in special patient populations.

The Center for Mind and Brain is located adjacent to the University of California, Davis campus at 267 Cousteau Place (main building) and 202 Cousteau Place (CMB and Developmental Psychology Annex). The CMB and Developmental Psychology Annex includes over {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. of custom designed laboratories, offices and shared facilities that currently houses 16 faculty laboratories.
