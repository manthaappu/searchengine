'''HealthBoards''' is a long-running [[support group]] website consisting of over 150 [[Internet forum|Internet message boards]] for peer to peer health support (also referred to as a [[virtual community]] or [[online health community]]). The site is unique in that it is purely a health community site, unlike other established health communities on the Web which have generally been part of large web portals ([[WebMD]], [[Yahoo]], [[iVillage]], etc.). As of June 2006 the site received over 2.3 million messages posted by over 250,000 registered members. In 2004 HealthBoards established a partnership with [[WebMD]] to provide additional health content and advertising support for HealthBoards. HealthBoards is currently ranked in the top 20,000 websites worldwide in terms of traffic by [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]].

==History==
HealthBoards was founded by site owner and current President/CEO Chuck Simmons. In 1997, after experiencing a variety of symptoms for which doctors had no explanation, Simmons turned to the Web for answers and support. When he did not find online [[support groups]] in the areas he needed, he decided to develop a health support site covering a wide range of health topics. After a year of development, the site launched with 70 message boards. By 2000, the site had grown to over 90 boards. Since then, the site has experienced steady growth.


==Operation==
On HealthBoards all health topics are given individual message boards. Each message board typically contains thousands of discussion threads, each relating to a specific question or comment initiated by a HealthBoards user. Participation on HealthBoards requires free registration. Users who register must supply an email address and login name. Users who are not registered may still view all the contents of the message boards, but cannot post messages. Anonymous posting is not allowed. The boards are moderated by a large staff of mostly volunteers. Users who violate the participation policy are temporarily banned from using the site. Repeat violations usually result in a permanent ban. Due to the extremely tight control that the moderators keep over the board people are often unable to get the full picture of available resources as they ban anyone who submits links to outside resources or tries to exchange emails so they may speak in private. Any information that the moderators disagree with is censored and made unavailable for members to view and decide about themselves. There are numerous complaints around the internet about the behavior of the site staff and the draconian and misapplied moderation.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}
