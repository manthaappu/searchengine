<html> <head> <title>Time-based One-time Password Algorithm</title></head><body>'''TOTP - Time-based One-time Password Algorithm ''' is an extension of the [[HMAC|HMAC-based]] [[One-time password|One Time Password]] algorithm [[HOTP]] to support time based moving factor. TOTP was submitted to the IETF as an Internet-Draft.  it is a cornerstone of [[Initiative For Open Authentication]] (OATH).

==Applications==
TOTP can be used to authenticate a user in a system via an authentication server. Also, if some more steps are carried out, the user can also authenticate the validation server.

==History==
The TOTP draft was developed through the collaboration of several OATH members in order to create an industry-backed standard. It complements the event-based one-time standard HOTP, and offers end user organizations and enterprises more choice in selecting technologies that best fit their application requirements and security guidelines.

In addition, OATH also submitted the final version of the OCRA (OATH Challenge-Response Algorithms) specification to the IETF. This version incorporates all the feedback and commentary that the authors received from the technical community based on the prior versions submitted to the IETF.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.openauthentication.org/news/20080408|title=OATH Submits TOTP: Time-Based One Time Password Specification to IETF|last=Alexander|first=Madison|work=Open Authentication|date=|accessdate=22 February 2010}}</ref>
