'''HiGig''' is a [[proprietary protocol]] that is implemented by [[Broadcom]]. The HiGig protocol supports various switching functions like [[Quality of service|Quality-of-Service (QoS)]], link aggregation, and others. The physical signaling across the interface is [[XAUI]], four differential pairs for receive and transmit ([[SerDes]]), each operating at 3.125 Gbit/s. HiGig+ is a higher rate version of HiGig. HiGig can be compared to the [[Interlaken (networking)]] protocol.
