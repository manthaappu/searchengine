==VRX - VRX/E==
'''VRX''' is an acronym for '''Virtual Resource eXecutive''', a proprietary [[operating system]] on the [[NCR Criterion]] series, and later the V-8000 series of [[mainframe computer]]s manufactured by [[NCR Corporation]] during the 1970s and 1980s. It replaced the B3 Operating System originally distributed with the Criterion series, and inherited many of the features of the [[B4 Operating System]] from the high-end of the [[NCR Century]] series of computers. VRX was upgraded in the late 1980s and 1990s to become VRX/E for use on the [[NCR 9800]] series of computers.
