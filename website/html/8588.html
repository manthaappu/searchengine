<html> <head> <title>Cryptanalysis of the Enigma</title></head><body>'''Cryptanalysis of the Enigma''' enabled the western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in [[World War II]] to read substantial amounts of secret [[Morse code|Morse-coded]] radio communications of the [[Axis powers]] that had been enciphered using [[Enigma machine]]s. This yielded [[military intelligence]] which, along with that from other decrypted [[Axis powers|Axis]] radio and [[teleprinter]] transmissions, was given the codename ''[[Ultra]]''. 

Enigma [[cryptanalysis]] contributed the majority of Ultra intelligence, which was considered by western Supreme Allied Commander [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to have been "decisive" to Allied victory in World War II.<ref>[[F.W. Winterbotham|Winterbotham]] (1974), pp. 16–17.</ref> 

The Enigma machines were a family of portable [[cipher]] machines with [[rotor machine|rotor]] [[scrambler]]s.<ref>{{ Citation | last = Reuvers | first = Paul | last2 = Simons | first2 = Marc | title = Enigma Cipher Machine | year = 2009,2010 | url = http://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/enigma/index.htm | accessdate = 22 July 2010 }}</ref> Good operating procedures, properly enforced, would have made the cipher unbreakable.<ref>[[Gordon Welchman|Welchman]] (1984), p. 3.</ref><ref>[[Peter Calvocoressi|Calvocoressi]] (2001), p. 66.</ref>  However, most of the German armed and secret services and civilian agencies that used Enigma employed poor procedures. The German Navy ''([[Reichsmarine]]'' and ''[[Kriegsmarine]])'' used better procedures than most. It was the poor operating procedures that allowed the cipher to be broken.

The German plugboard-equipped Enigma that would become the [[Third Reich|Third Reich's]] principal [[cryptography|crypto-system]] was reconstructed—with the aid of French-supplied intelligence material that had been obtained from a German spy—by the [[Polish General Staff|Polish General Staff's]] [[Biuro Szyfrów|Cipher Bureau]] in December 1932. From then until the outbreak of [[World War II]], the Poles held a monopoly in decrypting German military Enigma ciphers. In July 1939, as war drew near, the Polish Cipher Bureau initiated the French and British into its Enigma-breaking techniques and technology at a conference held in [[Warsaw]].

From this beginning, the British [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GCCS)|Government Code and Cypher School]] at [[Bletchley Park]] built up an extensive cryptanalytic facility that used manual methods and machines — "[[Bombe]]s". The methods used to break Enigma messages relied heavily on the poor design and implementation of German security procedures. Initially, the decryption was mainly of ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' and a few Army messages, as the German Navy employed much more secure procedures for using Enigma. 

[[Alan Turing]], a [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] mathematician and logician, provided much of the original thinking that led to the design of the Bombes and the eventual breaking of naval Enigma. However, when the German Navy introduced for its [[U-boats]] an Enigma version with a fourth rotor, there was a prolonged period when those messages could not be decrypted. With the capture of relevant cipher keys and the use of much faster [[Bombe#US Navy Bombe|U.S. Navy Bombes]], regular, rapid reading of German naval messages resumed.

==General principles==
{{main|Cryptanalysis}}
The Enigma machines produced a [[Polyalphabetic cipher|polyalphabetic substitution cipher]]. The early monoalphabetic [[Substitution cipher|substitution ciphers]] had been superseded by polyalphabetic ones, such as the [[Vigenère cipher]] in the 16th century. They had been considered to be completely secure (''le chiffre indéchiffrable''—"the indecipherable cipher") until [[Charles Babbage]] showed that, like monoalphabetic ones, they could be broken by [[frequency analysis]].<ref>[[Simon Singh|Singh]] (1999) pp. 45-78</ref> 

During [[World War I]], inventors in several countries realized that a purely random key sequence, containing no repetitive pattern, would make a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, in principle, unbreakable.<ref>[[Simon Singh|Singh]] (1999) p. 116 </ref> This led to the development of [[rotor cipher machine]]s which alter each character in the [[plaintext]] to produce the [[ciphertext]], by means of a scrambler comprising a set of ''rotors'' (or ''wheels'') that alter the electrical path from character to character, between the input device (in Enigma, a keyboard) and the output device (in Enigma, a lampboard). This constant altering of the electrical pathway produces a very long period before the pattern—the [[Key (cryptography)|key sequence]] or [[substitution alphabet]]—repeats.

Deciphering enciphered messages involves three stages.<ref>Churchhouse (2002) p. 4</ref> Firstly, there is the ''identification'' of the system in use, in this case Enigma. Secondly, ''breaking'' the system by establishing exactly how encryption takes place, and thirdly, ''setting'', which involves finding the way that the machine was set up for an individual message, ''i.e.'' the ''message key''. Although [[Kerckhoffs' principle]] states that a [[cryptosystem]] should be secure even when everything about the system except the key is known to the enemy, the internal wiring of machines such as Enigma has so many possibilities, that this second stage is a very important aspect of breaking them.

==The Enigma machines==
{{main|Enigma machine}}
[[Image:EnigmaMachineLabeled.jpg|thumb|The [[Enigma machine]] was used commercially from the early 1920s and was adopted by the militaries and governments of various countries—most famously, [[Nazi Germany]].]][[Image:Enigma rotor set.png|thumbnail|right|A series of three rotors from an Enigma machine]]
The Enigma was potentially an excellent system. It was designed to defeat [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalytic]] techniques by continually changing the [[substitution alphabet]] through the use of a scrambler comprising three—or in some cases, four—[[Enigma rotor details|rotor]]s. Like other [[rotor cipher machine|rotor cipher-machine]]s, Enigma generated a [[polyalphabetic substitution]] cipher, with a period before repetition that was much longer than any message, or set of messages, sent with the same key.

===Structure===
The mechanism of the Enigma consisted of a [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] connected to a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] and a [[Enigma machine#Entry wheel|current entry plate]] or wheel (German: ''Eintrittswalze''), at the right hand end of the scrambler (usually via a [[plugboard]] in the military versions).<ref>Alexander (c. 1945) "Background" Para. 2</ref> This contained a set of 26 contacts that made electrical connection with the set of 26 spring-loaded pins on the right hand rotor. The internal wiring of the core of each rotor provided an electrical pathway from the pins on one side to different connection points on the other. The left hand side of each rotor made electrical connection with the rotor to its left. The leftmost rotor then made contact with the [[Enigma machine#Reflector|reflector]] (German: ''Umkehrwalze''). The reflector provided a set of thirteen paired connections to return the current back through the scrambler rotors, and eventually to the lampboard where a lamp under a letter was illuminated.<ref>{{ Citation | last = Ellsbury  | first = Graham  | publication-date = 1998 | title = Description of the Enigma Machine | series = The Enigma Machine: Its Construction, Operation and Complexity | url = http://www.ellsbury.com/enigma2.htm | accessdate = 21 January 2009 }}</ref>

Whenever a key on the keyboard was pressed, the [[Enigma machine#Stepping motion|stepping motion]] was actuated, moving the rightmost rotor on one position. Because it advanced with each key pressed it is sometimes called the ''fast rotor''. When a notch on that rotor engaged with a [[Enigma machine#Stepping motion|pawl]] on the middle rotor, that too moved; and similarly with the leftmost ('slow') rotor.

There are a huge number of ways that the connections within each scrambler rotor—and between the entry plate and the keyboard or plugboard or lampboard—could be arranged. For the reflector plate there are fewer, but still a large number of options to its possible wirings.<ref>Churchhouse (2002) pp.202-204</ref>

Each scrambler rotor could be set to any one of its 26 starting positions (any letter of the alphabet). For the Enigma machines with only three rotors, their sequence in the scrambler—which was known as the ''wheel order (WO)'' to [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] cryptanalysts—could be selected from the six that are possible.

[[Image:Enigma-plugboard.jpg|right|thumbnail|The plugboard (''Steckerbrett'') was positioned at the front of the machine, below the keys. In the above photograph, two pairs of letters have been swapped (A-J and S-O).]]

Later Enigma models included an ''alphabet ring'' like a tyre around the core of each rotor. This could be set in any one of 26 positions in relation to the rotor's core. The ring contained one or more notches that engaged with a pawl that advanced the next rotor to the left.<ref>{{ Citation | last = Sale | first = Tony | author-link = Anthony Sale | title = The components of the Enigma machine | series = Enigma rotors (or wheels) | url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/enigma/enigma2.htm | accessdate = 1 January 2010 }}</ref>  

Later still, the three rotors for the scrambler were selected from a set of five or, in the case of the German Navy, eight rotors. The alphabet rings of rotors VI, VII and VIII contained two notches which, despite shortening the period of the key, made decryption more difficult. 

Most military Enigmas also featured a [[plugboard]] (German: ''Steckerbrett''). This altered the electrical pathway between the keyboard and the entry wheel of the scrambler and, in the opposite direction, between the scrambler and the lampboard. It did this by exchanging letters reciprocally, so that if ''A'' was plugged to ''G'' then pressing key ''A'' would lead to current entering the scrambler at the ''G'' position, and if ''G'' was pressed the current would enter at ''A''. The same connections applied for the current on the way out to the lamp panel. 

For an enemy to decipher German military Enigma messages required that the following were known.
:'''Logical structure of the machine''' (unchanging)
::The wiring between the keyboard (and lampboard) and the entry plate.
::The wiring of each rotor.
::The number and position(s) of turnover notches on the rings of the rotors.
::The wiring of the reflectors.
:'''Internal settings''' (usually changed less frequently than external settings)
::The selection of rotors in use and their positions on the spindle (''Walzenlage'' or "wheel order").
::The positions of the alphabet ring's turnover notch in relation to the core of each rotor in use (''Ringstellung'' or "ring settings").
:'''External settings''' (usually changed more frequently than internal settings)
::The plugboard connections (''Steckerverbindungen'' or "stecker values").
::The initial positions of each rotor at the start of enciphering the message (the "message key") or the rotor positions at the start of enciphering the message key (''Grundstellung'' or "indicator-setting") from which the message key could be derived.

===Key setting===
Enigma featured the major operational convenience of being [[involution (mathematics)|symmetrical]] (or [[Inverse function|self-inverse]]). This meant that [[decipherment]] worked in the same way as [[encryption|encipherment]], so that when the [[ciphertext]] was typed in, the sequence of lamps that lit yielded the [[plaintext]]. This of course required that the deciphering machine's plugboard and scrambler rotors had been set identically to those of the enciphering machine. 

This was achieved by a variety of key setting procedures, which varied from time to time and across different [[Telecommunications network|networks]]. They consisted of a combination of transmitting an ''[[Enigma machine#Indicator|indicator]]''<ref>Churchhouse (2002) pp. 33, 86</ref><ref>[[Peter Twinn|Twinn]] (1993) p. 129</ref> with the message, and ''setting sheets'' in a ''[[codebook]]''.<ref>{{ Citation | last = Sale | first = Tony | author-link = Anthony Sale | title = Military Use of the Enigma: The Message Key and Setting Sheets | series = Codes and Ciphers in the Second World War: The history, science and engineering of cryptanalysis in World War II  | url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/enigma/enigma3.htm | accessdate = 21 October 2008 }} </ref><ref>{{Citation | last = Rijmenants | first = Dirk | title = Enigma Message Procedures | work = Cipher Machines and Cryptology | url = http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigmaproc.htm | accessdate = 19 November 2009 }}</ref>  These were distributed to all users of a network<ref>Confusingly, the word ''key'' was also used at [[Bletchley Park]] to describe the network that used the same Enigma setting sheets. Initially these were recorded using coloured pencils and had the names ''red'', ''light blue'' etc., and later birds such as ''kestrel''. [[Harry Hinsley|Hinsley, F.H.]] and Stripp, Alan (1993) p. xviii and [[Harry Hinsley|Hinsley]] (1992) p. 2 </ref> and were changed regularly (at first monthly or weekly, but soon daily and even several times a day).<ref>One element of the key, the sequence of rotors in the machine, at first was changed quarterly; but from 1 January 1936 it was changed monthly; from 1 October 1936, daily; and later, during [[World War II]], as often as every eight hours. [[Marian Rejewski]], ''Summary of Our Methods for Reconstructing ENIGMA and Reconstructing Daily Keys...'', Appendix C to [[Władysław Kozaczuk]], ''Enigma'' (1984) p. 242</ref>  The sheets had columns specifying, for each date, the rotors to be used and their positions, the ring positions and the plugboard connections. The dates were in reverse chronological order down the page. Each row was cut off and destroyed when it was finished with, so that, in the event of capture, previous keys would not be revealed.<ref>US Army (1945) p. 2</ref>

For each message, the transmitting operator would send the ''message key'' (the key specific to that message) so that the receiving operator could align his rotors identically. This message key was itself enciphered on the machine using the ''indicator setting''. At first the indicator setting was specified as the ''ground key'' on the setting sheets, but later on, it was selected by the operator. The German Navy adopted a more complex and secure procedure on 1 May 1937 (see "[[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#German naval Enigma|German naval Enigma]]" below). The other users, however, continued with the insecure procedure of sending the message key twice, in case poor radio reception might have led to it being garbled. This was not changed until 10 May 1940.<ref>Gaj and Orłowski section 7 </ref>

===Security properties===
The various Enigma models provided different levels of security. The presence of a plugboard (''Steckerbrett'') substantially increased the security of the encipherment. Each pair of letters that were connected together by a plugboard lead, were referred to as ''stecker partners'', and the letters that remained unconnected were said to be ''self-steckered''.<ref>[[Jack Copeland|Copeland]] (2004) p. 245</ref> In general, the unsteckered Enigma was used for commercial and diplomatic traffic and could be broken relatively easily using hand methods, while attacking versions with a plugboard was much more difficult. The British read unsteckered Enigma messages sent during the [[Spanish Civil War]],<ref>[[Michael Smith (newspaper reporter)|Smith]] (2006) p. 23</ref> and also some [[Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma#Italian naval Enigma|Italian naval traffic]] enciphered early in World War II.                

The strength of the security of the ciphers that were produced by the Enigma machine was a product of the large numbers associated with the scrambling process.
#It produced a polyalphabetic substitution cipher with a period (16,900) that was many times the length of the longest message.
#The 3-rotor scrambler could be set in 26 × 26 × 26 = 17,576 ways, and the 4-rotor scrambler in 26 × 17,576 = 456,976 ways.
#With six leads on the plugboard, the number of ways that pairs of letters could be interchanged was 100,391,791,500 (100 billion)<ref>Singh (1999) p. 136 </ref> and with ten leads, it was 150,738,274,937,250 (150 trillion).<ref>{{Citation | last = Sale | first = Tony | author-link = Anthony Sale | title = Military Use of the Enigma: The complexity of the Enigma machine | url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/enigma/enigma3.htm | accessdate = 2 June 2010 }} </ref>

However, the way that Enigma was used by the Germans, with the exception of their Navy, meant that, if the settings for one day (or whatever period was represented by each row of the setting sheet) were established, the rest of the messages for that network on that day could quickly be deciphered.<ref>[[Jack Copeland|Copeland]] (2004) p. 250</ref>

The security of Enigma ciphers did have fundamental weaknesses that proved helpful to cryptanalysts.
#A letter could never be [[encrypt]]ed to itself <ref>Mahon (1945) p. 3</ref>(with the exception of the early models A and B, which lacked a reflector). This property was of great help in using ''[[Known-plaintext attack|cribs]]''—short sections of plaintext thought to be somewhere in the ciphertext—and could be used to eliminate a crib in a particular position. For a possible location, if any letter in the crib matched a letter in the ciphertext at the same position, the location could be ruled out; at Britain's [[Government Code and Cipher School]] (GCCS) at [[Bletchley Park]], this was termed a ''crash''.<ref>Mahon (1945) p. 16</ref> It was this feature that the British [[mathematician]] and [[logic]]ian [[Alan Turing]] would exploit in designing the British [[bombe]].
#The plugboard connections were reciprocal, so that if A was plugged to N, then N likewise became A. It was this property that led mathematician [[Gordon Welchman]] at Bletchley Park to propose that a ''diagonal board'' be introduced into the bombe, substantially reducing the number of incorrect rotor settings that the bombes found.<ref>[[Gordon Welchman|Welchman]] (1984) pp. 301-7</ref>
#The notches in the ''alphabet rings'' of rotors I to V were in different positions, which helped cryptanalysts to work out the ''wheel order'' by observing when the middle rotor was turned over by the right-hand rotor.<ref> [[Friedrich L. Bauer|Bauer]] (2002) p. 135 </ref>
#There were substantial weaknesses, in both policies and practice, in the way that Enigma was used (see [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Operating shortcomings|'Operating shortcomings']] below).

==Polish breakthrough==
{{main|Polish Cipher Bureau|Cyclometer}}
In 1928 the German Army, Navy and Air Force began using a 3-rotor Enigma with a 6-cable plugboard.<ref>Wilcox (2001) p. 2 </ref> British, French and American cryptanalysts had no success in cracking this cipher.<ref>[[Simon Singh|Singh]] (1999) p. 143 </ref> In Poland, where the threat from Germany was much greater, the [[Polish Cipher Bureau]] in Warsaw continued work on it. On 1 September 1932, a 27-year-old Polish mathematician, [[Marian Rejewski]], joined the Bureau along with two fellow [[Poznań University]] mathematics graduates, [[Henryk Zygalski]] and [[Jerzy Różycki]].<ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]]; [[Richard Woytak|Woytak]] (1984) p. 231 </ref> Their first task had to be the solving of the logical structure of the military Enigma, which differed from the commercial version that they had seen. 
       
[[Image:MR 1932 small.jpg|thumb|[[Marian Rejewski]] about 1932, when he first broke [[Enigma machine|Enigma]]]]
                    
In December 1932, the [[Polish Cipher Bureau]] received from Captain [[Gustave Bertrand]] of French Military Intelligence two German documents and two pages of Enigma daily keys (for September and October of that year)<ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]]; [[Richard Woytak|Woytak]] (1984) p. 256</ref> which had been obtained by the French from an agent who worked at Germany's Cipher Office in Berlin, [[Hans Thilo-Schmidt]]. The documents were ''Instructions for Using the Enigma Cipher Machine'' and ''Keying Instructions for the Enigma Cipher Machine''. This material enabled Rejewski to achieve "one of the most important breakthroughs in [[cryptology|cryptologic]] history"<ref>[[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]] (1996) p. 974 </ref> by using elementary [[group theory]] to solve the Enigma wiring independently of the plugboard connections.<ref>Wilcox (2001) p. 5</ref><ref>[[Andrew Hodges|Hodges]] (1983) p. 170</ref>   

Marian Rejewski later recalled that the table of keys was
{{blockquote|a great help to me, because thanks to [them] the number of unknowns in the equations  was reduced, and I was able to solve [the] equations, and... as I was sitting there writing, the internal connections just came out in the form... of letters or numbers, I don't recall [which]—the internal connections ['wiring'] for the first [rotor], the one... on the far right, which always... revolved at every depression of a key.<ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]]; [[Richard Woytak|Woytak]] (1984) p. 233</ref>}}and that{{blockquote|it was very important that the months [covered in the daily-key tables] happened to be September and October, in other words, periods that belonged to two different quarters [of the year. This is] because... the key consisted of several elements [and] one element of the key was changed only once a quarter. Namely, the order of the [rotors].... [A]t that time they were changed once a quarter. [S]ince September and October belonged to two different quarters, in September and October the orders of the [rotors] were different. [With] the method that I had been using to find the [wiring] in a [rotor]... I could only solve the [far] right-hand [rotor], the one that revolved one place every time [a key was pressed]. The point is that, thanks to the keys for September, I could solve the [rotor] that was in the far right-hand position in September. And since I also had the keys for October, using the same method I was later able to find the [wiring] in the [rotor] that was at the [far] right in October. [T]he third [rotor] and... the [reflector] now weren't so difficult... I managed to find them by other methods.<ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]]; [[Richard Woytak|Woytak]] (1984) p. 234</ref>}}

A crucial inspired guess on Rejewski's part was that the connections between the keyboard and the entry ring were in alphabetical order, rather than in the order of the keys on a German typewriter keyboard: QWERTZUIO... — the order that was used in the commercial Enigma. Britain's [[Dilly Knox]] was astonished when he learned, in July 1939, that the entry-ring order was so simple.<ref>[[Jack Copeland|Copeland]] (2004) p. 234</ref><ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]] (1984 d) p. 257 citing {{ Citation | last = Fitzgerald | first = Penelope  | author-link = Penelope Fitzgerald | year = 1977 | title = The Knox Brothers | publication-place = London | publisher = Macmillan | isbn = 1-58243-095-0 }}</ref> Having worked out the logical structure of the military Enigma, Rejewski had replicas made, which he called [[Polish Enigma doubles|'Enigma doubles']]. The Poles then built up capacity until they were able to decrypt a substantial proportion of German Enigma traffic. This ability lasted until December 1938 when two additional rotors were introduced,<ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]] (1984 c) pp. 242–43</ref> although Rejewski did solve their wiring.

===Early indicator procedures===
The message indicator in the 1930s was a 6-letter sequence comprising the three letters of the message key, enciphered twice using the initial rotor position given in the ground setting (e.g., ''RAO'').<ref>[[Andrew Hodges|Hodges]] (1983) p. 171</ref> If the 3-letter message key chosen by the operator was ''IHL'', he would encipher this after having set the rotors to ''RAO''. The resultant ciphertext, say ''OTUNSD'', would be transmitted, followed by the message, enciphered using message key ''IHL''. The receiving operator would use the ground setting ''RAO'' to decipher the first six letters, yielding ''IHLIHL''. The receiving operator would then decipher the message, using message key ''IHL''.

In the example of ''OTUNSD'' being the enciphered indicator, it is known that the first letter ''O'' and the fourth letter ''N'' represent the same letter, enciphered three positions apart in the scrambler sequence. Similarly with ''T'' and ''S'' in the second and fifth positions, and ''U'' and ''D'' in the third and sixth. Rejewski exploited this fact by collecting a sufficient set of messages enciphered with the same ground key, and assembling three tables for the 1,4, the 2,5, and the 3,6 pairings. Each of these might look something like the following: 
{|class="wikitable" | border=1 | style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto" 
|-
! First letter
| A||B||C||D||E||F||G||H||I||J||K||L||M||N||O||P||Q||R||S||T||U||V||W||X||Y||Z

! Fourth letter
| X||F||E||A||R||B||S||L||H||Q||I||G||C||V||D||Z||W||K||M||N||J||U||O||Y||T||P
|}
A path from one first letter to the corresponding fourth letter, then from that letter as the first letter to its corresponding fourth letter, and so on until the first letter recurs, traces out a [[Cycle graph (algebra)|cycle group]].<ref>Also referred to as a ''box shape'' or a ''chain''. See [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Alexander]] (''c.'' 1945) Ch. II Para. 4</ref>  The above table contains four cycle groups.

[[File:Cyclometer4.png|thumb|175px|[[Cyclometer]], devised in the mid-1930s by Rejewski to catalog the [[cycle (mathematics)|cycle]] structure of [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] [[permutation]]s. 1: Rotor lid closed, 2: Rotor lid open, 3: Rheostat, 4: Glowlamps, 5: Switches, 6: Letters.]]
The Poles realised that, although the letters in these cycle groups were changed by the plugboard, their patterns—in this example, four groups with 12, 10, 2 and 2 links—were not. This reduced the number of possibilities for the indicator setting from 10,000 trillion to 105,456.<ref>105,456 is the number of possible rotor settings (17,576) multiplied by the six ''wheel orders'' that were possible at this time. [[Simon Singh|Singh]] (1999) p. 153</ref> They therfore set about creating a ''card catalog'' of these cycle patterns.<ref>[[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Alexander]] (''c.'' 1945) Ch. II Para. 4</ref> 

[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]], in 1934 or 1935, devised a machine to facilitate this task, called a ''[[cyclometer]]''. This "comprised two sets of rotors... connected by wires through which electric current could run. Rotor N in the second set was three letters out of phase with respect to rotor N in the first set, whereas rotors L and M in the second set were always set the same way as rotors L and M in the first set".<ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]] (1984 e) p. 285</ref> Preparation of this catalog, using the cyclometer, was, said Rejewski, "laborious and took over a year, but when it was ready, obtaining daily keys was a question of [some fifteen] minutes".<ref name=RejewskiAppxC242>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]] (1984 c) p. 242</ref> 

However, on 1 November 1937, the Germans changed the Enigma [[reflector (cipher machine)|reflector]], necessitating the production of a new catalog&mdash;"a task which [says Rejewski] consumed, on account of our greater experience, probably somewhat less than a year's time".<ref name=RejewskiAppxC242/>

This cycle-pattern method stopped working for German naval Enigma messages on 1 May 1937, when the indicator procedure was changed to one involving special codebooks (see [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#German Navy 3-rotor Enigma|German Navy 3-rotor Enigma]] below.<ref name = MahonP13>Mahon (1945) p. 13</ref> On 15 September 1938 the indicator procedure for the German Army and Air Force was changed.<ref>[[Andrew Hodges|Hodges]] (1983) p. 173</ref> It now comprised a 9-letter sequence. The setting sheet no longer provided the indicator setting. Instead, the operator chose three letters, which were sent unenciphered, as the first three of the nine letters. These constituted the indicator setting for the next six letters, the 3-letter message key, which was still sent twice.<ref>[[Gordon Welchman|Welchman]] (1984) pp. 36, 60</ref><ref>Wilcox (2001) p. 6</ref>

===Perforated sheets===
[[File:Płachta Zygalskiego - decrypting Enigma.jpg|right|thumb|175px|[[Perforated sheets|Zygalski sheet]]]]
{{main|Zygalski sheets}}
Although the cycle pattern method no longer worked, the inclusion of the enciphered message key twice, gave rise to a phenomenon that the cryptanalyst [[Henryk Zygalski]] was able to exploit. Sometimes (about one message in eight) one of the repeated letters in the message key enciphered to the same letter on both occasions. These occurrences were called ''samiczki''<ref>[[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] (1984) pp. 54; 63, note 2</ref> (in English, ''females''—a term later used at Bletchley Park<ref>[[Gordon Welchman]] suggests that this arose from the nomenclature for plugs (male) and sockets (female) because the success of this method depended on a number of overlying sheets having their apertures in register. Welchman (1984) p. 72</ref><ref>[[Hugh Sebag-Montefiore]] cites [[Alfred Dillwyn Knox]], who attended the 25 July 1939 Warsaw conference, as having given a more frankly biological etymology, discreetly veiled in French. Sebag-Montefiore (2004) p. 362</ref>). 

Only a limited number of scrambler settings would give rise to females, and these would have been identifiable from the card catalog. If the first six letters of the ciphertext were '''''S'''ZV'''S'''IK'', this would be termed a 1-4 female; if ''W'''H'''OE'''H'''S'', a 2-5 female; and if ''AS'''W'''CR'''W''''', a 3-6 female. The method was called ''Netz'' (from ''Netzverfahren'', "net method"), or the [[Zygalski sheets|Zygalski sheet method]] as it used perforated sheets that he devised, although at Bletchley Park Zygalski's name was not used for security reasons. Some ten females from a day's messages were required for success.

There was a set of 26 of these sheets for each of the six possible sequences ''wheel orders''. Each sheet was for the left (slowest-moving) rotor. The 26 by 26 matrices on the sheets represented the 676 possible starting positions of the middle and right rotors. The sheets were punched with holes in the positions that would allow a female to occur. The set of sheets for that day's messages would be appropriately positioned on top of each other in the [[Perforated sheets|perforated sheets apparatus]]. Rejewski wrote about how the device was operated:

{{blockquote|When the sheets were superposed and moved in the proper sequence and the proper manner with respect to each other, in accordance with a strictly defined program, the number of visible apertures gradually decreased.  And, if a sufficient quantity of data was available, there finally remained a single aperture, probably corresponding to the right case, that is, to the solution. From the position of the aperture one could calculate the order of the rotors, the setting of their rings, and, by comparing the letters of the cipher keys with the letters in the machine, likewise permutation S; in other words, the entire cipher key.<ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]] (1984 e) p. 289</ref>}}

===Polish ''bomba''===

{{main|Bomba (cryptography)}}
In about October 1938 [[Marian Rejewski]] invented an electro-mechanical device that was dubbed the [[bomba (cryptography)|''bomba kryptologiczna'']] or ''cryptologic bomb'' <ref>There are various accounts of the source of this name. One is that it originated from the characteristic muffled noise it produced when operating; alternative names puckishly given the device by Polish [[Biuro Szyfrów|Cipher Bureau]] personnel were ''washing machine'' and ''mangle''. Other alternative explanations are that it made a ticking noise, that a part was released to the floor when it was successful and even that it was thought up whilst eating a [[Bombe glacée]].</ref> Each machine contained six sets of Enigma rotors for the six positions of the repeated three-letter key. Like the Zygalski sheet method, the ''bomba'' relied on the occurrence of ''females'', but required only three instead of about ten for the sheet method. The ''bomby''<ref>''Bomby'' is the plural of ''bomba''.</ref> conducted exhaustive ([[Brute force attack|brute-force]]) analyses of the 17,576 rotor positions for each of the six ''wheel orders''. 

Rejewski has written about the device: {{blockquote|The bomb method, invented in the fall of 1938, consisted largely in the automation and acceleration of the process of reconstructing daily keys.  Each cryptologic bomb (six were built in [[Warsaw]] for the [[Biuro Szyfrow|Cipher Bureau]] before September 1939) essentially  constituted an electrically powered aggregate of six Enigmas.  It took the place of about one hundred workers and shortened the time for obtaining a key to about two hours.<ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]] (1984 e) p. 290</ref>}} 

On 15 December 1938, the German Army increased the complexity of Enigma enciphering. Previously only three rotors had been in use, now two additional rotors were introduced. This increased the number of possible ''wheel orders'' from six to 60.<ref name=Kozaczuk84p54>[[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] (1984) p. 54</ref> 

Other Enigma users received the two new rotors at the same time. However, until 1 July 1939 the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (''S.D.''—the S.S. Security Service) continued to use its machines in the old way with a six-letter indicator.<ref name=Kozaczuk84p54/> The Cipher Bureau immediately exploited this discrepancy and by about the turn of the year had worked out the wirings of rotors IV and V. 

Rejewski wrote, in a 1979 critique of appendix 1, volume 1 (1979), of the official history of British Intelligence in the Second World War: {{blockquote|we quickly found the [wirings] within the [new rotors], but [their] introduction ... raised the number of possible sequences of [rotors] from 6 to 60 ... and hence also raised tenfold the work of finding the keys. Thus the change was not qualitative but quantitative. We would have had to markedly increase the personnel to operate the bombs, to produce the perforated sheets ... and to manipulate the sheets.<ref name=RejewskiHinsleyP80>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]] (1982) p. 80</ref><ref>Also quoted in [[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] (1984) p. 63</ref> }}

Nevertheless, even with Rejewski's bomba and Zygalski's perforated sheets, the new indicator procedure and the increased number of rotors, posed some major problems.<ref>[[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] (1984) pp. 54–55</ref> These were exacerbated when, on 1 January 1939, the Germans increased the number of plugboard connections from between five and eight to between seven and ten.<ref name=RejewskiAppxC242/>

==World War II==
===Italian naval Enigma===

During the [[Spanish Civil War]], Italy sided with [[Francisco Franco|Franco's]] [[Spanish Civil War#Nationalists|Nationalists]]. The [[Regia Marina|Italian Navy]] used a version of Enigma that did not have a plugboard. In April 1937<ref>[[Andrew Hodges|Hodges]] (1983) p. 176</ref> [[Dilly Knox|Dillwyn "Dilly" Knox]], a gifted British [[cryptanalyst]] veteran of [[World War I]] and the cryptanalytical activities of [[Room 40]], managed to break this cipher, using a technique that he called ''buttoning up'' to discover the rotor wirings<ref name=CarterButtoningUp>{{  Citation | last = Carter | first = Frank | title = Buttoning Up: A method for recovering the wiring of the rotors used in a non-stecker Enigma | url = http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/buttoningup.pdf | accessdate = 20 January 2009 }}</ref> and another that he called ''rodding'' to break  messages.<ref name=CarterRodding>{{ Citation | last = Carter | first = Frank | title = Rodding | url = http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/rodding.pdf | accessdate = 20 January 2009 }}</ref> This relied heavily on [[Crib (cryptanalysis)|cribs]] and on a crossword-solver's expertise in Italian, as it yielded a limited number of spaced-out letters at a time.

When in 1940 Dilly Knox wanted to establish whether the Italian Navy were still using the same system, he instructed his assistants to use rodding to see whether the crib ''PERX'' (''per'' being Italian for "for" and ''X'' being used to indicate a space between words) worked for the first part of the message. After three months there was no success, but Mavis Laver, a 19-year-old student, found that rodding produced ''PERS'' for the first four letters of one message. She then (against orders) tried beyond this and obtained ''PERSONALE'' (Italian for "personal"). This confirmed that the Italians were indeed using the same machines and procedures. 

The subsequent breaking of Italian naval Enigma ciphers led to substantial Allied successes. The cipher-breaking was disguised by sending a [[Surveillance aircraft|reconnaissance aircraft]] to the known location of a warship before attacking it, so that the Italians assumed that this was how they had been discovered. The [[Royal Navy|Royal Navy's]]  victory at the [[Battle of Cape Matapan|Battle of Matapan]] (March 1941) was considerably helped by [[Ultra]] intelligence obtained from Italian naval Enigma signals.

===Polish disclosures===

On 15 March 1939, Germany invaded [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]], and Britain and France pledged support for Poland in the event of action that threatened her independence.<ref> {{ Citation | last = Chamberlain | first = Neville  | author-link = Neville Chamberlain | date = 31 March 1939 | title = European Situation (2.52 p.m.) | periodical = Hansard | publisher = UK Parliament | volume = 345 | url = http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1939/mar/31/european-situation-1 | accessdate = 3 January 2009 }} </ref> Then, on 27 April, Germany withdrew from the [[German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact]] of January 1934. The Polish General Staff, realizing what was likely to happen, decided to share their work on Enigma decryption with their  western allies. [[Marian Rejewski]] later wrote: {{blockquote|[I]t was not [as [[Harry Hinsley]] suggested, cryptological] difficulties of ours that prompted us to work with the British and French, but only the deteriorating political situation. If we had had no difficulties at all we would still, or even the more so, have shared our achievements with our allies as our contribution to the struggle against Germany.<ref name=RejewskiHinsleyP80/><ref>[[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] (1984) p. 64</ref>}} 

At a conference in Warsaw on 26 July 1939, the Poles revealed to the French and British that they had broken Enigma and pledged to give each a Polish-reconstructed Enigma, along with details of their Enigma-solving techniques and equipment, including Zygalski's [[perforated sheets]] and Rejewski's [[bomba (cryptography)|cryptologic bomb]].<ref>Erskine (1984) p. 59</ref> [[Dilly Knox]] was a member of the British delegation. He commented on the fragility of the Polish system's reliance on the repetition in the indicator because it might, "at any moment be cancelled".<ref> [[Jack Copeland|Copeland]] (2004) p. 246 </ref> Two [[Polish Enigma doubles]] were sent to Paris, whence [[Gustave Bertrand]] sent one to London, handing it to [[Stewart Menzies]] of Britain's [[Secret Intelligence Service]] at [[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]].<ref>[[Gustave Bertrand|Bertrand]] (1973) pp. 60–61</ref> 

[[Gordon Welchman]], who became head of [[Hut 6]] at Bletchley Park, wrote: {{blockquote|Hut 6 [[Ultra]] would never have gotten off the ground if we had not learned from the Poles, in the nick of time, the details both of the German military version of the commercial Enigma machine, and of the operating procedures that were in use.<ref>[[Gordon Welchman|Welchman]] (1984) p. 289</ref> }}

[[Peter Calvocoressi]], who became head of the Luftwaffe section in Hut 3, wrote of the Polish contribution: {{blockquote|The one moot point is - how valuable? According to the best qualified judges it accelerated the breaking of Enigma by perhaps a year. The British did not adopt Polish techniques but they were enlightened by them.<ref>{{Citation | last = Calvocoressi | first = Peter  | author-link = Peter Calvocoressi | title = Credit to the Poles  | newspaper = The Times | page = 13 | date = 23 March 1984 }}</ref>}}

===Polish cryptanalysts escape===
On 17 September, as the [[Soviet Army]] invaded eastern Poland, Cipher Bureau personnel crossed their country's southeastern border, together with other Polish military and government personnel, into [[Romania]].  They eventually made their way to [[France]]. Some personnel of the Cipher Bureau's German section who had worked with Enigma, and most of the workers at the AVA Radio Company that had built [[Polish Enigma doubles|Enigma doubles]] and cryptologic equipment for the German section, remained in Poland. Some were interrogated by the [[Gestapo]], but no one gave away the secret of Polish mastery of Enigma decryption.<ref>[[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] (1984) pp. 211–16</ref> 

[[File:Gwido Langer Gustave Bertrand Kenneth McFarlan.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[PC Bruno]]'' during the [[Phony War]]. ''From left'': Polish Lt. Col. [[Gwido Langer]], French Major [[Gustave Bertrand]], British Capt. Kenneth ("Pinky") McFarlan.]]

On 20 October 1939, at ''[[PC Bruno]]'' outside [[Paris]], the Polish mathematician-cryptologists  resumed work on German Enigma ciphers in collaboration with [[Bletchley Park]].<ref>[[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] (1984) pp. 69–94, 104–11</ref> Actually, they might have reached Britain much earlier than they eventually did, in 1943, had they not been brushed off by preoccupied British diplomats in the British Embassy in [[Bucharest]].<ref>[[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] (1984) p. 79</ref>

As late as December 1939, when Lt. Col. [[Gwido Langer]], chief of the [[Polish Cipher Bureau]], and French Air Force Captain [[Henri Braquenié]], visited London and Bletchley Park, the British asked that the Polish cryptologists be turned over to them. Langer, however, took the position that the Polish team must remain where the [[Polish Armed Forces]] were being re-formed—on French soil.<ref>[[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] (1984) pp. 99, 102</ref>  

''PC Bruno'' and Bletchley Park worked together closely, communicating via a [[telegraph]] ([[teletype]]) line secured by the use of Enigma doubles. Henri Braquenié sometimes closed the Enigma-enciphered messages with an ironic ''Heil Hitler''.<ref>[[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] (1984) p. 87</ref> In January 1940 [[Alan Turing]] spent several days at ''PC Bruno'' conferring with his Polish colleagues. He had brought the Poles [[Zygalski sheets]] that had been punched at Bletchley Park by [[John R.F. Jeffreys|John Jeffreys]] using Polish-supplied information, but which were not always working. It turned out that the wirings in Enigma rotors IV and V that Rejewski had worked out, had been copied down wrongly.<ref>[[Michael Smith (newspaper reporter)|Smith]] (2006) p. 27</ref> Correcting this error allowed the Poles to make, on 17 January 1940, the first break into wartime Enigma traffic—that from 28 October 1939.<ref>[[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]], (1984), pp. 84; 94, note 8 </ref> From that time, until the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] in June 1940, 17 percent of the Enigma keys that were found, were solved at ''PC Bruno''.<ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]] (1982) pp. 81–82 </ref> 

The Germans, just before opening their 10 May 1940 offensive against [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[Holland]] in their thrust towards France, made the feared change in the indicator procedure, discontinuing the duplication of the enciphered message key. This rendered the Zygalski sheets "completely useless"<ref name="Rejewski84P243">[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]] (1984 c) p. 243</ref><ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]] (1984 d) pp. 269–70</ref> and temporarily defeated the joint British-Polish efforts. According to [[Gustave Bertrand]], "It took ''superhuman'' day-and-night effort to overcome this new difficulty: on May 20, decryption resumed."<ref>[[Gustave Bertrand|Bertrand]] (1973) pp. 88–89</ref><ref>According to [[Gwido Langer]], the interruption in decryption was shorter, 13–19 May 1940. [[Władysław Kozaczuk]] (1984) p. 115, note 2.</ref> 

At this stage, to break the Germans' Enigma ciphers, the cryptanalysts had to rely on exploiting the [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Operating shortcomings|operator weaknesses]] described below (particularly the cillies and the [[Herivel tip]]), as well as on some others, such as the non-uniformly-placed notches in rotor alphabet-rings that caused the rotor to the left to move one space when the first rotor reached its particular letter-notch.<ref>[[David Kahn (writer)|Kahn]] (1991) pp. 112–14</ref>

After the Franco-German armistice, the Polish cryptological team resumed work in France's southern ''Free Zone'', although probably not on Enigma.<ref>It is not clear whether, after the June 1940 fall of France, the Cipher Bureau broke ''Enigma''.  Rejewski, the principal Polish source, wrote in a posthumously published 1980 paper that at [[Cadix]] "We worked on other ciphers, no longer on Enigma." ([[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 270.)  Colonel [[Stefan Mayer]] of Polish Intelligence, however, mentioned the Poles breaking "interesting [machine-enciphered messages] from [Germany's 1941] [[Balkan]] campaign coming [in over] the 'Luftwaffe' network..." ([[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 116.)  And French intelligence Gen. [[Gustave Bertrand]] wrote of Enigma having been read at Cadix. ([[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 117.) Tadeusz Lisicki, Rejewski's and Zygalski's immediate chief in wartime England but sometimes a dubious source, wrote in 1982 that "Rejewski in [a letter] conceded that Bertrand was doubtless right that at Cadix they had read Enigma, and that the number given by Bertrand, of 673 [Wehrmacht] telegrams, was correct.... The British did not send keys to Cadix; these were found using various tricks such as the sillies [and] [[Herivel tip]] described by [[Gordon Welchman|Welchman]], [[Alfred Dillwyn Knox|Knox]]'s method, as well as others that Rejewski no longer remembered." ([[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 117.)</ref>  They did, however, decrypt thousands of [[Soviet]] messages.<ref>[[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] 1984 ''Enigma'', p. 116.</ref> In France and in [[French Algeria]], they were at constant risk of discovery and imprisonment or worse.  When Germany took over Vichy France in November 1942, they had to flee once again .<ref>[[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]], (1984)  pp. 111–47</ref> The Cipher Bureau's chiefs, Colonel Gwido Langer and Major [[Maksymilian Ciezki]], and some of the technical staff were captured by the Germans but, despite extensive interrogation, preserved the secret of Enigma decryption.<ref>[[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] (1984) pp. 156, 220</ref>   

Marian Rejewski and Henryk Zygalski, after a perilous odyssey that took them across France, into a Spanish prison, to Portugal and at last by ship to Gibraltar, finally made it to Britain.  (The third mathematician, Jerzy Różycki, had perished, while returning in 1942 to France from a tour of duty in Algeria, in the sinking of the passenger ship ''Lamoricière''.) In Britain, Rejewski and Zygalski were inducted  into the Polish Army as privates (they would eventually be promoted to lieutenant) and put to work breaking German ''[[SS]]'' and ''[[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]]'' hand ciphers at a Polish signals facility in [[Boxmoor]]. Because of having been in occupied France, it was considered too risky to invite them to work at Bletchley Park.<ref>[[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk]] (1984) pp. 148–55, 205–9</ref>

===Operating shortcomings===
Apart from some less-than-ideal inherent characteristics of the Enigma, in practice the machine's greatest weakness was the way that it was used. The basic principle of this sort of enciphering machine is that it should deliver a very long stream of transformations that is difficult for a cryptanalyst to predict. Some of the instructions to operators, however, and their sloppy habits, had the opposite effect. Without these operating shortcomings, Enigma would not have been broken. 

The set of shortcomings that the Polish cryptanalysts exploited to such great effect included the following:

* Producing an early Enigma training manual containing an example of plaintext and its genuine ciphertext, together with the relevant message key. When Rejewski was given this in December 1932, it "made [his reconstruction of the [[Enigma machine]]] somewhat easier".<ref name="Rejewski84P243"/> 
* Repetition of the message key as described in [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Early indicator procedures|early indicator procedures]], above. (This helped in Rejewski's [[Marian Rejewski#Solving Enigma's wiring|solving Enigma's wiring]] in 1932, and was continued until May 1940.)
* Repeatedly using the same stereotypical expressions in messages, an early example of what Bletchley Park would later term [[crib (cryptanalysis)|cribs]]. Rejewski wrote that "...  we relied on the fact that the greater number of messages began with the letters ''ANX''—German for "to", followed by ''X'' as a spacer".<ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]] (1984 c) p. 243–44</ref> 
* The use of easily-guessed keys such as ''AAA'' or ''BBB'', or sequences that reflected the layout of the Enigma keyboard, such as "three [typing] keys that stand next to each other [o]r diagonally [from each other]..."<ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]]; [[Richard Woytak|Woytak]] (1984) p. 235</ref> Sometimes, with multi-part messages, the operator would not enter a key for a subsequent part of a message, merely leaving the rotors as they were at the end of the previous part, to become the message key for the next part.<ref>>[[Jack Copeland|Copeland]] (2004) p. 235 </ref> At Bletchley Park such occurrences were called ''cillies''<ref name="David Kahn 1991 p. 113">[[David Kahn (writer)|Kahn]] (1991) p. 113 </ref><ref>[[Hugh Sebag-Montefiore|Sebag-Montefiore]] (2004) p. 92 </ref> Cillies in the operation of the four-rotor ''Abwehr'' Enigma included four-letter names and German obscenities.
* Having only three different rotors for the three positions in the scrambler. (This continued until December 1938, when it was increased to five and then eight for naval traffic in 1940.)
* Using only six plugboard leads, leaving 14 letters ''unsteckered''. (This continued until January 1939 when the number of leads was increased, leaving only a small number of letters ''unsteckered''.)

Other useful shortcomings that were discovered by the British and later the American cryptanalysts included the following, many of which depended on frequent breaking of a particular network:

* The practice of re-transmitting a message in an identical, or near-identical, form on different cipher networks. If a message was transmitted using both a low-level cipher that Bletchley Park broke by hand, and Enigma, the decrypt provided an excellent ''crib'' for Enigma decipherment.<ref> Alexander (''c.'' 1945) "Background" Para. 38 </ref>
* For machines where there was a choice of more rotors than there were slots for them, a rule on some networks stipulated that no rotor should be in the same slot in the scrambler as it had been for the immediately preceding configuration. This reduced the number of ''wheel orders'' that had to be tried.<ref>Bauer (2007) p. 441 </ref>
* Not allowing a ''wheel order'' to be repeated on a monthly setting sheet. This meant that when the keys were being found on a regular basis, economies in excluding possible ''wheel orders''  could be made.<ref>Taunt (1993) p. 108 </ref> 
* The stipulation, for Air Force operators, that no letter should be connected on the plugboard to its neighbour in the alphabet. This reduced the problem of identifying the plugboard connections and was automated in some Bombes with a Consecutive Stecker Knock-Out (CKSO) device.<ref>Budiansky (2000) p. 240 </ref>
* The sloppy practice that [[John Herivel]] anticipated soon after his arrival at Bletchley Park in January 1940. He thought about the practical actions that an Enigma operator would have to make, and the short cuts he might employ. He thought that, after setting the alphabet rings to the prescribed setting, and closing the lid, the operator might not turn the rotors by more than a few places in selecting the first part of the indicator. Initially this did not seem to be the case, but after the changes of May 1940, what became known as the Herivel tip proved to be most useful.<ref>[[Gordon Welchman|Welchman]] (1984) pp. 98-100 </ref><ref>[[John Herivel]], cited by [[Michael Smith (newspaper reporter)|Smith]] (2007) pp. 50-51 </ref><ref name="David Kahn 1991 p. 113"/> 
* The practice of re-using some of the columns of ''wheel orders'', ring settings or plugboard connections from previous months. The resulting analytical short-cut was christened at Bletchley Park ''Parkerismus'' after Reg Parker, who had, through his meticulous record-keeping, spotted this phenomenon.<ref>[[Gordon Welchman|Welchman]] (1984) pp. 130,131,167 </ref>
* The re-use of a permutation in the German Air Force METEO code as the Enigma ''stecker'' permutation for the day.<ref>Bauer (2007) p. 442 </ref>

Mavis Lever, a member of [[Dilly Knox|Dilly Knox's]] team, recalled an occasion when there was an extraordinary message. {{blockquote|The one snag with Enigma of course is the fact that if you press ''A'', you can get every other letter but ''A''. I picked up this message and—one was so used to looking at things and making instant decisions&mdash;I thought: 'Something's gone. What has this chap done. There is not a single ''L'' in this message.'

My chap had been told to send out a dummy message and he had just had a fag [cigarette] and pressed the last key on the keyboard, the ''L''. So that was the only letter that didn't come out. We had got the biggest crib we ever had, the encypherment was ''LLLL'', right through the message and that gave us the new wiring for the wheel [rotor]. That's the sort of thing we were trained to do. Instinctively look for something that had gone wrong or someone who had done something silly and torn up the rule book.<ref>[[Michael Smith (newspaper reporter)|Smith]] (2007) pp. 59,60</ref> }}

Postwar debriefings of German cryptographic specialists, conducted as part of project [[TICOM]], tend to support the view that the Germans were well aware that Enigma was theoretically breakable, but felt that the resources required to mount a pure [[brute-force attack]] on it would be impracticable. To the war's end, the Germans continued making improvements to the system, though they considered it to be, for all practical purposes, unbreakable.

===Crib-based decryption===
The term ''[[Known-plaintext attack|crib]]'' was used at [[Bletchley Park]] to denote any ''[[known plaintext]]'' or ''suspected plaintext'' at some point in an enciphered message. This cryptanalytic approach was thus a ''[[chosen-plaintext attack]]''. 

Britain's Government Code and Cipher School (GCCS), before its move to Bletchley Park, had realized the value of recruiting mathematicians and logicians to work in codebreaking teams. [[Alan Turing]], a [[Cambridge University]] mathematician with an interest in cryptology and in machines for implementing logical operations—and who was regarded by many as a genius—had started work for GCCS on a part-time basis from about the time of the [[Munich Agreement|Munich Crisis]] in 1938.<ref> {{ Citation | last = Hodges | first = Andrew | author-link = Andrew Hodges | year = 1995 | title = Part 4: The Second World War | series = Alan Turing: a short biography | url = http://www.turing.org.uk/bio/part4.html | accessdate = 23 October 2008 }} </ref> [[Gordon Welchman]], another Cambridge mathematician, had also received initial training in 1938,<ref>[[Gordon Welchman|Welchman]] (1984) p. 11 </ref> and  they both reported to Bletchley Park on 4 September 1939, the day after Britain declared war on Germany.

Much of the Polish success had relied on the repetition within the indicator. But as soon as Turing moved to Bletchley Park—where he initially joined [[Dilly Knox]] in the research section—he set about seeking methods that did not rely on this weakness, as they correctly anticipated that the German Army and Air Force might follow the German Navy in improving their indicator system.

The Poles had used an early form of crib-based decryption in the days when only six leads were used on the plugboard.<ref name = MahonP13 /> The technique became known as the ''Forty Weepy Weepy'' method for the following reason. When a message was a continuation of a previous one, the plaintext would start with ''FORT'' (from ''Fortsetzung'', meaning "continuation") followed by the time of the first message given twice bracketed by the letter ''Y''. At this time numerals were represented by the letters on the top row of the Enigma keyboard. So, "continuation of message sent at 2330" was represented as ''FORTYWEEPYYWEEPY''.

''Cribs'' were fundamental to the British approach to breaking Enigma, but guessing the [[plaintext]] for a message was a highly skilled business. So in 1940 [[Stuart Milner-Barry]] set up a special ''Crib Room'' in Hut 8.<ref>Mahon (1945) p. 24 </ref><ref name=Welchman84p120>[[Gordon Welchman|Welchman]] (1984) p. 120</ref> 

Foremost amongst the knowledge needed for identifying cribs was the text of previous decrypts. Bletchley Park maintained detailed indexes<ref> {{ Citation | title = Bletchley Park Archives: Government Code & Cypher School Card Indexes | url = http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/edu/archives/gccscoll.rhtm | accessdate = 8 July 2010 }} </ref> of message preambles, of every person, of every ship, of every unit, of every weapon, of every technical term and of repeated phrases such as forms of address and other German military jargon.<ref>Budiansky (2000) p. 301 </ref> For each message the [[traffic analysis]] recorded the radio frequency, the date and time of intercept, and the preamble—which contained the network-identifying discriminant, the time of origin of the message, the callsign of the originating and receiving stations, and the indicator setting. This allowed cross referencing of a new message with a previous one.<ref>[[Gordon Welchman|Welchman]] (1984) p. 56</ref> Thus, as [[Derek Taunt]], another Cambridge mathematician-cryptanalyst wrote, the truism that "nothing succeeds like success" is particularly apposite here.<ref>[[Derek Taunt|Taunt]] (1993) p. 108</ref>

Stereotypical messages included ''Keine besonderen Ereignisse'' (literally, "no special occurrences"—perhaps better translated as "nothing to report"),<ref>[[Stuart Milner-Barry|Milner-Barry]] (1993) p. 93</ref> ''An die Gruppe'' ("to the group") <ref>[[Michael Smith (newspaper reporter)|Smith]] (2007) p. 38</ref> and a number that came from weather stations such as ''weub null seqs null null'' ("weather survey 0600"). This was actually rendered as ''WEUBYYNULLSEQSNULLNULL''. The word ''WEUB'' being short for ''wetteruebersicht'', ''YY'' was used as a separator and ''SEQS'' was common abbreviation of ''sechs'' ("six").<ref>[[Derek Taunt|Taunt]] (1993) pp. 104, 105</ref> Field Marshall [[Erwin Rommel|Erwin Rommel's]] Quartermaster started all of his messages to his commander with the same formal introduction.<ref>Lewin (2001) p. 118</ref>

With a combination of probable plaintext fragment and the fact that no letter could be enciphered as itself, a corresponding ciphertext fragment could often be tested by trying every possible alignment of the crib against the ciphertext, a procedure known as ''crib-dragging''. This allowed the elimination of possible crib positions. Comparing the crib ''Keine besonderen Ereignisse'' with a section of ciphertext might produce the following, where the red cells represent ''crashes'', the co-occurrence of the same letter in the crib and the ciphertext:

''Crib-dragging'' was only one aspect of the processes of breaking a key. Derek Taunt has written that the three cardinal personal qualities that were in demand for cryptanalysis were (1) a creative imagination, (2) a well-developed critical faculty, and (3) a habit of meticulousness.<ref>[[Derek Taunt|Taunt]] (1993) p. 111</ref> Skill at solving crossword puzzles was famously tested in recruiting some cryptanalysts. This was useful in working out plugboard settings when a possible solution was being examined. For example, if the crib was the word ''WETTER'' (German for "weather") and a possible decrypt before the plugboard settings had been discovered, was ''TEWWER'', it is easy to see that ''T'' with ''W'' are ''stecker partners''.<ref>[[Simon Singh|Singh]] (1999) p. 174</ref> These examples, although illustrative of the principles, greatly over-simplify the cryptanalysts' tasks.

A fruitful source of cribs was re-encipherments of messages that had previously been decrypted either from a lower-level manual cipher or from another Enigma network.<ref>Mahon (1945) p. 44</ref> This was called a ''[[Kiss (cryptanalysis)|kiss]]'' and happened particularly with German naval messages being sent in the ''dockyard cipher'' and repeated ''verbatim'' in an Enigma cipher. One German agent in Britain, code named ''Treasure'', who had been ''[[Double Cross System|turned]]'' to work for the Allies, was very verbose in her messages back to Germany, which were then re-transmitted on the ''Abwehr'' Enigma network. She was kept going by [[MI5]] because of providing long cribs in this way, not because of her usefulness as an agent to feed incorrect information to the ''Abwehr''.<ref name="Michael Smith 2007 p. 129">[[Michael Smith (newspaper reporter)|Smith]] (2007) p. 129</ref>

Occasionally, when there was a particularly urgent need to break the German naval code, such as when an [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoy]] was about to depart, mines would be laid by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in a defined position, whose grid reference in the German naval system did not contain any of the words (such as ''sechs'' or ''sieben'') for which abbreviations or alternatives were sometimes used.<ref>Mahon (1945) p. 41</ref>  The warning message about the mines and then the "all clear" message, would be transmitted both using the ''dockyard cipher'' and the U-boat Enigma network. This process of ''planting'' a crib was called ''[[Gardening (cryptanalysis)|gardening]]''.<ref>Morris (1993) p. 235</ref>

Although ''cillies'' were not actually cribs, the ''chit-chat'' [[Cleartext|in clear]] that Enigma operators indulged in amongst themselves, often gave a clue as to the cillies that they might generate.<ref>[[Michael Smith (newspaper reporter)|Smith]] (2007) p. 102</ref> 

When a captured, interrogated German Enigma operator revealed that they had been instructed to encipher numbers by spelling them out rather than using the top row of the keyboard, [[Alan Turing]] reviewed decrypted messages and determined that the word ''eins'' ("one") appeared in 90% of messages. He automated the crib process, creating the ''Eins Catalogue'', which assumed that ''eins'' was encoded at all positions in the plaintext. The catalogue included every possible rotor position for ''EINS'' with that day's ''wheel order'' and plugboard connections.

===British ''bombe''===
{{main|Bombe}}
The British bombe was an electromechanical device designed by [[Alan Turing]] soon after he arrived at [[Bletchley Park]] in September 1939. [[Harold Keen|Harold "Doc" Keen]] of the [[British Tabulating Machine Company]] (BTM) in [[Letchworth]] ({{km to mi|35}} from Bletchley) was the engineer who turned Turing's ideas into a working machine—under the codename CANTAB.<ref>{{ Citation | contribution = BTM - British Tabulatuing Machine Company Ltd  | contribution-url = http://www.jharper.demon.co.uk/btm1.htm | editor-last = Harper | editor-first = John | title = The British Bombe CANTAB | url = http://www.jharper.demon.co.uk/bombe1.htm }}</ref> Turing's specification developed the ideas of the Poles' [[Bomba (cryptography)|''bomba kryptologiczna'']] but was designed for the much more general [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Crib-based decryption|crib-based decryption]].  

The bombe helped to identify the ''wheel order'', the initial positions of the rotor cores, and the ''stecker partner'' of a specified letter. This was achieved by examining all 17,576 possible scrambler positions for a set of ''wheel orders'' on a comparison between a crib and the ciphertext, so as to eliminate possibilities that [[Contradiction|contradicted]] the Enigma's known characteristics. In the words of [[Gordon Welchman]] "the task of the bombe was simply to reduce the assumptions of ''wheel order'' and scrambler positions that required 'further analysis' to a manageable number."<ref name=Welchman84p120/>

[[Image:TuringBombeBletchleyPark.jpg|thumbnail|right|300px|Replica of a British [[bombe]] at [[Bletchley Park]]]]

The demountable drums on the front of the bombe were wired identically to the connections made by Enigma's different rotors. Unlike them, however, the input and output contacts for the left-hand and the right-hand sides were separate, making 104 contacts between each drum and the rest of the machine.<ref>{{ Citation | last = Sale | first = Tony  | author-link = Anthony Sale | contribution = Alan Turing, the Enigma and the Bombe | contribution-url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/virtualbp/tbombe/tbombe.htm | editor-last = Sale | editor-first = Tony  | editor-link = Anthony Sale | title = The Enigma cipher machine | url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/enigma/ }}</ref> This allowed a set of scramblers to be connected [[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|in series]] by means of 26-way cables. Electrical connections between the rotating drums' wiring and the rear plugboard were by means of metal brushes. When the bombe detected a scrambler position with no contradictions, it stopped and the operator would note the position before re-starting it.

Although Welchman had been given the task of studying Enigma traffic [[Call sign|callsigns]] and discriminants, he knew from Turing about the bombe design and early in 1940, before the first pre-production bombe was delivered, he showed him an idea to increase its effectiveness.<ref>[[Andrew Hodges|Hodges]] (1983) p. 183</ref> It exploited the reciprocity in plugboard connections, to reduce considerably the number of scrambler settings that needed to be considered further. This became known as the ''diagonal board'' and was subsequently incorporated to great effect in all the bombes.<ref>[[Gordon Welchman|Welchman]] (1984) pp. 295-309</ref><ref>{{ Citation | last = Ellsbury  | first = Graham  | year = 1998 | contribution = The Turing Bombe: What it was and how it worked | contribution-url = http://www.ellsbury.com/bombe3.htm | editor-last = Ellsbury  | editor-first = Graham | title = The Enigma and the Bombe | url = http://www.ellsbury.com/enigmabombe.htm }}</ref>

A cryptanalyst would prepare a crib for comparison with the ciphertext. This was a complicated and sophisticated task, which later took the Americans some time to master. As well as the crib, a decision as to which of the many possible ''wheel orders'' could be omitted had to be made. Turing's [[Banburismus]] was used in making this major economy. The cryptanalyst would then compile a [[Bombe#Bombe menu|''menu'']] which specified the connections of the cables of the patch panels on the back of the machine, and a particular letter whose ''stecker partner'' was sought. The menu reflected the relationships between the letters of the crib and those of the ciphertext. Some of these formed loops (or ''closures'' as Turing called them) in a similar way to the ''cycles'' that the Poles had exploited. 

The reciprocal nature of the plugboard meant that no letter could be connected to more than one other letter. When there was a contradiction of two different letters apparently being ''stecker partners'' with the letter in the menu, the bombe would detect this, and move on. If, however, this happened with a letter that was not part of the menu, a false stop could occur. In refining down the set of stops for further examination, the cryptanalyst would eliminate stops that contained such a contradiction. The other plugboard connections and the settings of the alphabet rings would then be worked out before the scrambler positions at the possible true stops were tried out on [[Typex]] machines that had been adapted to mimic Enigmas. All the remaining stops would correctly decrypt the crib, but only the true stop would produce the correct plaintext of the whole message.<ref name=CarterStopsKeys/>

To avoid wasting scarce bombe time on menus that were likely to yield an excessive number of false stops, Turing performed a lengthy probability analysis (without any electronic aids) of the estimated number of stops per rotor order. It was adopted as standard practice only to use menus that were estimated to produce no more than four stops per ''wheel order''. This allowed an 8-letter crib for a 3-closure menu, an 11-letter crib for a 2-closure menu and a 14-letter crib for a menu with only one closure. If there was no closure, at least 16 letters were required in the crib.<ref name=CarterStopsKeys>{{ citation | last = Carter | first = Frank | title = From Bombe 'stops' to Enigma keys | url = http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/bombestops.pdf | accessdate = 1 March 2009 }}</ref> The longer the crib, however, the more likely it was that ''turn-over'' of the middle rotor would have occurred.

The production model 3-rotor bombes contained 36 scramblers arranged in three banks of twelve. Each bank was used for a different ''wheel order'' by fitting it with the drums that corresponded to the Enigma rotors being tested. The first bombe was named ''Victory'' and was delivered to Bletchley Park on 18 March 1940. The next one, which included the diagonal board, was delivered on 8 August 1940. It was referred to as a ''spider bombe'' and was named ''Agnus Dei'' which soon became ''Agnes'' and then ''Aggie''.  The production of British bombes was relatively slow at first, with only five bombes being in use in June 1941, 15 by the year end,<ref>[[Jack Copeland|Copeland]] (2004) pp. 253-256</ref> 30 by September 1942, 49 by January 1943<ref>Budiansky (2000) p. 230</ref> but eventually 210 at the end of the war. 

A refinement that was developed for use on messages from those networks that disallowed plugboard (''Stecker'') connection of adjacent letters, was the ''Consecutive Stecker Knock Out''. This was fitted to 40 Bombes and produced a useful reduction in false stops.<ref>{{ Citation | last = Harper | first = John | publication-date = Spring 2009 | periodical = Resurrection: the bulletin of the Computer Conservation Society | publisher = British Computer Society | issue = 46 | pages = 7–8 | title = Bombe Rebuild Project | url = http://www.computerconservationsociety.org/resurrection.htm | accessdate = 22 May 2009 }}</ref>

Initially the bombes were operated by ex-BTM servicemen, but in March 1941 the first detachment of members of the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]] (known as ''Wrens'') arrived at Bletchley Park to become bombe operators. By 1945 there were some 2,000 Wrens operating the bombes.<ref>[[Michael Smith (newspaper reporter)|Smith]] (2007) p. 75 </ref> Because of the risk of bombing, relatively few of bombes were located at Bletchley Park. The largest two outstations were at Eastcote (some 110 bombes and 800 Wrens) and Stanmore (some 50 bombes and 500 Wrens). There were also bombe outstations at Wavendon, Adstock and Gayhurst. Communication with Bletchley Park was by teleprinter (teletype) links.

When the German Navy started using 4-rotor Enigmas, about sixty 4-rotor bombes were produced at Letchworth, some with the assistance of the [[General Post Office]].<ref>{{ Citation | contribution = Bombe Types | contribution-url = http://www.jharper.demon.co.uk/types1.htm | editor-last = Harper | editor-first = John | title = The British Bombe CANTAB | url = http://www.jharper.demon.co.uk/bombe1.htm }}</ref> The [[NCR Corporation|NCR]]-manufactured [[Bombe#US Navy Bombe|US Navy 4-rotor bombes]] were, however, very fast and much the most successful.

===''Luftwaffe'' Enigma===
Although the German army, [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], police, and railway all used Enigma with similar procedures, it was the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (Air Force) that was the first and most fruitful source of [[Ultra]] intelligence during the war. The messages were decoded in [[Hut 6]] at Bletchley Park and turned into intelligence reports in Hut 3.<ref>Calvocoressi (2001) p. 74</ref> The network code-named ‘Red’ at Bletchley Park was broken regularly and quickly from 22 May 1940 until the end of hostilities. Indeed, the Air Force section of Hut 3 expected the new day’s Enigma settings to have been established in Hut 6 by breakfast time. The relative ease of breaking this network’s settings was a product of plentiful cribs and frequent German [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Operating shortcomings|operating mistakes]].<ref>Calvocoressi (2001) p. 87</ref> 

===''Abwehr'' Enigma===
[[Image:Enigma-G.jpg|thumb|Enigma Model G, used by the ''[[Abwehr]]''. It had three ordinary rotors and a rotating reflector, multiple notches on the rotor rings, but no plugboard.]]

[[Dilly Knox|Dilly Knox's]] last great cryptanalytical success before his untimely death in February 1943, was the breaking, in 1941, of the ''[[Abwehr]]'' Enigma. Intercepts of traffic which had an 8-letter [[Enigma machine#Indicator|indicator]] sequence before the usual 5-letter groups, led to the suspicion that a 4-rotor machine was being used.<ref>[[Peter Twinn|Twinn]] (1993) p. 127</ref> The assumption was correctly made that the indicator consisted of a 4-letter message key enciphered twice. In fact the machine was a [[Enigma machine#Military Enigma|Model G Enigma]], which had no plugboard, three conventional rotors, and a rotating reflector that could both be set by hand and was advanced by the [[Enigma machine#Stepping motion|stepping mechanism]]. Collecting a set of enciphered message keys for a particular day allowed ''cycles'' (or ''boxes'' as Knox called them) to be assembled in a similar way to the method used by the  Poles in the 1930s.<ref name=FCarterAbwehr/> 

Knox was able to derive, using his ''buttoning up'' procedure,<ref name=CarterButtoningUp /> some of the wiring of the rotor that had been loaded in the fast position on that day. Progressively he was able to derive the wiring of all three rotors. Once that had been done, he was able to work out the wiring of the reflector.<ref name=FCarterAbwehr>{{ Citation | last = Carter | first = Frank | title = The Abwehr Enigma Machine | url = http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/resources/file.rhtm/261894/web+abwehr2.pdf }}</ref> Deriving the indicator setting for that day was achieved using Knox's time-consuming ''rodding'' procedure.<ref name=CarterRodding /> This involved a great deal of trial and error, imagination and crossword puzzle-solving skills, but was helped by ''cillies''.

The ''Abwehr'' was the [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] and [[espionage|counter-espionage]] service of the German High Command. The spies that it placed in enemy countries used a lower level cipher (which was broken by [[Oliver Strachey|Oliver Strachey's]] section at [[Bletchley Park]]) for their transmissions. However, the messages were often then re-transmitted word-for-word on the ''Abwehr's'' internal Enigma networks, which gave the best possible [[Known-plaintext attack|crib]] for deciphering that day's indicator setting. Interception and analysis of ''Abwehr'' transmissions led to the remarkable state of affairs that allowed [[MI5]] to give a categorical assurance that all the German spies in Britain were controlled as [[double agents]] working for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] under the [[Double Cross System]].<ref name="Michael Smith 2007 p. 129"/>

===German Army Enigma===
In the summer of 1940 following the [[Second Armistice at Compiègne|Franco-German armistice]], most Army Enigma traffic was travelling by land lines rather than radio and so was not available to Bletchley Park. The air [[Battle of Britain]] was crucial, so it was not surprising that the concentration of scarce resources was on ''Luftwaffe'' and ''Abwehr'' traffic. It was not until early in 1941 that the first breaks were made into German Army Enigma traffic, and it was the spring of 1942 before it was broken reliably, albeit often with some delay.<ref>Colvocoressi (2001) p. 99</ref> It is unclear whether the German Army Enigma operators made deciphering more difficult by making fewer [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Operating shortcomings|operating mistakes]].<ref> Sullivan and Frode (2005) p. 215 </ref>

===German naval Enigma===
The German Navy used Enigma in the same way as the German Army and Air Force until 1 May 1937 when they changed to a substantially different system. This used the same sort of setting sheet but, importantly, it included the ground key for a period of two, sometimes three days. The message setting was concealed in the indicator by selecting a trigram from a book (the ''Kenngruppenbuch'', or K-Book) and performing a bigram substitution on it.<ref>{{ Citation | last = Supreme Command of the Navy | title =  The Enigma General Procedure (Der Schluessel M Verfahren M Allgemein) | work = The Bletchley Park translated Enigma Instruction Manual, transcribed and formatted by [[Anthony Sale|Tony Sale]] | place = Berlin | publisher = Supreme Command of the German Navy | year = 1940 | url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/documents/egenproc/egenproc.pdf | accessdate = 26 November 2009 }}</ref> This defeated the Poles, although they suspected some sort of bigram substitution.

The procedure for the naval sending operator was as follows. First they selected a trigram from the K-Book, say YLA. They then looked in the appropriate columns of the K-Book and selected another trigram, say YVT, and wrote it in the boxes at the top of the message form: 
{| class="wikitable" | border="1" | style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto" 
|- 
| align="center" | . ||align="center" |  Y ||align="center" |  V || align="center" | T 
|-
| align="center" | Y || align="center" | L || align="center" | A || align="center" | .
|} 
They then filled in the "dots" with any letters, giving say:
{| class="wikitable" | border="1" | style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto" 
|- 
| align="center" | Q ||align="center" |  Y ||align="center" |  V || align="center" | T 
|-
| align="center" | Y || align="center" | L || align="center" | A || align="center" | G
|}
Finally they looked up the vertical pairs of letters in the Bigram Tables
{{center|QY→UB YL→LK VA→RS TG→PW}}
and wrote down the resultant pairs, UB, LK, RS and PW which were transmitted as two four letter groups at the start and end of the enciphered message. The receiving operator performed the converse procedure to obtain the message key for setting his Enigma rotors.

As well as these ''Kriegsmarine'' procedures being much more secure than those of the German Army and Air Force, the German Navy Enigma introduced three more rotors (VI, VII and VIII), early in 1940.<ref>Copeland (2004) p. 225</ref> The choice of three rotors from eight meant that there were a total of 336 possible permutations of rotors and their positions. 

[[Alan Turing]] decided to take responsibility for German naval Enigma because "no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself".<ref>Alexander (''c''. 1945) Ch. II Para. 11</ref> He established [[Hut 8]] with [[Peter Twinn]] and two "girls".<ref>Copeland (2004) p. 258</ref> Turing used the indicators and message settings for traffic from 1–8 May 1937 that the Poles had worked out, and some very elegant deductions to diagnose the complete indicator system. After the messages were deciphered they were translated for transmission to the Admiralty in Hut 4.

====German Navy 3-rotor Enigma====
The first break of wartime traffic was in December 1939, into signals that had been intercepted in November 1938, when only three rotors and six plugboard leads had been in use.<ref name = MahonP22>Mahon (1945) p. 22</ref> It used "Forty Weepy Weepy" cribs. 

A captured German ''Funkmaat''<ref>German for radio operator</ref> Meyer had revealed that numerals were now spelt out as words. EINS, the German for "one", was present in about 90% of  genuine German Navy messages. An EINS catalogue was compiled consisting of the encipherment of EINS at all 105,456 rotor settings.<ref>Alexander (''c''. 1946) Ch. II Para. 21</ref> These were compared with the ciphertext, and when matches were found, about a quarter of them yielded the correct plaintext. Later this process was automated in Mr Freeborn's section using [[Unit record equipment|Hollerith equipment]]. When the ground key was known, this EINS-ing procedure could yield three bigrams for the tables that were then gradually assembled.<ref name = MahonP22 />

Further progress required more information from German Enigma users. This was achieved through a succession of ''pinches'', the capture of Enigma parts and codebooks. The first of these was on 12 February 1940, when rotors VI and VII, whose wiring was at that time unknown, were captured from the ''[[German submarine U-33 (1936)|U-33]]'', by HMS Gleaner.

On 26 April 1940 the Narvik-bound German patrol boat VP2623, disguised as a Dutch trawler named ''Polares'', was captured by HMS Griffin. This yielded an instruction manual, codebook sheets and a record of some transmissions, which provided complete ''cribs''. This confirmed that Turing's deductions about the trigram/bigram process was correct and allowed a total of six days' messages to be broken, the last of these using the first of the bombes.<ref name = MahonP22 /> However, the numerous possible rotor sequences, together with a paucity of usable cribs, made the methods used against the Army and Air Force Enigma messages of very limited value.

Turing had devised a development of the [[Clock (cryptography)|clock method]] invented by the Polish cryptanalyst [[Jerzy Różycki]] at the end of 1939. This came to be known as "[[Banburismus]]". Turing said that at that stage "I was not sure that it would work in practice, and was not in fact sure until some days had actually broken".<ref>Mahon (1945) p. 14</ref> Banburismus used a statistical scoring system and large cards printed in Banbury (hence its name), to reduce the number of rotor sequences to be tried on the bombes. In practice the 336 possible rotors and sequences could be reduced to perhaps 18 to be run on the bombes.<ref>Alexander (''c''. 1945) "Background" Para. 42</ref> Knowledge of the bigrams was essential for Banburismus and building up the tables took a long time. This lack of visible progress led to [[Francis Birch (cryptographer)|Frank Birch]], head of the Naval Section to write on 21 August 1940 to [[Edward Travis]] Deputy Director of Bletchley Park: {{quote|"I'm worried about Naval Enigma. I've been worried for a long time, but haven't liked to say as much.... Turing and Twinn are like people waiting for a miracle, without believing in miracles....."<ref>Mahon (1945) p. 2</ref>}}

Schemes for capturing Enigma material were conceived including, in September 1940, [[Operation Ruthless]] by Lieutenant Commander [[Ian Fleming]] (author of the [[James Bond]] novels).

A major advance came through [[Operation Claymore]], a [[British Commandos|commando]] raid on the [[Lofoten Islands]] on 4 March 1941. The German [[Naval trawler|armed trawler]] ''Krebs'' was captured, including the complete Enigma keys for February, but no bigram tables or K-book. However, the material was sufficient to reconstruct the bigram tables by "EINS-ing", and by late March they were almost complete.<ref>Mahon (1945) p. 26</ref>

Banburismus then started to become extremely useful. Hut 8 was expanded and moved to 24-hour working, and a crib room was established. The story of Banburismus for the next two years was one of improving methods, of struggling to get sufficient staff, and of a steady growth in the relative and absolute importance of cribbing as the increasing numbers of bombes made the running of cribs ever faster.<ref>Alexander (''c''. 1946) Ch. III Para. 5</ref> Of value in this period were further "pinches" such as those from the [[German weather ship Lauenburg#The weather ships and Enigma|German weather ships]] ''München'' and ''Lauenburg'' and the submarines ''[[German submarine U-110 (1940)|U-110]]'' and ''[[German submarine U-559#The sinking of U-559|U-559]]''. 

Despite the introduction of the 4-rotor Enigma for Atlantic U-boats, the analysis of traffic enciphered with the 3-rotor Enigma proved of immense value to the Allied navies. Banburismus was used until July 1943, when it became more efficient to use the many more bombes that had become available.

====German Navy 4-rotor Enigma====
[[Image:Bletchley Park Naval Enigma IMG 3604.JPG|thumb|The German Navy 4-rotor [[Enigma machine]] (M4) which was introduced for U-boat traffic on 1 February 1942.]]
On 1 February 1942, the Enigma messages to and from Atlantic U-boats which Bletchley Park called ''Shark'' became significantly different from the rest of the traffic which they called ''Dolphin''.<ref>Alexander (''c''. 1945) Ch. III Para. 20</ref>

This was because a new Enigma version had been brought into use. It was a development of the 3-rotor Enigma with the reflector replaced by a thin rotor and a thin reflector. Eventually, there were two fourth-position rotors that were called Beta and Gamma and two thin reflectors, Bruno and Caesar which could be used in any combination. These rotors were not advanced by the rotor to their right, in the way that rotors I to VIII were.

The introduction of the fourth rotor did not catch Bletchley Park by surprise, because captured material dated January 1941 had made reference to its development as an adaptation of the 3-rotor machine, with the fourth rotor wheel to be a reflector wheel.<ref>Mahon (1945) p. 62</ref> Indeed, because of operator errors, the wiring of the new fourth rotor had already been worked out. 

This major challenge could not be met by using existing methods and resources for a number of reasons.
# The work on the Shark cipher would have to be independent of the continuing work on messages in the Dolphin cipher.
# Breaking Shark on 3-rotor bombes would have taken 50 to 100 times as long as an average Air Force or Army job.
# U-boat cribs at this time were extremely poor.<ref>Alexander (''c''. 1946) Ch. III Para. 21</ref>

It seemed, therefore, that effective, fast, 4-rotor bombes were the only way forward. This was an immense problem and it gave a great deal of trouble. Work on a high speed machine had been started by [[Charles Wynn-Williams|Wynne-Williams]] of the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment|TRE]] late in 1941 and some nine months later [[Harold Keen]] of [[British Tabulating Machine Company|BTM]] started work independently. Early in 1942, Bletchley Park were a long way from possessing a high speed machine of any sort.<ref>Mahon (1945) p. 63</ref>

Eventually, after a long period of being unable to decipher U-boat messages, a source of cribs was found. This was the ''Kurzsignalen'' (Short Signal Code) which was used in minimize the duration of transmissions, to reduce the risk of them being located by [[direction finding]] techniques. The messages were only 22 characters long and were used to report sightings of possible Allied targets.<ref>{{ Citation | last = Sale | first = Tony | author-link = Anthony Sale | title = The Breaking of German Naval Enigma: U Boat Contact Signals | series = Codes and Ciphers in the Second World War: The history, science and engineering of cryptanalysis in World War II | url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/virtualbp/navenigma/navenig10.htm | accessdate = 1 December 2008 }}</ref> A copy of the code book had been captured from [[German submarine U-110 (1940)|U-110]] on 9 May 1941. A similar coding system was used for weather reports from U-boats, the ''Wetterkurzschluessel'', (Weather Short Code Book). A copy of this had been captured from [[German submarine U-559|U-559]] on 29 or 30 October 1942.<ref>Budiansky (2000) pp. 341-343</ref> These short signals had been used for deciphering 3-rotor Enigma messages and it was discovered that the new rotor had a neutral position at which it, and its matching reflector, behaved just like a 3-rotor Enigma reflector. This allowed messages enciphered at this neutral position to be deciphered by a 3-rotor machine, and hence deciphered by a standard bombe. Deciphered Short Signals provided good material for bombe menus for Shark.<ref>Mahon (1945) p. 64</ref>

===American ''bombes''===
{{Further|[[Bombe#|US Navy Bombe]] and [[Bombe#|US Army Bombe]]}}
Unlike the situation at Bletchley Park, the United States armed services did not share a combined cryptanalytical service. Before the US joined the war, there was collaboration with Britain, albeit with a considerable amount of caution on Britain's side because of the extreme importance of Germany and her allies not learning that its codes were being broken. Despite some worthwhile collaboration amongst the cryptanalysts, their superiors took some time to achieve a trusting relationship in which both British and American bombes were used to mutual benefit.

In February 1941, Captain Abe Sinkov and Lieutenant Leo Rosen of the US Army, and US naval Lieutenants Robert Weeks and Prescott Currier, arrived at Bletchley Park bringing, amongst other things, a replica of the [[Purple (cipher machine)|'Purple' cipher machine]] for the Bletchley Park's Japanese section in [[Hut 7]].<ref>Budiansky (2000) p. 176</ref> The four returned to America after ten weeks, with a naval radio [[direction finding]] unit and many documents<ref>Budiansky (2000) p. 179</ref> including a "paper Enigma".<ref>Jacobsen (2000)</ref> 

The main American response to the 4-rotor Enigma was the US Navy bombe, which was manufactured in much less constrained facilities than were available in wartime Britain. Colonel [[John Tiltman]], who later became Deputy Director at Bletchley Park, visited the US Navy cryptanalysis office ([[OP-20-G]]) in April 1942 and recognised America's vital interest in deciphering U-boat traffic. The urgent need, doubts about the British engineering workload and slow progress, prompted the US to start investigating designs for a Navy bombe, based on the full [[Blueprint|blueprints]] and wiring diagrams received by US naval Lieutenants Robert Ely and Joseph Eachus at Bletchley Park in July 1942.<ref>Budiansky (2000) p. 238</ref><ref>Wilcox (2001) p. 21</ref> Funding for a full, $2 million, Navy development effort was requested on 3 September 1942 and approved the following day. 

[[Image:US-bombe.jpg|thumb|US Navy bombe. It contained 16 four-rotor Enigma-equivalents and was much faster than the British bombe.]]
Commander [[Edward Travis]], Deputy Director and [[Francis Birch (cryptographer)|Frank Birch]], Head of the German Naval Section travelled from Bletchley Park to Washington in September 1942. With [[Carl Frederick Holden]], US Director of Naval Communications they established, on 2 October 1942, a UK:US accord which may have "a stronger claim than [[1943 BRUSA Agreement|BRUSA]] to being the forerunner of the [[UK–USA Security Agreement|UKUSA Agreement]]," being the first agreement "to establish the special [[Signals intelligence|Sigint]] relationship between the two countries," and "it set the pattern for UKUSA, in that the United States was very much the senior partner in the alliance."<ref>{{Citation | last = Erskine | first = Ralph | title = The Holden Agreement on Naval Sigint: The First BRUSA? | journal = Intelligence and National Security | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–197 | year = 1999 | month = Summer | url = http://intellit.muskingum.edu/alpha_folder/E_folder/erskine_a-o.html }}</ref> It established a relationship of "full collaboration" between Bletchley Park and OP-20-G.<ref>Budiansky (2000) p. 239</ref>  

An all electronic solution to the problem of a fast bombe was considered,<ref>Budiansky (2000) p. 241</ref>  but rejected for pragmatic reasons, and a contract was let with the [[NCR Corporation|National Cash Register Corporation]] (NCR) in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. This established the [[United States Naval Computing Machine Laboratory]]. Engineering development was led by NCR's [[Joseph Desch]]. 

[[Alan Turing]], who had written a memorandum to OP-20-G (probably in 1941),<ref>Turing (''c.''1941) pp. 341–352</ref> was seconded to the British Joint Staff Mission in Washington in December 1942, because of his exceptionally wide knowledge about the bombes and the methods of their use. He was asked to look at the bombes that were being built by NCR and at the security of certain speech cipher equipment under development at Bell Labs.<ref>{{Citation | title = Bletchley Park Text: November 1942: Departure of Alan Turing from BP | url = http://cipherweb.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cipher-demo/mobile/sms_categories_xml.py? | accessdate = 16 April 2010 }}</ref> He visited OP-20-G, and went to NCR in Dayton on the 21 December. He was able to show that it was not necessary to build 336 Bombes, one for each possible rotor order, by utilising techniques such as [[Banburismus]].<ref>Budiansky (2000) p. 242</ref> The initial order was scaled down to 96 machines. 

The US Navy bombes used drums for the Enigma rotors in much the same way as the British bombes, but were very much faster. The first machine was completed and tested on 3 May 1943. Soon, these bombes were more available than the British bombes at Bletchley Park and its outstations, and as a consequence they were put to use for Hut 6 as well as Hut 8 work.<ref Name=WelchmanP135 >Welchman (1984) p. 135</ref> A total of 121 Navy bombes were produced.<ref name=WengerWilcoxP52 /> In Alexander's "Cryptographic History of Work on German Naval Enigma", he wrote as follows.
{{blockquote|When the Americans began to turn out bombes in large numbers there was a constant interchange of signal - cribs, keys, message texts, cryptographic chat and so on. This all went by cable being first encyphered on the combined Anglo-American cypher machine, [[Combined Cipher Machine|C.C.M.]] Most of the cribs being of operational urgency rapid and efficient communication was essential and a high standard was reached on this; an emergency priority signal consisting of a long crib with crib and message text repeated as a safeguard against corruption would take under an hour from the time we began to write the signal out in Hut 8 to the completion of its decyphering in Op. 20 G. As a result of this we were able to use the Op. 20 G bombes almost as conveniently as if they had been at one of our outstations 20 or 30 miles away.<ref>Alexander (''c.'' 1945) Ch. VIII para. 11</ref> }}

The US Army also produced a bombe. It was physically very different from the British and US Navy bombes. A contract was signed with [[Bell Labs]] on 30 September 1942.<ref>Sebag-Montefiore (2004) p. 254</ref> The machine was designed to analyse 3-rotor, not 4-rotor traffic. It did not use drums to represent the Enigma rotors, using instead telephone-type relays. It could, however, handle one problem that the bombes with drums could not.<ref Name=WelchmanP135/><ref name=WengerWilcoxP52 /> The set of ten bombes consisted of a total of 144 Enigma-equivalents, each mounted on a rack approximately {{convert|7|ft|m}}  long {{convert|8|ft|m}} high and {{convert|6|in|mm}} wide. There were 12 control stations which could allocate any of the Enigma-equivalents into the desired configuration by means of plugboards. Rotor order changes did not require the mechanical process of changing drums, but was achieved in about half a minute by means of push buttons.<ref Name=WengerWilcoxP51 >Wenger (1945) p. 51</ref> A 3-rotor run took about 10 minutes.<ref Name=WengerWilcoxP52 >Wenger (1945) p. 52</ref>

===German suspicions===
By 1945, almost all German Enigma traffic ([[Wehrmacht]], [[Kriegsmarine]], [[Luftwaffe]], [[Abwehr]], [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]], etc.) could be decrypted within a day or two, yet the Germans remained confident of its security.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}  They openly discussed their plans and movements, handing the Allies huge amounts of information, not all of which was used effectively. For example, Rommel's actions at the [[Kasserine Pass]] were clearly foreshadowed in decrypted Enigma traffic, but the information was not properly appreciated by the Americans.  Some information was also not acted upon on purpose, so as not to betray that the code was broken.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}    

After the war, American [[TICOM]] project teams found and detained a considerable number of German cryptographic personnel. Among the things the Americans learned was that German cryptographers, at least, understood very well that Enigma messages might be read; they knew Enigma was not unbreakable. They just found it impossible to imagine anyone going to the immense effort required.<ref>{{Citation | last = Bamford | first = James | author-link = James Bamford | year = 2001 | title = Body Of Secrets: How America's NSA & Britain's GCHQ Eavesdrop on the World  | publisher = Century | page = 17 | isbn = 978-0712675987 }}</ref> When [[Abwehr]] personnel who had worked on [[Fish (cryptography)|Fish cryptography]] and Russian traffic were interned at Rosenheim around May 1945, they were not at all surprised that Enigma had been broken, only that someone had mustered all the resources in time to actually do it.  Admiral [[Karl Dönitz|Dönitz]] had been advised that that was the least likely of all security problems.

==Since World War II==
Modern computers can be used to solve Enigma, using a variety of techniques.<ref> Sullivan and Frode (2005) </ref> There is even a project to [[decryption|decrypt]] some remaining messages,<ref>{{ Citation | title = M4 Message Breaking Project | url =  http://www.bytereef.org/m4_project.html | accessdate = 16 October 2008 }}</ref> using [[distributed computing]].
