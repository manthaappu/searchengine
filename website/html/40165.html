==Career==
===Early struggles===
In February 1996, Arnett began acting in television pilots. His first was a pilot with [[Kevin Pollak]] and his wife, Lucy Webb, for [[CBS]], that was not picked up.<ref name="twop4" /> The pilot, ''The Underworld'', revolved around "The head of an organized crime family [who] hounds an ex-con who only wants to go straight."<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0301971/ The Underworld (1997) (TV)], IMDb. Retrieved on April 12, 2007</ref> After the show was not picked up, he appeared in the movie ''[[Southie (film)|Southie]]'', which was written by Arnett's friend [[Dave McLaughlin]]. In 1999, Arnett was cast in another pilot for ''[[The Mike O'Malley Show]]'' on [[NBC]]. Arnett was a regular on the series, playing the protagonist's friend Jimmy. The show was picked up, but it was canceled after only two episodes.<ref name="twop4" /> Arnett has referred to 2000, the year after that show was cancelled, as "the darkest year of [his] life" and he admits that he "didn't get a lot of work" and "drank those years away".<ref name="twop4" /> 

Arnett considers the summer of 2000 to have been a turning point for him because a friend helped pull him out of his battle with alcoholism and he began to get his career back on track. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} 

In 2001, Arnett was cast in another [[television pilot]], ''[[Loomis (TV pilot)|Loomis]]'', for [[CBS]]. The pilot starred [[Cheri Oteri]] as a local news reporter, and Arnett played her slacker brother. The pilot was not picked up. In 2002, Arnett was cast in a fourth television pilot. This pilot was for the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[Still Standing (TV series)|Still Standing]]''. This time the show was picked up and ran for several seasons, but his character was cut from the series after the pilot.<ref name="variety" /> Arnett became so frustrated, after his fourth failed pilot, that he "swore off pilots"<ref name="variety" /> altogether, until his agent persuaded him to audition for the pilot for ''Arrested Development''.
