</ref> is a [[blind source separation]] [[algorithm]] which factorizes a [[multivariate]] [[time series]] into [[stationary]] and [[non-stationary]] components.

== Introduction ==

In many settings, the measured time series contains contributions from various underlying sources that cannot be measured directly. For instance, in [[EEG]] analysis, the electrodes on the scalp record the activity of a large number of sources located inside the brain<ref>Niedermeyer E, da Silva F L. Electroencephalography: Basic Principles, Clinical Applications, and Related Fields. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2004. ISBN 0781751268</ref>. These sources can be stationary or non-stationary, but they are not discernible in the electrode signals, which are a mixture of these sources. SSA allows the separation of the stationary from the non-stationary sources in an observed time series.

According to the SSA model<ref name="ssaprl"/>, the observed multivariate time series <math>x(t)</math> is assumed to be generated as a linear superposition of stationary sources <math>s^\mathfrak{s}(t)</math> and non-stationary sources <math>s^\mathfrak{n}(t)</math>, 
:<math>
  x(t) = A s(t) = \begin{bmatrix} A^\mathfrak{s} & A^\mathfrak{n} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} s^\mathfrak{s}(t) \\ s^\mathfrak{n}(t) \\ \end{bmatrix},
</math>
where <math>A</math> is an unknown but time-constant mixing matrix; <math>A^\mathfrak{s}</math>  and <math>A^\mathfrak{s}</math> are the basis of the stationary and non-stationary subspace respectively. 

Given samples from the time series <math>x(t)</math>, the aim of Stationary Subspace Analysis is to estimate the inverse mixing matrix <math>A^{-1}</math> separating the stationary from non-stationary sources in the mixture <math>x(t)</math>.

== Identifiability of the solution ==

The true stationary sources <math>s^\mathfrak{s}(t)</math> are identifiable (up to a linear transformation) and the true non-stationary subspace <math>A^\mathfrak{n}</math> is identifiable. The true non-stationary sources <math>s^\mathfrak{n}(t)</math> and the true stationary subspace <math>A^\mathfrak{s}</math> cannot be identified, because arbitrary contributions from the stationary sources do not change the non-stationary nature of a non-stationary source<ref name="ssaprl"/>

== Applications and Extensions ==

Stationary Subspace Analysis has been successfuly applied to [[Brain-Computer Interface|Brain Computer Interfacing]]<ref>von Bünau P, Meinecke F C, Scholler S, Müller K-R.

There are variants of the SSA problem that can be solved analytically in closed form, without numerical optimization<ref>Hara S, Kawahara Y, Washio T, von Bünau P.
