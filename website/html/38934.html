In [[economics]] and [[marketing]] a '''universe''' is a population to be studied or measured.

In economics a population to be measured is described as a "universe", and the measures which are generated are intended to reflect the behavior of that population. Different [[statistical survey]]s may measure related, but different, universes and have to be adjusted to reflect this difference. For example the American [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] has a [[household survey]] and an [[establishment survey]] to measure employment. The differences in the populations and behavior that these two surveys measure are said to be the differences in their "universe".

The word has a similar meaning in marketing, where it describes the activity in a given population. For example, [[ASCAP]] measures airplay in different radio "universes" to determine royalties for different songs, because e.g. air play in the "classical" universe is compensated differently from popular music. It also fundamental to [[television audience measurement]]: advertisers buy into programmes based on the ratings in different [[demographic]] universes and those different universes will cost different amounts. For example, a [[Hair coloring|hair dye]] [[ad campaign]] may buy 1000 [[Nielsen ratings|Gross Rating Points (GRP)]] in the Women 25-44 universe in order to target that particular audience, rather than a demographic irrelevant to their product.
