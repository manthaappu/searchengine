The '''Shusaku number''' represents the "distance" between a [[Go (board game)|Go]] player and [[Honinbo Shusaku]], measured in Go opponents.

A person's Shusaku number can be determined, as follows:
* Shusaku himself has the Shusaku number 0.
* Any other Go player has the number 1 + the smallest Shusaku number of the player's opponents (provided at least one opponent has a Shusaku number).  For example, if a player has played Shusaku himself, that player would have a Shusaku number of 1.
* For all other people, the Shusaku number is undefined.

To extend the analogy to [[Erdős number]]s even further, one can define '''Shusaku numbers of the second kind''' to only consider players who have defeated a lower-numbered opponent. That is, only those who have beaten Shusaku would have a Shusaku number of 1, and so forth.
