<html> <head> <title>Medical royal colleges</title></head><body>There are a number of '''medical royal colleges''' in the [[United Kingdom]].  Each is responsible for a different speciality within the medical field. They are general charged with supervising the training of doctors within that speciality, although that responsibility has been somewhat taken over by the  [[Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board]] in recent years.
