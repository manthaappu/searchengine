'''Video In Video Out''', usually seen as the [[acronym]] '''VIVO''' (commonly pronounced vee-voh), is a [[Computer port (hardware)|graphics port]] which enables some [[video card]]s to have [[bidirectional]] (input and output) [[analog video]] transfer through a [[mini-DIN connector]], usually of the 9-pin variety, and a specialised [[breakout cable|splitter cable]] (which can sometimes also transfer [[analog audio]]).

VIVO is found on high-end [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] and [[NVIDIA]] computer [[video card]]s, sometimes labeled "<small>TV OUT</small>".  VIVO on these graphics cards typically supports [[composite video|composite]], [[component video|component]], and [[S-Video]] as outputs, and composite and S-Video as inputs.  Many other video cards only support component and/or S-Video outputs to complement [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] or [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]], typically using a component [[breakout cable]] and an S-Video cable.  While component-out operation supports [[HDTV|high-definition]] resolutions, it does not support the [[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection|HDCP]] standard which would be required for official HDTV support as set out by the [[EICTA]].

Some practical uses of VIVO include being able to display multimedia stored on a computer on a TV, and being able to connect a [[DVD player]] or [[video game console]] to a computer while continuing to allow viewing via a TV monitor. VIVO itself, however, can not decode broadcast signals from any source, and so, like HDTV sets without [[ATSC tuner|tuners]] and [[composite monitor]]s, additional equipment is required to be able to show broadcast TV programs.

Some manufacturers enable their version of the VIVO port to also transfer sound.

== Limitations ==
The VIVO output on graphics cards is often not used by those who have no need to connect their computer to a TV. Also, there can be issues in software supporting the use of VIVO ports.

A computer using VIVO must have software that can handle an input signal. For example, in the case of [[Nvidia]] [[GeForce]] series 6 and 7 video card users this means [http://www.nvidia.com/object/wdm_geforce_4.13.html downloading Nvidia's WDM drivers]. 

Additionally, On [[Windows XP]] computers that use [[GeForce]] video cards with [[Scalable Link Interface]] (SLI) mode enabled, using a TV to display part of the desktop via VIVO is disabled, just as dual-monitor mode is disabled. Confusingly, however, some distorted images may be visible on a properly-connected VIVO-driven television display at boot-up.
