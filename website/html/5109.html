CMiC [http://www.cmic.ca] (Computer Methods international Corp.) is a software provider for the [[architectural]], [[engineering]] and [[construction]] industry.  Based in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], '''CMiC''' has been providing software solutions for over 36 years and has some of the largest general [[contractors]] in [[North America]] as clients, according to [[Engineering News-Record]] Magazine.<ref name="ENR's Top 400 Contractors List">[http://enr.construction.com/people/topLists/topContractor/topCont_1-50.asp ENR's Top 400 Contractors List]</ref>

== History ==

Computer Methods international Corp. was founded in [[1974]] to conduct software research and development, primarily for [[IBM]] computers.<ref>[http://www.ibm.com IBM]</ref> Since then CMiC has provided software solutions to primarily the project and financial management industries such as [[construction]] and [[engineering]].

In [[1978]] CMiC developed and offered software solutions specific to the construction industry on the [[IBM]] System 5100 series and later migrated to the System 23, 36 and 38 platforms. In the mid-1980s, CMiC developed construction specific software solutions on a PC-networked environment utilizing Business Basic software<ref>[http://www.thoroughbredsoftware.com/datasheet/pbasic.html Business Basic]</ref>.

Since early [[1988]], CMiC has applied resources and manpower in the research and development of their [[Oracle Corporation]] <ref>[http://www.oracle.com Oracle]</ref> based software for the construction and engineering industries. The Oracle based product was developed from the ground up utilizing techniques available in relational database model design and did not use any legacy code or file structures from any previous product ever developed. The technology deployed was and still is 100% native Oracle, utilizing the Oracle development environment for the application code and the Oracle RDBMS for the database. 

Beginning in [[1994]], CMiC embarked on a massive project to convert the entire product to client/server operating under a [[Windows]] [[GUI]] environment. In [[1995]], the software was renamed as mPOWER and became the first construction specific product to be released in a client/server configuration on a relational platform. In 1997, mPOWER Software was released on a 32-bit platform providing additional stability to the software. Remote access to mPOWER was delivered through a [[Citrix]] <ref>[http://www.citrix.com Citrix]</ref> or [[Terminal Server]]<ref>[[Terminal server|Terminal Server]]</ref> configuration. 

In the fall of [[2000]], CMiC released its totally Web-based version of mPOWER, which enabled any user to operate the software solely through an [[Internet browser]]. In [[2002]], CMiC released the CMiC Self Service that served as the gateway to the entire corporate activity across the organization. 

[[2003]] was the start of CMiC’s new vision.  CMiC was restructured for growth, all products were re-branded under the name CMiC, and a new look was presented to the industry.  In 2004, a stand alone [[Project Management]] Solution, called CMiC Project Management, was released along with a Collaboration application called CMiC Collaboration Manager. CMiC Integration, which contains CMiC Imaging and Workflow, was released soon after.

The CFMA IT Survey 2008 <ref>[http://www.cfma.org/pubs/its.asp CFMA IT Survey 2008]</ref> and a survey by [[McGraw-Hill]] Construction ranked CMiC in the top three spots for all five software categories, including financials, project management, collaboration, CRM and imaging/workflow. 

In 2008, CMiC expanded in the Heavy Highway market by having American Infrastructure, a vertically integrated, heavy civil construction company in the Mid-Atlantic Region.<ref>[http://www.americaninfrastructure.com/who_we_are/overview.aspx American Infrastructure]</ref>

Also in 2008, CMiC expanded into the Capital Project Owners <ref>[http://www.cmicprojectowners.com CMiC Project Owners]</ref> space, with BJC Healthcare,<ref>[http://www.bjc.org BJC HealthCare]</ref> one the largest nonprofit health care organizations in the United States, using CMiC software to build and maintain facilities.

CMiC also launched CMiC Emerging <ref>[http://www.softwareforgrowingcontractors.com CMiC Emerging]</ref> to target smaller contractors. This approach provides CMiC solutions as a [[Software As A Service]] (Saas).

In 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 CMiC was recognized by Constructech Magazine as one of the Hottest Companies in the construction technology industry.<ref>[http://www.specialtypub.com/constructech/hottest/listing.asp?List=commercial Constructech's Hottest Companies]</ref> In 2007 and 2008 CMiC was recognized as one of Canada's 50 Best Managed Companies.<ref>[http://www.canads50best.com Canada's 50 Best Managed Companies]</ref>

In 2009 CMiC released CMiC Open Enterprise v10, the newest version of CMiC software.  Using [[XML]], CMiC Open Enterprise v10 increases [[interoperability]] and integrates [[Building Information Modeling]] (BIM) applications, online payment applications, online planrooms and other diverse applications into the enterprise.
