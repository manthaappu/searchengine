'''DISCUS''' is an acronym for ''[[Distributed source coding]] Using Syndromes''.

==Introduction==
'''DISCUS''' is a compression algorithm used to compress [[correlated]] data sources.

'''DISCUS''' is a particular scheme used in [[source coding]] which is designed to
achieve the [[Slepian-Wolf bound]] ([[David Slepian]]) by using [[channel coding|channel codes]].

==History==
DISCUS was invented by researchers ''SS Pradhan'' and ''K Ramachandran'', in their seminal 
paper ''Distributed source coding using syndromes (DISCUS): design and construction''
published in the  ''Information Theory, IEEE Transactions on, 2003''.

==Variations==
Many variations of DISCUS are presented in related literature. One such popular scheme
is the ''Channel Code Partitioning'' scheme, which is an a-priori scheme, to reach the
[[Slepian-Wolf bound]]. Many papers illustrate simulations and experiments on channel code partitioning using the
[[turbo codes]], [[Hamming code]]s and [[IRA Code|Irregular Repeat Accumulate Codes]].
