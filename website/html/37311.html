'''''The Hacker Crackdown: Law and Disorder on the Electronic Frontier''''' (ISBN 0-553-56370-X) is a nonfiction book written by [[Bruce Sterling]] in 1992. It was published by Spectra Books.

The book discusses watershed events in the [[Hacker (computing)|hacker]] [[subculture]] in the early 1990s. The most notable topic covered is [[Operation Sundevil]] and the events surrounding the 1987-1990 war on the [[Legion of Doom (hacking)|Legion of Doom]] network: the [[Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service#Raid|raid]] on [[Steve Jackson Games]], the trial of "[[Craig Neidorf|Knight Lightning]]" (one of the original journalists of ''[[Phrack]]''), and the subsequent formation of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]. The book also profiles the likes of "[[Eric Gorden Corley|Emmanuel Goldstein]]" (publisher of ''[[2600: The Hacker Quarterly]]''), the former Assistant Attorney General of Arizona Gail Thackeray, [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center|FLETC]] instructor Carlton Fitzpatrick, [[Mitch Kapor]], and [[John Perry Barlow]].

In 1994, Sterling released the book for the [[Internet]] with a new afterword.

==Historical perspective==
Though published in 1992, and released as a freeware, electronic book ([[eBook]]) in 1994, the book offers a unique and colorful portrait of the nature of "[[cyberspace]]" in the early 1990s, and the nature of "computer crime" at that time. The events that Sterling discusses occur on the cusp of the mass popularity of the [[Internet]], which arguably achieved critical mass in late 1994. It also encapsulates a moment in the information age revolution when "cyberspace" morphed from the realm of telephone [[modem]]s and [[Bulletin Board System|BBS']] into the Internet and the [[World Wide Web]].

==Critical reception==
[[Cory Doctorow]], who voiced an unabridged podcast of the book, said it "inspired me politically, artistically and socially".<ref>http://www.boingboing.net/2007/06/23/cory-podcasts-bruce-.html</ref>

==Quotations==
{{quote|I can see a future in which any person can have a Node on the [[Internet|[Internet]]]. Any person can be a publisher. It's better than the media we now have. It's possible.|[[Mitch Kapor]]}}

{{quote|[[John Perry Barlow|[John Perry] Barlow]] was the first commentator to adopt [[William Gibson]]'s striking science-fictional term "[[cyberspace]]" as a synonym for the present- day nexus of computer and telecommunications networks. Barlow was insistent that cyberspace should be regarded as a qualitatively new world, a 'frontier.' According to Barlow, the world of electronic communications, now made visible through the computer screen, could no longer be usefully regarded as just a tangle of high-tech wiring. Instead, it had become a place, cyberspace, which demanded a new set of metaphors, a new set of rules and behaviors. The term, as Barlow employed it, struck a useful chord, and this concept of cyberspace was picked up by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Scientific American]]'', computer police, hackers, and even Constitutional scholars. 'Cyberspace' now seems likely to become a permanent fixture of the language.|On the initial founding of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]}}

{{quote|The electronic landscape changes with astounding speed. We are living through the fastest technological transformation in human history. I was glad to have a chance to document cyberspace during one moment in its long mutation; a kind of strobe-flash of the maelstrom.|From the afterword}}
