| '''Los Alamos chess'''
}}
'''Los Alamos chess''' (or '''anti-clerical chess''') is a [[chess variant]] played on a [[Minichess|6×6 board]] without [[bishop (chess)|bishops]]. This was the first chess-like game played by a computer program. This program was written in [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos laboratory]] by [[Paul Stein (computer scientist)|Paul Stein]] and [[Mark Wells (computer scientist)|Mark Wells]] for the [[MANIAC I]] computer in 1956. The reduction of the board size and the number of pieces from standard [[chess]] was due to the very limited capacity of computers at the time.

The computer played three games. The first it played against itself. The second one was against a strong human player, who played [[chess handicap|without a queen]]. The human player won. In the third game, MANIAC I played against a novice chess player who had been taught the rules just before the game. The computer won, marking the first time that a computer had beaten a human player in a chess-like game.

== Rules ==
The starting position is shown on the right. All rules are as in chess except:
* There is no pawn double-move, nor is there ''[[en passant]]'' capture;
* [[Pawns]] may not promote to bishops;
* There is no [[castling]].
