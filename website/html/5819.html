'''Chad Davis''' (born 1981) is an [[United States|American]] [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] (or [[Black hat|cracker]]) from [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], [[Wisconsin]], who operated under the alias of '''Mindphasr'''. He was the subject of one of the most high-profile prosecutions of [[cybercrime|cybercriminal]]s of the late 20th century.  Davis is a founding member of the [[globalHell]] syndicate of hackers, and is suspected to have authored or participated in the [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]] of the [[website]]s of numerous businesses and government agencies.<ref name="wpost">Suro, R.

==Biography==
===Arrest and prosecution===
On June 2, 1999, Davis's apartment was searched in a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) attempt to crack down on members of [[globalHell]], who had just weeks before [[vandalism|vandalized]] the [[White House#External links|homepage of the White House]].  Davis was not charged with any crime relating to his computer activities on this occasion.  However, underage at the time, he was fined $165 for a can of beer investigators discovered in his refrigerator.<ref>Taylor, C. (1999). [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991205,00.html "Geeks Vs. G-Men: A virtual shooting war breaks out between hackers and the FBI. Are the kids really worth the trouble?"] ''Time Magazine''. Retrieved October 31, 2006</ref>

On June 28, in retaliation for the search, Davis allegedly hacked the [http://www.army.mil/ home page] of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], vandalizing it with the message "globalHell will not die", and shutting it down for four hours.<ref>[http://www.hpcwire.com/hpc-bin/artread.pl?direction=Current&articlenumber=16194 HPCwire Article # 16194<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The case was immediately assigned to the [[Army Computer Crime Resident Agency|Computer Crime Resident Agency]] of the [[United States Army|Army]]'s [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Division|Criminal Investigation Command]], and the FBI.  Davis was taken into custody shortly afterwards.<ref>[http://www.cybercrime.gov/davis.htm Chad Davis, "Global Hell" Hacker, Sentenced to Six Months in Prison, Three Years Probation, for Air Force Network Hacks (March 1, 2000)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[United States Attorney]] Thomas Schneider told reporters, "Even though the intrusion involved an unclassified Army computer network, the intruder prevented use of the system by Army personnel. Interference with government computer systems are not just electronic vandalism, they run the risk of compromising critical information infrastructure systems."<ref>{{cite book |last= Newton |first= Michael |title= [[The Encyclopedia of High-Tech Crime and Crime-Fighting]] |publisher= [[Checkmark Books]], an imprint of [[Facts on File Inc.]] |year= 2004 |isbn= 0-8160-4979-3 }}</ref>

On January 4, 2000, Davis pled guilty to intentionally [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]] a protected computer and causing damage.  And on March 1, 2000, Judge Joseph P. Stadtmueller sentenced him to six months in prison, US$8,054 in restitution, three years probation, and forbade Davis from using or aiding anyone else in the use of a computer.<ref name="USDOJ_March_2000">{{cite web |date=March 1, 2000|url = http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/davis.htm|title = Chad Davis, "Global Hell" Hacker, Sentenced to Six Months in Prison, Three Years Probation., For Air Force Network Hacks |format = HTML |publisher = [[United States Department of Justice]]| accessdate = 2009-05-11 | last= |quote=}}</ref>

===Post-conviction===
Since his incarceration in 2000, Davis has gone onto a career as an independent security consultant. Davis has given numerous speeches around the country on the importance of security. As a consultant, he has also been hired by some of the worlds top corporations to oversee network security implementations.{{Fact|date=May 2007}}

==Fallout==
Other computer security experts predicted a massive wave of retaliation from the [[hacker culture|hacker community]] for the aggressive pursuit of [[globalHell]] members.  However, as of 2010, only one other group of hackers--known as [[Team Spl0it]]--has explicitly taken up the call for retaliation, by committing low-grade vandalism of several commercial web sites unaffiliated with the federal government.<ref>[http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-516142.html Lovesick hacker hits Microsoft site | Tech News on ZDNet<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Davis's successful prosecution for [[cybercrime]]--and the concurrent successful prosecution of fellow globalHell members [[Patrick W. Gregory]], [[Eric Burns (hacker)|Eric Burns]] and [[Russell Sanford]]--was actually seen by commentators to be the turning point in the attitude of globalHell, which has since declared itself legitimate.<ref>[http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-501316.html?legacy=zdnn Global Hell says it's going legit | Tech News on ZDNet<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Modus operandi==
Officials said that typically Davis used the [[ColdFusion]] software development framework, and attacked vulnerabilities in [[Microsoft Windows]] programs to gain [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] entry into a system.<ref name="USDOJ_March_2000"/> Davis did not program in ColdFusion; rather, he exploited a vulnerability discovered by [[rain.forest.puppy]] and extended to allow file uploads by a member of the [[L0pht]].<ref>[http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/115/info Allaire ColdFusion Remote File Display, Deletion, Upload and Execution Vulnerability.]</ref> Davis also allegedly used [[Domain Name System]] spoofing extensively, especially on the [[EFnet|Eris Free Network]].

==In pop culture==
"Chad Davis" is the name of the main character of [[Spyros Nomikos]] and [[Herbert Hugh Thompson]]'s 2004 [[techno-thriller]], [http://www.mezonicagenda.com/main.html ''The Mezonic Agenda: Hacking the Presidency''].  The character is a computer intrusion expert and "ethical hacker" who testifies before the [[United States Congress]] about the vulnerability of certain computer networks.
