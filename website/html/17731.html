'''ISWIM''' is an abstract computer [[programming language]] (or a family of programming languages) devised by [[Peter J. Landin]] and first described in his article, ''The Next 700 Programming Languages'', published in the [[Communications of the ACM]] in 1966. The [[acronym]] stands for "'''I'''f you '''S'''ee '''W'''hat '''I''' '''M'''ean".

Although not implemented, it has proved very influential in the development of programming languages, especially [[functional programming]] languages such as [[SASL programming language|SASL]], [[Miranda programming language|Miranda]], [[ML programming language|ML]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and their successors.

I<small>SWIM</small> is an imperative language with a functional core, consisting of a [[syntactic sugar]]ing of [[lambda calculus]] to which are added mutable variables and assignment and a powerful control mechanism — the [[Peter Landin's J operator|J operator]]. Being based on lambda calculus I<small>SWIM</small> has [[higher order functions]] and [[lexically scoped]] variables.

The operational semantics of I<small>SWIM</small> are defined using Landin's [[SECD machine]] and use call-by-value, that is [[eager evaluation]]. A goal of I<small>SWIM</small> was to look more like mathematical notation, so Landin abandoned [[Algol programming language|ALGOL]]'s semicolons between statements and <small>begin</small> <small>end</small> blocks and replaced them with the [[off-side rule]] and scoping based on indentation.

A notationally distinctive feature of I<small>SWIM</small> is its use of where clauses. An I<small>SWIM</small> program is a single expression qualified by 'where' clauses (auxiliary definitions including equations among variables), conditional expressions and function definitions. With [[CPL programming language|CPL]], I<small>SWIM</small> was one of the first programming languages to use 'where' clauses.

A notable semantic feature was the ability to define new data types, as a (possibly recursive) sum of products - this was done using a somewhat verbose natural language style description, but apart from notation amounts exactly to the [[algebraic data types]] found in modern functional languages.  I<small>SWIM</small> variables did not have explicit type declarations and it seems likely (although not explicitly stated in the 1966 paper) that Landin intended the language to be dynamically typed, like LISP and unlike [[Algol programming language|ALGOL]]; but it is also just possible that he had in mind to develop some form of [[type inference]].

No direct implemention of I<small>SWIM</small> was attempted but Art Evan's PAL and [[John C. Reynolds]]' G<small>edanken</small> captured most of Landin's concepts including powerful transfer-of-control operations.  Both of these were dynamically typed. Milner's [[ML programming language|ML]] may be considered equivalent to I<small>SWIM</small> without the J operator and with type inference.

Another line of descent from I<small>SWIM</small> is to strip out the imperative features (assignment and the J operator) leaving a purely functional language.  It then becomes possible to switch to [[lazy evaluation]].  This path led to programming languages [[SASL (programming language)|SASL]], KRC (Kent Recursive Calculator), [[Hope (programming language)|Hope]], [[Miranda (programming language)|Miranda]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], and [[Clean (programming language)|Clean]].
