'''Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation''' (acronym TENS) is the use of electric current produced by a device to stimulate the nerves for therapeutic purposes. TENS by definition covers the complete range of transcutaneously applied currents used for nerve excitation although the term is often used with a more restrictive intent, namely to describe the kind of pulses produced by portable stimulators used to treat pain.<ref>Robetson et al., 4th ed.</ref>{{Page needed|date=November 2010}} The unit is usually connected to the skin using two or more electrodes. A typical battery-operated TENS unit is able to modulate pulse width, frequency and intensity.  Generally TENS is applied at high frequency (>50 Hz) with an intensity below motor contraction (sensory intensity) or low frequency (<10 Hz) with an intensity that produces motor contraction.<ref>{{Cite book

==History==

Electrical stimulation for pain control was used in [[ancient Greece]], 63 A.D. It was reported by [[Scribonius Largus]] that pain was relieved by standing on an electrical fish at the seashore.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Jensen JE, Conn RR, Hazelrigg G, Hewett JE |title=The use of transcutaneous neural stimulation and isokinetic testing in arthroscopic knee surgery |journal=Am J Sports Med |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=27–33 |year=1985 |pmid=3872082 |url=http://ajs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/13/1/27 |doi=10.1177/036354658501300105}}</ref> In the 16th through the 18th century various [[electrostatic]] devices were used for headache and other pains. [[Benjamin Franklin]] was a proponent of this method for pain relief. In the nineteenth century a device called the electreat, along with numerous other devices were used for pain control and cancer cures. Only the electreat survived into the twentieth century, but was not portable, and had limited control of the stimulus.

The first modern, patient-wearable TENS was patented in the United States in 1974.<ref>{{US patent|3817254}}</ref> It was initially used for testing the tolerance of [[chronic pain]] patients to electrical stimulation before [[spinal Cord Stimulator|implantation of electrodes in the spinal cord dorsal column]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Burton C |title=Instrumentation for dorsal column stimulator implantation |journal=Surg Neurol |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=39–40 |year=1974 |month=Jan |pmid=4810453 }}</ref> The electrodes were attached to an implanted receiver, which received its power from an antenna worn on the surface of the skin. Although intended only for testing tolerance to electrical stimulation, many{{Weasel-inline|date=June 2009}} of the patients got so much relief from the TENS itself that they never returned for the implant. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

A number of companies began manufacturing TENS units after the commercial success of the [[Medtronic]] device became known.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The neurological division of Medtronic, founded by Don Maurer, Ed Schuck and Dr. Charles Ray, developed a number of applications for implanted electrical stimulation devices for treatment of epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and other disorders of the nervous system. Maurer founded Empi, Inc. in 1977, and in the late 1980s purchased the TENS product line from Medtronic.

Today many people confuse TENS with [[Electro Muscle Stimulation]] (EMS). EMS and TENS devices look similar, with both using long electric lead wires and electrodes. TENS is for blocking pain, where EMS is for stimulating muscles.

TENS is a non-invasive, safe nerve stimulation intended to reduce pain, both acute and chronic. While controversy exists as to its effectiveness in the treatment of chronic pain, a number of systematic reviews or meta-analyses have confirmed its effectiveness for postoperative pain, osteoarthritis, and chronic musculoskeletal pain.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Johnson M, Martinson, M |title=Efficacy of electrical nerve stimulation for chronic musculoskeletal pain: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials |journal=Pain |volume=130 |issue=1 |pages=157–165 |year=2006 |pmid= 17383095|doi=10.1016/j.pain.2007.02.007 |url=http://www.painjournalonline.com/article/S0304-3959(07)00073-5/abstract}}</ref> Conversely, results from the Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010 Task Force on Neck Pain, reported in early 2008, showed no clinically significant benefit to TENS for the treatment of neck pain when compared to sham treatment.<ref>{{Cite journal|author= |title=The Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders: Executive Summary |journal=Spine |volume=33 |issue=4S Supplement |pages=S5–7 |date=15 February 2008 |url=http://www.spinejournal.com/pt/re/spine/fulltext.00007632-200802151-00004.htm;jsessionid=JnnRzQxYsPbn2R14TVybSpYpR4yD9z2PG9TQl6Rcdh4HgpJwSJ9v!1173332523!181195629!8091!-1 |doi= 10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181643f40 |last1= Haldeman |first1= Scott |pmid= 18204400 |last2= Carroll |first2= L |last3= Cassidy |first3= JD |last4= Schubert |first4= J |last5= Nygren |first5= A |author6= Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders}}</ref> A January 2010,  systematic literature search published in the journal ''Neurology'',<ref>{{Cite journal

Scientific studies show that high and low frequency TENS produce their effects by activation of opioid receptors in the central nervous system{{Citation needed|reason=This whole section lacks references, and insinuates an air of authority / certainty which is entirely unwarranted, until proven otherwise. Compare the above and below paragraphs' referencing.|date=May 2010}}. Specifically, high frequency TENS activates delta-opioid receptors both in the spinal cord and supraspinally (in the medulla) while low frequency TENS activates beta-opioid receptors both in the spinal cord and supraspinally{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. Further high frequency TENS reduces excitation of central neurons{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} that transmit nociceptive information, reduces release of excitatory neurotransmitters (glutamate) and increases the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters (GABA) in the spinal cord, and activates muscarinic receptors centrally to produce analgesia (in effect, temporarily blocking the [[Gate control theory of pain|pain gate]]){{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. Low frequency TENS also releases serotonin and activates serotonin receptors in the spinal cord, releases GABA, and activates muscarinic receptors to reduce excitability of nociceptive neurons in the spinal cord{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.

In [[palliative care]] and [[pain medicine]], TENS units are used in an attempt to temporarily alleviate [[neuropathic pain]]

==Safety==
TENS electrodes should never be placed:

*Through the chest using an anterior and posterior electrode positions,<ref name=safe/> or other transthoracic applications understood as "across a thoracic diameter"; this does not preclude coplanar applications<ref name=val159/>
*Internally, except for specific applications of dental, vaginal, and anal stimulation that employ specialized TENS units<ref name=safe/>
*On broken skin areas or wounds, although it can be placed around wounds; on active areas of psoriasis where it may cause pain.<ref name=safe>Watson, 12th ed., [http://books.google.com/books?id=1IPj7rYI2u0C&pg=PA266 p. 266]</ref>
* Over a [[tumour]]/[[malignancy]] (based on [[in vitro]] experiments where electricity promotes cell growth)<ref name=safe/><ref name=val159/>
* Directly over the spinal column

TENS should not be used across an artificial [[Artificial pacemaker|cardiac pacemaker]] (or other indwelling stimulator, including across its leads) due to risk of interference and failure of the implanted device. Serious accidents have been recorded in cases when this principle was not observed.<ref name=val159/> A 2009 review in this area suggests that eletrotherapy, including TENS, "are best avoided" in patients with pacemakers or [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]]s (ICDs). They add that "there is no consensus and it may be possible to safely deliver these modalities in a proper setting with device and patient monitoring", and recommend further research. The review found several reports of ICDs administering inappropriate treatment due to interference with TENS devices, but notes that the reports on pacemakers are mixed: some non-programmable pacemakers were inhibited by TENS, but others were unaffected or auto-reprogrammed.<ref>{{cite pmid|19411677}}</ref>

On areas of numb skin/decreased sensation TENS should be used with caution because it's likely less effective due to nerve damage. It may also cause skin irritation due to the inability to feel currents until they are too high.<ref name=safe/> There's an unknown level of risk when placing electrodes over an [[infection]] (possible spreading due to muscle contractions), but cross contamination with the electrodes themselves is of greater concern.<ref>Roberston et al., 4th ed., [http://books.google.com/books?id=XBUEfp5ZfcgC&pg=PA160 p. 160]</ref> TENS should also be used with caution in people with epilepsy or pregnant women; do not use over area of the uterus as the effects of electrical stimulation over the developing fetus are not known.<ref name=val159>Roberston et al., 4th ed., [http://books.google.com/books?id=XBUEfp5ZfcgC&pg=PA159 p. 159]</ref><ref>Watson, 12th ed., [http://books.google.com/books?id=1IPj7rYI2u0C&pg=PA265 p. 265]</ref>
