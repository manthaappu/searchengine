The '''European Union Microsoft competition case''' is a case brought by the [[European Commission]] of the [[European Union]] (EU) against [[Microsoft]] for abuse of its dominant position in the market (according to [[competition law]]). It started as a complaint from [[Novell]] over Microsoft's licensing practices in 1993, and eventually resulted in the EU ordering Microsoft to divulge certain information about its server products and release a version of [[Microsoft Windows]] without [[Windows Media Player]].

==Initial complaints==
In 1993, [[Novell]] said that Microsoft was blocking its competitors out of the market through anti-competitive practices. The complaint centered on the license practices at the time which required royalties from each computer sold by a supplier of Microsoft's operating system, whether or not the unit actually contained the Windows operating system. Microsoft reached a settlement in 1994, ending some of its license practices.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com/2100-1023_3-204317.html | title=Microsoft investigated in Europe | first=Lamia | last=Abu-Haidar | publisher=[[CNET News.com]] | date=1997-10-16 | accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref>

[[Sun Microsystems]] joined the fray in 1998 when it complained about the lack of disclosure of some of the interfaces to Windows NT. The case widened even more when the EU started to look into how [[streaming media]] technologies were integrated with Windows.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com/2100-1001_3-941090.html | title=EU looks to wrap up Microsoft probe | publisher=[[CNET News.com]] | first=Declan | last=McCullagh | authorlink=Declan McCullagh | date=2002-07-01 | accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref>

==Judgment==
Citing ongoing abuse by Microsoft, the EU reached a preliminary decision in the case in 2003 and ordered the company to offer both a version of Windows without Windows Media Player and the information necessary for competing networking software to interact fully with Windows desktops and servers.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com/2100-1016_3-5060463.html | title=EU closes in on Microsoft penalty | publisher=[[CNET News.com]] | first=Ina | last=Fried | authorlink=Ina Fried | date=2003-08-06 | accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref> In March 2004, the EU ordered Microsoft to pay [[Euro|€]]497 million ([[United States Dollar|$]]794 million or [[Pound sterling|£]]381 million), the largest fine ever handed out by the EU at the time, in addition to the previous penalties, which included 120 days to divulge the server information and 90 days to produce a version of Windows without Windows Media Player.<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/antitrust/cases/decisions/37792/en.pdf Commission Decision of 24.03.2004 relating to a proceeding under Article 82 of the EC Treaty (Case COMP/C-3/37.792 Microsoft)].

The next month Microsoft released a paper containing scathing commentary on the ruling including: "The commission is seeking to make new law that will have an adverse impact on intellectual property rights and the ability of dominant firms to innovate."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com/2100-1016_3-5197390.html | title=Microsoft commentary slams EU ruling | publisher=[[CNET News.com]] | first=Ina | last=Fried | authorlink=Ina Fried | date=2004-04-21 | accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref> Microsoft paid the fine in full in July 2004.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com/2100-1014_3-5255715.html | title=Microsoft pays EU in full | publisher=[[CNET News.com]] | first=Matt | last=Hines | date=2004-07-02 | accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref>

In 2004, [[Neelie Kroes]] was appointed the European Commissioner for Competition; one of her first tasks was to oversee the fining brought onto Microsoft. Kroes has stated she believes [[open standards]] and [[open source]] are preferable to anything [[Proprietary software|proprietary]]:<ref>[http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2544 Open source as industrial policy]</ref>
{{cquote|The Commission must do its part.....It must not rely on one vendor, it must not accept closed standards, and it must refuse to become [[Vendor lock-in|locked into a particular technology]] – jeopardizing maintenance of full control over the information in its possession}}

==Follow-up==
Microsoft has a compliant version of its flagship operating system without Windows Media Player available under the negotiated name "[[Windows XP]] N."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com/2100-1016_3-5960750.html | title=Still 'no demand' for media-player-free Windows | publisher=[[CNET News.com]] | first=Ingrid | last=Marson | date=2005-11-18 | accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref> In response to the server information requirement, Microsoft released the [[source code]], but not the specifications, to [[Windows Server 2003]] service pack 1 to members of its Work Group Server Protocol Program (WSPP) on the day of the original deadline.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://open.itworld.com/4914/060125ms_ups_ante/page_1.html | title=Microsoft ups the ante with the E.C. | publisher=ITworld.com | first=Neil | last=Macehiter | date=2006-01-25 | accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref> Microsoft also appealed the case, and the EU had a week-long hearing over it. [[Neelie Kroes]] stated:<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.cnet.com/No-alternative-to-Microsoft-fine/2008-1014_3-6093104.html | title='No alternative' to Microsoft fine | publisher=[[CNET News.com]] | first=Dawn | last=Kawamoto | date=2006-07-12 | accessdate=2009-05-27}}</ref> {{cquote|Microsoft has claimed that its obligations in the decision are not clear, or that the obligations have changed. I cannot accept this characterization--Microsoft's obligations are clearly outlined in the 2004 decision and have remained constant since then.
Indeed, the monitoring trustee appointed in October 2005, from a shortlist put forward by Microsoft, believes that the decision clearly outlines what Microsoft is required to do. I must say that I find it difficult to imagine that a company like Microsoft does not understand the principles of how to document protocols in order to achieve interoperability.}}

Microsoft stated in June 2006 that it had begun to provide the EU with the requested information, but according to the [[BBC]] the EU stated that it was too late.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5120536.stm | title=Brussels poised to fine Microsoft | publisher=[[BBC]] | date=2006-06-27 | accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref>

On 12 July 2006, the EU fined Microsoft for an additional €280.5 million (US$448.58 million), €1.5 million (US$2.39 million) per day from 16 December 2005 to 20 June 2006. The EU threatened to increase the fine to €3 million ($4.81 million) per day on 31 July 2006 if Microsoft did not comply by then.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.zeropaid.com/bbs/archive/index.php/t-38334.html | title=EU fines Microsoft $357.3 million for defiance | publisher=[[Reuters]] | first=David | last=Lawsky | coauthors=Zawadzki, Sabina | date=2006-07-12 | accessdate=2006-07-12}}</ref>

On 17 September 2007, Microsoft lost their appeal against the European Commission's case.  The €497 million fine was upheld, as were the requirements regarding server interoperability information and bundling of Media Player.  In addition, Microsoft has to pay 80% of the legal costs of the Commission, while the Commission has to pay 20% of the legal costs by Microsoft. However, the appeal court rejected the Commission ruling that an independent monitoring trustee should have unlimited access to internal company organization in the future.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6998272.stm Microsoft loses anti-trust appeal].

Microsoft announced that it will demand 0.4% of the revenue (rather than 5.95%) in patent-licensing royalties, only from commercial vendors of interoperable software and promised not to seek patent royalties from individual open source developers. The interoperability information alone is available for a one-time fee of €10,000 (US$15,992).<ref>[http://www.itnews.com.au/News/63623,eu-forces-microsoft-to-cage-open-source-patent-dogs.aspx EU forces Microsoft to cage open source patent dogs]. itNews, 24 October 2007.</ref>

On 27 February 2008, the EU fined Microsoft an additional €899 million (US$1.44 billion) for failure to comply with the March 2004 antitrust decision. This represents the largest penalty ever imposed in 50 years of EU competition policy. This latest decision follows a prior €280.5 million fine for non-compliance, covering the period from June 21, 2006 until October 21, 2007.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/reuters/2008/02/27/business/OUKBS-UK-MICROSOFT-EU.php EU fines Microsoft 899 million]</ref> On 9 May 2008, Microsoft lodged an appeal in the European [[General Court (European Union)|Court of First Instance]] seeking to overturn the €899 million fine, officially stating that it intended to use the action as a "constructive effort to seek clarity from the court".<ref>[http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9084578&taxonomyId=14&intsrc=kc_top Update: Microsoft to appeal $1.3B EU fine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In its 2008 Annual Report Microsoft stated:<ref>http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10005379-16.html</ref>
{{cquote|The European Commission closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. In 2004, the Commission ordered us to create new versions of Windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products. The Commission’s impact on product design may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the Windows platform, and increase our product development costs. The availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our own products which could result in decreased sales of our products.}}
