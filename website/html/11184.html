The '''Dunia Engine''' is a game engine, based on [[CryEngine]], but heavily modified by the [[Ubisoft]] Montréal development team for ''[[Far Cry 2]]''.<ref>http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=nl&u=http://tweakers.net/nieuws/50850/ubisoft-licht-tipje-van-de-sluier-over-far-cry-2-op.html&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=1&ct=result&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://tweakers.net/nieuws/50850%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26hs%3DxUy</ref> A heavily modified version of the Dunia Engine is used for ''[[James Cameron's Avatar: The Game]]''. ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]'' and ''[[Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood]]'' also uses ''Far Cry 2'''s vegetation technology, although it doesn't use the Dunia Engine itself (the game runs on [[Anvil (game engine)|Anvil]]).<ref>http://www.pcgames.de/aid,684781/Assassins-Creed-2-Interview-Die-Missionen-sind-nicht-mit-dem-Vorgaenger-vergleichbar/PC/Special/?page=2</ref>
