==History==
Indy was initially named "Winshoes" and was written by [[Chad Hower|Chad Z. Hower]] ([[Pseudonym|a.k.a]] Kudzu<ref name="z">{{cite web|url=http://www.KudzuWorld.com/|author=Hower, Chad Z.|title=Kudzu World}}</ref>) in 1993 in Visual Basic.<ref name="about">{{ cite web | url=http://www.indyproject.org/About.aspx | title=Indy Project - About | publisher=Indy Project | accessdate=2008-02-06 }}</ref> In 1995, he ported it to Borland Delphi and deprecated the Visual Basic version. In 1997, he made it available under an open-source license.<ref name="license" /> In 2000, Winshoes was renamed to Internet Direct (Indy for short) and became cross-platform. In 2001, Borland began including it as a part of Borland Delphi, C++ Builder, and Kylix. In 2003, Indy was ported to Delphi for .NET.  The following year, Indy was made available to the Microsoft [[.NET Framework|.NET]] community.<ref name="about" />
