'''Tom Lane''' is a computer scientist dedicated to [[Open source software]].  In a 2000 study, he was cited as one of the leading contributors to Open Source software.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/769/678|title=The Orbiten Free Software Survey|author=Rishab Aiyer Ghosh and Vipual Ved Prakash|date=2000-05-10|accessdate=}} (The Orbiten Free Software Survey)</ref>

Tom Lane's contributions to Open source include:
* Organizer of the Independent JPEG Group (IJG)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jCqRwa0T81kC&pg=PA301&lpg=PA301&dq=%22Organizer+of+the+Independent+JPEG+Group%22&source=web&ots=7CNdkKB-nu&sig=K8lasgz6-RfJg7qsBkWpnrl9ZrY&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=2&ct=result|title=Introduction to Information Theory and Data Compression|author=Darrel R.

==Education and academic work==
Tom holds a [[bachelor's degree]] in Electrical Engineering from [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[1978]] and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Computer Science from [[Carnegie Mellon University]],  [[1990]].

Tom occasionally lectures at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and other places.

==PostgreSQL==

Tom Lane is a member of the core [[PostgreSQL]] development team.  He is involved in all aspects of PostgreSQL, including new features, performance improvements, and bug evaluation and fixes. 

==Independent JPG Group (IJG)==

IJG is an informal group that writes and distributes a widely used free library for [[JPEG]] image compression.  The IJG is arguably one of the important early open source groups and a major reason why the JPEG image format is a standard.

{{Cquote|Probably the largest and most important contribution however was the work of the Independent JPEG Group (IJG), and Tom Lane in particular.  Their Open Source software implementation, as well as being one of the major Open Source packages was key to the success of the JPEG standard and was incorporated by many companies into a variety of products such as image editors and Internet browsers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpeg.org/jpeg/index.html|title=JPEG.org Homepage|author=|date=2008-09-14|accessdate=}} (www.jpeg.org)</ref>}}

The IJG develops and maintains [[libjpeg]], a library written entirely in C which contains a widely-used implementation of a JPEG decoder, JPEG encoder and other JPEG utilities.

==PNG==

The original specification for the [[Portable Network Graphics]] (PNG), version 1.0, was written by Thomas Boutell and Tom Lane, with contributions by many others.

Tom Lane is a Contributing Editor for PNG Specification, Version 1.1.

==TIFF==

Tom Lane is a member of the [[Tagged Image File Format]] (TIFF) advisory committee.

==Humor==

* In disputing a JPEG patent claim. "The patent describes a three-way symbol classification; the closest analog in JPEG is a two-way classification.  If the jury can count higher than two, the case will fail."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2002/0719jpeg.html|title=Forgent claims JPEG patent; others cry foul|author=Gillian Law|date=2002-07-02|accessdate=2007-09-11}} (NetworkWorld article)</ref>

* In describing the attention to detail of another software company "The Single Unix Spec says that getopt() is supposed to be defined by <unistd.h>, but I guess reading the spec closely is not a hobby in Redmond..."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/pgsql-hackers@postgresql.org/msg52400.html|title=pgsql-hackers forum|author=Tom Lane|date=2004-11-19|accessdate=2007-09-11}}</ref>

* In contributing to "The Only Coke Machine on the Internet"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~coke/history_long.txt|title=The Only Coke Machine on the Internet|author=|date=|accessdate=}}</ref> "Since time immemorial (well, maybe 1970) the Carnegie-Mellon CS department has maintained a departmental Coke machine which sells bottles of Coke for a dime or so less than other vending machines around campus. As no Real Programmer can function without caffeine, the machine is very popular..."

* On idiotic benchmark comparisons "Try to carry 500 people from Los Angeles to Tokyo in an F-15. No? Try to win a dogfight in a 747. No? But they both fly, so it must be useful to compare them... especially on the basis of the most simplistic test case you can think of. For extra points, use *only one* test case. Perhaps this paper can be described as "comparing an F-15 to a 747 on the basis of required runway length".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/pgsql-general@postgresql.org/msg93043.html|title=Re: Database performance comparison paper.|author=|date=|accessdate=}}</ref>

==In Modern Culture==

* Mentioned in the game "Doom 3" readme file<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nd80usa.net/slicks/doom3docs/htm/readme.htm|title=Doom 3 Readme File|author=|date=|accessdate=}}</ref>
* Partially responsible for the standardization of JPEG as the dominant computer image format on the World Wide Web
