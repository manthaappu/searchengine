<html> <head> <title>FASMI</title></head><body>'''''Fast Analysis of Shared Multidimensional Information''''' ('''''FASMI''''') is an alternative term for [[OLAP]]. The term was coined by [[Nigel Pendse]] of The [[OLAP Report]] (now known as The BI Verdict), because he felt that the 12 rules that [[Tedd Codd]] used to define OLAP were too controversial and biased. (The rules  were sponsored by [[Hyperion Solutions|Arbor Software]], the company which developed [[Essbase]]). Also, Pendse considered that the list of 12 rules was too long, and the OLAP concept could be defined in only five rules.
