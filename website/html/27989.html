'''PARSEC''' is a package designed to perform [[electronic structure]] calculations of [[solids]] and [[molecules]] using [[density functional theory]] (DFT). The acronym stands for ''Pseudopotential Algorithm for Real-Space Electronic Calculations''.<ref>L. Kronik, A. Makmal, M. Tiago, M. M. G. Alemany, X. Huang, Y. Saad, and J. R. Chelikowsky, "PARSEC - the pseudopotential algorithm for real-space electronic structure calculations: recent advances and novel applications to nanostructures", Phys. Stat. Solidi. (b) (Feature Article) 243, 1063-1079 (2006)</ref>. It solves the [[Kohn-Sham equations]] in real space, without the use of [[Basis set (chemistry)|explicit basis sets]].<ref>J. R. Chelikowsky, N. Troullier, and Y. Saad, "Finite difference-pseudopotential method: Electronic structure calculations without a basis", Phys. Rev. Lett. 72, 1240 (1994).</ref>

One of the strengths of this code is that it handles non-periodic boundary conditions in a natural way, without the use of super-cells, but can equally well handle periodic and partially periodic boundary conditions.<ref>M. M. G. Alemany, M. Jain, L. Kronik, and J. R. Chelikowsky, "A real space pseudopotential method for computing the electronic properties of periodic systems”, Phys. Rev. B69, 075101:1-6 (2004)"</ref>,<ref>A. Natan, A. Benjamini, D. Naveh, L. Kronik, M. L. Tiago, S. P. Beckman, and J. R. Chelikowsky, "Real-space pseudopotential method for first principles calculations of general periodic and partially periodic systems", Phys. Rev. B 78, 075109 (2008).</ref>,<ref>J. Han, M.L. Tiago, T.-L. Chan, and J.R. Chelikowsky, "Real space method for the electronic structure of one-dimensional periodic systems", J. Chem. Phys. 129, 144109 (2008)</ref>. Another key strength is that it is readily amenable to efficient massive parallelization, making it highly effective for very large systems.<ref>A. Stathopoulos, S. Öğüt, Y. Saad, J. R. Chelikowsky, and H. Kim, Comput. Sci. Eng. 2, 19 (2000).</ref>

Its development started in early 1990s with James Chelikowsky (now at the [[University of Texas]]), [[Yousef Saad]] and collaborators at the [[University of Minnesota]]. The code is freely available under the [[GNU GPL]]. Currently, its public version is 1.1. Some of the physical/chemical properties calculated by this code are: Kohn-Sham [[band structure]], atomic forces (including molecular dynamics capabilities), static [[electric susceptibility|susceptibility]], [[magnetic dipole moment]], and many additional molecular and solid state properties.
