A '''plugboard''', or '''control panel''' (the term used depended on the application area), is an array of [[jack (connector)|jacks]], or hubs, into which [[patch cords]] can be inserted to complete an electrical circuit.  Control panels were used to direct the operation of some [[unit record equipment]].  Plugboards were used on some [[:Category:Cryptographic hardware|cipher machine]]s, and some [[History of computing hardware#Digital computation|early computers]].  

==Unit record equipment==

Control panels were introduced in 1906 for a [[Herman Hollerith|Hollerith]] [[Tabulating machine|tabulator]], earlier machines had been hard wired for specific applications. Removable control panels were introduced with the Hollerith (IBM) type 3-S tabulator in the 1920s. Different programs could be stored on separate plugboards, and then inserted into the tabulators as needed.  IBM manuals use the word "program" only for calculators, such as the [[IBM 602]] and [[IBM 604]], that executed a sequence of operations.  For all other machines, from sorters, interpreters, to the [[IBM 407]], the control panel "directed" or "automatic operation was obtained by..."

An IBM control panel was roughly one to two feet (300 to 600 mm) on a side and had a rectangular array of hubs. [[Jack (connector)|Plugs]] at each end of a patch cord were inserted into hubs, making a connection between two contacts on the machine when the control panel was placed in the machine, thereby connecting an emitting hub to an accepting hub. For example, in a card duplicator application a card column reading (emitting) hub might be connected to a punch column (accepting) hub. It was a relatively simple matter to copy some fields, perhaps to different columns, and ignore other columns by suitable wiring. Tabulator control panels required dozens of patch cords for complex applications. Wiring a control panel required knowledge of the machines functions and its timing constraints.

Many applications using unit record tabulators were later migrated to computers such as the [[IBM 1401]].  Two programming languages, [[FARGO (programming language)|FARGO]] and [[RPG programming language|RPG]], were created to aid this migration.  Since tabulator control panels were based on the machine cycle, both FARGO and RPG emulated the notion of the machine cycle and training material showed the control panel vs. programming language coding sheet relationships.

==Cypher machines==
[[Image:Enigma-plugboard.jpg|thumb|The plugboard (''steckerbrett'') on the Enigma is positioned at the front of the machine, below the keys. In the photograph, two pairs of letters are swapped (S-O and J-A). Up to 13 letters can be swapped this way.]]
A plugboard was used on the famous [[Enigma machine]]; it was not removable. In this case the plugboard acted as a "fourth rotor" in the [[rotor machine]]'s workings. Plugboard wirings were part of the "day settings" that specified which rotors to insert into which slot, and which plugboard connections to make. In practice the plugboard did not improve the security of the cypher being generated, as it did not change with every keypress, unlike the rotors.

==Early computers==
The first version of the [[ENIAC]] computer was programmed via cabling, switches and plugboards.  ENIAC's cabling was later reconfigured to use the existing Function Tables data ROM memory as program ROM memory (the switches and plugboards continued to be used in the reconfigured ENIAC). 

Plugboards remained in use in specialty-purpose computers for some time, acting as a ROM but able to be manually reprogrammed in the field. One example is the [[Ferranti Argus]] computer, used on the [[Bristol Bloodhound]] missile, which feature a plugboard programmed by inserting small ferrite rods into slots, in effect creating a read-only [[core memory]] by hand.

Wiring the plugboard "programmed" the system, which operated as a sort of [[read only memory]].
