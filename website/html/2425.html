'''Ars Technica''' ({{pronEng|ˌɑrz ˈtɛknɨkə}}), [[Latin]] for "Art of Technology"<ref name=latin/>, is a technology news and information website created by Ken Fisher and Jon Stokes in 1998. It publishes news, reviews and guides on issues such as computer hardware and software, science, technology policy, and video games. Ars Technica is known for its features; long articles that go into specific detail on their subjects. Many of the site's writers are postgraduates, and some work for research institutions. Articles on the website are often written in an opinionated tone, as opposed to a journal.

Ars Technica was privately owned until May 2008 when it was sold to Condé Nast Digital—the online division of [[Condé Nast Publications]]. Condé Nast purchased the site along with two others for $25 million, and added it to their Wired Digital group that also includes [[Wired News]] and [[Reddit]]. The website's staff relocated to Chicago, Illinois, and also have offices in San Francisco, California. The cost of operating Ars Technica has always been funded primarily by online advertising. The website generated controversy in 2009 when it experimentally blocked users who use advertisement blocking software from viewing the site. Ars Technica has also offered a paid subscription service since 2001.

== History ==
Ken Fisher and Jon Stokes created the Ars Technica [[website]] and [[limited liability company]] in 1998.<ref name=llc/> Its purpose was to publish computer [[hardware]] and [[Computer software|
software]]-related news articles and guides;<ref name=wsj_video/> in their words, "the best multi-OS, PC hardware, and tech coverage possible while [..] having fun, being productive, and being as informative and as accurate as possible."<ref name=orig_mission_statement/> "Ars technica" is a [[Latin]] [[attributive construction]] that translates to "art of technology".<ref name=wsj_video/> The website published news, reviews, guides, and other content of interest to computer enthusiasts. Writers for Ars Technica were geographically distributed in the United States at the time; Fisher lived in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], Stokes in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and the other writers in their respective cities.<ref name=llc/><ref name=orig_staff/> 

On May 19, 2008, Ars Technica was sold to Condé Nast Digital—the online division of [[Condé Nast Publications]].<ref group=note>Condé Nast Digital was named CondéNet at the time.[http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.showArticle&art_aid=99121]</ref> The sale was part of a combination purchase by Condé Nast Digital of three unaffiliated websites costing $25 million total: Ars Technica, [[Webmonkey]], and [[HotWired|Hot Wired]]. Ars Technica was added to the company's Wired Digital group that includes [[Wired News]] and [[Reddit]]. In an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', Fisher said other companies offered to buy Ars Technica, and that the site's writers agreed to a deal with Condé Nast because they felt it offered them the best chance to turn their "hobby" into a business.<ref name=nytimes_buyout/> Fisher, Stokes, and the eight other writers at the time were employed by Condé Nast, with Fisher as [[editor in chief]],<ref name=arrington/><ref name=boomtown/> and they began relocating to Chicago.<ref name=ars-v5/> [[Layoff]]s at Condé Nast in November 2008 affected websites owned by the company "across the board", including Ars Technica.<ref name=layoffs/>

== Content ==
The content of articles published by Ars Technica has generally remained the same since its creation in 1998. Articles include commentary and opinion by the writers, and are usually accompanied by pictures for illustration, or for [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] purposes. They are now categorized by four types: News, Guides, Reviews, and Features. News articles relay current events. Guides instruct readers on how to do things; for example, the Ars Technica System Guide that advises readers on which computer parts to buy when building a computer. Reviews give opinionated assessment of hardware and software products. Features are longer informative articles. The website's readers can post their comments and start discussions at the bottom of each article. Ars Technica also hosts OpenForum, a free [[internet forum]] for the discussion of a variety of topics.

Originally, most news articles published by the website were relayed from other technology-related websites. Ars Technica provided short commentary on the news, generally a few paragraphs, and a link to the original source. After being purchased by Conde Nast, Ars Technica began publishing more original news; investigating topics and interviewing sources themselves. A significant portion of the news articles published there now are original. Ars Technica was criticized in 2006 for quoting a [[blog|blogger]] in a news article without giving attribution for the quote; after the blogger raised the issue, the article's writer apologized and retroactively added attribution.<ref name=boomtown/> Relayed news is still published on the website, ranging from one- or two-sentences to a few paragraphs.

Ars Technica's Features are long articles that go into specific detail on their subject.<ref name=atlantic/><ref name=guardian_long_os_revs/> For example, the site published a guide on CPU architecture in 1998 named "Understanding CPU caching and performance".<ref name=old_cpu_guide/> An article in 2009 discussed in detail the [[Scientific theory|theory]], [[physics]], [[mathematical proof]]s, and applications of [[quantum computer]]s.<ref name=qubits/> The website's 18,000-word review of [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iPad]] described everything from the product's packaging, to the specific type of [[integrated circuit]]s it uses.<ref name=ipad_review/> 

Ars Technica is written in an informal, opinionated tone, as opposed to a traditional journal, but its articles are often written by people with some expertise on the subject they are writing.<ref name=nature/><ref name=bonetta/> Many of the website's regular writers have [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] degrees, and many work for academic or private research institutions. Website co-founder Jon Stokes published the computer architecture textbook ''Inside The Machine'' in 2007;<ref name=inside_the_machine/> John Timmer performed [[postdoctoral research]] in [[neuroscience|developmental neurobiology]];<ref name=nature/> Timothy Lee is a scholar at the [[Cato Institute]], a [[policy institute|public policy institute]], which has republished Ars Technica articles by him.<ref name=cato/><ref name=cato_lee/> Biology journal ''[[Disease Models & Mechanisms]]'' called Ars Technica a "conduit between researchers and the public" in 2008.<ref name=dmm/>

=== Layout ===
Ars Technica's [[page layout]] has been significantly changed five times since its creation, most recently in 2009.<ref name=ars-v5/> The current layout consists of two vertical columns topped by a horizontal navigation bar, interspersed with two [[Web banner|banner advertisements]]. [[Hyperlink|Links]] on the navigation bar lead to the website's 17 sections. Any given article is listed under a section that organizes it by its general subject: Infinite Loop ([[Apple Inc.|Apple]]), Uptime ([[business]]), Gear & Gadgets (electronics), Opposable Thumbs ([[video games]]), One [[Microsoft]] Way, Open Ended ([[open source]]), [[Nobel prize|Nobel]] Intent (science), Law & Disorder (technology  [[policy]]), Hardware, Media, Security, Software, Staff (articles about Ars Technica), Telecom ([[telecommunication]]), Web, and Exploring Datacenters. The left column lists the most recent articles of all types and their associated images. The right column showcases the ten latest Features with larger pictures; below the Features, it lists aggregated news, job listings for technology companies in the United States and Canada, and other varied links.

== Revenue ==
The cost of operating Ars Technica has always been funded primarily by online advertising.<ref name=niemanlab/> Originally handled by Federated Media Publishing, selling advertising space on the website is now handled by Condé Nast.<ref name=arrington/> In addition to online advertising, Ars Technica has sold subscriptions to the website since 2001, now named Ars Premier subscriptions. Subscribers are not shown advertisements, and are able to see exclusive articles, post in certain areas of Ars Technica forum, participate in live [[chat rooms]] with notable people in the computer industry, and other benefits.<ref name=subs-faq/> To a lesser extent, revenue is also collected from content sponsorship. A series of articles about the future of collaboration was sponsored by [[IBM]],<ref name=niemanlab/> and the site's Exploring Datacenters section is sponsored by [[data management]] company [[NetApp]]. In the past, Ars Technica collected [[Revenue sharing|shared revenue]] from [[affiliate marketing]] by advertising deals and discounts from online retailers, and from the sale of Ars Technica-[[brand]]ed merchandise<!--until when?-->.<ref name=sales-merch-2001/>

===Advertisement block===
On March 5, 2010, Ars Technica experimentally blocked readers who use [[Adblock Plus]]—one of several computer programs that stop advertisements from being displayed in their [[Web browser|browser]]—from viewing the website. Fisher estimated 40% of the website's readers had the software installed at the time. The next day, the block was lifted, and the article "Why Ad Blocking is devastating to the sites you love" was published on Ars Technica persuading readers not to use the software on websites they care about:<ref name=niemanlab/>

{{quote|text=... blocking ads can be devastating to the sites you love. I am not making an argument that blocking ads is a form of stealing, or is immoral, or unethical [...] It can result in people losing their jobs, it can result in less content on any given site, and it definitely can affect the quality of content. It can also put sites into a real advertising death spin.}}

The block and article were controversial, generating articles on other websites about them, and the broader issue of advertising ethics.<ref name=asay_abp/><ref name=wsj_abp/> Readers of Ars Technica generally followed Fisher's persuasion; the day after his article was published, 25,000 readers who  used the software had allowed the display of advertisements on Ars Technica in their browser, and 200 readers had subscribed to Ars Premier.<ref name=niemanlab/> Adblock Plus developer Wladimir Palant responded, stating that blocking advertisements in general is justified because websites receive revenue from them regardless of whether they are seen or ignored by readers:<ref name=Palant-response/>

{{quote|text=Only an ad that generates a sale (either directly because the user clicked it or indirectly via brand awareness and similar) provides value. If you see yourself being paid without providing a value than [''sic''] you either tricked whoever is paying you [...] or it is a temporary state where whoever is paying you didn’t adjust to the new realities yet.}}
