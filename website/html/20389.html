'''Kabru''' is a '''[[supercomputer]]''' that uses a 2.4 GHz [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium Xeon]] Cluster and [[Linux]] to provide a sustained speed of 959 [[gigaflops]]. It was developed by the [[Institute of Mathematical Sciences]] (IMSc) in [[Chennai| Chennai, India]]. In 2004, Kabru was listed as #257 in the world's top 500 supercomputers{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} and takes its name from a [[Kabru|Himalayan]] peak.

The idea for Kabru was born when Professor Hari Dass of the Institute began looking for a supercomputer to handle his [[theoretical physics]] research, which dealt primarily with large-scale simulations in the field of the [[lattice gauge theory]].

The [[Department of Atomic Energy (India)|Department of Atomic Energy]] in India made a grant of Rs 3.5 crore to the Institute to develop Kabru.
