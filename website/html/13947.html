'''Forensic Corporate Collections''' refer to the type of [[debt collection]] and recovery tactics that apply [[computer forensics]] and [[scientific knowledge]] to the debt collection process.

==Purpose==
Forensic corporate collections are those that are acquired in a fashion that enables the evidence and results that are collected, preserved, analyzed, and presented to the [[creditor]] to be legally admissible in a [[court of law]]. This type of debt collection employs data collected from computer-driven [[hardware]] such as [[personal computer]]s, public information center databases, PDAâ€™s ([[personal digital assistant]]s), [[cell phone]]s, and other hardware to track down [[debtor]]s nationally and internationally to recover and collect money that is owed to a client/creditor. This is all done within the fullest parameters of the law in order for it to be presented in court, if necessary.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Process==
By engaging consistently updated [[computer software]] in the debt collection process, forensic corporate collection agencies are able to identify, retrieve, and protect electronic evidence of [[fraud]] (and other illegal means of avoiding debt) found on computers and use it as evidence in case of [[litigation]]. In order for a forensic collections agency to be used as a means of recovering a debt, the agency must be compliant with and knowledgeable of investigation basics, federal, state and local policies, standards, laws and legal processes. They must also have a working knowledge of the types of crimes and incidents in debt deception and fraud, the [[computing]] environment and types of evidence, as well as investigative tools, technical training, and use of forensic recovery equipment.

In order to effectively recover and locate debtors and get them to pay what they owe their client(s), forensic collections agents have become adept and conversant in [[evidence collection]] and management, managing the incident scene, the investigation of [[computer system]]s, disks, and file structures, extracting and preserving computer and electronic evidence, [[e-mail]] and [[Internet]] investigations, cell phone and PDA investigations, and other [[digital footprint]]s debtors invariably leave behind.
