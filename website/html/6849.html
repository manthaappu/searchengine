'''College Tonight''' was a social networking service for U.S. college-aged students, graduate students, and alumni. It focuses on nightlife events and social opportunities on and near college campuses. Students utilize the service to explore their communities and socially interact.  The unique platform also allows the advertising sector to tap into active, outgoing, and socially motivated young people.  Starting a profile requires an e-mail address with an ".edu" ending.

The site is the brainchild of Emory University alumnus, Zach Suchin, and Emory University student, Jason Schutzbank. The company launched a beta version in September 2006 and launched the official site to the public in September 2007, beginning with a nine-month nightlife tour at 192 campuses across the country.<ref name=busweek>{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/aug2007/id2007088_875208_page_2.htm | title= ‘‘Facebook Faces Up’’ at Business Week | accessdate=August 8, 2007 }}</ref>

==History==
While an undergraduate at Emory University in Atlanta, Zach Suchin made money promoting events and realized there was nothing out there that offered students a chance to explore new nightlife opportunities. He conceptualized a website that not only informs people of the nightlife options in their direct area, but also helps them enjoy an interactive, networking experience that goes beyond the physical computer.<ref name=dailynexus>{{cite web | url=http://www.dailynexus.com/article.php?a=14805 | title= ‘‘Web Site Promotes Student Nightlife’’ at Daily Nexus | accessdate=October 19, 2007 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  Years later, Zach and current Emory undergraduate Jason Schutzbank made Zach’s dream a reality with the launch of collegetonight.com. Zach found [[angel investor]]s for the initial startup capital.  College Tonight was available at 194 campuses.<ref name=digitalmediawire>{{cite web | url=http://www.dmwmedia.com/news/2006/10/26/spotlight-college-tonight-takes-on-myspace-facebook-on-coveted-turf | title= ‘‘Spotlight: College Tonight Takes on MySpace, Facebook on Coveted Turf’’ at digitalmediawire | accessdate=October 26, 2006 }}</ref>

CollegeTonight.com would later became part of TheQuad.com, grander collegiate platform.

==Features==
College Tonight is a privacy-protected, registered-users-only social network that encourages actual social interactivity. It establishes distinct networks for each U.S. college, where students can post information about parties, concerts, and social events, download contact lists to their mobile phones, and make plans to meet up.<ref name=busweek /> The site has many features, including The Entourage, My Hook-Ups, and My Drunk Dials.<ref name=coloradodaily>{{cite web | url=http://coloradodaily.com/articles/2006/12/07/mix_sections/local_scene/local1.txt | title= ‘‘Bring it!’’ at Colorado Daily | accessdate=December 7, 2006 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> But, despite all the "party central" features, the company’s main concern is to keep users’ privacy intact and, to this end, has employed a former FBI profiler, [[John E. Douglas|John Douglas]], as its security advisor.<ref name=coloradodaily />  College Tonight has also added him onto their board of advisers.<ref name=collegetonight>{{cite news | last = BusinessWire | title = FBI's Legendary Special Agent John Douglas Joins College Tonight Inc. | publisher = Yahoo!
