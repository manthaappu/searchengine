<html> <head> <title>Generating set</title></head><body>In [[mathematics]], the expressions '''generator''', '''generate''', '''generated by''' and '''generating set''' can have several closely related technical meanings:
* [[Generating set of an algebra]]: If ''A'' is a ring and ''B'' is an ''A''-[[algebra]], then ''S'' '''generates''' ''B'' if the only [[subalgebra|sub-''A''-algebra]] of ''B'' containing ''S'' is ''B'' itself.
* [[Generating set of a group]]: A set of group elements which are not contained in any subgroup of the group other than the entire group itself. See also [[group presentation]].
* [[Subring#Subring generated by a set|Generating set of a ring]]: A subset ''S'' of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''A'' '''generates''' ''A'' if the only [[subring]] of ''A'' containing ''S'' is ''A'' itself.
* [[Ideal (ring theory)#Ideal generated by a set|Generating set of an ideal]] in a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]].
* [[generator (category theory)|Generator]] is invoked in [[category theory]]. Usually the intended meaning will be clear from context.

* In [[topology]], a collection of sets which generate the topology is called a [[subbase]].
* [[Generating set of a topological algebra]]: ''S'' is a generating set of a [[topological algebra]] ''A'' if the smallest closed [[subalgebra]] of ''A'' containing ''S'' is ''A'' itself

* Elements of the [[Lie algebra]] to a [[Lie group]] are sometimes referred to as "generators of the group," especially by physicists.  The Lie algebra can be thought of as generating the group at least locally by exponentiation, but the Lie algebra does not form a generating set in the strict sense.
* The '''generator''' of any [[continuous symmetry]] implied by [[Noether's theorem]], with the generators of a Lie group being a special case. In this case, a generator is sometimes called a [[charge (physics)|charge]] or [[Noether charge]], in analogy to the [[electric charge]] being the generator of the [[U(1)]] symmetry group of [[electromagnetism]]. Thus, for example, the [[color charge]]s of [[quark]]s are the generators of the [[SU(3)]] [[color symmetry]] in [[quantum chromodynamics]]. More precisely, "charge" should apply only to the [[root system]] of a Lie group.
* In [[stochastic processes|stochastic analysis]], an [[Itō diffusion]] or more general [[Itō process]] has an [[Infinitesimal generator (stochastic processes)|infinitesimal generator]].
