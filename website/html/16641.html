A '''hierarchical RBF''' is an [[interpolation]] method based on [[Radial basis function|RBF]].  

[[Interpolation]] based on [[Radial basis function|RBF]] used for the construction of shape models in [[3d computer graphics|3D computer graphics]] (see [[Stanford Bunny]] on picture), treatment of results from a [[3D scanner]], terrain reconstruction and others.

This problem often named "large scattered data point set interpolation".

The idea of method (for example in 3D) consists of the following: 
* let the scattered points be presented a set <math>\mathbf{P}=\{\mathbf{c}_i=(\mathbf{x}_i,\mathbf{y}_i,\mathbf{z}_i)\vert^{N}_{i=0} \subset \mathbb{R}^3\}</math>
* let the exist a set of values of some function in scattered points <math>\mathbf{H}=\{\mathbf{h}_i \vert^{N}_{i=0}\subset \mathbb{R}\}</math>
* find a function <math>\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})</math> which will meet next condition: <math>\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})=1</math> for points lies on shape and <math>\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})\neq1</math> for points not lies on shape
* as J. C. Carr et al. showed <ref>Carr, J.C.; Beatson, R.K.; Cherrie, J.B.; Mitchell, T.J.; Fright, W.R.; McCallum B.C.; Evans, T.R. (2001),  “Reconstruction and Representation of 3D Objects with Radial Basis Functions” ACM SIGGRAPH 2001, Los Angeles, CA, P. 67–76.</ref> this function looks like <math>\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})=\sum_{i=1}^N \lambda_i \varphi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{c}_i)</math> where:
<math>\varphi</math> &mdash; it is [[Radial basis function|RBF]];
<math>\lambda</math> &mdash; it is coefficients which are the solution of the [[Linear system of equations|system]] show on picture:

for determination of surface it is necessary to estimate the value of function <math>\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})</math> in interesting  points ''x''.
A lack of such method is considerable complication <ref>Bashkov, E.A.; Babkov, V.S. (2008) “Research of RBF-algorithm and his modifications apply

==Hierarchical algorithm==
An idea of [[hierarchical]] [[Algorythm|algorithm]] is an acceleration of calculations due to [[Decomposition (computer science)|decomposition]] of intricate problem on the great number of simple (see picture). [[Image:Sxema.gif]]

In this case [[hierarchical]] division of space containing points on elementary parts, the [[Linear system of equations|system]] of small dimension solves in each of which. The calculation of surface in this case is taken to the [[hierarchical]] (on the basis of [[Tree (data structure)|tree-structure]]) calculation of interpolant. A method for a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] case is offered Pouderox J. et al.<ref>Pouderox, J. et al.
