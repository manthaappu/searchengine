The '''Trusted Computing Group''' ('''TCG'''), successor to the '''Trusted Computing Platform Alliance''' ('''TCPA'''), is an initiative started by [[AMD]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[IBM]], [[Intel]], and [[Microsoft]] to implement [[Trusted Computing]]. Many others followed.

== Overview ==
TCG's original goal was the development of a [[Trusted Platform Module]] (TPM), a [[semiconductor intellectual property core]] or [[integrated circuit]] that conforms to the trusted platform module specification put forward by the Trusted Computing Group and is to be included with computers to enable [[trusted computing]] features. TCG-compliant functionality has since been integrated directly into certain{{Specify|date=May 2008}} mass-market [[chipset]]s. 

TCG also recently released the first version of their [[Trusted Network Connect]] ("TNC") protocol specification, based on the principles of [[AAA protocol|AAA]], but adding the ability to authorize network clients on the basis of [[computer hardware|hardware]] configuration, [[BIOS]], [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]] version, and which updates that have been applied to the [[Operating system|OS]] and [[anti-virus software]], etc.<ref>https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/downloads/specifications/TNC_Architecture_v1_0_r4.pdf</ref>

In 2009, TCG released a set of specifications that describe the protocol to communicate with [[Hardware-based full disk encryption|self encrypting disk drives]]. The TCG Storage Work Group (SWG) Storage Core Architecture Specification describes in detail how to implement and utilize trust and security services on [[storage device]]s. Security Subsystem Class (SSC) Specifications describe the requirements for specific classes of devices; specifically, the Enterprise SSC defines minimum requirements for Data Center and Server Class devices while the Opal SSC defines minimum requirements for client devices.

The owner of a TPM-enabled system has complete control over what software does and does not run on their system <ref>[https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/faq/TPMFAQ/ The Trusted Platform Module FAQ] from the TCG website</ref> This does include the possibility that a system owner would choose to run a version of an [[operating system]] (OS) that refuses to load unsigned or unlicensed software, but those restrictions would have to be enforced by the operating system and not by the TCG technology. What a TPM does provide in this case is the capability for the OS to lock software to specific machine configurations, meaning that "hacked" versions of the OS designed to get around these restrictions would not work.  While there is legitimate concern that OS vendors could use these capabilities to restrict what software would load under their OS (hurting small software companies or [[open source]]/[[shareware]]/[[freeware]] providers, and causing [[vendor lock-in]] for some data formats), no OS vendor has yet suggested that this is planned.{{When|date=October 2010}} Furthermore, since restrictions would be a function of the operating system, TPMs could in no way restrict alternative operating systems from running, including free or open source operating systems. There are several projects which are experimenting with TPM support in free operating systems; examples of such projects include a TPM device driver for Linux<ref>[http://tpmdd.sourceforge.net Linux TPM Device Driver<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, an open source implementation of the TCG's Trusted Software Stack called TrouSerS<ref>[http://trousers.sourceforge.net TrouSerS - The open-source TCG Software Stack<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (recently also ported to [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]]<ref>[http://security.polito.it/tc/trouserswin TrouSerS for Windows<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>), a [[Java]] interface to TPM capabilities called TPM/J<ref>[http://projects.csail.mit.edu/tc/tpmj/ TPM/J Java-based API for the Trusted Platform Module (TPM)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, and a TPM-supporting version of the [[GNU GRUB|Grub]] [[bootloader]] called TrustedGrub.<ref>[http://sourceforge.net/projects/trustedgrub/ SourceForge.net: TrustedGRUB<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The TPM 1.1 specification envisioned a standard PC platform equipped with a TPM chip. In this scenario, the TPM chip can serve as a hardware key storage. Additionally, it can keep track of so-called measurements of the platform (i.e. hashes of various software) and be able to produce signed statements about the running software chain. Particularly the latter mode of operation proved unfeasible in practice, since the amount of software that has to be measured and trusted is very large; it includes (in addition to the system firmware) the operating system, [[Device driver|drivers]] and application programs. Therefore, numerous other TPM-related projects are in progress, the purpose of which is to make it possible to launch and measure a trusted subenvironment from within an untrusted environment. The TPM specification 1.2 has been enhanced to accommodate this mode of operation. Additionally, hardware changes are required in the [[CPU]] and chipset (note that this should not be confused with the inclusion of TPM functionality into the chipset even though this is a possibility too). [[Intel]]'s approach is called [[Trusted Execution Technology]] (TXT). Many of Intel's Core 2 Duo CPUs are advertised to support these extensions. However, chipset support is required for the extensions to be operational. Currently, Intel's chipset Q35 Express supports TXT. In addition to chipset support, the [[mainboard]] must also feature a TPM 1.2 chip. Intel currently advertises DQ35MP and DQ35JO as being compliant with the technology. The first application of the technology will be a set of manageability enhancements under the brand name vPro.
[[AMD]]'s platform is called Secure Execution Mode.<ref>[http://conference.digitalidworld.com/2004/attendees/slides/1027_1700_E1.pdf AMD Platform for Trustworthy Computing<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 2002-2003, Microsoft announced an initiative called [[Next-Generation Secure Computing Base]] (formerly Palladium). This was basically a vision of how a TPM 1.2 chip, CPU, chipset and software could provide an environment and a software ecosystem in which trusted applications (launched from within "regular" Windows) could be developed. Intel's TXT and AMD's SEM can be seen as realizations of the hardware side of the NGSCB vision. Owing to significant difficulties in creating a working implementation that third-party developers were interested in using and in unavailability of the enhancements to CPU and chipset, NGSCB was not included with Microsoft [[Windows Vista]]. Instead, Vista ships with a few technologies that can make use of a subset of the functions of the TPM chip (but not of Intel's TXT or AMD's SEM), such as [[BitLocker Drive Encryption]], and a new version of the [[Cryptographic Application Programming Interface|Microsoft Cryptography API]].<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/windowsvista/library/c61f2a12-8ae6-4957-b031-97b4d762cf31.mspx Windows Vista Technical Library Roadmap<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Criticism==
{{more2|Trusted Computing#Criticism}}
The group has faced widescale opposition from the [[free software]] community on the grounds that the technology they are developing  has a negative impact on the users' privacy and can create customer [[vendor lock-in|lock-in]], especially if it is used to create [[Digital rights management|DRM]] applications. It has received criticism from the [[GNU|GNU/Linux]] and [[FreeBSD]] communities, as well as the software development community in general. Significant backlash amongst the Trusted Computing Group was present during [[Richard Stallman]]'s speech at the [[Hackers on Planet Earth]] conference in July 2006, in New York. Richard Stallman and the [[Free Software Foundation]] have also criticized the group publicly in other speeches. The criticism calls Trusted Computing "Treacherous Computing" instead and warns that vendors can lock out software that is not officially signed by specific vendors, rendering it unusable.<ref>[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/can-you-trust.html "Can you trust your computer?"] by [[Richard Stallman]], from the [[GNU Project]] website</ref>

Privacy concerns with the TCG revolve around the fact that each TPM has a unique keypair, called the "endorsement key", that identifies the platform.  In initial versions of the TPM (version 1.1), the TCG addressed privacy concerns by suggesting the use of a "Privacy [[Certificate authority|CA]]" that could certify [[pseudonymity|pseudonymous]] machine credentials.  By having separate credentials for interacting with different parties, actions could not be linked, and so some level of privacy is provided.  However, this requires trust in the Privacy CA, who could still link pseudonyms to the common, identifying machine credential.  Since this left unresolved privacy concerns, version 1.2 of the TPM specification introduced "[[Direct anonymous attestation]]": a protocol based on the idea of a [[zero-knowledge proof]] which allows a TPM user to receive a certification in such a way that the Privacy CA would not be able to link requests to a single user or platform, while still being able to identify rogue TPMs.

Privacy concerns for TPM were heightened when [[Christopher Tarnovsky]] presented methods to access and compromise the Infineon TPM non-volatile memory capacity which contains user data at [[Black Hat]] 2010.<ref>[https://media.blackhat.com/bh-dc-10/video/Tarnovsky_Chris/BlackHat-DC-2010-Tarnovsky-DeconstructProcessor-video.m4v] by Christopher Tarnovsky from Flylogic.net</ref>

==ISO standardization ==
Efforts to have the TCG specifications standardized by ISO was active for a first part in October 2007. Member states of the ISO/DIS JTC1 were expected to send their opinion to ISO by July 24, 2008. On May 18, 2009, TCG managed to achieve standardization for their TPM specifications:
* ISO/IEC 11889-1:2009 Information technology—Trusted Platform Module—Part 1: Overview
* ISO/IEC 11889-2:2009 Information technology—Trusted Platform Module—Part 2: Design principles
* ISO/IEC 11889-3:2009 Information technology—Trusted Platform Module—Part 3: Structures
* ISO/IEC 11889-4:2009 Information technology—Trusted Platform Module—Part 4: Commands
