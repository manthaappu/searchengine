==History==
Legit Reviews was founded in the summer of 2002 by Nathan Kirsch to give computer users around the world an inside view into the current computer industry and a peek into what the future holds for all of us. After running and starting a successful series of LAN parties at [[Truman State University]] and co-founding the school-charted TSU Counter-Strike League (later renamed Computer Gaming Association), he became aware that many gamers did not fully understand what computer hardware was best for gaming and that a large number of the online reviews were biased. As he already worked very closely with the companies who design and create the products, since many sponsored the LAN parties, he began doing independent product reviews.<ref>[http://www.legitreviews.com/about.php], 'Legit Reviews About Us'.
