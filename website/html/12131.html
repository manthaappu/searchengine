In [[linguistics]], '''endophora''' is a term that means an expression  which refers to something [[intralinguistic]], i.e. '''in the same text'''. 

For example, in the sentences "I saw Sally yesterday. She was lying on the beach", "she" is an ''endophoric'' expression because it refers to something already mentioned in the text, i.e. "Sally". 

By contrast, "She was lying on the beach," if it appeared by itself, has an ''exophoric'' expression; "she" refers to something that the reader is not told about. That is to say, there is not enough information in the text to independently determine to whom "she" refers. It can refer to someone the speaker assumes his audience has prior knowledge of or it can refer to a person he is showing to his listeners. Without further information, in other words, there is no way of knowing the exact meaning of an exophoric term. 

Endophora can be broken into three subcategories: [[cataphora]], [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]] and [[self-reference]].
