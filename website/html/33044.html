'''SUDAAN''' is a statistical software package for the analysis of [[correlation|correlated data]], including correlated data encountered in complex [[sample survey]]s.  SUDAAN originated in 1972 at [http://www.rti.org RTI International] (the trade name of Research Triangle Institute). 
==Current version==
[http://www.rti.org/sudaan/ SUDAAN Release 10.0], released in August 2008, is a single program consisting of a family of eleven [[Analytic and enumerative statistical studies|analytic procedures]] used to analyze data from complex [[sample survey]]s and other observational and experimental studies involving repeated measures and [[Data clustering|cluster-correlated data]].  It provides estimates that account for complex design features of a study, including:
* unequally [[Weight function|weighted]] or unweighted data
* [[Stratified sampling|stratification]]
* with- or without-replacement designs
* multistage and cluster designs
* repeated measures
* general cluster-correlation (e.g., correlation due to multiple measures taken from patients)
* multiply imputed analysis variables

==Example fields of use==
SUDAAN enables the analysis of correlated data encountered in various fields of statistical research, including: 
* survey research ([[Random_digit_dialing|RDD]]/telephone studies, area sample designs, cluster and [[Stratified sampling|stratified designs]], list sampling)
* [[clinical trial]]s (safety and efficacy data from multiple sites in multisite trials) 
* group or community randomized trials 
* observations on related family members 
* [[toxicology]] (observations on littermates) 
* multiple subjects within a cluster (patients within physician clinics or students within school classrooms) 
* [[social statistics]] 
* health outcomes research 
* longitudinal data analyses 
* repeated measures.

==Strengths==
SUDAAN's strength lies it its ability to compute [[Standard error (statistics)|standard error]]s of ratio estimates, [[mean]]s, totals, [[Regression analysis|regression coefficients]], and other statistics in accordance with the sample design, greatly increasing the accuracy and validity of results. Many, if not most, [[data set]]s require attention to [[correlation]] and [[weighting]], but few statistical software packages offer the user the opportunity to specify how data are correlated and weighted.  For many years, SUDAAN remained the only broadly applicable software for analysis of correlated and weighted data. Currently Mplus offers similar capacities for a much broader set of models.

Currently, all nine of SUDAAN's  analytic procedures offer three popular robust variance estimation methods:
* [[Taylor series]] linearization (generalized estimation equations [GEE] for regression models)
* [[Resampling (statistics)|jackknife]] (with or without user-specified replicate weights)
* balance repeated replication (BRR).

==Operating systems==
SUDAAN functions on many computing platforms—including Windows 95/98/ME or NT/2000/XP, DOS, SUN/Solaris, and LINUX—either as a stand-alone statistical software tool, or in SAS-callable format (SAS Version 8 or 9).
