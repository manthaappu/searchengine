In [[combinatorics]], a '''combinatorial class''' (or simply '''class''') is an [[equivalence class]] of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] that have the same counting sequence.  Although the elements of these equivalent sets may have very different definitions and semantics, combinatorics is concerned only with the number of elements of a given size.  Therefore, knowledge about one set in the class can be applied directly to other sets in the class.

For example, the set of [[triangulation]]s of [[polygon]]s is ''combinatorially [[isomorphic]]'' to the set of general [[rooted plane tree]]s.  Although these sets certainly describe different things, they have the same counting sequence, namely the [[Catalan number]]s.
