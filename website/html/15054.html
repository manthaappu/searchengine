'''Genitive connector''' is a term used in grammatical contexts of several languages and especially the [[Bantu languages]] to denote special word categories. It is used in formation of [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] terms through formation of conjunctions. Nouns can be modified by other nouns or other categories.
There is prototypically a head word that comes before the connector and another one following. Long terms can therefore be achieved through the use of these genitive connectors. Commonly used connectors in [[Swahili language|Swahili]] take the form -a. Examples from selected bantu languages include.

*Example in Swahili wa > Mkojo wa mtoto ; ya > nywele ya mama; cha> kidole cha gumba, la> Titi la mama etc

*Example in [[Gikuyu]]: wa> Muti wa baba; ya>miti ya haaro; ga> gakunia gakwa etc

*Example of a chain formed through compounding by conjunction by use of genitive connector: Mayai ya kuku wa kienyeji.
