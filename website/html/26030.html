<html> <head> <title>Neil Weste</title></head><body>'''Neil H. E. Weste''' (born 1951), is an Australian inventor and engineer, noted for having designed a 2-chip wireless LAN implementation and for authoring the textbook ''Principles of CMOS VLSI Design''. He has worked in many aspects of integrated-circuit design and was a co-founder of Radiata Communications.

==Life==
Weste grew up in the [[Riverland|Riverland Region]] of South Australia. He received a BSc in Physics in 1974, a BE in 1976, and a Ph.D. in 1978, all from the [[University of Adelaide]].
Weste worked at a number American technology firms, including [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]], Microelectronics Center of North Carolina, [[Symbolics]], Agile Systems, and TLW.
He was also at [[Duke University]] and the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]].

In 1995 he returned to Australia as a professor at [[Macquarie University]].  In 1997 he started Radiata Communications with David Skellern where the first 802.11a chip was designed.  The company was acquired by [[Cisco Systems]] in 2001.<ref>http://www.tvp.com.au/portfolio/news/Emotiv-PR-March2007.pdf</ref>
After the acquisition, Weste remained with Cisco for 2 years and then founded NHEW R&D, a technology-investment and consulting firm that he continues to manage.

==Inventions==
Weste has 14 U.S. patents to his name, including a number of methods for doing wireless communication in CMOS integrated circuits.

In 1998, Weste produced a CMOS chipset for the IEEE 802.11a wireless LAN.
He did the conception, managed the project, and participated in the design.

==CMOS Textbook==

Weste's textbook, ''Principles of CMOS VLSI Design'' (initially coauthored with [[Kamran Eshraghian]]<ref>Weste, Neil and Eshraghian, Kamran, ''Principles of CMOS VLSI Design - A Systems Perspective,''  Addison-Wesley, MA, 1985</ref><ref>Weste, Neil and Eshraghian, Kamran, ''Principles of CMOS VLSI Design - A Systems Perspective, 2nd Edition''  Addison-Wesley, MA, 1993</ref> but now coauthored with David Harris<ref>Weste, Neil and Harris, David, ''Principles of CMOS VLSI Design - A Circuits and Systems Perspective, 3rd Edition''  Addison-Wesley, MA,  May 2004</ref><ref>Weste, Neil and Harris, David, ''Principles of CMOS VLSI Design - A Circuits and Systems Perspective, 4th Edition''  Addison-Wesley, MA, 2010</ref>) is a standard textbook in integrated-circuit design courses.
It has been translated into Japanese, Greek, and Chinese.
