'''CFD-DEM''' model is suitable for the modelling or simulation of [[fluid]]-solids or fluid-particles systems. In the CFD-DEM, the motion of discrete solids or particles phase is obtained by the Discrete Element Method (DEM) which applies Newton's laws of motion to every particle, while the flow of continuum fluid is described by the local averaged Navierâ€“Stokes equations that can be solved using the traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach. The interactions between the fluid phase and solids phase is modeled by use of [[Newton's third law]].

The direct incorporation of CFD into DPM to study the gas fluidization process so far has been
attempted by Tsuji et al.<ref>Tsuji, Y., Kawaguchi, T. and Tanaka, T. (1993) Discrete particle simulation of two-dimensional fluidized bed. Powder Technol. 77, 79-87.,</ref><ref>Tsuji, Y., Tanaka, T. and Ishida, T. (1992) Lagrangian numerical simulation of plug flow of cohesionless particles in a horizontal pipe. Powder Technol. 71, 239-250.</ref> and most recently by Hoomans et al.<ref>Hoomans, B. P. B., Kuipers, J. A. M., Briels, W. J. and Van Swaaij, W. P. M. (1996) Discrete particle simulation
of bubble and slug formation in a two-dimensional gas-fluidised bed: a hard-sphere approach. Chem. Engng Sci. 51, 99-118.</ref>.
