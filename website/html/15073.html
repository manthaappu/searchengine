Segen (1992). Dictionary of modern medicine. p.246. ISBN 1850703213 [http://books.google.com/books?id=FbSlyyshjOoC&pg=PA246&lpg=PA246&dq=dictionary+%22gentleman+scientist%22&source=bl&ots=juVfcRDdrx&sig=8VsuQLxjLd0kks-vQphH0W5ffOY&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result]</ref>  The term arose in post-Renaissance Europe but became less common in the 20th century as government and private funding increased.

==History==
Self-funding scientists were more common in the days before large-scale [[government]] funding was available, up to the [[Victorian era]], especially in [[England]].  Many early fellows of the [[Royal Society]] in [[London]] were gentleman scientists.  The position significantly reduced during the 20th century as other forms of science funding increased.

==Benefits and drawbacks==
Self-funding has the disadvantage that funds may be more restricted, however it has the advantage of obviating a number of inconveniences such as teaching obligations, administrative duties, and writing grant requests to funding bodies.  It also permits the scientist to have greater control over research directions, as funding bodies direct grants towards interests that may not coincide with that of the scientist.  Peer-review is sidestepped.<ref>{{doi|10.1126/science.279.5348.178}}</ref> Furthermore, [[intellectual property]] of the inventions belongs to the inventor and not the employer.

==Modern-day gentleman scientists==
Modern-day equivalents are [[Stephen Wolfram]] who funds his own independent research through the sale of [[Mathematica]] software, [[Craig Venter]], [[Julian Barbour]], [[Aubrey de Grey]], [[Barrington Moore]], [[Susan Blackmore]]<ref>http://www.moreintelligentlife.com/story/solo-science</ref> and [[James Lovelock]]<ref>http://www.moreintelligentlife.com/story/solo-science.</ref>

Speaking of [[Peter D. Mitchell]], Peter Rich said "I think he would have found it difficult to have gotten funding because his ideas were rather radical."<ref>{{doi|10.1126/science.279.5348.178}}</ref>  Mitchell went on to win the Nobel prize for chemistry in 1978.  Chemist [[Luis Leloir]] funded the research institute he headed, the Institute for Biochemical Research, in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  He won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1970.
