'''''In the Name of Science''''' is a book written by [[Harold L. Nieburg]] in [[1966]] concerning the [[political]] uses of [[science]]. It focuses on [[United States|American]] [[Defense (military)|defense]] spending on science and the U.S. [[military-industrial complex]], and was one of the first books to discuss this issue at length. 

A summary appears in the [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] 22 (March 1966), pp.20-24, as ''R and D in the Contract State: Throwing Away the Yardstick'' in a review by [[Bernard L. Spinrad]].
