'''DVD Player''' (also known as dvdplay.exe) was a [[computer program]] included in some versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] that [[autoplay]]s a [[DVD]] disc if a supported [[MPEG-2]] [[codec|decoder]] was present. DVD Player was introduced in [[Windows 98]]<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/win98/reskit/part2/wrkc12.mspx?mfr=true Windows 98 Multimedia]</ref>.

When the DVD Player is launched, it searches all local drives in alphabetical order, starting with the C drive, looking for a Video_TS folder. When this folder is located, the data file within it is loaded, and video streaming begins. If this folder exists on a drive that comes before the DVD drive, the player will try to play the data in the first folder it finds.

In Windows 98/Me and Windows 2000, DVDPlay.exe only plays DVDs if a hardware-based decoder is present. In [[Windows Me]], DVDPlay supports software-based decoders.<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/272985 Description of DVD Player in Windows Millennium Edition]</ref>. With Windows XP, DVDPlay.exe was dropped as a separate application in favor of DVD functionality introduced into [[Windows Media Player]]. While the DVDPlay executable still resides in %Windir%system32, it simply executes [[Windows Media Player]], but the Windows 2000 version can run on Windows XP/Vista/7 (With bugs).
