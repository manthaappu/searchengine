'''Ikivo Animator''' is an application that enables designing animated content for mobile devices. It integrates with [[Adobe Creative Suite]], providing efficient access to the animation toolset within the application. Because Ikivo Animator has a similar look and feel to todayâ€™s leading design tools (such as [[Adobe Illustrator]]), users are able to quickly start using it to develop their own professional [[SVG]] content. Contents include [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]], mobile UI design, mobile web publishing and handset personalisation.
