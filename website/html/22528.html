'''Logic Control''' is a control surface originally designed by [[Emagic]] in cooperation with [[Mackie]]. 

==History==
Logic Control was designed by Emagic as a dedicated control surface for their [[Logic Pro|Logic]] [[Digital Audio Workstation]] [[software]].  It was manufactured by Mackie, but distributed by Emagic.

About 6 months later, Mackie introduced a physically identical product called "Mackie Control" which included support for most major DAW applications, but not Logic.  The Emagic Logic Control was still available and would only work with Logic.

Later, Mackie Control's firmware was revised to include compatibility with Logic.  The name of the Mackie Control was changed to "Mackie Control Universal" (MCU).  Out of the box, MCU included Lexan overlays with different button legends to support control of other DAWs such as Pro Tools and Cubase.

==Description==
Logic Control (and now MCU) allows to control almost all of Logic's parameters with its hardware faders, buttons and "V-Pots" (knobs). Its touch-sensitive, motorized faders react to track automation. All transport functions and wheel scrubbing are also available. The unit also controls plug-in parameters. Visual feedback including current parameters being edited, parameter values, project location (SMPTE time code or bars/beats/divisions/ticks) are conveyed by a two-line LCD and red 7-segment led displays.
