<html> <head> <title>Self service software</title></head><body>'''Self service software''' is a subset within the [[knowledge management]] software category and which contains a range of software that specializes in the way information, process rules and logic are collected, framed within an organized taxonomy, and accessed through decision support interviews. Self-service software allows people to secure answers to their inquiries and/or needs through an automated interview fashion instead of traditional search approaches.  

== Self-service software functionality ==
Self-service software allows authors (typically subject-matter experts) to readily automate the deployment of, the timeliness of, and compliance around a variety of processes with which they are involved in communicating without having to physically address the questions, needs, and solicitations of end-users who are inquiring about the particular process being automated. 

Self-service software primarily addresses [[closed-loop]] inquiries whereby the author emulates a variety of known (finite) questions and related (known) responses on hand or required steps that must be addressed to derive and deliver a final answer or directive.  Often the author using such software codifies such known processes and steps then generates (publishes) end-user facing applications which can encompass a variety of code bases and platforms.

Self-service software is sometimes referred to decision support software and even expert systems.  It is typically categorized as a subtopic within the [[knowledge management software]] category.  Self service software allows individuals and companies alike to tailor and address customer support, technical support and employee support inquiries and needs in an on-demand fashion where the person with a question (need) can interface with the author's generated application via a computer, a handheld device, a kiosk, register, or other machine type to secure their answers as if they were directly interacting (talking to) the author.
