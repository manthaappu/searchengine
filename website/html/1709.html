'''Amiram Harten''' (1947 &ndash; 1994) was an [[United States|American]]/[[Israelis|Israeli]] [[applied mathematician]]. Harten made fundamental contribution to the development of [[high-resolution scheme]]s for the solution of [[hyperbolic partial differential equations]]. Among other contributions, he developed the [[total variation diminishing]] scheme, which gives an oscillation free solution for flow with [[Shock wave|shocks]].<ref>{{Citation

In 1980s, Harten along with [[Bj√∂rn Engquist]], [[Stanley Osher]], and Sukumar R. Chakravarthy developed the essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) schemes. The article on ENO, titled, ''Uniformly High Order Accurate Essentially Non-oscillatory Schemes, III'' was published in [[Journal of Computational Physics]], in 1987 <ref>{{Citation
