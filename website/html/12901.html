<html> <head> <title>Extended Affix Grammar</title></head><body>In [[computer science]], '''Extended [[Affix]] Grammar'''s ('''EAG''') are a [[formal grammar]] formalism for describing the [[Context-free_grammar | context free]] and [[Context-sensitive_grammar | context sensitive]] [[syntax]] of language, both [[natural language]] and [[programming language]]s.

EAGs are a member of the family of [[two-level grammar]]s; more specifically, a restriction of [[Van Wijngaarden grammar]]s with the specific purpose of making [[parsing]] feasible.

Like Van Wijngaarden grammars, EAGs have ''hyperrules'' that form a [[context-free grammar]] except in that their nonterminals may have arguments, known as ''affixes'', the possible values of which are supplied by another context-free grammar, the ''metarules''.

EAGs introduced and studied by [[David Watt (computer scientist)|D.A. Watt]] in 1974; recognizers were developed at the University of Nijmegen between 1985 and 1995.  The EAG compiler developed there will generate either a recogniser, a transducer, a translator, or a syntax directed editor for a language described in the EAG formalism.  The formalism is quite similar to [[Prolog]], to the extent that it borrowed its [[cut operator]].

EAGs have been used to write grammars of natural languages such as English, Spanish, and Hungarian.  The aim was to verify the grammars by making them parse corpora of text ([[corpus linguistics]]); hence, parsing had to be sufficiently practical.  However, the [[parse tree explosion]] problem that ambiguities in natural language tend to produce in this type of approach is worsened for EAGs because each choice of affix value may produce a separate parse, even when several different values are equivalent.  The remedy proposed was to switch to the much simpler Affix Grammar over a [[Finite]] [[Lattice]]s ([[Affix grammar over a finite lattice|AGFL]]) instead, in which metagrammars can only produce simple finite languages.<ref>[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.53.5264 ''Affix grammars for natural languages'', by C.H.A.
