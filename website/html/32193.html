'''Robert Goldman''' (born 1959 in [[Rochester, New York]]) is an American inventor responsible for pioneering technology in [[digital media]] as well as [[cancer treatment]].

==Digital Audio Download Patents==
In the early 1990s, Goldman developed and patented technologies around digital audio systems wherein music could be stored, browsed, downloaded and purchased from digital databases.<ref>Patent No. 5,809,246.  [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=3&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=music.TI.&s2=goldman.INNM.&OS=TTL/music+AND+IN/goldman&RS=TTL/music+AND+IN/goldman].

May 23, 2000</ref><ref>Patent No. 6,295,555.  [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=%22Goldman,+Robert%22.ASNM.&s2=digital&OS=AN/].  September 25, 2001</ref> These technologies are a way for enabling digital [[music downloads]] on web sites. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In 1999 Goldman launched the company GetMedia, Inc. to support this technology, and subsequently sold his intellectual property to [[Intellectual Ventures]], an IP licensing company, for an undisclosed sum.<ref>InternetNews  [http://www.internetnews.com/ec-news/article.php/148521/GetMedia+Partners+with+WebRadiocom+.htm GetMedia Partners with WebRadio.com].

==Cancer Treatment Catheter==
In 2002, Goldman launched the company, Vascular Designs, where he developed an innovative medical device, the IsoFlow™ infusion [[catheter]]. An important application for the IsoFlow catheter may be in the treatment of [[cancer]].<ref>Duan, Mary (October 30, 2009).  [http://sanjose.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2009/11/02/story4.html IsoFlow device could aid in cancer treatments].  Publisher: Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal</ref> Goldman invented the device in an attempt to save his own sister, Amy Cohen, from [[colon cancer]].<ref>Cassidy, Mike (November 23, 2009).  [http://www.mercurynews.com/mike-cassidy/ci_13772885 Silicon Valley inventor seeks next big thing in cancer fight].  Publisher: San Jose Mercury News</ref> The IsoFlow is a dual balloon catheter designed to isolate a specific treatment region within the body from blood flow. It allows the infusion of fluids into the region and the [[perfusion]] of blood past the region to keep the blood flow intact during treatment. One of the many unique features of the IsoFlow infusion catheter is the ability to deliver medications sideways while using pressure to push the medications into the targeted area. The IsoFlow catheter is inserted over a guide wire for precise positioning within a patient’s body. Once in place, medication is infused and isolated when both of the catheter’s balloons are simultaneously inflated using fluid via a single inflation lumen.<ref>Patent No. 7,645,259.  [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=7645259.PN.&OS=PN/7645259&RS=PN/7645259].  January 12, 2010</ref>

Vascular Designs secured [[FDA]] 510(k) marketing clearance for its IsoFlow catheter as a Class II [[medical device]] in May 2009.<ref>The Medical News  [http://www.news-medical.net/news/20090903/IsoFlow-Infusion-catheter-allows-physicians-to-increase-drug-concentrations-at-targeted-sites.aspx IsoFlow Infusion catheter allows physicians to increase drug concentrations at targeted sites]. September 3, 2009</ref> With the IsoFlow catheter’s design, medications can be pushed into areas that could not previously be treated directly. According to numerous studies, this type of approach to delivery can increase drug concentrations at targeted sites while reducing systemic exposure, potentially improving treatment outcomes.<ref>Collins, JM (1984).
