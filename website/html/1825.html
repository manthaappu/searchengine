==Synopsis==
===Magic bullets===
[[File:SSDI-SSI-1987-2003.png|thumb|left|alt=Chart showing increase (in red) over baseline (in blue) between 1987 and 2003|Number of Americans who received [[Social Security Disability Insurance|SSDI]] and [[Supplemental Security Income|SSI]] for mental disability in 1987 (blue) when [[Eli Lilly and Company]] introduced the antidepressive drug [[Prozac]], compared to 2003 (red).]]
Whitaker says that the drugs given to people with [[schizophrenia]] - [[antipsychotic]]s, and to people with [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] - [[antidepressant]]s, were developed during a period of growth for the pharmaceutical industry, following that industry's development of "magic bullets" that treat people with, for example, [[diabetes]]. The public wanted to believe in "wonder drugs". Unfortunately, according to Whitaker the reasons the pharmaceutical companies gave for the drugs working (too much or too little [[dopamine]] or [[serotonin]] in the patient's brain) have not proved to be true.<ref>Whitaker, part two, chapters 3, 4 and 5</ref>

===Psychiatric drugs===
While Whitaker is pro-drug, he believes that medication must be used in a "selective, cautious manner. It should be understood that they’re not fixing any chemical imbalances. And honestly, they should be used on a short-term basis."<ref name=Lipinski>{{cite news|author=Lipinski, Jed|title="Anatomy of an Epidemic": The hidden damage of psychiatric drugs|date=April 27, 2010|url=http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2010/04/27/interview_whitaker_anatomy_of_an_epidemic|work=Salon|publisher=Salon Media|accessdate=October 9, 2010}}</ref> He finds the idea that the "invention of [the antipsychotic] [[Chlorpromazine|Thorazine]]" emptied asylums to be a myth.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Whitaker, Robert|title=Anatomy of an Epidemic: Psychiatric Drugs and the Astonishing Rise of Mental Illness in America|url=http://www.cchr.org/sites/default/files/Anatomy_of_an_Epidemic_Psychiatric_Drugs_Rise_of_Mental_Illness.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Ethical Human Psychology and Psychiatry|publisher=Springer|page=1|issue=I|volume=7|date=Spring 2005|accessdate=October 11, 2010}}</ref> He traces the effects of what looks like an [[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] epidemic<ref>Whitaker, p. 208</ref>—unfortunately, the drugs that patients receive can perturb their normal brain function.<ref name="Whitaker, p. 210">Whitaker, p. 210</ref>

{{cquote|"Psychiatrists saw that the drugs  'worked'. They saw that antipsychotics knocked down psychotic symptoms, and they observed that patients who stopped taking their medications regularly became psychotic again."<ref>Whitaker, p. 108</ref>}}

In contrast, Whitaker can only offer as a "solution" the style of care documented by professor Jaakko Seikkula at Keropudas Hospital in [[Tornio]] in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] where drugs are given to patients only on a limited basis—with good outcomes. According to Whitaker, the district has the lowest per capita spending on mental health of all health districts in [[Finland]].<ref>Whitaker, p. 343</ref>

===Children===
Whitaker sees that children are vulnerable to being prescribed a ''lifetime'' of drugs. As the author says, a psychiatrist and parents may give a child a "cocktail" to force him or her to behave. Then when this child grows up to eighteen, Whitaker says he or she becomes a disabled adult.<ref>Whitaker, chapters 11 and 12</ref>

==Review of data and statistics==
Over the year and a half he spent researching this book,<ref name="Whitaker, p. 210"/> Whitaker thoroughly reviewed U.S. government statistics and evidence in the scientific literature.<ref>[[Joseph Mercola]] says Whitaker has done his homework, and spent thousands (or tens of thousands) of hours on research in {{cite video|title=Dr. Mercola and Robert Whitaker Discuss Mental Health (part 3 of 7)|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx2HiLyJ0-0|date=April 29, 2010|publisher=Joseph Mercola via YouTube|time=1:50|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}</ref> He maintains a website where the scientific studies are linked.<ref>{{cite web|author=Whitaker, Robert|title=Mad in America|url=http://www.madinamerica.com/|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}</ref>

==Reception and media coverage==
{{expand section|what the reviews said|date=November 2010}}
Whitaker, who was a finalist for the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service and is an award-winning<ref>{{cite news|author=Jacobs, Andrew|title=20 Journalists, Including 2 Times Writers, Win Polk Awards|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/10/nyregion/20-journalists-including-2-times-writers-win-polk-awards.html|date=March 10, 1999|work=The New York Times|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}</ref> author and a former director of publications for the [[Harvard Medical School]], did interviews with ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'' and ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' during the release of this book.<ref name=Lipinski /><ref>{{cite news|author=Weintraub, Karen|title=The downside of meds|url=http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2010/05/10/robert_whitaker_talks_about_the_downside_to_psychiatric_meds/|date=May 10, 2010|work=The Boston Globe|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=October 9, 2010}}</ref> He also did a book tour, and  he spoke for an hour and a half on [[C-SPAN]] where there is an archived video.<ref>{{cite video|people=Robert Whitaker|title=Anatomy of an Epidemic|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/293935-1|date=April 22, 2010|publisher=C-SPAN|accessdate=October 9, 2010}}</ref> Still, in his book he explains that this story was never told in mainstream newspapers.<ref>Whitaker, pp. 309–310</ref> For example, Whitaker says a study of long-term outcomes for people with schizophrenia done by Martin Harrow in 2007 (which Whitaker thinks is the best work ever done on the subject in the U.S.) was never in a [[National Institute of Mental Health]] press release and thus never reached reporters at U.S. newspapers.<ref>Whitaker, p. 310</ref>

As of October 2010, the only negative review of the book, written by sleep researcher Dennis Rosen for ''The Boston Globe'', asks for a review of data, and devotes a paragraph to [[Thabo Mbeki]] and [[AIDS denialism]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Rosen, Dennis|title=Tying the rise in mental illness to drugs used in its treatment|date=April 14, 2010|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2010/04/14/tying_the_rise_in_mental_illness_to_drugs_used_in_its_treatment/|work=The Boston Globe|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=October 9, 2010}}</ref> Other reviews were in ''[[New Scientist]]'',<ref name=Burch /> ''[[Waterloo Region Record|The Record]]'',<ref name=Good /> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine,<ref name=Fitzpatrick /> and ''[[Salon.com|Salon]].<ref name=Lipinski />

==Controversy==
Whitaker, who had been an invited keynote speaker, was "uninvited" from the Alternatives 2010 conference. The event has been funded since 1985 by the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]. [[MindFreedom International]] started an online campaign and many people wrote to [[Barack Obama|President Obama]]. Whitaker was reinvited and delivered his address.<ref>{{cite web|title=What About Bob? USA Mental Health Agency May Cancel Journalist Robert B.
