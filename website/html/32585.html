'''RunGEM''' is a freeware component of the commercial modelling package, [[Gempack]], written at [[Monash University]].

It is mainly used for solving (ie, simulating with) [[computable general equilibrium]] (CGE) models. It does not allow a user to change a model's specification or to create a new model.
