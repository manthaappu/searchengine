'''Case modification''' (commonly referred to as '''case modding''' where an individual project is referred to as a '''case mod''' ) is the  modification of a [[Computer case|computer chassis]] (often just referred to as the [[Computer case|case]]), or a [[video game console]] chassis. Modifying a computer case in any non-standard way is considered a case mod.  Many people, particularly [[Computer hardware|hardware]] enthusiasts, use case mods to illustrate a computer's power (by showing off the internal hardware), and also for [[aesthetic]] purposes. Cases may also be modified to improve a computer's performance.

==History==
When personal computers first became available to the public, the majority were produced in simple, beige-colored cases. This design is sometimes referred to as a ''[[beige box]]''. Although this served the purpose of containing the components of the [[personal computer]], many users saw their computers as "tacky" or "dull", and some began modifying their existing chassis, or building their own from scratch.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

A new market for third-party computer cases and accessories began to develop, and today cases are available in a wide variety of colors and styles. Today the business of "modding" computers and their cases is a hugely profitable endeavor, and modding competitions are not uncommon.<ref>{{cite web

==Common modifications==

[[Image:PC case mod lights.jpg|left|thumbnail|A computer modded with lights]]
*'''Window mods''': This refers to a window placed within one of the panels of a computer case.<ref>{{cite web

*'''Lighting mods''': A lighting mod refers to lighting in or on the computer cases.<ref>{{cite web

| title = Case Mod Supplies
| url = http://www.xpcgear.com/casemodding.html
| accessdate = 2009-05-07

}}</ref>, or [[electroluminescent]] wire lights. The lights are sometimes paired with sound controllers that make the lights pulse in time to sound. CCLs come in long tubes and generally produce a little bit of heat. LEDs come in many sizes and forms, most often seen in bars similar to CCLs or within fans, called LED fans. Electroluminescent wire, which takes the form of a small light rope, is often embedded in cables such as [[Serial ATA|SATA]] cables. 

Lighting modifications are often paired with window mods to help show off the components. Although not as common, they are also placed in cases without a window, allowing light to shine through any holes or gaps of the case which add subtle aesthetics to an otherwise plain looking case; this is also done for practical purposes such as to make a computer double as a night light.  Internal components, such power supplies, are often available with built in lighting.  

*'''Cooling mods''': There are many modifications that can fall into this category. The most common one is simply drilling a mount for a new fan<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>, filtering, sealing openings to promote better air flow, or even the adding of a tank of pressurized [[carbon dioxide]] or liters of [[mineral oil]] to the case. These modifications are often performed by [[Overclocking|overclockers]] either looking for better cooling for hot components or [[Quiet PC|sound reduction]]. Some fan modifications are merely a show of modding skill or talent and have no true functional purpose.<ref>{{cite web

*'''Spray paint''': Painting a case is another method of distinguishing your work from others. [[Spray paint]] is the common method preferred among amateur modders.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> There are many spray painting guides for amateur modders. The finish cannot be compared to automotive paint or [[powder coating]], but is a simple way to change the look of a case.

==Less common modifications==
[[Image:Saibotcaseside.jpg|left|thumbnail|A computer modded with different coloured [[CCFL]]s and [[LED]] fans. ]]
*'''Automotive paint & other finishes''':  Automotive paint refers to the paint typically seen on cars and trucks.  This type of finish requires a compressed air source, such as an [[air compressor]] or [[CO2]] tank, and a [[spray gun]].  It is more expensive than a finish using [[Aerosol paint|spray cans]], but when done skillfully it can be better looking and much more durable.  Other methods of painting can include [[powder coating]] which is highly durable though not quite as aesthetically pleasing to many modders as automotive paint.  [[Electroplating]] can also be done on steel computer cases and parts.  Aluminum cases can be plated or [[Anodizing|anodized]] as well, and processes are available to plate plastic cases.  Plated coatings can range from nickel to chrome and even gold.  More elaborate finishes can be crafted by using a combination of techniques, such as chrome plating with a transparent color coat.
*'''Body filler''': Body filler (or [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]]) is a two-part putty often used to fix dents in automobiles.  Case modders use it to fill and sculpt their own creations.  When mixed with a paste catalyst the filler hardens in a short period of time and can be sanded, ground or cut to a desired shape.  An alternative system uses [[fiberglass]] resin (catalyzed with liquid hardener) and either fiberglass cloth or mat to fill holes and form shapes.  Lacquer based Spot Putty is often used to fill smaller imperfections before the application of [[Primer (paint)|primer]].  Typically, a case modder uses a combination of these materials to obtain the desired result.  This method is usually used on the front plastic bezel of a computer case to give it a new look.

==Types of case mods==

*'''Peripheral mods''':  [[Peripheral]]s like the keyboard, mouse, and speakers are sometimes painted or otherwise modified to match the computer.  Some system builders, in an effort to make their system more portable and convenient, install speakers and small [[LCD]] screens into the case.
*'''Unusual cooling mods''':  Hardcore [[Overclocking|overclockers]] often install cooling systems for the sole purpose of achieving performance records.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  Such systems frequently include [[phase change]], [[Thermoelectric effect#Peltier effect|thermoelectric/Peltier]]  and [[liquid nitrogen]].  However, some of these systems are noisy and expensive.  They are rarely used for extended periods of time.
*'''Case building''':  Sometime modders even build entire cases from scratch.  Some may attempt to treat the case as a work of [[art]]. Others make it appear to be something else, like a teddy bear, wooden cabinet, or a shelf mounted on a wall.  Still others pursue a retro look, like a [[Macintosh Plus]] or an old [[Atari 2600]] [[video game console]].  Case [[modders]] (or case builders) who create their computer cases from scratch are few and far between.  These people sometimes put hundreds of hours into their work.  The [http://www.bit-tech.net/modding/2006/05/22/wmd_part2_g-gnome_case_mod/1.html WMD case], [http://www.thebestcasescenario.com/forum/showthread.php?t=28&page=6 Project Nighthawk], and [http://forums.bit-tech.net/showthread.php?t=76374&page=1&pp=20 Dark Blade case] are a few examples of professional cases built from scratch.
*'''Component modding''':  This type of modding, as the name suggests, involves modifying the PC components themselves.  An example is the relocation of buttons on optical drives. This is often done in combination with "stealthing", which hides the drive's visibility by masking it with a blank face. A riskier modification involves installing [[hard drive]] windows.  This is done in a clean room where there is little to no dust.  Few people have attempted it and results seem to vary. {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  Some hard drives, including the [[WD Raptor]], now come with a window as standard.
*'''Laptop modding''': [[Laptop]]s can be modified much like a typical computer case.  While most laptop mods consist of new paint or other finishes, others have chosen to engrave or cut out designs into their laptop cover (behind the screen).  Laptops may also be turned into [[digital photo frame]]s.  These types of mods will typically void the warranty of the device.  To avoid warranty issues, skins or stickers can be purchased that are easily removable from the casing.

==Case modding contests==
Many sites and companies run contests for case modders, awarding prizes and accolades to the winners. Some of these contests are sponsored by computer enthusiast magazines and others by computer retailers.

==Console case modding==

[[File:Gold Xbox.jpg|thumb|300px|An example of an Xbox 360 case mod]]
''Console case modding'' refers to gamers who modify the case of their game consoles. The most common consoles to modify are the Xbox and Xbox 360, because there is much more room inside to customize them with items such as lights, fans, etc. These consoles and their controllers are also relatively easy to take apart. For those who do not wish to scratch-build mods, there are several companies that sell transparent Xbox cases and various cooling/lighting equipment for them.

Console case modding started in the late 1980s when the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and [[Sega Mega Drive|Sega Genesis]], were released; many customers simply put pictures or stickers on them until the [[PlayStation]] was released. Many case modders started to change hardware, for example by altering them to play copied games (known as 'chipping' the games console). The most common modification for the PlayStation was the 'chipping' process (mentioned above). When the [[Nintendo 64]], [[Dreamcast]] and [[PlayStation 2]] was released, many chipped them, styled them, and added additional cooling; some went as far as changing the hardware itself. When the [[Xbox]] and [[Xbox 360]] were released, many modders personally customized them further, using neon lights, transparent cases, fans, and PC hard drives (as opposed to Xbox-branded drives). Many modders found that altering the interior of Xbox 360s was difficult due to absence of a power cable (normally in a PC, this cord attaches the hard disk drive to its motherboard). Despite shortcomings, modders also found a way to power neon lighting and other powered equipment by using the DVD-ROM power supply; however, due to insufficient power to the hard disk drive, it often caused freezing during disk access. [http://www.xbox-modchips.com/img/xcm-360-blk2-limited-big.jpg]. Fortunately, the most recent products available for internal case modding uses the power outlet for the internal fan by splitting the cord with a "Y" connector.
