==History==
The Software Industry Conference website notes: "From 1991 through 1994 the conference was called the Summer Shareware Seminar and was held in June. In 1994, due to a conflict with [[Ziff Davis|Ziff-Davis]], the conference name was changed to the Shareware Industry Conference and began being held in July. In 2007, the [[board of directors]] changed the name to Software Industry Conference to better reflect the needs of the industry."
