The '''ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems''' ('''CHI''') series of [[academic conference]]s is generally considered the most prestigious in the field of [[human-computer interaction]]. It is hosted by [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[SIGCHI]], the [[Special Interest Group]] on Computer-Human Interaction. CHI has been held annually since 1982 and attracts thousands of international attendees. CHI 2011 will be held in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].

==History==
The CHI conference series started with the Human Factors in Computer Systems conference in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland|Gaithersburg]], [[Maryland]], USA in 1982. During this meeting the formation of the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI) was first publicly announced. ACM SIGCHI became the sponsor of the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. The first CHI conference was held in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, in 1983. The second conference took place in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]], USA, in 1985. <ref>{{ cite web | url=http://old.sigchi.org/bulletin/1996.1/conf-chairs.html | title=The CHI Conference: Interviews with Conference Chairs | first=Steven | last=Pemberton | publisher=[[SIGCHI]] year=1996 accessdate=2008-09-29 }}</ref> Since then, CHI conferences have been held annually in spring each year. Till 1992 the conference was held in [[Canada]] or the USA. In 1993 CHI moved to [[Europe]] for the first time and was held in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]].<ref>{{ cite web | title=Past CHI Conferences | url=http://www.chi2007.org/welcome/pastchi.php | publisher=[[SIGCHI]] | year=2006 | accessdate=2008-09-29 | work=CHI 2007 website }}</ref>

Over the years, CHI has grown in popularity. The 1982 meeting drew 907 attendees. CHI 90 attracted 2,314. Attendance has been fairly stable since then.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.chi2007.org/attend/2006RegStats.php | year=2006 | last=Wixon | first=Dennis | title=CHI 2006 Registration Statistics | publisher=[[SIGCHI]] | accessdate=2008-09-29 | work=CHI 2007 website }}</ref> After the early years CHI became highly selective. Since 1993 the acceptance rate for full papers was consistently below 30 percent. After 1992 the average acceptance rate was around 20 percent. The number of accepted full papers is slowly increasing and reached  157 accepted papers with an acceptance rate of 22 percent in 2008.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://portal.acm.org/browse_dl.cfm?part=series&idx=SERIES260 | accessdate=2010-04-02 | publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] | work=ACM Digital Library | title=CHI: Papers Acceptance Statistics }}</ref>
