'''Lingueo.com''' is a social network whose aim is to help its users to practice and learn foreign languages.

==The name==
Lingueo is a [[portmanteau]] of the Latin word "lingua", which means "tongue" (and, by extension, "language"), and the word "video", which refers to language learning by videoconference.

==The company==
Created in 2007, Lingueo is a French enterprise situated in Paris and founded by Guillaume le Dieu de Ville, Arnaud Portanelli and Johann Querne. More than 10 different nationalities are presented in the Lingueo team.

==The service==
Lingueo.com is a social network whose aim is to help its users to practice and learn foreign languages. The site connects people who wish to learn and practice foreign languages with suitable tutors all over the world.
The courses are held directly on the website through videoconferences, and no software to install whatsoever. The fees vary depending on the tutor, the minimum fee being 10â‚¬/hour. No subscription is needed and a student is free to end the course at any time. Besides enabling direct contact, Lingueo offers a free access to a linguistic video library consisting of little video courses made by the tutors. This practical data bank aims at familiarizing a learner with everyday words and expressions.
Lingueo offers a possibility to learn the most commonly spoken languages, and promotes the learning of regional languages as well as the [[French Sign Language|Sign Language]]. <ref>[http://www.france-handicap-info.com/en/articles/langue-des-signes.html France handicap info (in English)]</ref> In addition to linguistic learning, Lingueo promotes diversity and cultural exchange. More than 50 different languages are taught on Lingueo by almost 1000 tutors around the world.
This effort has been recognized by the [[European Commission]], who rewarded Lingueo in the spring of 2009 with the European Language Label, which is a prize awarded to the most innovative language learning projects. <ref>[http://entrepreneurs.telecom-paristech.fr/incubes/lingueo-laureat-du-label-europeen-des-langues/ Telecom Paristech (in French)]</ref>
