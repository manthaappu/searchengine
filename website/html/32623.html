'''Rustic capitals''' (in [[Latin]] ''capitalis rustica'') is an [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] script. As the term is negatively connotated supposing an opposition to the more 'civilized' form of the [[Roman square capitals]] [[Bernhard Bischoff]] prefers to call the script ''canonized capitals''.

Rustic capitals are similar to [[Roman square capitals]], but are less rigid, influenced more by pen and ink writing on [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]] than the writing used for [[inscription]]s. The letters are thinner and more compressed, use many more curved lines than do square capitals, and have [[descender]]s extending below the baseline. 

The script was used between the 1st century and the 9th century, most often between the 4th and 6th centuries. After the 5th century, rustic capitals began to fall out of use, but they continued to be used as a display script in titles and headings, along with [[uncial]] as the script of the main text.

About fifty manuscripts with rustic capitals survive, including four copies of works by [[Virgil]] (including the [[Vergilius Vaticanus]] and the [[Vergilius Romanus]]), one copy of a work by [[Terence]], and one of a work by [[Prudentius]]. The script was usually used for ''de luxe'' copies of pagan authors; the only works by Christian authors which use this script are those by Prudentius and [[Coelius Sedulius|Sedulius]].
