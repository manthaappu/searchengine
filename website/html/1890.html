After buying an Apple II in January 1978, he went to work for [[Apple Computer]] from August 1979 until March 1984, where he was a key designer of the [[Macintosh]] system software. Since leaving Apple, he has co-founded three companies: [[Radius (computer)|Radius]] in 1986, [[General Magic]] in 1990 and [[Eazel]] in 1999. In 2002, he helped [[Mitch Kapor]] promote [[open source]] [[software]] with the [[Open Source Applications Foundation]]. Hertzfeld joined [[Google]] in 2005 and has been working there since.

==Career==
===Apple Computer (1979–1984)===

After graduating from [[Brown University]] with a [[Computer science|Computer Science]] degree in 1975, Hertzfeld attended [[graduate school]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. In 1978, he bought an [[Apple II]] computer and soon began developing software for it. He was hired by Apple Computer as a systems programmer in 1979 and developed the [[Apple SilenType]] printer [[firmware]] and the first 80-column card for the Apple II. In the early 1980s, he invited his high school friend, artist [[Susan Kare]], to join Apple in order to help design what would become standard Macintosh icons.

Hertzfeld's business card at Apple listed his title as ''Software Wizard''. He wrote large portions of the Macintosh's original system software including much of the burned-in [[Read-only memory|ROM]] code, the User Interface Toolbox, and a number of innovative components now standard in many graphic user interfaces, like the [[Control panel (Mac OS)|Control Panel]] and [[Scrapbook (Mac OS)|Scrapbook]].

After a shakeup in the Apple II team and at Hertzfeld's request, Apple co-founder [[Steve Jobs]] added him to the newly formed Macintosh team in February, 1981. Working for [[Bud Tribble]] alongside [[Bill Atkinson]] and [[Burrell Smith]], Hertzfeld became a primary software architect of the [[Mac OS|Macintosh Operating System]], which was considered revolutionary in its use of the [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) where [[Jef Raskin]] also made significant contributions.

===After Apple (1984–present)===
Since leaving Apple in 1984, Hertzfeld has co-founded three new companies &mdash; [[Radius (computer)|Radius]] (1986), [[General Magic]] (1990) and [[Eazel]] (1999). At Eazel, he helped to create the [[Nautilus file manager]] for [[Linux|Linux's]] [[GNOME]] desktop. He volunteered for [[OSAF]] in 2002 and 2003, writing early prototypes of ''[[Chandler (PIM)|Chandler]]'', their information manager. In 1996, Hertzfeld was interviewed by [[Robert Cringely]] on the television show ''[[Triumph of the Nerds]]'', and was again interviewed by Cringely on NerdTV in 2005.

In early 2004, he started ''folklore.org'', a [[web site]] devoted to collective storytelling that contains dozens of [[anecdote]]s about the development of the original Macintosh. The stories have been collected in an [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] book, ''Revolution in the Valley'', published in December 2004. In August 2005, Hertzfeld joined [[Google]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/22/technology/22google.html | work=The New York Times | title=Where Does Google Plan to  Spend $4 Billion? | first=John | last=Markoff | date=August 22, 2005 | accessdate=April 25, 2010}}</ref>
