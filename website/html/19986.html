'''John Charles Butcher''' (born 31 March 1933) is a [[mathematician]] who specialises in [[numerical methods]] for the solution of [[ordinary differential equations]]. Butcher works on multistage methods for [[initial value problem]]s, such as [[Runge-Kutta]] and [[Group (mathematics)|general linear methods]]. The [[Butcher group]] is named after him.

More recently, he is investigating a new type of method with stability identical to that of a [[Runge-Kutta method]].
