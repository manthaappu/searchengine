<html> <head> <title>Entity integrity</title></head><body>In the [[relational data model]], '''entity integrity''' is one of the [[database integrity|three inherent integrity rules]]. Entity integrity is an integrity rule which states that every table must have a [[primary key]] and that the column or columns chosen to be the primary key should be unique and not null.<ref>Beynon-Davies P. (2004). Database Systems 3rd Edition. Palgrave, Basingstoke, UK. ISBN 1-4039-1601-2</ref>
A direct consequence of this integrity rule is that duplicate rows are forbidden in a table. If each value of a primary key must be unique no duplicate rows can logically appear in a table. The NOT NULL characteristic of a primary key ensures that a value can be used to identify all rows in a table.

Within relational databases using [[SQL]], entity integrity is enforced by adding a primary key clause to a schema definition.
The system enforces Entity Integrity by not allowing operations (INSERT, UPDATE) to produce an invalid primary key. Any operation that is likely to create a duplicate primary key or one containing nulls is rejected.
The Entity Integrity ensures that the data that you store remains in the proper format as well as comprehendible.
