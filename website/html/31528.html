<html> <head> <title>Recursion termination</title></head><body>In computing, '''Recursion termination''' is when certain conditions are met and  the recursive algorithm ceases calling itself and begins to return values.<ref>http://www.itl.nist.gov/div897/sqg/dads/HTML/recursiontrm.html</ref> This happens only if with every recursive call the recursive algorithm changes its state and moves towards the base case. Cases that satisfy the definition without being defined in terms of the definition itself are called base cases. They are small enough to solve directly.<ref>

==Examples==
===Fibonacci function===
The Fibonacci function(fibonacci(n)), which takes integer n(n >= 0) as input, has three conditions

1. if n is 0, returns 0.<br>
2. if n is 1, returns 1.<br>
3. otherwise, return [fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)]

This recursive function terminates if either conditions 1 or 2 are satisfied. We see that the function's recursive call reduces the value of n(by passing n-1 or n-2 in the function) ensuring that n reaches either condition 1 or 2. 

===C++===
C++ Example<ref>
{{cite book
 | title = An Introduction to the Imperative Part of C++
 | url=http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~wjk/C++Intro/RobMillerL8.html
}}
</ref>:
<pre>
int factorial(int number)  
{
	else if (number == 0)
		return 1;
	else
		return (number * factorial(number - 1)); 
}
</pre>
Here we see that in the recursive call, the number passed in the recursive step is reduced by 1. This again ensures that the number will at some point reduce to 0 which in turn terminates the recursive algorithm.
