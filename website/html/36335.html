<html> <head> <title>Symbol table</title></head><body>In [[computer science]], a '''symbol table''' is a [[data structure]] used by a language translator such as a [[compiler]] or [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]], where each [[identifier]] in a program's [[source code]] is associated with information relating to its declaration or appearance in the source, such as its [[data type|type]], [[scope (programming)|scope]] level and sometimes its [[Memory address|location]].

==Implementation==
A common implementation technique is to use a [[hash table]] implementation. A compiler may use one large symbol table for all symbols or use separated, hierarchical symbol tables for different [[Scope (programming)|scopes]].

==Uses==
An [[object file]] will contain a symbol table of the identifiers it contains that are externally visible.  During the linking of different object files, a [[Linker (computing)|linker]] will use these symbol tables to resolve any unresolved references.

A symbol table may only exist during the translation process, or it may be embedded in the output of that process for later exploitation, for example, during an interactive [[debugger|debugging session]], or as a resource for formatting a diagnostic report during or after [[execution (computers)|execution]] of a program.

While reverse engineering an executable a lot of tools refer the symbol table to check what addresses have been assigned to global variables and known functions. If the symbol table has been [[strip (Unix)|stripped]] or cleaned out before converting it into an executable tools will find it hard to find out addresses and understand anything about the program.

==Example==

The symbol table of a small program is listed below. The table itself was generated using the [[GNU Binary Utilities|GNU binutils']] [[nm (Unix)|nm]] utility. There is one data symbol, holaamigosh (noted by the "D" type), and many functions (self defined as well as from the standard library). The first column is where the symbol is located in the memory, the second is "[http://sourceware.org/binutils/docs-2.17/binutils/nm.html#nm The symbol type]" and the third is the name of the symbol. By passing suitable parameters, the symbol table was made to sort on basis of address.
