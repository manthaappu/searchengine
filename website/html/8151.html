In [[computer science]], '''Coq''' is an [[Interactive theorem proving|interactive theorem prover]]. It allows the expression of [[mathematics|mathematical]] assertions, mechanically checks proofs of these assertions, helps to find formal proofs, and extracts a certified program from the [[constructive proof]] of its formal specification. Coq works within the theory of the [[calculus of inductive constructions]], a derivative of the [[calculus of constructions]]. Coq is not an automated [[theorem prover]] but includes automatic theorem proving [[tactic (theorem proving)|tactic]]s and various decision procedures.

Coq implements a [[dependent types|dependently typed]] [[functional programming language]].<ref>[http://coq.inria.fr/a-short-introduction-to-coq A short introduction to Coq].</ref>

It is developed in [[France]], in the [http://typical.inria.fr/ TypiCal] (ex-LogiCal) project, jointly operated by [[INRIA]], [[École Polytechnique]], [[Paris-Sud 11 University]] and [[CNRS]]. There was also formerly a group at [[École Normale Supérieure de Lyon]]. The team leader is Senior Scientist [[Benjamin Werner]]. Coq is implemented in [[Objective Caml]].

The word ''coq'' means "[[rooster|cock]]" (rooster) in [[French language|French]], and stems from a tradition of naming French research development tools with animal names. It is also a reference to [[Thierry Coquand]], who developed the aforementioned calculus of constructions along with [[Gérard Huet]]. Also, at first it was simply called Coc, the acronym of calculus of construction.

== Four color theorem and ssreflect extension ==

[[Georges Gonthier]] (of [[Microsoft Research]], in [[Cambridge]], [[England]]) and [[Benjamin Werner]] (of [[INRIA]]) used Coq to create a surveyable proof of the [[four color theorem]], which was completed in September 2004.<ref>[http://www.inria.fr/rapportsactivite/RA2004/logical2004/uid40.html Development of theories and tactics: Four Color Theorem]</ref>

Based on this work, a significant extension to Coq was developed called Ssreflect (which stands for "small scale reflection"). Despite the name, most of the new features added to Coq by Ssreflect are general purpose features, useful not merely for the computational reflection style of proof. These include:

* Additional convenient notations for irrefutable and refutable pattern matching, on inductive types with one or two constructors
* Implicit arguments for functions applied to zero arguments - which is useful when programming with higher-order functions
* Concise anonymous arguments
* An improved <code>set</code> tactic with more powerful matching
* Support for reflection

Ssreflect 1.2 is freely available under the open source [[CeCill-B]] license, and is compatible with Coq 8.2pl1.<ref>[http://www.msr-inria.inria.fr/Projects/math-components/index_html#download Download the Ssreflect extension for the Coq system]</ref>
