'''Cryptanalytic''' [[computer]]s are computers designed to be used for [[cryptanalysis]]. Modern cryptanalysis involves massive statistical analysis and multiple trial decryptions. These are possible only with automated equipment. This has been true since before WWII; Polish cryptanalysts designed and built automated aids in their work on [[Enigma]] traffic. Arguably, the first modern computer (digital, electronic, programmable (sort of)) was built for cryptanalytic work at [[Bletchley Park]] (the [[Colossus_computer|Colossus]]) during the war. More modern computers were important after WWII, and some machines (eg, the [[Cray-1]]) are reported to have had machine instructions hardwired in at the request of [[NSA]]. 

Computers continue to be important in cryptanalysis well into the 21st century. NSA, in fact, is said to have the largest number of installed computers on the planet. Whether or not this is true in an age of [[Google]] computer farms and such remains publicly unknown.
