'''First pass yield''' '''(FPY)''', also known as '''throughput yield''' '''(TPY)''', is defined as the number of units coming out of a process divided by the number of units going into that process over a specified period of time.<ref>http://www.six-sigma-material.com/Throughput-Yield.html</ref>

Also related, "first time yield" (FTY) is simply the number of good units produced divided by the number of total units going into the process. First time yield considers only what went into a process step and what went out, while FPY adds the consideration of rework.

Consider the following:

You have a process that is divided into four sub-processes: A, B, C and D. Assume that you have 100 units entering process A. To calculate FTY you would:

#Calculate the yield (number out of step/number into step) of each step.
#Multiply these together.

For Example:

*100 units enter A and 90 leave. The FTY for process A is 90/100 = .9
*90 units go into B and 80 leave. The FTY for process B is 80/90 = .89
*80 units go into C and 75 leave. The FTY for C is 75/80 = .94
*75 units got into D and 70 leave. The FTY for D is 70/75 = .93

The total process yield is equal to FTYofA * FTYofB * FTYofC * FTYofD or .9*.89*.94*.93 = .70.

You can also get the total process yield for the entire process by simply dividing the number of good units produced by the number going in to the start of the process. In this case, 70/100 = .70 or 70% yield.
