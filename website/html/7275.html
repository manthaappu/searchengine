In [[computational complexity theory]], a [[computational problem]] is '''complete''' for a [[complexity class]] if it is, in a formal sense, one of the "hardest" or "most expressive" problems in the complexity class.  If a problem has the property that it allows you to quickly solve any problem in a complexity class, it is called '''hard''' for that class.  

More formally, a problem ''p'' is called hard for a complexity class ''C'' under a given type of [[reduction (complexity)|reduction]], if there is a reduction of this type from any problem in ''C'' to ''p''.  If a problem is both hard for a class, and a member of the class, it is complete for that class (under the given type of reduction).

A problem that is complete for a class ''C'' is said to be '''C-complete''', and the class of all problems complete for ''C'' is denoted '''C-complete'''. The first complete class to be defined and the most well-known is [[NP-complete]], a class that contains many difficult-to-solve problems that arise in practice. Similarly, a problem hard for a class ''C'' is called '''C-hard''', e.g. [[NP-hard]].

Normally it is assumed that the reduction in question does not have higher computational complexity than the class itself. Therefore it may be said that if a ''C-complete'' problem has a "computationally easy" solution, then all problems in "C" have an "easy" solution. 

Generally, complexity classes that have a recursive enumeration have known complete problems, whereas those that do not, don't have any known complete problems. For example, [[NP (complexity)|NP]], [[co-NP]], [[PLS (complexity)|PLS]], [[PPA (complexity)|PPA]] all have known natural complete problems, while [[RP (complexity)|RP]], [[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]], [[BPP]] and [[TFNP]] do not have any known complete problems (although such a problem may be discovered in the future).{{Fact|date=July 2008}}

There are  classes without complete problems. For example, Sipser showed that there is a language '''M''' such that '''BPP'''<sup>'''M'''</sup> ('''BPP''' with [[oracle machine|oracle]] '''M''') has no complete problems.<ref>M. Sipser.
