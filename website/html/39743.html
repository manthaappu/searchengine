<html> <head> <title>WS-CAF</title></head><body>'''Web Services Composite Application Framework''' ('''WS-CAF''') is an open framework developed by [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]]. Its purpose is to define a generic and open framework for applications that contain multiple services used together, which are sometimes referred to as [[composite application]]s<ref>[http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=ws-caf OASIS Web Services Composite Application Framework (WS-CAF)], [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]], [[2006]]</ref>. WS-CAF characteristics include interoperability, ease of implementation and ease of use.

== Scope ==

The scope of WS-CAF includes:

* Provision of [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]] definitions for context, coordination and transactions. 
* Message formats will be specified as [[SOAP]] headers and/or body content. 
* The specification is to be programming language-neutral and platform-neutral.
* Demonstrated composability with other [[List of Web service specifications|Web Service specifications]] that are being developed as open, recognized standards
* The goals of promoting convergence, consistent use, and a coherent architecture.
* Support composability as a critical architectural characteristic of Web service specifications. WS-CAF and WS-Context are targeted to become building blocks for other Web service specifications and standards.

== Input specifications ==

The WS-CAF accepts the following Web services specifications as input:

* [[WS-Context]]
* WS-Coordination Framework ([[WS-CF]])
* WS-Transaction Management ([[WS-TXM]])

== Benefits ==

The benefits and results of CAF are intended to be standard and interoperable ways to:

* Demarcate and coordinate web service activities
* Propagate and coordinate context information
* Notify participants of changes in an activity
* Define the relationship of coordinators to each other
* Recover transactions predictably and consistently in a business process execution.
* Interact across multiple transaction models (such as are used in [[CORBA]], [[CICS]], [[Enterprise JavaBean]]s or [[.NET Framework|.NET]] environments)<ref>[http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/ws-caf/charter.php OASIS Web Services Composite Application Framework Charter], [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]], [[2006]]</ref>.
