<html> <head> <title>Multivariate interpolation</title></head><body>In [[numerical analysis]], '''multivariate interpolation''' or '''spatial interpolation''' is [[interpolation]] on functions of more than one variable.

The function to be interpolated is known at given points <math>(x_i, y_i, z_i, \dots)</math> and the interpolation problem consist of yielding values at arbitrary points <math>(x,y,z,\dots)</math>.

==Regular grid==
For function values known on a [[regular grid]] (having predetermined, not necessarily uniform, spacing), the following methods are available.

===Any dimension===
* [[Nearest-neighbor interpolation]]

===2 dimensions===
* [[Bilinear interpolation]]
* [[Bicubic interpolation]] 
* [[BÃ©zier surface]]
* [[Lanczos resampling]] 
* [[Delaunay triangulation]] 
* [[Spline interpolation]]
* [[Natural neighbor]]
* [[Kriging]]
* [[Inverse distance weighting]]

[[Resampling#Bitmap|Bitmap resampling]] is the application of 2D multivariate interpolation in [[image processing]].

Three of the methods applied on the same dataset, from 16 values located at the black dots. The colours represent the interpolated values.

===3 dimensions===
* [[Trilinear interpolation]]
* [[Tricubic interpolation]]

===Tensor product splines for ''N'' dimensions===

Catmull-Rom splines can be easily generalized to any number of dimensions.
The [[cubic Hermite spline]] article will remind you that <math>\mathrm{CINT}_x(f_{-1}, f_0, f_1, f_2) = \mathbf{b}(x) \cdot \left( f_{-1} f_0 f_1 f_2 \right)</math> for some 4-vector <math>\mathbf{b}(x)</math> which is a function of ''x'' alone, where <math>f_j</math> is the value at <math>j</math> of the function to be interpolated.
Rewrite this approximation as
:<math>
\mathrm{CR}(x) = \sum_{i=-1}^2 f_i b_i(x)
</math>
This formula can be directly generalized to N dimensions <ref>[http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.3564 Two hierarchies of spline interpolations. Practical algorithms for multivariate higher order splines]</ref>:
:<math>
\mathrm{CR}(x_1,\dots,x_N) = \sum_{i_1,\dots,i_N=-1}^2 f_{i_1\dots i_N} \prod_{j=1}^N b_{i_j}(x_j)
</math>
Note that similar generalizations can be made for other types of spline interpolations, including Hermite splines.
In regards to efficiency, the general formula can in fact be computed as a composition of successive <math>\mathrm{CINT}</math>-type operations for any type of tensor product splines, as explained in the [[tricubic interpolation]] article.
However, the fact remains that if there are <math>n</math> terms in the 1-dimensional <math>\mathrm{CR}</math>-like summation, then there will be <math>n^N</math> terms in the <math>N</math>-dimensional summation.

== Irregular grid (scattered data) ==
Schemes defined for scattered data on a [[irregular grid]] should all work on a regular grid, typically reducing to another known method.
* [[Nearest-neighbor interpolation]]
* [[Triangulated irregular network]]-based [[natural neighbor]]
* [[Triangulated irregular network]]-based [[linear interpolation]] (a type of [[piecewise linear function]])
* [[Inverse distance weighting]]
* [[Kriging]]
* [[Radial basis function]]
* [[Thin plate spline]]
* [[Polyharmonic spline]] (the thin-plate-spline is a special case of a polyharmonic spline)
* Least-squares [[spline (mathematics)|spline]]
