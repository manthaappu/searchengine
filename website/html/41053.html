<html> <head> <title>Zero flag</title></head><body>The '''Zero Flag''' is a flag stored in the [[FLAGS register]] on all [[x86]] compatible [[CPU]]s.  It is [[bit]] 6.  When it is set to 1, it means that the result of an instruction was zero.  The Zero Flag is changed by all math instructions and the CMP instruction (a compare instruction works by subtracting the two values).
