'''Jack Steinberger''' (born May 25, 1921) is a [[Germany|German]]-[[United States|American]] [[physicist]] currently residing near [[Geneva, Switzerland]]. He co-discovered the [[muon neutrino]], along with [[Leon Lederman]] and [[Melvin Schwartz]], for which they were given the 1988 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].

==Life==

Steinberger was born in the city of [[Bad Kissingen]] in [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]], in 1921.  The rise of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] party in Germany, with its open [[anti-Semitism]], prompted his parents to send him out of the country.

Steinberger emigrated to the [[United States]] at the age of 13, making the trans-Atlantic trip with his brother Herbert. Barnett Farroll cared for him as a foster child, the connection was made by Jewish charities in the United States. During this period, Steinberger attended [[New Trier Township High School]], in [[Winnetka, Illinois]].

Steinberger studied chemical engineering at Armour Institute of Technology (now [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]) but left after his scholarship ended to help supplement his family's income. He obtained a bachelor's degree in Chemistry from the [[University of Chicago]], in 1942.  Shortly thereafter,  he joined the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]] at [[MIT]].  With the help of the [[G.I. Bill]], he returned to graduate studies at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1946, where he studied under [[Edward Teller]] and [[Enrico Fermi]].  His Ph.D. thesis concerned the energy spectrum of electrons emitted in [[muon]] [[particle decay|decay]]; his results showed that this was a three-body decay, and implied the participation of two neutral particle in the decay (later identified as the [[electron neutrino|electron]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}) and [[muon neutrino|muon]] ({{SubatomicParticle|muon neutrino}}) neutrinos) rather than one.

==Early career==

After receiving his doctorate, Steinberger attended the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] for a year.  In 1949 he published a calculation of the lifetime of the neutral [[pion]],<ref>

}}</ref> which anticipated the study of anomalies in quantum field theory.

Following Princeton, Steinberger went to the [[Radiation Lab]] at the [[University of California at Berkeley]], where he performed an experiment which demonstrated the production of neutral pions and their decay to photon pairs.  This experiment utilized the 330 MeV synchrotron and the newly-invented scintillation counters.<ref>

}}</ref> Despite this and other achievements, he was asked to leave the Radiation Lab at Berkeley due to his refusal to sign the so-called ''[[Non-Communist Oath]]''.

Steinberger accepted a faculty position at Columbia in 1950. The newly commissioned [[meson]] beam at [[Nevis Labs]] provided the tool for several important experiments. Measurements of the production cross section of pions on various nuclear targets showed that the pion has odd parity.<ref>

The same target was used to observe the relative rare decay of neutral pions to a photon, an electron and a [[positron]]. A related experiment measured the mass difference between the charged and neutral pions based on the angular correlation between the neutral pions produced when the negative pion is captured by the proton in the hydrogen nucleus.<ref>

==Investigations of strange particles==

During 1954–1955, Steinberger contributed to the development of the [[bubble chamber]] with the construction of a 15 cm device for use with the [[Cosmotron]] at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]].  The experiment used a pion beam to produce pairs of [[hadrons]] with [[strange quarks]] in order to elucidate the puzzling production and decay properties of these particles.<ref>

}}</ref> This observation was important for confirming the existence of the SU(3) flavor symmetry which hypothesizes the existence of the strange quark.

An important characteristic of the [[weak interaction]] is its violation of [[parity symmetry]].  This characteristic was established through the measurement of the spins and parities of many [[hyperons]]. Steinberger and his collaborators contributed several such measurements using large (75 cm) liquid-hydrogen bubble chambers and separated hadron beams at Brookhaven.  One example is the measurement of the invariant mass distribution of electron-positron pairs produced in the decay of [[Sigma baryon|Sigma-zero hyperons]] to [[Lambda baryon|Lambda-zero hyperons]].<ref>

==Neutrinos and the weak neutral current==

In the 1960s, the emphasis in the study of the weak interaction shifted from strange particles to neutrinos.  Steinberger and [[Melvin Schwartz|Schwartz]] built large spark chambers at [[Nevis Lab]] and exposed them in 1961 to neutrinos produced in association with muons in the decays of charged pions and kaons.  They used the [[Alternating Gradient Synchrotron]] (AGS) at Brookhaven, and obtained a number of convincing events in which muons were produced, but no electrons.<ref name="slac.stanford.edu">

 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.9.36
}}</ref> This result, for which they received the Nobel Prize in 1988, proved the existence of a type of neutrino associated with the muon, distinct from the neutrino produced in beta decay.

==Study of CP violation==

The [[CP violation]] ([[charge conjugation]] and [[parity (physics)|parity]]) was established in the neutral kaon system in 1964.  Steinberger recognized that the phenomenological parameter epsilon (''ε'') which quantifies the degree of CP violation could be measured in interference phenomena (See CP violation).  In collaboration with [[Carlo Rubbia]], he performed an experiment while on sabbatical at [[CERN]] during 1965 which demonstrated robustly the expected interference effect, and also measured precisely the difference in mass of the short-lived and long-lived neutral kaon masses.<ref>

}}</ref>

Back in the United States, Steinberger conducted an experiment at Brookhaven to observe CP violation in the semi-leptonic decays of neutral kaons.  The charge asymmetry relates directly to the epsilon parameter, which was thereby measured precisely.<ref>

 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.19.993
}}</ref> This experiment also allowed the deduction of the phase of epsilon, and confirmed that [[CPT symmetry|CPT]] is a good symmetry of nature.

==CERN==

In 1968, Steinberger left Columbia University and accepted a position as a department director at [[CERN]]. He constructed an experiment there utilizing multi-wire proportional chambers ([[MWPC]]), recently invented by [[Georges Charpak]].  The MWPC's, augmented by micro-electronic amplifiers, allowed much larger samples of events to be recorded.  Several results for neutral kaons were obtained and published in the early 1970s, including the observation of the rare decay of the neutral kaon to a muon pair, the time-dependence of the asymmetry for semi-leptonic decays, and a more precise measurement of the neutral kaon mass difference.  A new era in experimental technique was opened.

These new techniques proved crucial for the first demonstration of direct [[CP-violation]].  The [[NA31 experiment]] at CERN was built in the early 1980s using the CERN [[Super Proton Synchrotron|SPS 400 GeV proton synchrotron]].  Aside from banks of MWPC's and a hadron calorimeter, it featured a [[liquid argon]] electromagnetic calorimeter with exceptional spatial and energy resolution. NA31 showed that direct CP violation is real.<ref>

==Nobel Prize==

Jack Steinberger was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in the year 1988, "for the neutrino beam method and the demonstration of the doublet structure of the leptons through the discovery of the muon neutrino".  He shares this prize with [[Leon M. Lederman]] and [[Melvin Schwartz]].  At the time, all three experimenters were at [[Columbia University]].

The experiment used charged [[pion]] beams generated with the ''Alternating Gradient Synchrotron'' (AGS) at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]. The pions decayed to [[muons]] which were detected in front of a steel wall; the [[neutrinos]] were detected in spark chambers installed behind the wall.  The coincidence of muons and neutrinos demonstrated that a second kind of neutrino was created in association with muons.  Subsequent experiments proved this neutrino to be distinct from the first kind (electron-type). Steinberger, Lederman and Schwartz published their work in Physical Review Letters in 1962.<ref name="slac.stanford.edu"/>

He gave his Nobel medal to [[New Trier High School]] in [[Winnetka, Illinois]] (USA), of which he is an alumnus.
