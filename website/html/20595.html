In [[cryptography]], '''key clustering''' is said to occur when two different [[key (cryptography)|keys]] generate the same [[ciphertext]] from the same [[plaintext]], using the same [[cipher]] [[algorithm]]. A good cipher algorithm, using different keys on the same plaintext, should generate a different ciphertext, irrespective of the key length.

Assume that there is a plaintext P, two different keys, K1 and K2, and an algorithm A. Ciphertexts C1 and C2 with the two keys are generated as follows:
     
'''P → A(K1) → C1'''

'''P → A(K2) → C2'''

C1 should not equal C2, if they do then key clustering has occurred.

==Importance==

If an 'attacker' tries to break a cipher by [[brute-force]] (trying all possible keys until it finds the correct key) then key clustering will result in an easier attack on a particular cipher text.  If there are N possible keys with out any key clustering then the attacker will on average need to try N/2 keys to decrypt it and a worst case of trying all N keys.  If there are two keys that are clustered then the average number of keys to try is reduced to N/4 (worst case is N-1 keys).  If three keys cluster than average attempt is only N/6 attempts.
