A Common Berthing Mechanism consists of two components: the Active Common Berthing Mechanism (ACBM) and the Passive Common Berthing Mechanism (PCBM).<ref name="cbm-tech">{{PDFlink|[http://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/design_lib/ICES01-2435.ISS_CBM.pdf The Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) for International Space Station]|923 [[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 945909 bytes -->}}</ref> Once connected, the two sides of the CBM form a pressure tight seal. The CBM also features a hatch, which can be opened to reveal a 50 inch (127 cm) diameter passage for crew/cargo transfer. Since this passage is large enough to allow [[International Standard Payload Rack]]s to fit, payloads can be pre-configured in racks and transported to the station aboard the [[Multi-Purpose Logistics Module]]s, which use CBM ports. Once the hatches have been opened, electrical, data, and fluid lines can be manually connected through the CBM vestibule by the crew.
The Common Berthing Mechanism was first used to connect the ''[[Unity (ISS module)|Unity]]'' and the [[Integrated Truss Structure#Z1 truss|Z1 truss]] of the International Space Station.<ref name="cbm-tech" />

The CBM is to be used as a berthing mechanism for the unmanned Japanese [[H-II Transfer Vehicle]] (HTV). Future support spacecraft such as the [[Cygnus spacecraft|Cygnus]] resupply vehicle, and the [[SpaceX Dragon]] capsule are also designed to connect using a CBM. These spacecraft will feature a PCBM, and will be berthed to one of the station's open ACBMs using the station's robot arm.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Each CBM compatible module that connects to previously launched modules requires a PCBM to connect to an APCM.<ref name="cbm-tech" /> The three ISS connecting nodes feature four radial ACBM ports. ''Unity'' features two ACBM on the axial side, while ''[[Harmony (ISS module)|Harmony]]'' and ''[[Tranquility (ISS module)|Tranquility]]'' feature a PCBM on one axial side and an ACBM on the other axial side.<ref name="node2-design">{{cite book|title=SM98-110/254 International Space Station Node 2 - Structure Design Analysis and Static Test Definition|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1999ESASP.428..173G&db_key=AST&page_ind=1&plate_select=NO&data_type=GIF&type=SCREEN_GIF&classic=YES|author=Gualtieri, N|coauthors=Rubino, S.; Itta, A.|isbn= 9290927127|page=174|publisher=European Space Agency}}</ref><ref name="node3-design">{{cite web|url=https://node.msfc.nasa.gov/geninfo/External/Node%203%20Description.pdf|title=Node 3 Description|publisher=NASA}}</ref> The ''[[Destiny (ISS module)|Destiny]]''' laboratory and the [[Japanese Pressurised Module]] both feature one PCBM and one ACBM.<ref name="sts-98-presskit">{{cite web|url=http://www.shuttlepresskit.com/Sts-98/index.htm|title=STS-98 Presskit|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2010-02-08|date=2001-02-07}}</ref><ref name="pm-cbm">{{cite web|url=http://kibo.jaxa.jp/en/about/kibo/jpm/|title=Pressurized Module:About Kibo - Kibo Japanese Experimental Module|publisher=JAXA|accessdate=2010-02-08|date=2008-08-29}}</ref>
