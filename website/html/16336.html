'''Harry Nyquist''' (''né'' Harry Theodor Nyqvist; {{IPA-en|ˈnaɪkwɪst}}, {{IPA-sv|nʏːkvɪst|lang}}; February 7, 1889 – April 4, 1976) was an important contributor to [[information theory]].

==Personal life==
Nyquist was born in the [[Stora Kil]] parish of [[Nilsby, Sweden|Nilsby]], [[Värmland]], [[Sweden]]. He was the son of Lars Jonsson Nyqvist (b. 1847) and  Katrina Eriksdotter (b. 1857). His parents had seven children: Elin Teresia, Astrid, Selma, Harry Theodor, Aemelie, Olga Maria, and Axel. He emigrated to the [[United States|USA]] in 1907.

==Education==

He entered the [[University of North Dakota]] in 1912 and received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering in 1914 and 1915, respectively. He received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in physics at [[Yale University]] in 1917.

==Career==
He worked at [[AT&T Corp.|AT&T]]'s Department of Development and Research from 1917 to 1934, and continued when it became [[Bell Laboratories|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] in that year, until his retirement in 1954.

Nyquist received the [[IEEE Medal of Honor|IRE Medal of Honor]] in 1960 for "fundamental contributions to a quantitative understanding of thermal noise, data transmission and negative feedback."  
In October 1960 he was awarded the Stuart Ballantine Medal of the [[Franklin Institute]] "for his theoretical analyses and practical inventions in the field of communications systems during the past forty years including, particularly, his original work in the theories of telegraph transmission, thermal noise in electric conductors, and in the history of feedback systems." 
In 1969 he was awarded the [[National Academy of Engineering]]'s fourth Founder's Medal "in recognition of his many fundamental contributions to engineering."

Nyquist lived in [[Pharr, Texas]] after his retirement, and died in [[Harlingen, Texas]] on April 4, 1976.

== Technical contributions==

As an engineer at Bell Laboratories, Nyquist did important work on thermal noise ("[[Johnson–Nyquist noise]]")<ref> H. Nyquist, "Thermal Agitation of Electric Charge in Conductors", Phys. Rev., Vol. 32, pp. 110-113, 1928</ref>, the stability of [[feedback]] [[amplifier]]s, telegraphy, [[fax|facsimile]], television, and other important communications problems.  With [[Herbert E. Ives]], he helped to develop [[AT&T]]'s first facsimile machines that were made public in 1924. In 1932, he published a classical paper on stability of feedback amplifiers.<ref>H. Nyquist, "Regeneration theory", Bell System Technical Journal, vol. 11, pp. 126-147, 1932</ref>  The [[Nyquist stability criterion]] can now be found in all textbooks on feedback control theory.

His early theoretical work on determining the bandwidth requirements for transmitting information laid the foundations for later advances by [[Claude Shannon]], which led to the development of [[information theory]].  In particular, Nyquist determined that the number of independent pulses that could be put through a telegraph channel per unit time is limited to twice the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the channel, and published his results in the paper ''Certain topics in Telegraph Transmission Theory'' (1924).<ref>Nyquist, Harry. "Certain factors affecting telegraph speed". ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]'', 3, 324–346, 1924</ref>  This rule is essentially a [[Duality_(mathematics)|dual]] of what is now known as the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]].
