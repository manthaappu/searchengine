<html> <head> <title>Picolisp</title></head><body>'''PicoLisp''' is an [[Open source software|open source]] [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] dialect. It
runs on [[Linux]] and other [[POSIX]]-compliant systems.

== Features ==

Its most prominent feature is "simplicity". It is built on top of a single
internal [[data type]] (cell), without giving up flexibility and expressive
power. On the language level, it supports just three data types (numbers,
symbols and lists), constructed from internal cells.

Because the only [[S-expression|non-atomic]] data type is the linked list, many
interoperable functions exist that concentrate on [[list processing]]. As a
result, PicoLisp programs are often more succinct - and at the same time faster
- than those of other interpreted languages (see examples in
[http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:PicoLisp rosettacode.org]).

[[Function (computer science)|Functions]] are free from the restrictions that
would be imposed by a [[compiler]], and can so accept arbitrary types and
numbers of arguments. Macros are needed only in rare cases.

A special feature is the intrinsic [[database]] functionality. Persistent
symbols are [[first-class object]]s, they are loaded from database files
automatically when accessed, and written back when modified. Applications are
written using a [[class hierarchy]] of [[Entity-relationship model|entities and
relations]].

Furthermore: [[Prolog]] engine and database queries, distributed databases,
inlining of [[C (programming language)|C language]] functions and native C
function calls, child process management, [[interprocess communication]],
Browser GUI, [[Internationalization and localization|internationalization]].

== History ==

Originally developed on the [[Apple Macintosh]] in the 1980s, and used in
commercial application development since then. It was soon ported to [[MS-DOS]]
and [[SCO Unix]], and used mainly on Linux since 1993. Database functionality
was added in the mid-1990s.

While the first versions were written in a mix of C and [[Assembly language]], a
first rewrite from scratch was done in 1999 completely in C. That version was
released 2002 under the [[GNU GPL]] license, and changed to a MIT/X11 license in
2010.

In 2009 the [[64-bit]] version was released, another rewrite, this time written
in a generic assembler which in turn is implemented in PicoLisp.

A [[Java (programming language)|Java]] version was released in December 2010.[http://software-lab.de/ersatz/README]
