The '''RubySpec''' project aims to write a complete executable specification for the [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby programming language]]. This project contains specs that describe Ruby language syntax and [[Standard library|standard library]] classes. The project contains two main components:
* the RubySpec sources
* the MSpec framework

The RubySpec test suite captures most of 1.8.6/1.8.7/1.9  behavior as a reference conformance tool. [[Ruby MRI]] 1.9.2 currently passes over 99% of RubySpec.<ref>{{cite web

==History==
The RubySpec tests were initially created in 2006 for the [[Rubinius]] project, with significant contribution from the [[JRuby]] project<ref>{{cite web
| url=http://www.rubyspec.org/
| title=RubySpec
| quote=''The project began as part of Rubinius (now sponsored by Engine Yard) and most of the work was done by contributors to Rubinius, with significant contribution by JRuby collaborators. Engine Yard has provided extensive financial support for this project, employing Evan Phoenix since June 2007 and several more full-time developers since January 2008. See History for more details of the project's timeline.''| accessdate=2010-10-23}}</ref>. It is now used in other Ruby implementation projects such as [[IronRuby]]<ref>{{cite web
| url=http://github.com/ironruby/ironruby/wiki/RubySpec
| title=RubySpec
| quote=''The IronRuby GIT repo includes a copy of the RubySpec tests, including the MSpec test framework, under External.LCA_RESTRICTED\Languages\IronRuby\mspec. This makes it easy to modify existing tests or write new tests, and fix the bugs in the IronRuby sources, all in a single commit to the IronRuby repo.''| accessdate=2010-10-23}}</ref>.
