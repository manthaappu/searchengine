'''mSQL-JDBC''' (aka Soul) is an [[Open Source]] Type IV [[JDBC]] driver for the [[mSQL]] [[database]] engine created by [[George Reese (computer programmer)|George Reese]]. It is written 100% in the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programming language and uses the native mSQL network protocols to talk to mSQL. The driver supports as much of the JDBC specification as the mSQL database will support, but development on the driver basically ceased in 1997. The driver therefore does not support the most recent releases (3.0 and above) of mSQL.

mSQL-JDBC was renamed '''Soul''' in 1997, though few packages exist under that name.
