'''Marvin Lee Minsky''' (born August 9, 1927) is an [[United States|American]] [[cognitive scientist]] in the  field  of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI), co-founder of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s AI laboratory, and  author of several texts on AI and [[philosophy]].

==Biography==
Marvin Lee Minsky was born in [[New York City]] to a [[Jewish]] family,<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=LJQjKkphxjUC&pg=PA188&dq=marvin+minsky+jewish&hl=en&ei=QC_WTNf1EsK5jAeLg-24CQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=marvin%20minsky%20jewish&f=false Science in the contemporary world: an encyclopedia]</ref> where he attended [[The Fieldston School]] and the [[Bronx High School of Science]]. He later attended [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]]. He served in the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] from 1944 to 1945. He holds a BA in Mathematics from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] (1950) and a PhD in the same field from [[Princeton University|Princeton]] (1954).<ref name="AIMag80th">{{cite journal

He is currently the Toshiba Professor of [[Media Arts]] and Sciences, and Professor of [[electrical engineering]] and [[computer science]].

Minsky won the [[Turing Award]] in 1969, the [[Japan Prize]] in 1990, the [[IJCAI Award for Research Excellence]] in 1991, and the [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (Franklin Institute)|Benjamin Franklin Medal]] from the [[Franklin Institute]] in 2001.<ref name="franklinmedal">[http://www.fi.edu/winners/2001/minsky_marvin.faw?winner_id=3528 Marvin Minsky - The Franklin Institute Awards - Laureate Database].

[[Isaac Asimov]] described Minsky as one of only two people he would admit were more intelligent than he was, the other being [[Carl Sagan]].<ref>{{cite book | title=In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954-1978 | author=Isaac Asimov | page=217,302 | publisher=Doubleday/Avon | year=1980 | isbn= 0-380-53025-2}}</ref>  [[Patrick Winston]] has also described Minsky as the smartest person he has ever met.  [[Ray Kurzweil]] has referred to Minsky as his mentor.

Minsky's inventions include the first head-mounted graphical display (1963) and the [[confocal microscope]]<ref>The patent for Minsky's Microscopy Apparatus was applied for in 1957, and subsequently granted US Patent Number 3,013,467 in 1961. According to his published biography on the MIT Media Lab webpage, "In 1956, when a Junior Fellow at Harvard, Minsky invented and built the first Confocal Scanning Microscope, an optical instrument with unprecedented resolution and image quality".</ref> (1957, a predecessor to today's widely used [[confocal laser scanning microscope]]).  He developed, with [[Seymour Papert]], the first [[Logo programming language|Logo]] "[[turtle (robot)|turtle]]".  Minsky also built, in 1951, the first randomly wired neural network learning machine, [[SNARC]].

Minsky wrote the book ''[[Perceptrons (book)|Perceptrons]]'' (with [[Seymour Papert]]), which became the foundational work in the analysis of [[artificial neural network]]s. This book is the center of a controversy in the history of AI, as some claim it to have had great importance in driving research away from neural networks in the 1970s, and contributing to the so-called [[AI winter]]. That said, few of the mathematical proofs present in the book, which are still important and interesting to the study of [[perceptron]] networks, were ever countered.
He also founded several other famous AI models. His book "A framework for representing knowledge" created a new paradigm in programming. While his "Perceptrons" now is more historical than practical book, the theory of frames is in wide use.
Minsky was an adviser<ref>For more, see this interview, http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/Hal/chap2/two3.html</ref> on the movie [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|''2001: A Space Odyssey'']] and is referred to in the movie and book.

{{quote|Probably no one would ever know this; it did not matter. In the 1980s, Minsky and Good had shown how neural networks could be generated automatically—self replicated—in accordance with any arbitrary learning program. Artificial brains could be grown by a process strikingly analogous to the development of a human brain. In any given case, the precise details would never be known, and even if they were, they would be millions of times too complex for human understanding.|Arthur C. Clarke|''2001: A Space Odyssey''<ref>Clarke, Arthur C.: "2001: A Space Odyssey"</ref>}}

In the early 1970s at the [[MIT]] Artificial Intelligence Lab, Minsky and [[Seymour Papert]] started developing what came to be called [[The Society of Mind]] theory.  The theory attempts to explain how what we call intelligence could be a product of the interaction of non-intelligent parts.  Minsky says that the biggest source of ideas about the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm, a video camera, and a computer to build with children's blocks.  In 1986, Minsky published ''[[The Society of Mind]]'', a comprehensive book on the theory which, unlike most of his previously published work, was written for a [[general audience]].

In November 2006, Minsky published ''[[The Emotion Machine]]'', a book that critiques many popular theories of how human minds work and suggests alternative theories, often replacing simple ideas with more complex ones.

==Personal life==
[[Image:Minskytron-PDP-1-20070512.jpg|thumb|The Minskytron or "Three Position Display" running on the [[Computer History Museum]]'s [[PDP-1]], 2007]]

Minsky is an actor in an [[hacker koan|artificial intelligence koan]] (attributed to his student, [[Danny Hillis]]) from the [[Jargon file]]:

::In the days when [[Gerald Jay Sussman|Sussman]] was a novice, Minsky once came to him as he sat hacking at the [[PDP-6]].
::"What are you doing?" asked Minsky.
::"I am training a randomly wired [[neural net]] to play [[Tic-tac-toe]]," Sussman replied.
::"Why is the net wired randomly?", asked Minsky.
::"I do not want it to have any preconceptions of how to play," Sussman said.
::Minsky then shut his eyes.
::"Why do you close your eyes?" Sussman asked his teacher.
::"So that the room will be empty."
::At that moment, Sussman was enlightened.

<blockquote>  	 
What I actually said was, "If you wire it randomly, it will still have preconceptions of how to play. But you just won't know what those preconceptions are." --Marvin Minsky 
</blockquote>

Minsky has three children: Henry Minsky, Julie Minsky and Margaret Minsky, who is herself a Doctor of Philosophy from MIT, with a special interest in [[Haptic technology]].<ref>[http://margaretminsky.com/ Margaret Minksy's website]</ref> He also has four grandchildren: Gigi Minsky, Harry Minsky, Charlotte Minsky and Miles Steele.
