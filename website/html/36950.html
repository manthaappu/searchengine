<html> <head> <title>Technorealism</title></head><body>'''Technorealism''' is an attempt to expand the middle ground between [[Techno-utopianism]] and [[Neo-Luddism]] by assessing the social and political implications of [[technology|technologies]] so that people might all have more control over the shape of their [[future]]. The technorealist approach involves a continuous critical examination of how technologies might help or hinder people in the struggle to improve the quality of their lives, their communities, and their economic, social, and political structures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.technorealism.org/ |title=Technorealism |accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref>

Although technorealism began with a focus on U.S.-based concerns about [[information technology]], it has evolved into an international intellectual movement with a variety of interests such as [[biotechnology]] and [[nanotechnology]].<ref name="Berkman Center for Internet and Society 1998">{{cite paper|    author =  Berkman Center for Internet & Society|    title = Conference on Technorealism: How should we think about technology|    date = 1998 |      url = http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/technorealism/| accessdate=2007-02-06}}</ref>
