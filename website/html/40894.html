'''Yellow Dog Enterprise Linux''' (YDEL) is a [[board support package]] built upon the world renowned [[Yellow Dog Linux]] OS, coupled with support for every [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell/B.E.]] based system on the market today.

As the Cell/B.E. [[Multi-core processor|multi-core]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]] offers astonishing performance capability for optimized code on a unique offering of [[hardware]] from select [[vendor]]s, it is critical that the development environment is complete, the deployment simple, and the [[runtime environment]] be treated as mission critical.

The World's Only Enterprise [[Linux]] Built Specifically for Cell/B.E that minimizes the challenge of unlocking the Cell/B.E.'s potential, giving you the strongest foundation for code development and [[deployment]] with the world's leading Cell/B.E. optimization team standing behind you. 

==Yellow Dog Enterprise Linux for nVIDIA CUDA==

YDEL is an [[open source]], Linux [[operating system]] built for faster, easier, and more reliable [[Graphics processing unit|GPU Computing]]. YDEL goes beyond the basic Linux OS and integrates GPU robustness and developmental tools. Developers, end users, and integrators will have the support of the biggest team of experts with over a decade of Linux and multicore development experience.

YDEL dependability empowers your team to focus on your productivity and projects instead of administering Linux.

YDEL for [[CUDA]] is the first enterprise Linux operating system built for faster, easier, and more reliable GPU Computing. YDEL goes beyond the basic Linux OS and integrates GPU robustness and developmental tools.
