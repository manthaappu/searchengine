<html> <head> <title>PTAS reduction</title></head><body>In [[computational complexity theory]], a '''PTAS reduction''' is a [[reduction (complexity)|reduction]] that is often used to perform reductions between solutions to [[optimization problem]]s. It preserves the property that a problem has a [[polynomial time approximation scheme]] (PTAS) and is used to define [[complete (complexity)|completeness]] for certain classes of [[optimization problem]]s such as [[APX]]. Notationally, if there is a PTAS reduction from a problem A to a problem B, we write <math>\text{A} \leq_{\text{PTAS}} \text{B}</math>.

With ordinary [[polynomial-time many-one reduction]]s, if we can describe a reduction from a problem A to a problem B, then any polynomial-time solution for B can be composed with that reduction to obtain a polynomial-time solution for the problem A. Similarly, our goal in defining PTAS reductions is so that given a PTAS reduction from an optimization problem A to a problem B, a PTAS for B can be composed with the reduction to obtain a PTAS for the problem A.

Formally, we define a PTAS reduction from A to B using three polynomial-time computable functions, ''f'', ''g'', and ''&alpha;'', with the following properties:

* ''f'' maps instances of problem A to instances of problem B.
* ''g'' takes an instance ''x'' of problem A, an approximate solution to the corresponding problem <math>f(x)</math> in B, and an error parameter &epsilon; and produces an approximate solution to ''x''.
* ''&alpha;'' maps error parameters for solutions to instances of problem A to error parameters for solutions to problem B.
* If the solution ''y'' to <math>f(x)</math> (an instance of problem B) is at most <math>1 + \alpha(\epsilon)</math> times worse than the optimal solution, then the corresponding solution <math>g(x,y,\epsilon)</math> to ''x'' (an instance of problem A) is at most <math>1 + \epsilon</math> times worse than the optimal solution.

From this definition it is straightforward to show that:
* <math>\text{A} \leq_{\text{PTAS}} \text{B}</math> and <math>\text{B} \in \text{PTAS} \implies \text{A} \in \text{PTAS}</math>
* <math>\text{A} \leq_{\text{PTAS}} \text{B}</math> and <math>\text{A} \not\in \text{PTAS} \implies \text{B} \not\in \text{PTAS}</math>
* <math>\text{A} \leq_{\text{PTAS}} \text{B}</math> and <math>\text{B} \in \text{APX} \implies \text{A} \in \text{APX}</math>
