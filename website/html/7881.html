<html> <head> <title>Construction collaboration technology</title></head><body>'''Construction collaboration technology''' refers to software applications used to enable effective sharing of project-related information between geographically-dispersed members of a [[construction]] project team, often through use of a web-based [[Software as a service]] platform.

==History==
The phrase was coined in 2003 when seven [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based vendors joined together to form the Network for Construction Collaboration Technology Providers (NCCTP), to promote the benefits and use of collaborative technologies in the [[architecture]], [[engineering]], construction (AEC) and related industries.<ref>[http://www.cnplus.co.uk/news/software-body/845778.article "Eight construction software providers are joining forces to form a representative body", ''Construction News'' 16 January 2003]</ref>

The phrase was preferred to the then commonly-used term 'project [[extranet]]' which was felt might exclude use of the platforms for multi-project programmes of work, or for post-construction collaboration - e.g.: for [[facilities management]].<ref>Wilkinson, P. (2005) ''Construction Collaboration Technologies: The Extranet Evolution'' Taylor & Francis, London, pp.6-7.</ref> It also supported progressive moves within the UK construction industry to promote more collaborative or integrated approaches following the 1994 [[Latham Report|Latham]] and 1998 [[Egan Report]]s. For example, Sir John Egan's follow-up report, ''Accelerating Change'' in 2002, recommended:

:'Integrated teams, created at the optimal time in the process and ''using an integrated IT approach'', that fully release the contribution each can make and equitably share risk and reward in a non-adversarial way.' (p.10, emphasis added)<ref>Egan, J. (2002) ''Accelerating Change'': Consultation Paper by Strategic Forum for Construction, London: HMSO.</ref>

Other descriptions such as 'construction [[project management]]' or 'construction [[document management]]' were seen as confusing or misleading, being associated more with scheduling tools (e.g.: [[Microsoft Project]]) or with generic electronic document management systems (e.g.: [[Documentum]]) that could not easily handle AEC-oriented requirements for dispersed teams.

==Characteristics==
Essentially, construction collaboration technologies are deployed to support the requirements of a multi-disciplinary construction project team. This is typically drawn from multiple companies, all based in different locations with their own IT systems, and is brought together – usually temporarily – to plan, design, construct and, in some cases, to operate and maintain the resulting built asset.<ref>http://ncctp.constructingexcellence.org.uk/about_ct.jsp Collaboration Technologies Explained (NCCTP)</ref>

Construction collaboration technologies replace localised sets of data held by individual team members or companies. A centralised repository or data store is created that can be accessed by all authorised team members, usually using a lowest common denominator technology: a computer equipped with an internet browser and a telecommunications link to the internet. The platforms' functionality also reflects the industry's extensive use of graphical information - most notably design drawings - and the need to be able to access, view, mark-up and comment on designs.

The core characteristics of construction collaboration technologies can be summarised<ref>Wilkinson, P. (2005), pp.65-94.</ref> as:
* Organisation features (i.e.: security settings, user administration, information administration)
* Communication features (i.e.: file publication, management, feedback)
* Management features (i.e.: management of specific workflows, teams, work packages, multiple projects, standards)
* Sharing, viewing and working with [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]-based drawings (including use of viewing tools)

Reflecting the need to encourage take-up and active use of their platforms, the leading UK construction collaboration technology vendors all adopted a similar charging structure. Rather than charging companies per-user or per-seat licenses, the applications were typically licensed per-project, with customers paying a single subscription (typically monthly or quarterly) for the duration of the planning, design and construction process, and allowing use by all companies in the project's supply chain.

==Vendors==
The founder members of the NCCTP were (in alphabetical order): [[4Projects]], Asite, [[BIW Technologies]], BuildOnline (today [[Sword-CTSpace]]), [[Cadweb]], [[Causeway Technologies]] and [[Sarcophagus Ltd|Sarcophagus]]. Business Collaborator (today UNIT4 Collaboration Software) and [[Aconex]] joined shortly afterwards. The NCCTP was initially managed by [[CIRIA]] before becoming a membership forum within [[Constructing Excellence]] in August 2007.

Other vendors/products in this sector include (in alphabetical order): [[Autodesk]]'s Buzzsaw and Constructware platforms, [[Bentley Systems]]' ProjectWise, Bricsnet, Conject, CoreCon, ePin, Kalexo, Incite, iSite, Meridian Systems' Prolog, Proliance and ProTalk platforms, and Woobius. There are also construction-oriented implementations of [[Microsoft]]'s [[SharePoint]] platform, e.g.: Cadac's Organice, ProgramNetInc's ProgramNet Portal and CMBoost.
