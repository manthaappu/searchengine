The '''Homeland Security Digital Library''' (HSDL) is a collection of documents related to [[homeland security]] policy, strategy, and organizational management of the [[United States]]. Library access is offered to U.S. citizens who are federal, state, tribal, and local [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] officials; members of the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]]; homeland security researchers and academics; or security staff protecting organizations vital to U.S. infrastructure.

The mission of the Homeland Security Digital Library (HSDL) is to strengthen the [[national security]] of the United States by supporting federal, state, local, and tribal analysis, debate, and decision-making needs and to assist academics of all disciplines in homeland defense and security related research.

== History ==
Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|events of September 11, 2001]]  and the government response to address the security of the country, there was a recognized need for a formal [[higher education]] program that would discuss and debate strategic solutions for the new critical issues and threats facing our country. In response, the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] (NPS), with the sponsorship of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], launched a [[Academic degree|graduate degree]] program in 2002.  The program’s initial requirements called for development of the Homeland Security Digital Library (HSDL), an online resource designed to support NPS’ new homeland security master’s students, and to capture and archive the current homeland security debate.  Since then, the HSDL has become the major digital library for homeland security scholars and professionals; it serves almost 15,000 individual account holders and gives general access to over 500 different government agencies and educational or research institutions.  The library is currently in partnership with the [[United States Government Printing Office|Government Printing Office]] and the [[Institute for Information Infrastructure Protection|I3P Institute]]. The HSDL can be easily summed up by its tagline, “Securing the Homeland Through the Power of Information.”

== Content ==
'''General Collection'''
The HSDL’s General Collection contains over 65,000 documents covering a range of historical and contemporary issues in homeland security and its related fields.  The collection includes [[open source]] material from a wide variety of sources including federal, state and [[local government]]; international governments and institutions; [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit organizations]]; and private entities.  [[Special collections]] include a large number of homeland security related [[Congressional Research Service reports|Congressional Research Reports]] (CRS), [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) hearings and testimony, national strategy  and policy documents, and state and local government plans and policies.   In addition to text-based material, the digital collection contains other media formats such as maps, images, video, audio and websites.
Within the General Collection, HSDL content team members have designated special smaller collections of key documents that provide easy, direct access to major legislation, significant policy, [[presidential directive]]s, executive orders Homeland Security theses and the latest documents of topical interest or potential importance. 

'''Restricted Collection'''
The Restricted Collection contains sensitive materials collected from national, state and local fusion centers, threat analysis centers, and law enforcement organizations. (Access to this section is restricted to U.S. government officials and requires prior approval by HSDL staff.)

'''News Digest Collection'''
The News Digest Collection includes documents, both current and archival, covering intelligence, infrastructure, [[terrorism]] and other homeland security concerns.

'''I3P Cyber Infrastructure Collection'''
The cyber infrastructure collection is a partnership of the Institute for Information Infrastructure Protection (I3P)[http://www.thei3p.org/] and the HSDL. It is focused on identification of information assets in the broad area of information infrastructure protection and [[Computer security|cyber security]]. The I3P's effort in this partnership was sponsored by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST)[http://www.nist.gov/].

== Public resources ==
'''HSDL Blog:''' ''On the Homefront'' – The HSDL blog is an open listing of homeland security related documents that are rapidly posted as they become available to the public.  Each blog entry includes a link and a short summary plus any additional helpful information.  Homeland security professionals can also find listings of current homeland security events (e.g., conferences and workshops).  Blog posts are available via [[RSS]] and on [[Twitter]].  Other public resources on the HSDL site include a customized search of selected homeland security blogs, and resource pages for grants, homeland security books and journal sources.

== Technology ==

The HSDL technical infrastructure relies on a number of open-source [[web application]]s.  The library’s interface to its patrons is custom-developed web code built upon the [[Apache Solr|SOLR]] [[search engine]].  The library content team currently uses Scout Portal Toolkit (SPT)[http://scout.wisc.edu/Projects/SPT/] to input and manage the collections’ metadata.  On the Homefront, the library’s blog and the events and conferences calendar use the [[Drupal]] [http://drupal.org/] CMS). These three applications, in addition to the custom code developed around them, are all open-source [[LAMP (software bundle)|LAMP]] environments (linux, apache, mysql and php).  The Homeland Security Blog search is maintained with a [[Google Co-op|Google Custom Search]] [http://www.google.com/coop/cse/] appliance.
