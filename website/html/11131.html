<html> <head> <title>Dry loop</title></head><body>A '''dry loop''' (also known as a '''dry pair''') is an unconditioned leased pair of [[telephone line|telephone wire]] from a [[telephone company|Telco]]. The pair does not have a [[dial-tone]] or "battery" (continuous [[electric potential]]), as opposed to a "wet pair" (a line usually with no dial tone but with battery). 

A dry pair was originally used with a security system, but more recently may also be used with [[Digital_Subscriber_Line|DSL]] equipment <ref>[http://web0.lightlink.com/cgi-bin/gopher-gateway.pl?loc=gopher://gopher.lightlink.com:70/00/swem-l/sn0300.script%09%09+ Local Area Data Circuit]</ref> or an [[Ethernet extender]] to connect two locations, as opposed to a costlier means such as [[frame relay]]. The pair in many cases goes through the local [[central office]].
Many carriers market dry loops to independent DSL providers, as a '''BANA''' for '''basic analog loop''' or in some locales '''PANA''' for '''plain analog loop''', '''OPX''' ('''off-premise extension''') line, '''paging circuit''', or finally '''LADS''' ('''local area data service''').

== Pricing ==
In the [[United States]], these circuits typically incur a monthly recurring charge (MRC) of $3.00 per 1/4 mile (approximately), plus an additional handling fee of around ($5-10).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
