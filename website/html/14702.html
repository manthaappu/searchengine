<html> <head> <title>Galahad library</title></head><body>The '''Galahad library''' is a thread-safe [[library]] of packages for the solution of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]—or [[mathematical programming]]—problems. The areas covered by the library are unconstrained and bound-constrained optimization, [[quadratic programming]], [[nonlinear programming]], systems of nonlinear equations and inequalities, and nonlinear [[least squares]] problems. The library is mostly written in the [[Fortran|Fortran 90]] programming language.

The name of the library originates from its major package for general [[nonlinear programming]], LANCELOT-B, the successor of the original augmented lagrangian package LANCELOT of Conn, Gould and Toint [1].

Other packages in the library include

* a filter-based method for systems of linear and nonlinear equations and inequalities,
* an active-set method for nonconvex [[quadratic programming]],
* a primal-dual interior-point method for nonconvex [[quadratic programming]],
* a presolver for quadratic programs,
* a [[Lanczos]] method for trust-region subproblems,
* an interior-point method to solve [[linear programming|linear programs]] or separable [[convex optimization|convex programs]] or alternatively, to compute the analytic center of a set defined by such constraints, if it exists.

Packages in the GALAHAD library accept problems modeled in either the [http://www.numerical.rl.ac.uk/lancelot/sif/sifhtml.html Standard Input Format] (SIF) or the [[AMPL|AMPL modeling language]]. For problems modeled in the SIF, the GALAHAD library naturally relies upon the [[CUTEr]] package, an optimization toolbox providing all low-level functionalities required by solvers.

The library is available on several popular computing platforms, including Compaq (DEC) Alpha, Cray, HP, IBM RS/6000, Intel-like PCs, SGI and Sun. It is designed to be easily adapted to other platforms. Support is provided for many operating systems, including [[Digital UNIX]], [[Tru64 UNIX]], [[Linux]], [[HP-UX]], [[AIX operating system|AIX]], [[Irix|IRIX]] and [[Solaris Operating System|Solaris]], and for a variety of popular [[Fortran|Fortran 90]] compilers on these platforms and operating systems.

The GALAHAD Library is authored and maintained by N.I.M. Gould, D. Orban and Ph.L. Toint.
