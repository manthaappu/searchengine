<html> <head> <title>Sparse language</title></head><body>In [[computational complexity theory]], a '''sparse language''' is a [[formal language]] (a set of [[String (computer science)|strings]]) such that the number of strings of length ''n'' in the language is bounded by a [[polynomial]] function of ''n''. They are used primarily in the study of the relationship of the complexity class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' with other classes. The [[complexity class]] of all sparse languages is called '''SPARSE'''.

Sparse languages are called ''sparse'' because there are a total of 2<sup>''n''</sup> strings of length ''n'', and if a language only contains polynomially many of these, then the proportion of strings of length ''n'' that it contains rapidly goes to zero as ''n'' grows. All [[unary language]]s are sparse. An example of a nontrivial sparse language is the set of binary strings containing exactly ''k'' 1 bits for some fixed ''k''; for each ''n'', there are only [[Binomial coefficient|<math>\binom{n}{k}</math>]] strings in the language, which is bounded by ''n''<sup>''k''</sup>.

'''SPARSE''' contains '''TALLY''', the class of [[unary language]]s, since these have at most one string of any one length. Although not all languages in '''[[P/poly]]''' are sparse, there is a [[polynomial-time Turing reduction]] from any language in '''P/poly''' to a sparse language.<ref>Jin-Yi Cai.
