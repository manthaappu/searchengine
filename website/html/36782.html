'''Tactical Munitions Recording System''' (TMRS), not to be confused with TRMS, is a database management program used for tracking and reporting important information about tactical missiles and missile components. TMRS is designed to give the missile maintenance or storage manager visibility of missile and component identification, inspection, [[Technical order|time-compliance technical order]] (TCTO), time change, serviceability and location data. It was developed in a windowed menu format for easy use and operation.

The program allows users to track and maintain air-to-air and air-to-ground missile systems. This includes both All-Up-Rounds (AURS), unassembled components and their support equipment.
