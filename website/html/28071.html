'''Provider Edge router''' ('''PE router''') is a [[router]] between one [[computer network|network]] service provider's area and areas administered by other network providers. A network provider is usually an [[Internet Service Provider]] as well (or only that).

The term ''PE router'' covers equipment capable of a broad range of [[routing]] [[Communications protocol|protocol]]s, notably:
*[[Border Gateway Protocol]] (BGP)
*[[Open Shortest Path First]] (OSPF)
*[[Multi-protocol label switching|Multi-Protocol Label Switching]] (MPLS)

PE routers need not be aware of what kind of traffic is coming from the provider's network. However, some PE routers also do labeling.
