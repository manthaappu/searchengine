<html> <head> <title>Signwave</title></head><body>'''Signwave''' is a small independent company, based in [[London]], [[England]] specialising in [[software]] production, but is heavily influenced by the [[arts]]. Despite releasing some conventional [[shareware]] and desktop [[application software|applications]], Signwave have also received attention and awards from arts organisations such as [[Transmediale]] and [[Ars Electronica]] for their [[software art|software artworks]].

Typically their software challenges the traditional notions of functionality and efficiency as key selling points of [[proprietary software]], instead focussing on the role of the [[author]]/[[artist]] as a creative role. When considering the role of the [[programmer]] in the production of software, their products can be seen in a new light: that of programming as a creative expression, and of proprietary software as an artefact or [[Work of art|artwork]]. This contentious issue is hotly debated, with people on both the 'arts' as well as the 'technology' sides of the argument denying the right of [[artist]] to the [[programmer]].

To date, Signwave have released two major software artworks, [[Autoshop]] (a parody of [[Adobe Photoshop]]), and [[Auto-Illustrator]] (a similar but more advanced parody of [[Adobe Illustrator]]), both artworks being purchasable online through the distribution of [[serial number]]s. This deliberate conflation of polemic extremes is typical of Signwave's practice, forcing a fresh consideration of the traditional values of both [[commerce]] and [[art]].
