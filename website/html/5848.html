<html> <head> <title>Change-making problem</title></head><body>The '''change-making problem''' addresses the following question: how can a given amount of money be made with the least number of coins of given denominations? It is a [[knapsack problem| knapsack type problem]], and has applications wider than just currency.

==Mathematical definition==
Given a set of integer coin values {''w''<sub>1</sub>, ''w''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''w''<sub>''n''</sub>} where ''w''<sub>1</sub> = 1 and ''w''<sub>''j''</sub> < ''w''<sub>''j''+1</sub> for 1 &le; ''j'' &le; ''n'' &minus; 1, and a positive integer ''W'', find a set of non-negative integers {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>} which minimize

: <math>\sum_{j=1}^n x_j</math>

subject to

: <math>\sum_{j=1}^n w_j x_j = W.</math>

==Methods of solving==

===Dynamic programming===
Making a list of ways to make each amount from one upwards (an example of a [[dynamic programming]] method)

===Linear programming===
[[Linear_programming#Integer_unknowns | Integer Linear Programming]] is often a quick way to solve this kind of problem, but the time it will take to resolve the problem is not certain, and may be slow in some cases

===Greedy method===
In the US (and most other) coin systems, a [[greedy algorithm]] of picking the largest denomination of coin which is not greater than the remaining amount to be made will always produce the optimal result. This is not automatically the case, though: if the coin denominations were 1, 3 and 4, then to make 6, the greedy algorithm would choose three coins (4,1,1) whereas the optimal solution is two coins (3,3)
