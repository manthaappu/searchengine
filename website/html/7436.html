<html> <head> <title>Computational photography</title></head><body>''Computational imaging'' refers to any image formation method that involves a [[digital computer]].  '''Computational photography''' refers broadly to computational imaging techniques that enhance or extend the capabilities of
[[digital photography]].  The output of these techniques is an ordinary photograph, but one that could not have been taken by a traditional [[camera]].

Its current definition, which stems from a 2004 course at
Stanford University and a 2005 symposium at MIT (see links below),
has evolved to cover a number of
subject areas in [[computer graphics]], [[computer vision]], and applied
[[optics]].  These areas are given below, organized according to a taxonomy
proposed by [[Shree K. Nayar]].  Within each area is a list of techniques, and for
each technique one or two representative papers or books are cited.
Deliberately omitted from the
taxonomy are [[image processing]] (see also [[digital image processing]])
techniques applied to traditionally captured
images in order to produce better images.  Examples of such techniques are
[[image scaling]], dynamic range compression (i.e. [[tone mapping]]),
[[color management]], image completion (a.k.a. inpainting or hole filling),
[[image compression]],  [[digital watermarking]], and artistic image effects.
Also omitted are techniques that produce [[3D scanner|range data]],
[[voxel|volume data]], [[3D model]]s, [[light field|4D light fields]],
4D, 6D, or 8D [[Bidirectional reflectance distribution function|BRDF]]s, or other high-dimensional image-based representations.

==Computational illumination==

Controlling photographic illumination in a structured fashion, then processing the captured images,
to create new images. The applications include image-based relighting, image enhancement, image deblurring, geometry/material recovery and so forth.

==Computational optics==

Capture of optically coded images, followed by computational decoding to produce new images.
[[Coded aperture]] imaging was mainly applied in astronomy or X-ray imaging to boost the image quality. Instead of a single pin-hole, a pinhole pattern is applied in imaging, and [[deconvolution]] is performed to recover the image. In [[coded exposure imaging]], the on/off state of the shutter is coded to modify the kernel of [[motion blur]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.media.mit.edu/~raskar/deblur/ |title=Coded Exposure Photography: Motion Deblurring using Fluttered Shutter |first1=Ramesh |last1=Raskar |first2=Amit |last2=Agrawal |first3=Jack |last3=Tumblin |year=2006 |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref> In this way motion deblurring becomes a [[well-conditioned problem]]. Similarly, in a lens based coded aperture, the aperture can be modified by inserting a [[broadband mask]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.media.mit.edu/~raskar/Mask/ |title=Dappled Photography: Mask Enhanced Cameras for Heterodyned Light Fields and Coded Aperture Refocusing |first1=Ashok |last1=Veeraraghavan |first2=Ramesh |last2=Raskar |first3=Amit |last3=Agrawal |first4=Ankit |last4=Mohan |first5=Jack |last5=Tumblin |year=2007 |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref> Thus, out of focus deblurring becomes a [[well-conditioned problem]]. The coded aperture can also improve the quality in light field acquisition using Hadamard transform optics.

==Computational processing==

Processing of non-optically coded images to produce new images.

==Computational sensors==

Detectors that combine sensing and
processing, typically in hardware.

==Early work in computer vision==

Although computational photography is a currently popular buzzword in computer graphics, many of its
techniques first appeared in the computer vision literature,
either under other names or within papers aimed at 3D shape analysis.
