'''Idiomag''' is a UK-based digital publishing company founded in 2006 by two [[Warwick Business School]] graduates, Andrew Davies and Ed Barrow.<ref name="guardian.co.uk">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2008/apr/07/elevatorpitchidiomagcreates|title=Elevator Pitch: Idiomag Creates a Home for Music Aggregation|date=2008-04-07|publisher=[[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=Jemima | last=Kiss | accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref> The idio [[Computing platform|platform]] allows publishers and brands to personalise their content and distribute it across multiple platforms,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://platform.idiomag.com/|title=idio's personalised publishing platform|publisher=idiomag}}</ref> which is intended to improve audience engagement and revenue.

Using this platform, a consumer site is run at idiomag.com, which delivers [[digital music]] content to its users, in the form of a daily personalised music magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/company/idiomag|title=CrunchBase profile for idiomag}}</ref> This magazine is viewed through the user’s browser, using the [[Adobe Flash Player]], and can contain the full spectrum of text, images, and video chosen for each reader based on their tastes. The user can then find concert dates, download music, and buy tickets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idiomag.com/about/|title=About idiomag}}</ref>

The site also provides a [[web widget|widget]], allowing the user’s magazine to be delivered on popular social networks such as [[Facebook]], [[MySpace]], and [[Bebo]], or on individual [[blog]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idiomag.com/widget/|title=idiomag widget}}</ref>
The site aggregates content from a range of sources, both from the mainstream music press and the [[blogosphere]], like a “glossy RSS feed”.<ref>[http://buzzshout.com/shoutblog/2006/10/23/customizing-a-magazine-to-your-taste ]</ref> Content is selected based on the user’s listening history, either manually entered or drawn from music sites such as [[Last.fm]], [[Pandora (music service)|Pandora]], and [[iLike]].<ref>http://mashable.com/2008/01/07/idiomag-social-graph-integration/</ref>

In 2009, the site released their [[API]], making idiomag's content-delivery model available to [[web application]] programmers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idiomag.com/api|title=API documentation|publisher=idiomag}}</ref>
