'''BURS''' (bottom-up rewrite system) theory tackles the problem of taking a complex [[expression (programming)|expression]] tree or [[intermediate language]] term and finding a good [[Translation#Computer_translation|translation]] to [[machine code]] for a particular [[architecture]]. Implementations of BURS often employ [[dynamic programming]] to solve this problem.

BURS can also be applied to the problem of designing an [[instruction set]] for an [[application-specific instruction-set processor]].
