<html> <head> <title>Spirit Parser Framework</title></head><body>The '''Spirit Parser Framework''' is an [[object oriented]] [[Recursive descent parser|recursive descent]] [[parser generator]] framework implemented using template [[metaprogramming]] techniques. [[Expression templates]] allow users to approximate the syntax of [[Extended Backus Naur Form]] (EBNF) completely in [[C++]]. Parser objects are composed through [[operator overloading]] and the result is a backtracking [[LL parser|LL(âˆž)]] parser that is capable of parsing rather ambiguous grammars.

Spirit can be used for both [[lexing]] and parsing, together or separately.

This framework is part of the [[Boost C++ Libraries | Boost libraries]].

== Operators ==

Because of limitations of the C++ language, the syntax of Spirit has been designed around the operator precedences of C++, while bearing resemblance to both [[Extended Backus Naur Form|EBNF]] and [[regular expressions]].

{|class="wikitable"
! syntax
! explanation
|-
| x >> y
| Match x followed by y.
|-
| *x
| Match x repeated zero or more times. (This is representing the [[Kleene star]]; C++ lacks a unary postfix [[Operator (programming)|operator]] *)
|-
| x &#124; y
| Match x.  If x does not match, try to match y.
|-
| +x
| Match x repeated one or more times.
|-
| -x
| Match x zero or one time.
|-
| x & y
| Match x and y.
|-
| x - y
| Match x but not y.
|-
| x ^ y
| Match x or y but not both.
|-
| x [ function_expression ]
| Execute the function/functor returned by function_expression, if x matched.
|-
| ( x )
| Match x  (can be used for priority grouping)
|-
| x % y
| Match one or more repetitions of x, separated by occurrences of y.
|-
| ~x
| Match anything but x  (only with character classes such as ch_p or alnum_p)

== Example ==

<source lang="cpp">
#include <boost/spirit.hpp>
#include <boost/spirit/actor.hpp>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
using namespace boost::spirit;

int main()
{
    string input;
    
    cout << "Input a line.\n";
    getline(cin, input);
    
    cout << "Got '" << input << "'.\n";
    
    unsigned count = 0;

 /*  
    Next line parses the input (input.c_str()),
        using a parser constructed with the following semantics
        (identation matches source for clarity):

     Zero or more occurrences of (
          literal string "cat" ( when matched, increment the counter "count" )
      or  any character (to move on finding the next occurrence of "cat")
     )
 */
     parse(input.c_str(),
        *(  str_p("cat") [ increment_a(count) ]
          | anychar_p
         ));
 /*
     The parser is constructed by the compiler using operator
     overloading and template matching, so the actual work is
     done within spirit::parse(), and the expression starting
     with * only initializes the rule object that the parse
     function uses.
  */
    
    // last, show results.
    cout << "The input had " << count
              << " occurrences of 'cat'\n";
    return 0;
}
</source>

Of course, there are better algorithms suited for string searching,
but this example gives an idea how to construct rules and attach
actions to them.
