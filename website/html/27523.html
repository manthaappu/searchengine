'''Open Security''' is an initiative to tackle today's mounting software security challenges.  It is based on the simple concept that any malware, including viruses, spamware, trogen, rootkits, worms, etc. share the same fundamental characteristic, that is, to conceal its identity and intention.  On the other hand, legitimate software providers have every intention to tell the world that their software will not harm customers in any means.

In the past twenty years, the number of malware has been increasing following Mooreâ€™s law to reach over millions.  The conventional method of catching the most wanted as well as the least wanted malware has been challenged as IT just cannot catch every piece of bad software in the global world.  Different companies have been looking at alternatives to replace or compensate the black list method that have been used by most of the anti-virus companies nowadays in the market place. Open Security has been advocated by various organizations as an alternative to resolve BlackList only solution.
