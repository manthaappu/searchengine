'''''XRDS: Crossroads, The ACM Magazine for Students''''', formerly called ''Crossroads'', is a quarterly [[computer science]] magazine for students, published in both print and electronic forms by the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] or ACM. The full text of every issue is available online to ACM members, with many articles selected by the editorial staff open to the general public. The first edition was published in 1994<sup>(ACM 2010)</sup>. It is run by students and supported by ACM headquarters staff, and accepts unsolicited submissions of articles targeting student readers<sup>(ACM 2010b)</sup>.

''Crossroads'' was ACM's first electronically produced publication. The magazine is distributed internationally. Issues exist for every quarter since Fall 1994, with a few extra, mid-Summer, issues <sup>(ACM 2010c)</sup>.

==Makeover==
The magazine was originally titled "Crossroads" but in May 2010, it was given a makeover and the title was replaced by the pseudo-acronym "XRDS". Prior to the makeover, the format of the magazine is similar to that of its more illustrious cousin, the [[Communications of the ACM]] where articles are summaries of interesting research papers. With the Summer 2010 issue of XRDS, ACM inaugurates a completely revamped edition of the magazine. Targeted to both graduate and undergraduate students contemplating computing careers, the newly redesigned XRDS offers breaking news and information, practical career advice, and first-hand stories and profiles of people on the front lines of the burgeoning computing field.

The new magazine and its website http://XRDS.acm.org reflect the real voices of today’s students, and will create a hub of interaction and communication for them to access.

XRDS has been designed as an easy-access resource for students who are focused on their futures. Readers now have a convenient channel to find valuable content not only on their field of study but on the student experience as well. With the magazines’ new website, students now have a central place where they can share their ideas and experiences through interactive features and by submitting articles for publication.
