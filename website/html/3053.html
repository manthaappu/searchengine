'''BASE''' ('''Bielefeld Academic Search Engine''') is a multi-disciplinary [[search engine]] to scholarly internet resources, created by [[Bielefeld University]] Library in [[Bielefeld]], [[Germany]]. It is based on search technology provided by [[Fast Search & Transfer]] (FAST), a [[Norway|Norwegian]] company.

BASE is a registered service provider for the [[Open Archives Initiative]] (OAI), and has contributed to the [[Digital Repository Infrastructure Vision for European Research]] (DRIVER) project since June 2006.

OAI metadata are "[[Web harvesting|harvested]]" for the BASE project from scientific [[Digital repository|digital repositories]] that implement the [[Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting]] (OAI-PMH), and are [[Index (search engine)|indexed]] using FAST's software.

In addition to OAI [[metadata]], the library indexes selected web sites and local data collections, all of which can be searched via a single search interface.

BASE is distinguished from commercial search engines by the following features:
* Resources are academically selected
* [[Document server]]s must comply with specific requirements of scientific quality and relevance
* Searches are provided with [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] by a data resources inventory
* [[Full text search]]es plus metadata are available (where available)
* BASE discloses resources of the [[deep Web]], which are often ignored by commercial search engines or get lost in vast quantities of hits
* Search results are displayed with precise [[Bibliographic database|bibliographic data]] (where available)
* There are several options for sorting the result list, and search results can be refined by author, resource, document type, language, etc.)
