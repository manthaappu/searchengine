==Biography==
Dr. Darema received her BS degree from the School of Physics and Mathematics of the [[University of Athens]] - Greece, and MS and Ph. D. degrees in Theoretical Nuclear Physics from the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] and the [[University of California at Davis]], respectively, where she attended as a [[Fulbright Scholar]] and a Distinguished Scholar. After Physics Research Associate positions at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], she received an APS Industrial Fellowship and became a Technical Staff Member in the Nuclear Sciences Department at [[Schlumberger Doll Research]]. Subsequently, in 1982, she joined the [[International Business Machines|IBM]] [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]] as a Research Staff Member in the Computer Sciences Department and later-on she established and became the manager of a research group at IBM Research on parallel applications. Dr. Darema was at the [[National Science Foundation]] since 1994, where she has managed the New Generation Software and Dynamic Data Driven Application Systems programs. During 1996-1998 she completed a two-year assignment at [[DARPA]]. She is now at the [[Air Force Office of Scientific Research]].
