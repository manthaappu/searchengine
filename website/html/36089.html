In [[computer science]], a '''succinct data structure''' for a given data type is a representation of the underlying combinatorial object that uses an amount of space “close” to the information theoretic lower bound, together with efficient algorithms for navigation, search, insertion and deletion operations.  The concept was introduced by Jacobson <ref name="jacobson89">{{Citation | first = Guy | last = Jacobson | title = Space-Efficient Static Trees and Graphs | isbn = 0-8186-1982-1 | doi = 10.1109/SFCS.1989.63533 | year = 1989 | pages = 549 }}</ref>, to encode [[bit vector]]s, (unlabeled) trees, and [[planar graph]]s.

A natural example is the representation of a [[binary tree]]: an arbitrary binary tree on n nodes can be represented in <math>2n + o(n)</math> bits while supporting a variety of operations on any node, which includes finding its parent, its left and right child, and returning the size of its subtree, each in constant time. The number of different binary trees on <math>n</math> nodes is <math>{\tbinom{2n}{n}}</math><math>/(n+1)</math>. For large <math>n</math>, this is about <math>4^n</math>; thus we need at least about <math>\log_2(4^n)=2n</math> bits to encode it. A succinct binary tree therefore would occupy only <math>2</math> bits per node.

A related notion is that of a [[compressed data structure]], in which the size of the data structure depends upon the particular data being represented. When the data are compressible, as is often the case in practice for natural language text, the compressed data structure can occupy substantially less space than the information-theoretic lower bound.
