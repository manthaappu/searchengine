'''synth''' is a [[skinnable]] [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[Look and feel#Look and Feel in Widget Toolkits|look and feel]], which is configured with an [[XML]] property file.

According to Sun, goals for synth were:
* Enable to create custom look without writing any code.
* Allow appearance to be configured from images.
* Provide the ability to customize the look of a component based on its named properties.
* Provide a centralized point for overriding the look of all components.
* Enable custom rendering based on images, or user-defined {{Javadoc:SE|javax/swing/plaf/synth|SynthPainter}}s. 

== History==
synth is available beginning with version '''J2SE 5.0''' of Java (see [[Java version history]]).

[[Java version history#Java SE 6 Update 10|Java SE 6 Update 10]] release and newer contain ''Nimbus'', a cross-platform Look and Feel implemented with Synth.  However, for backwards compatibility, Metal is still the default Swing look and feel.<ref>{{cite web

==Architecture==
Synth is a skinnable look and feel in which all painting is delegated to the components, without having to write any code (see {{Javadoc:SE|package=Synth Look and Feel|javax/swing/plaf/synth}}). 

However synth does not provide a default look, and components that are not defined in the synth [[XML]] file will not be painted. It is however possible to assign a default style to all other widgets, and customize styles for some specific widgets only.

==Example==
The following XML declaration defines a style named textfield and binds it to all text fields. The ''defaultStyle'' allows to set a default font, foreground and background colors to all other widgets. 
 <source lang="xml">
 <synth>
  <style id="defaultStyle">
    <font name="Verdana" size="16"/>
    <state>
      <color value="WHITE" type="BACKGROUND"/>
      <color value="BLACK" type="FOREGROUND"/>
    </state>
  </style>
  <bind style="defaultStyle" type="region" key=".*"/>
  <style id="textfield">
    <state>
      <color value="yellow" type="BACKGROUND"/>
    </state>
    <imagePainter method="textFieldBorder" path="textfieldborder.png"
                  sourceInsets="5 6 6 7" paintCenter="false"/>
    <insets top="5" left="6" bottom="6" right="7"/>
  </style>
  <bind style="textfield" type="region" key="TextField"/>
 </synth>
 </source>

Supposing that the XML declaration is defined in a file named ''synthExample.xml'', the following code loads the XML definition file and sets the current look and feel to synth (loading a synth Look and Feel is done using the ''load'' method of the {{Javadoc:SE|javax/swing/plaf/synth|SynthLookAndFeel}} class):
 <source lang="java">
 SynthLookAndFeel laf = new SynthLookAndFeel();
 laf.load(new File("synthExample.xml").toURL());
 UIManager.setLookAndFeel(laf);
 </source>
