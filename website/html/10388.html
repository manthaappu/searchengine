'''Digital Project''' is a [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software application based on [[CATIA]] V5 and developed by Gehry Technologies, a technology company owned by the architect [[Frank Gehry]].
Among the changes made by Gehry Technologies to CATIA is a new visual interface suitable for architecture work.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://aecnews.com/articles/842.aspx |title=Digital Project Review |accessdate=2007-12-06 }}</ref>

Images and videos of using Digital Project were shown as part of the Danish exhibition ”Digital Project – Frank Gehry’s Vision” in 2007.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.haandbogforbygningsindustrien.dk/pages/nyhedsider/nyhed.php?id=146&antal=11&fra=0 |title=FRANK GEHRY’S DIGITALE VISION I DAC}}</ref>

In contrast to some CAD packages used for architecture, engineering and construction, Digital Project (like CATIA) enables information to be sent directly to manufacturer{{Fact|date=August 2008}}, rather than needing to be processed separately in preparation for sending out of house.

It also provides CAD data interoperability between CATIA and IFC (Industry Foundation Classes)Viewer. It competes as a [[Building Information Modelling|BIM]] tool<ref>The [http://www.gehrytechnologies.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=97&Itemid=211 Base Product version of Digital Project] provides BIM Attributes and Quantities</ref> with products like [[ArchiCAD]] and [[Revit]].
