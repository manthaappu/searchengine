</ref> is an image compression algorithm that exploits the inherent similarities across the subbands in a [[wavelet transform|wavelet decomposition]] of an image. 

== General description ==
The algorithm codes the most important wavelet transform coefficients first, and transmits the bits so that an increasingly refined copy of the original image can be obtained progressively.
