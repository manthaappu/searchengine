The [[computer program]] '''yacc''' is a [[parser generator]] developed by [[Stephen C. Johnson]] at [[AT&T]] for the [[Unix]] operating system. The name is an acronym for "[[Yet Another]] [[Compiler Compiler]]." It generates a [[parsing|parser]] (the part of a [[compiler]] that tries to make syntactic sense of the [[source code]]) based on an [[Formal grammar|analytic grammar]] written in a notation similar to [[Backus-Naur form|BNF]]. Historically, Yacc has generated the [[code]] for the [[parser]] in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]].[http://www.techworld.com.au/article/252319/-z_programming_languages_yacc?pp=1]

Yacc used to be available as the default parser generator on most Unix systems. It has since been supplanted as the default by more recent, largely compatible, programs such as [[Berkeley Yacc]], [[GNU bison]], [[MKS Inc.|MKS]] yacc and Abraxas pcyacc. An updated version of the original AT&T version is included as part of [[Sun Microsystems|Sun's]] [[OpenSolaris]] project. Each offers slight improvements and additional features over the original yacc, but the concept has remained the same. Yacc has also been rewritten for other languages, including [[Ratfor]], [[ML programming language|ML]], [[Ada programming language|Ada]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[Common Lisp]].

The parser generated by yacc requires a [[lexical analyzer]]. Lexical analyzer generators, such as [[Lex programming tool|Lex]] or [[Flex lexical analyser|Flex]] are widely available. The [[IEEE]] [[POSIX]] P1003.2 standard defines the functionality and requirements for both Lex and Yacc.

Some versions of AT&T Yacc have become [[open source]].  For example, [[source code]] (for different implementations) is available with the standard distributions of [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]] and [[OpenSolaris]].
