In this [[data structure]] a node usually has two parents (unless it is the first or last on a level) and two children (unless it is on the last level). What separates the beap from Williams' [[Heap_%28data_structure%29|heap]] is that beap allows [[sublinear]] search.

==Performance== 

The height of the structure is approximately <math>\sqrt{n}</math>. Also, assuming the last level is full, the number of elements on that level is also <math>\sqrt{n}</math>. In fact, because of these properties all basic operations (insert, remove, find) run in <math>O(\sqrt{n})</math> time on average. Find operations in the heap can be <math>O(n)</math> in the worst case. Removal and insertion of new elements involves propagation of elements up or down (much like in a heap) in order to restore the beap invariant. An additional perk is that beap provides constant time access to the smallest element and <math>O(\sqrt{n})</math> time for the maximum element.

==Advantages==

The main advantage of the beap is that it can be fully implemented in-place - only data nodes need to be present (no pointers or other extra information is required). However, this structure should be used with care since it is not <math>O(\log{n})</math> nor does it perform much better than a vector for small values of n.
