'''Andy Gavin''' (born 1970) is a programmer notable for co-founding the video game company [[Naughty Dog]] with childhood friend [[Jason Rubin]] in 1986. [[Naughty Dog]]'s games (most famously, [[Crash Bandicoot]]) are known for their combination of exceptional technology, great graphics, and polished gameplay.<ref>http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.05/deathmatch.html?pg=2</ref>  The sophistication of [[Naughty Dog]] technology is often credited to Gavin's background in [[LISP]] at the [[MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]].<ref>http://www.franz.com/success/customer_apps/animation_graphics/naughtydog.lhtml</ref>

==Education==
Gavin studied for his Ph.D. at M.I.T. where he did research for the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] on the Mars Rover Vision Project, under his advisor [[Rod Brooks]].  While still a student, Gavin learned the computer programming language [[LISP]].  Influences from M.I.T. and his own work lead him to develop a number of custom programming languages that improved the quality of graphics, controls, sounds and artificial intelligence in [[Naughty Dog]] video games.  He also has a B.S. from [[Haverford College]] in Neuro Biological Science.<ref>http://www.gamasutra.com/features/19991112/GavinWhite_03.htm</ref>

==Career==
Together, Gavin and Rubin sold their first video game called Math Jam in 1985. A few games later they sold Keef the Thief [http://www.mobygames.com/game/keef-the-thief-a-boy-and-his-lockpick] in 1989 to [[Electronic Arts]].  In the early 90’s, they created a fighting game called [[Way of the Warrior]] which eventually led to a multi-title deal with Universal Interactive Studios.<ref>http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.02/eword.html?pg=7</ref>  It was under the auspices of this Universal deal that they produced the multi-million selling [[Crash Bandicoot]] series from 1994 until 1999, and later segueing into the successful [[Jak and Daxter]] series of games. At the end of 2000, Rubin and Gavin sold [[Naughty Dog]] to [[Sony Computer Entertainment America]] (SCEA).  All in all, they created 14 [[Naughty Dog]] games including Math Jam (1985), Ski Crazed (1986), [[Dream Zone]] (1987), Keef the Thief (1989), [[Rings of Power]] (1991), [[Way of the Warrior]] (1994), [[Crash Bandicoot]] (1996), Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back (1997), Crash Bandicoot: Warped (1998), Crash Team Racing (1999), [[Jak and Daxter]]: The Precursor Legacy (2001), Jak 2 (2003), Jak 3 (2004) and Jak X: Combat Racing (2005). Together these games have sold over 35 million units and generated over $1 billion in revenue.[http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/devs-dont-need-producers-naughty-dog]

While at [[Naughty Dog]], Gavin developed two LISP dialects for use in game development, GOOL (Game Object Oriented Lisp) and its successor [[Game Oriented Assembly Lisp|GOAL]] (Game Oriented Assembly Lisp).  These represented a departure from the mainstream in terms of language choice, and featured some innovations in design.<ref>http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2985/postmortem_naughty_dogs_jak_and_.php?page=2</ref>

Shortly after leaving Naughty Dog, Gavin co-founded a new Internet startup called [[Flektor]] with his former business partner, [[Jason Rubin]], and former HBO executive Jason R. Kay. In May 2007, the company was sold to [[Fox Interactive Media]], which is a division of [[News Corp.]]<ref>http://machinist.salon.com/blog/2007/06/26/flektor/index.html</ref>  Fox has described the company as: “a next-generation Web site that provides users with a suite of Web-based tools to transform their photos and videos into dynamic slideshows, postcards, live interactive presentations and video mash-ups.”  In October 2007, [[Flektor]] partnered with its sister company, [[MySpace]], and [[MTV]] to provide instant audience feedback via polls for the interactive MySpace / MTV Presidential Dialogues series with then-presidential candidate Senator [[Barack Obama]].<ref>http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1572991/20071029/index.jhtml</ref>  

Gavin left Fox Interactive Media in 2008. He recently announced a return to the video game business with his [[Naughty Dog]] co-founder [[Jason Rubin]]. They have formed a new social game startup called [[Monkey Gods]] that is working on a new version of [[Snood (video game)|Snood]] along with a casual word game called MonkWerks [http://www.monkwerks.com].<ref>http://venturebeat.com/2009/05/14/crash-bandicoot-creators-speak-out-on-forming-new-game-company/</ref>
