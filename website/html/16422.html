This is a bit error detection and correction mechanism used in data transmitter and receiver.

The '''Header Error Control''' (HEC) is the last field in the [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] cell consisting of an 8-bit [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRC]] of the cell's header only. 

It consists of the remainder of the division of the 32 bits of the header by the [[polynomial]] <math>x^8+x^2+x+1</math>. The pattern 01010101 is XORed with the 8-bit remainder before being inserted in the last octet of the header.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipmplsforum.org/ftp/pub/approved-specs/af-uni-0010.001.rtf |title=ATM User-Network Interface Specification V3.0 |accessdate=2007-09-17}}</ref>  This added 01010101 value is called a coset.

This scheme is able to correct single-bit errors and detect many multiple-bit errors.

For a tutorial and an example of computing the CRC see the [[Mathematics of CRCs]] page.
