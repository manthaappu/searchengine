In [[robotics]] the '''common normal''' of two non-intersecting joint axes is a line perpendicular to both axes.<ref>''Introduction to Robotics'' by Saeed Niku ISBN 0470604468 page 75</ref>

The common normal can be used to characterize robot arm links, by using the "common normal distance" and the angle between the link axes in a plane perpendicular to the common normal.<ref>''Robot manipulators: mathematics, programming, and control'' by Richard P. Paul 1981 ISBN 026216082X page 51</ref> When two consecutive joint axes are parallel, the common normal is not unique and an arbitrary common normal may be used, usually one that passes through the center of a coordinate system.<ref>''Foundations of Robotics: Analysis and Control'' by Tsuneo Yoshikawa 1990 ISBN 0262240289 page 33</ref>

The common normal is widely used in the representation of the [[frames of reference]] for robot joints and links, and the selection of minimal representations with the [[Denavit-Hartenberg parameters]].
