<html> <head> <title>Fourier shell correlation</title></head><body>In [[applied mathematics]], the three-dimensional '''Fourier shell correlation (FSC)''' measures the normalised [[cross-correlation]] coefficient between two 3-dimensional volumes over corresponding shells in [[Fourier]] space (i.e., as a function of spatial frequency<ref name=Harauz1986>Harauz & van Heel, 1986</ref>), a three-dimensional extension of the Fourier ring correlation (FRC).<ref name=vanHeel1982>van Heel, 1982</ref><ref name=Saxton1982>Saxton & Baumeister, 1982</ref>

== Calculation ==
:<math>
FSC(r) = 
\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{r_i \in r}{ F_1(r_i) \cdot F_2(r_i)^{\ast} }}
{\displaystyle\sqrt[2]{\sum_{r_i \in r}{ \left|F_1(r_i)\right|^2} \cdot \sum_{r_i \in r}{\left|F_2(r_i)\right|^2}}}
</math>

where <math>F_1</math> is the complex structure Factor for volume 1, <math>F_2^{\ast}</math> is the complex conjugate of the structure Factor for volume 2, and <math>r_i</math> is the individual voxel element at radius <math>r</math>.<ref>{{cite web | title=Image Science's FSC: Program to calculate the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) of two 3D volumes | url=http://www.imagescience.de/fsc/index.htm | work=IMAGIC 5 | publisher=Image Science | accessdate=2009-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=RF 3 - Phase Residual & Fourier shell correlation | url=http://www.wadsworth.org/spider_doc/spider/docs/man/rf3.html | work=SPIDER | publisher=Wadsworth Center | accessdate=2009-04-09}}</ref><ref name=vanHeel2005>van Heel & Schatz, 2005</ref> In this form, the FSC takes two three-dimensional data sets and converts them into a one-dimensional array.

== Application in Cryo-electron microscopy ==
In [[cryo-electron microscopy]], the resolution of a structure is typically measured by the Fourier shell correlation (FSC).<ref name=Harauz1986>Harauz & van Heel, 1986</ref> To measure the FSC, the data needs to be separated into two groups. Typically, the even particles form the first group and odd particles the second based on their order. This is commonly referred to as the even-odd test. Most publications quote the FSC 0.5 cutoff, which refers to the when correlation coefficient of the Fourier shells is equal to 0.5.<ref name=Bottcher1997>Böttcher et al., 1997</ref><ref name=Frank2006>Frank, 2006, p250-251</ref> Determining the resolution threshold remains a controversial topic: fixed-value thresholds were argued to be based on incorrect statistical assumptions.<ref name=vanHeel2005/> Many other criteria using the FSC curve exist, including 3-σ criterion, 5-σ criterion, and the 0.143 cutoff. The half-bit criterion indicates at which resolution we have collected enough information to reliably interpret the 3-dimensional volume, and the (modified) 3-[[sigma]] criterion indicates where the FSC systematically emerges above the expected random correlations of the background noise.<ref name=vanHeel2005/>
