{{Nihongo|'''''Kikaider'''''|キカイダー| Kikaidā|}} is a [[Japan]]ese franchise about the titular character [[Kikaider (character)|Kikaider]]  created by [[Shotaro Ishinomori]]. It was originally a [[tokusatsu]] and has since been adapted into [[manga]] and [[anime]].

Paying tribute to [[Astro Boy]], created by his mentor [[Osamu Tezuka]], Ishinomori used the stories of [[Carlo Collodi]]'s [[Pinocchio]] (which was also the basis for ''Astro Boy'') along with [[Mary Shelley]]'s [[Frankenstein]] as the basis for his [[science fiction]] action story.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

The [[tokusatsu]] series from 1972 is especially popular in [[Hawaii]]. The complete DVD series is available in the west with English subtitles through [[JN Productions]].

The series was originally a live-action Tokusatsu series, as was its sequel Kikaider 01. A manga drawn in a style reminiscent of Osamu Tezuka's ''Astro Boy'' was eventually published, introducing Kikaider 00. A 13-episode anime and 4-episode OVA based on the manga were created in 2001.

==Superhero Safety==
In the past, the [[Super Giant]] movie series and shows like ''[[Moonlight Mask]]'' (the first TV superhero in Japan) became controversial, when kids imitated the stunts performed by the featured [[superhero]]es, usually by jumping out of a window (this was also a major issue with [[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|TV]] and [[Superman (film)|movie]] adaptations of [[Superman]]).

The original ''[[Android Kikaider]]'' series was one of the first [[tokusatsu]] [[superhero]] TV shows that added safety bumpers (seen at the end of each episode) which warned kids not to imitate the dangerous and impossible stunts performed by the title superhero.
