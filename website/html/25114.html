The '''Morse potential''', named after physicist [[Philip M. Morse]], is a convenient model for the [[potential energy]] of a [[diatomic molecule]]. It is a better approximation for the [[oscillation|vibrational]] structure of the molecule than the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] because it explicitly includes the effects of bond breaking, such as the existence of unbound states. It also accounts for the [[anharmonicity]] of real bonds and the non-zero transition probability for [[overtone band|overtone]] and [[combination band]]s. The Morse potential can also be used to model other interactions such as the interaction between an atom and a surface.

==Potential Energy Function==
[[Image:Morse-potential.png|400px|thumb|The '''Morse potential''' (blue) and harmonic oscillator potential (green). Unlike the energy levels of the harmonic oscillator potential, which are evenly spaced by ħω, the Morse potential level spacing decreases as the energy approaches the dissociation energy. The dissociation energy ''D''<sub>e</sub> is larger than the true energy required for dissociation ''D''<sub>0</sub> due to the zero point energy of the lowest (''v'' = 0) vibrational level.]] 
The Morse potential energy function is of the form 

:<math>V(r) = D_e ( 1-e^{-a(r-r_e)} )^2</math> 

Here <math>r</math> is the distance between the atoms, <math>r_e</math> is the equilibrium bond distance, <math>D_e</math> is the well depth (defined relative to the dissociated atoms), and <math>a</math> controls the 'width' of the potential (the smaller <math>a</math> the larger the well). The [[Bond dissociation energy|dissociation energy]] of the bond can be calculated by subtracting the [[zero point energy]] <math>E(0)</math> from the depth of the well. The [[force constant]] of the bond can be found by Taylor expansion of <math>V(r)</math> around <math>r=r_e</math> to the second [[derivative]] of the potential energy function, from which it can be shown that the parameter, <math>a</math>, is

:<math>a=\sqrt{k_e/2D_e}</math>,

where <math>k_e</math> is the force constant at the minimum of the well.

Of course, the [[Potential_energy#Relation_between_potential_energy_and_force| zero of potential energy is arbitrary]], and the equation for the Morse potential can be rewritten any number of ways by adding or subtracting a constant value. When it is used to model the atom-surface interaction, the Morse potential is usually written in the form

:<math>V(r) - D_e = D_e ( e^{-2a(r-r_e)}-2e^{-a(r-r_e)} )</math>

where <math>r</math> is now the coordinate perpendicular to the surface. This form approaches zero at infinite <math>r</math> and equals <math>-D_e</math> at its minimum. It clearly shows that the Morse potential is the combination of a short-range repulsion and a longer-range attractive tail.

==Vibrational States and Energies==

To write the [[stationary state]]s on the Morse potential, i.e. solutions <math>\Psi(v)</math> and <math>E(v)</math>  of the following [[Schrödinger equation]]:

:<math>\left(-\frac{\hbar ^2 }{2 m }\frac{\partial ^2}{\partial r^2}+V(r)\right)\Psi(v)=E(v)\Psi(v),</math>

it is convenient to introduce the new variables:

:<math>x=a r

\text{;  }

x_e=a  r_e

\text{;  }

\lambda =\frac{\sqrt{2 m  D_e}}{a \hbar } 

\text{;  }

\varepsilon _v=\frac{2 m }{a^2\hbar ^2}E(v).
</math>

Then, the [[Schrödinger equation]] takes the simple form:

:<math>
\left(-\frac{\partial ^2}{\partial x^2}+V(x)\right)\Psi _n(x)=\varepsilon _n\Psi _n(x),
</math>
:<math>
V(x)=\lambda ^2\left(e^{-2\left(x-x_e\right)}-2e^{-\left(x-x_e\right)}\right).
</math>
Its [[eigenvalue]]s and [[eigenstate]]s can be written as:
:<math>
\varepsilon _n=-\left(\lambda -n-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2
</math>
:<math>
\Psi _n(z)=N_nz^{\lambda -n-\frac{1}{2}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}Z}L_n^{2\lambda -2n-1}(z),
</math>
where <math> z=2\lambda  e^{-\left(x-x_e\right)}</math>; <math>N_n=n![\frac{a\left(2\lambda-2n-1\right)}{\Gamma (n+1)\Gamma (2\lambda -n)}]^{\frac{1}{2}}</math>  and <math>L_n^{\alpha }(z)</math> is [[Laguerre polynomial]]:
:<math>L_n^{\alpha }(z) = \frac{z^{-\alpha  }e^z}{n!} \frac{d^n}{d z^n}\left(z^{n + \alpha } e^{-z}\right)=\frac{\Gamma (\alpha  + 2)/\Gamma (\alpha -n+2)}{\Gamma (n+1)} \, _1F_1(-n,\alpha +1,z),
</math>

There also exists the following important analytical expression for [[matrix element]]s of the coordinate operator (here it is assumed that <math>m>n</math> and <math>N=\lambda -\frac{1}{2}</math>)
<ref name="Another">E. F. Lima and J. E. M. Hornos, "Matrix Elements for the Morse Potential Under an External Field", J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 38, pp. 815-825 (2005)</ref>
:<math>
\left\langle \Psi _m(x)|x|\Psi _n(x)\right\rangle =\frac{2(-1)^{m-n+1}}{(m-n)(2N-n-m)} \sqrt{\frac{(N-n)(N-m)\Gamma (2N-m+1)m!}{\Gamma (2N-n+1)n!}}.
</math>

The eigenenergies in the initial variables have form:

:<math>E(v) = h\nu_0 (v+1/2) - \frac{\left[h\nu_0(v+1/2)\right]^2}{4D_e}</math>

where <math>v</math> is the vibrational quantum number, and <math>\nu_0</math> has units of frequency, and is mathematically related to the particle mass, <math>m</math>, and the Morse constants via

:<math>\nu_0 = \frac{a}{2\pi} \sqrt{2D_e/m}</math>.

Whereas the energy spacing between vibrational levels in the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] is constant at <math>h\nu_0</math>, the energy between adjacent levels decreases with increasing <math>v</math> in the Morse oscillator. Mathematically, the spacing of Morse levels is 

:<math>E(v+1) - E(v) = h\nu_0 - (v+1) (h\nu_0)^2/2D_e\,</math>.

This trend matches the anharmonicity found in real molecules. However, this equation fails above some value of <math>v_m</math> where <math>E(v_m+1) - E(v_m)</math> is calculated to be zero or negative. Specifically,

:<math>v_m \approx 2D_e/2\pi\nu_0</math>.

This failure is due to the ''finite'' number of bound levels in the Morse potential, and some maximum <math>v_m</math> that remains bound. For energies above <math>v_m</math>, all the possible energy levels are allowed and the equation for <math>E(v)</math> is no longer valid.

Below <math>v_m</math>, <math>E(v)</math> is a good approximation for the true vibrational structure in non-rotating diatomic molecules.  In fact, the real molecular spectra are generally fit to the form<sup>1</sup> 

:<math> E_v / hc = \omega_e (v+1/2) - \omega_e\chi_e (v+1/2)^2\,</math>

in which the constants <math>\omega_e</math> and <math>\omega_e\chi_e</math> can be directly related to the parameters for the Morse potential.

== Solving Schrödinger's equation for the Morse oscillator ==

Like the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]], the energies and eigenstates of the Morse potential can be found using operator methods
<ref>F. Cooper, A. Khare, U. Sukhatme, ''Supersymmetry in Quantum Mechanics'', World Scientific, 2001, Table 4.1</ref>.
One approach involves applying the [[factorization method]] to the Hamiltonian.
