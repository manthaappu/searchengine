'''Emergent democracy''' refers to the rise of political structures and behaviors without central planning and by the action of many individual participants, especially when mediated by the Internet. More recently, [[Clay Shirky]] has referred to this as "[[Here Comes Everybody|the power of organizing without organizations]]."<ref>{{cite book

The phrase draws upon [[emergence]] theory for the idea that the simple actions of individuals can collectively create complex and unpredictable results, as when the behavior of [[termites]] results in large, efficient nests beyond the comprehension of any individual participant.

In the paper that first drew attention to the term,<ref>{{cite web

From its outset, emergent democracy has been seen arising most clearly among bloggers who, as a decentralized network of writers, can provide a fuller airing and development of ideas than can the relatively limited resources of traditional media.<ref>{{cite book

The canonical example of emergent democracy was the December [[2002]] resignation of [[Trent Lott]] as [[Senate]] [[majority leader]] after bloggers publicized his praising of [[Strom Thurmond]]'s [[1948]] [[Racial segregation|segregation]]ist campaign for the [[President of the United States|presidency]].<ref>Gillmor, pp. 44–45</ref><ref>Shirky, pp. 61–66</ref>

== History ==

Ito had been vocal about issues with Japanese democracy, and had spoken at Davos about how broken he felt Japanese democracy was. "Afterwards, Ms. Ogata, the former UN High Commissioner for Refugees told me that I should stop ranting as a Japanese and think more about global democracy and global issues," he posted. "These words stuck with me and last year I tried to think about blogs and emergent democracy outside of the Japanese context." <ref>{{cite web

He organized a group effort to discuss and document the emergent democracy concept, using a term initially coined by [[Ross Mayfield]]. He announced meetings on his weblog, inviting his readers to attend a [[conference call]] that was augmented by [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] chat for posting realtime visual cues and backchannel conversation, and a [[wiki]] for gathering notes from the call. This "multimodal" approach was called a "happening" by Ross Mayfield.<ref>{{cite web

The discussion and notes were captured in a paper that was placed on a wiki for collaborative editing and enhancement. [[Jon Lebkowsky]] edited the wiki version, and published it as a chapter in the 2005 book ''Extreme Democracy''.<ref>{{cite book
