<html> <head> <title>Patch Tuesday</title></head><body>'''Patch Tuesday''' is the second Tuesday of each month, on which [[Microsoft]] releases security patches.<ref>{{cite web |title=Security updates |publisher=Microsoft |date=2007-10-09 |accessdate=2007-11-02 |url=http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/update/bulletins/default.mspx}}</ref>
Starting with [[Windows 98]], Microsoft included a "[[Windows Update]]" system that would check for [[patch (computing)|patches]] to [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and its components, which Microsoft would release intermittently. With the release of [[Microsoft Update]], this system also checks for updates to other [[List of Microsoft software applications|Microsoft products]], such as [[Microsoft Office|Office]], [[Microsoft Visual Studio|Visual Studio]], [[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server]], and others.

== Patch-Deployment Costs ==
Earlier versions of the Windows Update system suffered from two problems.  The first was that less-experienced users were often unaware of Windows Update and did not install it; Microsoft's solution was the "Automatic Update," which notified each user that an update was available for their system.  The second problem was that customers, such as corporate users, with many copies of Windows not only had to update every Windows deployment in the company but also uninstall patches issued by Microsoft that broke existing functionality.

In order to reduce the costs related to the deployment of patches, Microsoft introduced "Patch Tuesday," in October 2003<ref>http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-details-new-security-plan/2100-1002_3-5088846.html</ref>.  In this system, security patches are accumulated over a period of one month and then dispatched all at once on the second Tuesday of the month, an event for which system administrators may prepare.  Some speculate that Tuesday was selected so that post-patch problems could be troubleshot and resolved before the weekend, but, certainly, not every patch-induced injury may be cured in that time.  The non-Microsoft terms for the following day are "Exploit Wednesday" and "[[Zero-day attack|Day Zero]]," when attacks may be launched against the newly announced vulnerabilities.

== Security Implications ==
The most obvious security implication is that security problems that have a solution are withheld from the public for a period of up to a month. This policy is adequate when the vulnerability is not widely known or extremely obscure, but that is not always the case.

There have been cases where either vulnerability information or actual worms were released to the public a day or two before patch Tuesday.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} This did not leave Microsoft enough time to incorporate a fix for said vulnerabilities, and thus, theoretically, left a one month window for attackers to exploit the hole, before a patch is available to formally fix it. Microsoft issues critical patches as they become ready, however, so this is not generally a problem.

== Exploit Wednesday ==
Many exploitation events are seen shortly after the release of a patch.<ref>[http://blog.metasploit.com/2010/08/better-faster-stronger.html HD Moore: Better, Faster, Stronger: DLLHijackAuditKit v2]</ref> By analyzing the patch, exploitation developers can more easily figure out how to exploit the underlying vulnerability,<ref>{{cite web|last=Kurtz |first=George |title=Operation “Aurora” Hit Google, Others |published=mcafee.com |date=2010-01-14 |accessdate=2010-01-14 |url=http://siblog.mcafee.com/cto/operation-%E2%80%9Caurora%E2%80%9D-hit-google-others/}}</ref> and attack systems that have not been patched. Therefore the term "Exploit Wednesday" was coined.<ref>{{cite web |last=Leffall |first=Jabulani |title=Are Patches Leading to Exploits? |publisher=The Register |date=2007-10-12 |accessdate=2009-02-25 |url=http://redmondmag.com/news/article.asp?editorialsid=9143}}</ref>

Also, starting to abuse an unpatched exploitation entry point on this day gives malicious code writers the longest period of time before a fix is supplied to users. Malware authors can sit on the vulnerability of a new exploitation entry point until after a given patch Tuesday, knowing that there will be an entire month before Microsoft releases any patch to fix it.

== Bandwidth Impact ==
In August 2007, [[Skype]] experienced a two-day outage following Patch Tuesday; according to Skype this was caused by a previously unidentified software bug exposed by an abnormally high number of restarts. <ref>{{cite news |last=Layden |first=John |title=Patch Tuesday update triggered Skype outage |publisher=The Register |date=2007-08-20 |accessdate=2007-08-28 |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/08/20/skype_outage_post-mortem/}}</ref>

Microsoft's download servers do not honor the TCP [[Slow-start]] congestion control strategy.<ref>{{cite web |last=Strong |first=Ben |date=2010-11-25 |url=http://blog.benstrong.com/2010/11/google-and-microsoft-cheat-on-slow.html|title=Google and Microsoft Cheat on Slow Start|publisher=benstrong.com|format=blog}}</ref> As a result, other uses of the internet may be significantly slowed from machines actively retrieving updates. This can be particularly noticeable in environments where many machines individually retrieve updates over a shared, bandwidth constrained link such as those found in many small to medium sized businesses. To some extent the bandwidth demands of patching a group of computers can be alleviated by deploying [[Windows Server Update Services]].
