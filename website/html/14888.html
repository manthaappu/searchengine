'''GenStat''' is a general [[statistical package]].  Early versions were developed for large [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] computers. Up until version 5, there was a [[Unix]] binary available, and this continues to be used by many universities and research institutions.  The current version, version 12, is available for the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] environment.

GenStat was originally developed at the then [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]] (now Rothamsted Research) by a team led by [[John Nelder]], and is programmed in [[Fortran]].

''GenStat Discovery Edition'' is a free version of the statistical software GenStat. GenStat Discovery Edition 3 is available to non-commercial users throughout Africa and a range of developing countries outside Africa. Examples of users who qualify are students and lecturers of universities and staff of government research organisations or NGOs.
When you register for a license you will be asked for information about the status of the organisation which will be using the software to determine whether it qualifies for the free version.

It is developed by VSN International which is owned by The [[Numerical Algorithms Group]] and Rothamsted Research.
