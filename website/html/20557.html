A '''kernel panic''' is an action taken by an [[operating system]] upon detecting an internal [[fatal error]] from which it cannot safely recover.  The term is largely specific to [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems; for [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems the equivalent term is "[[Fatal system error|Bug check]]" (or, [[Colloquialism|colloquially]], "[[Stop error screen|Blue Screen of Death]]").

The [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] routines that handle panics (in [[AT&T]]-derived and [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] Unix source code, a routine known as <code>panic()</code>) are generally designed to output an [[error message]] to the [[system console|console]], dump an image of kernel memory to disk for post-mortem [[debugging]] and then either wait for the system to be manually rebooted, or initiate an automatic [[Reboot (computer)|reboot]].<ref>http://www.unix.com/man-page/FreeBSD/9/panic/</ref> The information provided is of highly technical nature and aims to assist a [[system administrator]] or [[software developer]] in diagnosing the problem.

Attempts by the operating system to read an invalid or non-permitted [[memory address]] are a common source of kernel panics. A panic may also occur as a result of a hardware failure or a bug in the operating system. In many cases, the operating system could continue operation after memory violations have occurred. However, the system is in an unstable state and rather than risking security breaches and data corruption, the operating system stops to prevent further damage and facilitate diagnosis of the error.

The kernel panic was introduced in an early version of [[Unix]] and demonstrated a major difference between the design philosophies of Unix and its predecessor [[Multics]]. Multics developer [[Tom van Vleck]] recalls a discussion of this change with Unix developer [[Dennis Ritchie]]: 

{{quote|I remarked to Dennis that easily half the code I was writing in Multics was error recovery code. He said, "We left all that stuff out. If there's an error, we have this routine called panic, and when it is called, the machine crashes, and you holler down the hall, 'Hey, reboot it.'"<ref>[http://www.multicians.org/unix.html Unix and Multics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>}}

The original <code>panic()</code> function was essentially unchanged from Fifth Edition UNIX to the [[VAX]]-based UNIX 32V and output only an error message with no other information, then dropped the system into an endless idle loop. As the Unix [[codebase]] was enhanced, the <code>panic()</code> function was also enhanced to dump various forms of debugging information to the console.

== Linux ==
Linux has kernel panic as other [[unix-like]] systems. There is also [[Linux kernel oops|kernel oops]] message that informs about a bug in the kernel that could be recovered by [[kill (Unix)|killing]] offending [[process (computing)|process]]. As this means that some subsystem or resource could be then unavailable, this could later leads to a kernel panic when the kernel will try to use them.

Kernel panics also appear in Mac OS X. These can appear while booting up or when using an application. Once they show up they tell the user that they need to reboot the system (except for versions below 10.2).<ref>http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1392?viewlocale=en_US</ref> They vary from version to version:

* 10.0 - 10.1.5: The system prints out numbers and words detailing the error on-screen and then the system becomes unresponsive.
* 10.2 - 10.2.8: Similar to the current versions of the kernel panic except the text is more spaced out and the background is pink.
* 10.3 - 10.5.8: The background is now black, but with the same language translations and the same text as version 10.2.
* 10.6 - 10.6.6: The text is different and now features a Spanish language translation.

In all versions above 10.2 the text is in front of a [[Power symbol|standby symbol]] and is not full screen. Debugging information is saved in [[Non-volatile random access memory|NVRAM]] and written to a log file on reboot.
