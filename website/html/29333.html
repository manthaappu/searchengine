'''Pixlet''' is a [[video codec]] created by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and based on [[wavelet]]s, designed to enable viewing of full resolution, [[High-definition video|HD]] movies in real time at low [[DV]] data rates.  According to Apple's claims, it allows for a 20-25:1 [[compression ratio]]. Similar to DV, it does not use [[interframe compression]], making it suitable for previewing in production and special effects studios. It is designed to be an editing codec. However, this makes it poorly suited for broadcast use, due to high bitrates. 

When it was introduced by [[Steve Jobs]] at [[Worldwide Developers Conference]] [[2003]], it was said that the codec was developed in cooperation with the animation company [[Pixar]].

A [[Power Macintosh]] with at least a 1 [[GHz]] [[PowerPC G4]] processor is required for real time playback of half resolution High-Definition Video (960x540). 

Pixlet, while part of the cross-platform [[QuickTime]], is only available on [[Apple Macintosh|Macs]] running [[Mac OS X v10.3]] or later.
