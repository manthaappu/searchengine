In [[cryptography]] most [[Public-key cryptography|public key cryptosystems]] are founded on problems that are believed to be intractable.  The '''higher residuosity problem''' is one such problem.  This problem is ''easier'' to solve than [[integer factorization]], so the assumption that this problem is hard to solve is ''stronger'' than the assumption that integer factorization is hard.

==Mathematical Background==
If ''n'' is an [[integer]], then the integers [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''n'' form a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]].  If ''n''=''pq'' where ''p'' and ''q'' are [[Prime number|primes]], then the [[Chinese remainder theorem]] tells us that

:<math>\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} \simeq \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z}</math>

The [[Unit (ring theory)|group of units]] of any ring form a [[Group (mathematics)|group]], and the group of units in <math>\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}</math> is traditionally denoted <math>(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})
^*</math>.

From the isomorphism above, we have

:<math>(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^* \simeq (\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^* \times (\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z})^*</math>

as an isomorphism of ''groups''.  Since ''p'' and ''q'' were assumed to be prime, the groups <math>(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^*</math> and <math>(\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z})^*</math> are [[Cyclic group|cyclic]] of orders ''p''-1 and ''q''-1 respectively.  If ''d'' is a divisor of ''p''-1, then the set of ''d''th powers in <math>(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^*</math> form a subgroup of [[Index of a subgroup|index]] ''d''.  If gcd(''d'',''q''-1) = 1, then ''every'' element in <math>(\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z})^*</math> is a ''d''th power, so the set of ''d''th powers in <math>(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^*</math> is also a subgroup of index ''d''.  In general, if gcd(''d'',''q''-1) = ''g'', then there are (''q''-1)/(''g'') ''d''th powers in <math>(\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z})^*</math>, so the set of ''d''th powers in <math>(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^*</math> has index ''dg''.
This is most commonly seen when ''d''=2, and we are considering the subgroup of [[quadratic residues]], it is well known that exactly one quarter of the elements in <math>(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^*</math> are
quadratic residues (when ''n'' is the product of exactly two primes, as it is here).

The important point is that for any divisor ''d'' of ''p''-1 (or ''q''-1) the set of ''d''th powers forms a subgroup of <math>(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^*</math>.

==Problem Statement==
Given an integer ''n'' = ''pq'' where ''p'' and ''q'' are unknown, an integer ''d'' such that ''d'' divides ''p''-1, and an integer ''x'' < ''n'', it is infeasible to determine whether ''x'' is a ''d''th power (equivalently ''d''th residue) modulo ''n''.

Notice that if ''p'' and ''q'' are known it is easy to determine whether ''x'' is a ''d''th residue modulo ''n'' because ''x'' will be a ''d''th residue modulo ''p'' if and only if

:<math>x^{(p-1)/d} \equiv 1 \pmod p</math>

When ''d''=2, this is called the [[quadratic residuosity problem]].

==Applications==
The [[semantic security]] of the [[Benaloh cryptosystem]] and the [[Naccache-Stern cryptosystem]] rests on the intractability of this problem.
