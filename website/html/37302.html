<html> <head> <title>The Game (treasure hunt)</title></head><body>'''The Game''' is a non-stop 24â€“48 hour [[treasure hunt]], [[puzzlehunt]] or [[road rally]] that has run in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|San Francisco Bay]] and [[Seattle]] areas since 1973. Its teams use [[van]]s rigged with power and [[Internet]] access and drive hundreds of miles from puzzle site to puzzle site, overcoming often outrageous physical and mental challenges along the way, usually with no sleep. Teams in recent games have been required to walk around the roof of the [[Space Needle]], find a puzzle hidden in a live rat, and circulate a petition to ban [[dihydrogen monoxide hoax|dihydrogen monoxide]] from local ecosystems while dressed in superhero outfits.

Game founder '''Joe Belfiore''' has described the Game as "the ultimate test for Renaissance men and women."

==History==
The Game was created in [[Los Angeles]] in [[1973]] by a graphic designer named Donald Luskin and longtime friend, Patrick Carlyle.  Teams competed all night long solving puzzles across L.A. for a $100 first prize. The game was a mostly underground affair, but eventually drew the attention of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.<ref>[http://family.puzzalot.com/v/puzevents/firstgames/ ''Los Angeles Times'' clippings from the first Games]</ref> and later the [[Walt Disney Company]], who produced a movie, ''[[Midnight Madness (film)|Midnight Madness]]'', based on Luskin's game.<ref>[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/1867/mmdirector.html&date=2009-10-25+08:05:23 "Fagabeefe: The Unofficial ''Midnight Madness'' Home Page / Director's Chair"] - notes from the ''[[Midnight Madness (film)|Midnight Madness]]'' directors</ref> 

In 1985 Joe Belfiore (at that time a student at [[Clearwater Central Catholic High School]]) and his friends, inspired by ''[[Midnight Madness (film)|Midnight Madness]]'', created a race like the one in the film. They played four more games before Joe moved to [[Stanford University]] to go to school. With Stanford classmates Eli Ben-Shoshan and Andrew Reisner, he created the Bay Area Race Fantastique ([[barf|BARF]]) which occurred six times before changing its name to 'The Game'.  There are some interesting notes about the initial BARFs and number of teams that actually completed them due to the hyper-competitive aspect of the BARF format.<ref>http://www.gamecontrol.com/history/history2.htm</ref>{{Clarifyme|date=February 2009}} The term "Gentleman's Game" was used to describe the Stanford Game shortly after Joe Belfiore graduated, meaning there was no prize for winning, only bragging rights.

Two more events were held in the Bay Area before Joe Belfiore moved to [[Seattle]] to work for [[Microsoft]], taking the official "The Game" with him, although the San Francisco Bay Area people still consider their games to be "The Game."  Structurally, the two Games are identical, but the Seattle Games tend to be more competitive and require more technological gear.

Currently, versions of The Game (both full-blown and abbreviated foot-transportation-only) are organized regularly by Stanford dorm staff members as a bonding activity for their residents.

==Structure==
The general structure of The Game is a series of puzzle challenges, often called "Clues".  Each challenge solves to the location where the next challenge can be found.  During the course of The Game, a team will often travel all around a metropolitan area.

Usually there is an overall theme to the clues, or even a story that ties all the clues together.

==Game communities==

In Seattle, the organization typically fell on the previous winner.  However, as time progressed, the Seattle System became unfeasible, and a central organization was created to ensure that Games were not spaced too closely together.

In the Bay Area, the next Game would be run by whatever team felt the ability, chutzpah and desire to do so.  Future Game Controls (GCs) in the Bay Area tended to rely on the expertise of previous GCs and the so-called legitimacy of owning the "Captain's List".   In the Bay Area there is no "Central System" or "Central Ownership" per se, but rather an autonomous collective of Gamers (a group of teams that communicate with one-another) and a group-moderated site.

In subsequent years, The Game became increasingly more high-tech and more psychological in nature, a result of each Game trying to "outdo" the previous Games.  For instance, a team member might find themselves stripped of all clothes and spectacles, be dressed in nothing but a hospital gown, have the next puzzle be written on the back of their neck in reverse lettering, and then be deposited at a strip club.  Teams became increasingly competitive and would even break the rules and mislead other teams in order to gain an advantage, much to the fellow participants' and organizers' displeasure. Such teams can become [[wikt:blacklist|blacklist]]ed by the community at large and no longer find themselves invited to future Games. This nature of self-policing (decentralized control and word-of-mouth) prevents out-of-control teams from destroying the elaborate events. 

In the 2002 Game, "Shelby Logan's Run", a participant was severely injured in a mine shaft.<ref>Martin, Jonathan.

The August 2005 "Mooncurser's Handbook" Game in Seattle, run by a group of twelve veteran Seattle Gamers, renewed the Seattle Game tradition, with a special emphasis on safety.

The Game culture has spawned several spinoffs in the Bay Area, including the Bay Area Treasure Hunt (BATH), Bay Area Night Game (BANG), Park Challenge, Iron Puzzler, and Different Area Same Hunt (DASH).  There have been several spinoffs in other parts of North America as well.  There are three yearly games in [[New York City]] that are very similar to The Game:  Midnight Madness, The Haystack, and The Great All Nighter.  There is also a yearly game in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]], [[Arkansas]] also called Midnight Madness. Midnight Madness Brevard also puts on events many times a year in [[Brevard County, Florida]].  Midnight Madness Vermont hosts MMVT events several times a year as well.
