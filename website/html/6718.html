'''Coding by exception''' is an [[anti-pattern]] where software quickly degrades in performance and maintainability because it evolves by having special case functionality added piecemeal.  This typically happens because an existing piece of software is extended to cover requirements that were not previously considered at the project's inception. This anti-pattern is unrelated to software [[exception handling]].

As a general rule, well designed software projects contain very few [[corner case]]s.  There are a variety of [[Software development process|software development methodologies]] that purport to help engineers develop software that avoid these corner cases.  They typically address [[Dependency (computer science)|dependency management]] issues.  [[Design pattern (computer science)|Design patterns]] are another tool for arriving at less of a 'one-off' solution.
