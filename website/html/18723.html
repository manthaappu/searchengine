'''Intel SOA Products Division''' is a group within [[Intel]] which releases [[XSLT|XML processing]] and security software for transforming [[XML]] messages. Their primary product line, SOA Expressway, is a family of software and hardware XML Gateways ([[XML appliance]]s) that are used in [[Service-oriented architecture|SOA architectures]] on-premise or in the [[Cloud computing|cloud]]. The appliances interoperate with SOA [[middleware]] & [[SOA Governance|governance]] products and handle [[SOAP]] and [[REST]] for cross-domain integration & security.

The Intel SOA Expressway core runtime engine is based on highly-performing XML technology that includes the utilization of an [[X86|Intel Architecture]] using the [[SSE4|SSE 4.2]] instruction set as well as [[Event stream processing|Event Stream]] optimizations developed by [[Sarvega]] (acquired by Intel in 2005.)

Intel SOA Expressway for Healthcare is a software product that provides secure interoperability across different domains such as hospitals, state [[Health information exchange|Health Information Exchanges]] (HIE), or national healthcare integration networks.
