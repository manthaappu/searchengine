:''First Appearance: [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19971117&mode=classic November 17, 1997]''
'''A.J.''' Garrett is the creative guy for the company, maintaining and designing their websites. As a [[web designer]], he's uncomfortably crammed in that tiny crevice between the techies and the [[marketing]] people. This means he's not disliked by anyone, but they all look at him funny from time to time. A.J. is shy and sensitive. He loves most computer games, nifty art, and has a big brother relationship with the  [[#Dust Puppy|Dust Puppy]].  A.J. is terrified of [[Grue (monster)|Grues]] and attempts to avoid  [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20021017 them].

A.J. was downsized on [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19980905&mode=classic September 5, 1998], following iCan't Internet's purchase of Columbia Internet on [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19980824&mode=classic August 24, 1998], but was re-engaged on [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19981017&mode=classic October 17, 1998] after the company had been rebought. He lost his job again on [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20021016 October 16, 2002], following working on a personal project, and was employed by [[AOL]].  Having suffered an [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20021028 Ethicectomy], he became a clone of Stef - fortunately following an Ethics donation from [[Colin Powell]] he was [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20021129&mode=classic re-employed].

He and Miranda have previously dated, but split up over a misunderstanding.  They remained attracted to each other and started dating again on September 16, 2005.

:''First Appearance: [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19971119&mode=classic November 19, 1997]''
The '''Chief''' is Columbia Internet's [[CEO]]. He is the fearless leader for the techies and salespeople, as well as the only calm, clear-thinking head in the company. He wouldn't be if he knew what was really going on. The Chief is also a closet [[guitar]] player, having spent years mastering the art of perfect tone, only to have [[computers]] come along and render all of his effort meaningless.

Illiad based the character on a former boss:

{{cquote|The Chief is based on my business mentor. He was the vice president that I reported to back in the day. The Chief, like my mentor, is tall (!) and thin and sports a bushy ring around a bald crown, plus a very thick moustache.}}

The Chief bears a superficial resemblance to the [[Pointy-Haired Boss]] of [[Dilbert]] fame — he once was referred as the “Pointy Headed Boss”, and asked whether it was a mistake[http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20000903]. However, Illiad says that The Chief was not inspired by the Dilbert character. [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/read.cgi?id=20060718&tid=2135612]

===Dust Puppy===

:''First Appearance: [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19971203&mode=classic December 3, 1997]''
The '''Dust Puppy''' was born in a [[Server (computing)|server]] from a combination of [[dust]], [[lint]] and [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] events. He looks like a ball of dust and lint, with eyes, feet and an occasional big toothy smile. He was briefly absent from the strip from January 6 to January 10, 1998 after accidentally being blown with compressed air while sleeping inside a dusty server.

Although the Dust Puppy is very innocent and everything but worldly, he plays a superb game of [[Quake (video game)|Quake]], doing his first [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] only four days after his initial appearance in the strip, on December 7, 1997, and even beating Zock, the Quake god, on [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19980213&mode=classic February 13, 1998]; he also created an artificial intelligence named [[#Erwin|Erwin]] on January 25 1998, with whom he has been known to do occasional song performances (the first one being on [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19980208&mode=classic February 8, 1998]).

Generally, all the other characters in the strip like the Dust Puppy; notable exceptions to this are [[#Stef|Stef]] and the Dust Puppy's evil nemesis, the [[#Crud Puppy|Crud Puppy]], who first appeared in the strip on February 24, 1998. 

The Dust Puppy has (in the strip for [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19980117&mode=classic January 17, 1998]) described himself as:

:"''I walk around looking short, and sleep in the servers, and give advice to people who need it and sometimes I even play Quake.''"

:''First Appearance: [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19980125&mode=classic January 25, 1998]''
Erwin is a highly advanced [[Artificial Intelligence]] ([[AI]]) that resides somewhere on the [[computer network|network]]. He was created overnight during [[experimentation]] in [[Artificial intelligence]] by the [[#Dust Puppy|Dust Puppy]], who was feeling kind of bored. Erwin is written in [[COBOL]] because  Dust Puppy "lost a bet". Erwin passes the [[Turing Test]] with flying colours, and has a dry sense of [[humour]]. He is an expert on any subject that is covered on the [[World Wide Web]], such as [[Elvis sightings]] and [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracies]].

He was named Erwin on [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19980128 January 28, 1998], in light of the alternative, "[[web designer]]".  

Originally, Erwin occupied the classic '[[Computer display|monitor]] and [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]]' type [[computer]] with an [[x86]] [[computer architecture]], but was later given such residences as an [[iMac]], a [[Palm, Inc.|Palm]] III, a [[Coleco Adam]] on [[Mir]], a [[Furby]], a [[nuclear missile|nuclear weapon]] guidance system, an [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] O2,  a [[Hewlett-Packard]] [[Calculator]] (with [[reverse Polish notation]]),  a [[Lego Mindstorms]] construction, a [[Tamagotchi]], a [[Segway HT|Segway]], a [[BattleTech|Mech-Warrior]] Timber Wolf exo-skeleton, an internet equipped toilet as a punishment for insulting [[Hastur]], and an IBM PC 5150 brought in to work by Sid. He also had a very detailed dream about being a [[Death Star]].

:''First Appearance: [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19971117&mode=classic November 17, 1997]''
'''Greg''' Flemming is in charge of Technical Support at the company. In other words, he's the guy that customers turd all over when something goes wrong. He blows off steam by playing visceral games and doing Bad Things to the salespeople. He's not a bad sort, but his grip on his sanity hovers somewhere between weak and non-existent, and he once worked for [[Microsoft]] [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19980306&mode=classic Quality Assurance].

'''Mike''' Floyd works as a System Administrator, and is responsible for the smooth running of the [[computer network|network]] at the office. He's bright but prone to fits of anxiety. His worst nightmare is being locked in a room with a sweaty Windows 95 programmer, and no hacking weapons in sight. He loves hot curries, preferably ones with the same properties as Alien acid-for-blood.

'''Miranda''' Cornielle is a trained systems technologist, an experienced [[Unix|UNIX]] sysadmin, and very, very [[female]]. Her technical abilities unnerve the other techs, but her obvious physical charms compel them to stare at her, except for [[#Pitr|Pitr]], who is convinced she is [[evil]]. The only character flaw she displayed is her jealousy when Pearl is too close to A.J.

'''Pitr''' Dubovich is the admin of the Columbia Internet server, and a self proclaimed [[Linux]] guru.

He has almost succeeded in taking over the planet several times. His sworn enemy is [[#Sid|Sid]], who seems to outdo him at every turn.

Although a relative newcomer to Columbia Internet, '''Sid''' Dabster is the oldest of the geeks, and very knowledgeable. His advanced age gives him the upper hand against [[#Pitr|Pitr]], whom he has outdone on several occasions; including in a coffee brewing competition and in a (rather biased) game of Jeopardy. Unlike Pitr, he has no evil ambitions per se, but he is a friend of [[Hastur]] and [[#Cthulhu|Cthulhu]]. 

Illiad originally intended Sid's character to appear as an incidental character in a single storyline, but audience reception encouraged him to bring Sid back as a regular character.

The Smiling Man is the company Comptroller. He is in charge of [[account (accountancy)|account]]s, [[finance]]s and expenditures. He smiles all day, for no reason. This in itself is enough to encourage the other staff to keep pointy objects out of his reach. It has been said that he smiles for the same reason that a cat "smiles" before killing something. His favourite wallpaper is a large, complex, and utterly meaningless [[spreadsheet]].

'''Stef''' Murky works as the Corporate Sales Manager. He runs most of the [[marketing]] efforts within the firm and sells things before they exist. He can't understand the way techies think and treats them rather condescendingly, so he doesn't get very far with them. He lusts for Miranda, but she quite wisely refuses to have anything to do with him. He sucks at [[Quake (video game)|Quake]]. Although he admires the power of [[Microsoft]]'s marketing muscle, he has a real problem with Microsoft salesmen, probably because they make much more money than he does. He has a strange relationship with women and is universally hated by the geeks. Stef is definitely [[wikt:gormless|gormless]] as demonstrated on [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20050114&mode=classic January 14, 2005].

The [[Beastie (mascot)|BSD Daemon]] (technically the [[FreeBSD]] Daemon) is the little Demon/Daemon guy who advertises the [[BSD]] operating system, he reckons that one of the reasons you should change is that he is cuter than [[#Tux|Tux]].

===Clippy===
:''First Appearance: [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20000715&mode=classic July 15, 2000]''
:''See also [[Office Assistant]]''.
Clippy is an oversized [[Office Assistant|paperclip]] who just wants to help. He takes a dim view of items not in his world (e.g. [[#Dust Puppy|Dust Puppy]]), and seeks to replace them with things that are.

===Cobb===
:''First Appearance: [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19971121&mode=classic November 21, 1997]''
Cobb works in the Sales Department, and is known throughout the company to be lousy at [[Quake (video game)|Quake]]. However, we have never seen him play, for the one time  [[#Stef|Stef]] challenged him, Cobb cheated and had Dust Puppy play for him.

Caffeine hallucination, he usually appears as a giant walking [[cola]] can, but takes different forms for different people.  He is very keen for people to remain addicted to [[caffeine]] (and, in one strip, [[THC]]), and will sometimes invite people to suck directly out of his nose to ensure their fealty.  Mr Cola takes the form of the drug most enjoyed by the particular person looking at him.  For Greg, he appears as a large can of cola; for Miranda, as (presumably) a cup of [[espresso]] [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19981028]; and, for Sid, as a "big, juicy, thirty-kilogram [[Spliff|doobie]]" [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20010507].

===Crud Puppy===
:''First Appearance: [http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19980224&mode=classic February 24, 1998]''
Crud Puppy is [[#Dust Puppy|Dust Puppy]]'s nemesis, he "has the gnarled hands of a [[Microsoft]] programmer". 

''Life and Times of the Crud Puppy''

After Stef spilled coffee on his keyboard, the Crud Puppy appeared to consume it. Then challenging the Dust Puppy (they have obviously met before) to a [[Quake (video game)|Quake]] Deathmatch, he falls in his coffee and is drunk by Pitr.

Later Pitr is discovered to have a pair of hands (CP's) in his chest. During surgery to remove them, CP escapes, swipes a scapel and a goalie mask, regenerates his crud-body by consuming a Microsoft salesman, and hunts down Dust Puppy (who upon hearing the news attempts to flee to [[French Guiana]]).

After an inconclusive fight CP detours into [[Starbucks|"Skybucks" Coffee]] and is kicked into a coffee grinder by DP - and is promptly drunk by Pitr ''again''.

Still later CP is summoned by [[Bill Gates]] to assist in the Microsoft anti-trust trial; he latches onto Pitr's kidneys, regenerates again when the clumsy surgeon spills his coffee into Pitr, swipes yet another scapel and escapes.

DP then explains to Greg (who apparently was away during the first two Crud Puppy appearances) that, in previous lives 2000 years ago, he and CP became adversaries when [[Darth Vader|"Lord Crud"]] was commander of the [[Death Star|Imperial Death Orb]], which was destroyed by DP and [[Tux]] by uploading [[Windows 95]].

CP, meanwhile, has stolen the body (sans head) of the previous Microsoft attorney and (as "Sid Crud") wins the case; he then resigns in favour of a position at [[AOL]] ("it's the new evil")...

===Cthulhu===

'''Pearl''' Dabster is [[#Sid|Sid]]'s daughter.  She was originally introduced as a romantic rival to [[#Miranda|Miranda]] for [[#A.J.|A.J.]]'s affections.  She and [[#Pitr|Pitr]] have dated (to her father's disgust).  She holds an MBA and a Nuclear Engineering Degree.
