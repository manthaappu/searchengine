A '''quine''' is a [[computer program]] which produces a copy of its own [[source code]] as its only output. The standard terms for these programs in the [[computability theory]] and [[computer science]] literature are '''self-replicating programs''', '''self-reproducing programs''', and '''self-copying programs'''.

A quine is a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of an execution environment, when the execution environment is viewed as a function. Quines are possible in any programming language that has the ability to output any computable string, as a direct consequence of [[Kleene's recursion theorem]]. For amusement, programmers sometimes attempt to develop the shortest possible quine in any given [[programming language]].

The name "quine" is coined by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in his popular science book [[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]] in the honor of philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] (1908–2000), who made an extensive study of [[indirect self-reference]], and in particular for the following paradox-producing expression, known as [[Quine's paradox]]:

<blockquote>
"Yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation" yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation.
</blockquote>

The name has become popular between amateur enthusiasts and programming hobbyists although it is not adopted by computer scientists.

A quine takes no input. Allowing input would permit the source code to be fed to the program via the keyboard, opening the source file of the program, and similar mechanisms.

In some languages, an empty source file is a fixed point of the language, producing no output. Such an empty program, submitted as "the world's smallest self reproducing program", once won the "worst abuse of the rules" prize in the [[Obfuscated C]] contest.<ref>[http://www0.us.ioccc.org/1994/smr.hint IOCCC 1994 Worst Abuse of the Rules]</ref>

==History==

The idea of self-reproducing programs first appeared in ''[[Paul Bratley|Bratley, Paul]] and Jean Millo. "Computer Recreations; Self-Reproducing Automata", Software -- Practice & Experience, Vol. 2 (1972). pp. 397-400.'' Bratley first became interested in self-reproducing programs after seeing the first known such program written in [[Atlas Autocode]] at Edinburgh in the 1960s by the [[University of Edinburgh]] lecturer and researcher [[Hamish Dewar]]. This program appears below:

 %BEGIN
 !THIS IS A SELF-REPRODUCING PROGRAM
 %ROUTINESPEC R

In general, the method used to create a quine in any programming language is to have, within the program, two pieces: (a) [[Source code|code]] used to do the actual printing and (b) [[data]] that represents the textual form of the code (e.g., <code>progdata</code> in the first C example below).  The code functions by using the data to print the code (which makes sense since the data represents the textual form of the code), but it also uses the data, processed in a simple way (e.g., <code>quote()</code> below) to print the textual representation of the data itself.  

An example in colloquial English would be:

 "quoted and followed by itself is a quine." quoted and followed by itself is a quine.

The following [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] example neatly illustrates the point:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spikeypillow.com/nc/item/31|title=12/09: Quines of the World Unite}}</ref>
 main=putStr(p++show(p))where p="main=putStr(p++show(p))where p="

You read the above source as follows: print out ('''putStr''') the program text ('''p''') accompanied by a quoted ('''show'''n) version of the same, where the program text is the same as has just been said. Depending on programming environment, there could exist many ways the code and the data can be organized together within the program (neither must be contiguous), but a common telltale sign of the data section is that it mirrors some part of the entire program.

Here is a terser variation of the previous [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]:

  main=ap((putStr.).(++))show"main=ap((putStr.).(++))show"

This is actually, if you squint, a particular instance of (one particular) general pattern to produce a quine:

  (\o -> APPLY (UNQUOTE o) (QUOTE o)) (QUOTE (\o -> APPLY (UNQUOTE o) (QUOTE o)))

where CAPITALIZED identifiers are schematic. In passing, note the implicit "APPLY"s that are happening at the level of the programming language.

Armed with this template, we can unravel the second of the two previous Haskell quines. First, we extract the essential part of the quine

  ap(++)show"ap(++)show"

then note that

  ap f g = (\o -> f o (g o))

expanding this in the original gives

  (\o -> (++) o (show o)) "(\\o -> (++) o (show o))"

and matching this against our quine template produces

  APPLY   := (++)
  UNQUOTE := id
  QUOTE   := show

So, APPLY is string concatenation, QUOTE is string-escaping, and UNQUOTE is the identity.

We can also perform a similarly mechanical matching of the previous (slightly modified, but in a non-essential way) English quine:

  quoted and preceeded by itself is a quine. "quoted and preceeded by itself is a quine."

Also, notice that by using "is a quine", it references itself in another way as well, and this additional self reference is not essential for it to be a quine. In other words,

  quoted and preceeded by itself. "quoted and preceeded by itself."

is a quine.

===C===
The idea behind this quine is to store a copy of the program code in a string,
and use that to print out both the program code and the string.

<source lang="c">
/* A simple quine (self-printing program), in standard C. */

/* Note: in designing this quine, we have tried to make the code clear
 * and readable, not concise and obscure as many quines are, so that
 * the general principle can be made clear at the expense of length.
 * In a nutshell: use the same data structure (called "progdata"
 * below) to output the program code (which it represents) and its own
 * textual representation. */

#include <stdio.h>

void quote(const char *s)
     /* This function takes a character string s and prints the
      * textual representation of s as it might appear formatted
      * in C code. */
{
    int i;

    printf("    \"");
    for (i=0; s[i]; ++i) {
        /* Certain characters are quoted. */
        if (s[i] == '\\')
            printf("\\\\");
        else if (s[i] == '"')
            printf("\\\"");
        else if (s[i] == '\n')
            printf("\\n");
        /* Others are just printed as such. */
        else
            printf("%c", s[i]);
        /* Also insert occasional line breaks. */
        if (i % 48 == 47)
            printf("\"\n    \"");
    }
    printf("\"");
}

/* What follows is a string representation of the program code,

        {
            quote(progdata);    /* Quote all. */
            i++;                /* Skip second '@'. */
        } else
            printf("%c", progdata[i]);  /* Print character. */
    }
    return 0;
}
</source>

An alternative approach in C would be to make use of the C pre-processor. For example:

<source lang="c">
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
/* This macro B will expand to its argument, followed by a printf
 command that prints the macro invocation as a literal string */
#define B(x) x; printf("  B(" #x ")\n");

/* This macro A will expand to a printf command that prints the
 macro invocation, followed by the macro argument itself. */
#define A(x) printf("  A(" #x ")\n"); x;

/* Now we call B on a command to print the text of the program
 up to this point. It will execute the command, and then cause
 itself to be printed. */
  B(printf("#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv)\n{\n/*
    This macro B will expand to its argument, followed by a printf\n
    command that prints the macro invocation as a literal string
    */\n#define B(x) x; printf(\"  B(\" #x \")\\n\");\n\n/* This macro
    A will expand to a printf command that prints the\n
    macro invocation, followed by the macro argument itself. */\n#define A(x)
    printf(\"  A(\" #x \")\\n\"); x;\n\n/* Now we call B on a command
    to print the text of the program\n up to this point. It will execute
    the command, and then cause\n itself to be printed. */\n"))
  A(printf("/* Lastly, we call A on a command to print the remainder
    of the program;\n it will cause itself to be printed, and then
    execute the command. */\n}\n"))
/* Lastly, we call A on a command to print the remainder of the program;
 it will cause itself to be printed, and then execute the command. */
}
</source>

Note that in the above, the line beginning with <code>B(printf(</code> would be one line; there is exactly one space between the end of each line and the beginning of the next, but it is broken into multiple lines so that it does not overflow the screen. Likewise, the line beginning <code>A(printf(</code> has been broken into multiple lines.

After eliminating comments, the essence of this method is:

<source lang="c">
#define B(x) x; printf("{ B(" #x ") }\n");
int main()
{ B(printf("#define B(x) x; printf(\"{ B(\" #x \") }\\n\");\nint main()\n")) }
</source>

Here the <code>B</code> macro has been slightly altered, so that it produces a pair of braces around its invocation. This eliminates the need for an <code>A</code> macro.

An even shorter, classic,<ref>[http://www.nyx.net/~gthompso/quine.htm The Quine Page]</ref> approach in C instead exploits the ability of the <code>printf</code> function to use a [[format string]], passing a carefully-constructed string as both the format string and a substitution parameter.  Note: 34 is the ASCII code for a double-quote character, and is used to avoid the need to quote the double-quotes in the string literal.

<source lang='c'>
main() { char *s="main() { char *s=%c%s%c; printf(s,34,s,34); }"; printf(s,34,s,34); }
</source>

This program uses the <code>[[printf]]</code> function without including its corresponding header (<code>#include <[[stdio.h]]></code>), which can result in [[undefined behavior]]. Also, the return type declaration for main has been left off to reduce the length of the program.
<!-- DO NOT ADD ANY MORE QUINE EXAMPLES! Please read the talk page. -->

===Scheme (also valid Common Lisp)===
This quine works by feeding the program to itself, which then converts the data structure to source code.
<source lang="scheme">
((lambda (x) (list x (list 'quote x)))
 (quote (lambda (x) (list x (list 'quote x)))))
</source>

The example mentioned above is not absolutely correct, because it does not have [[output]] operators. The correct example is: 
<source lang="scheme">
(progn (setf a "(progn (setf a ~S) (format t a a))") (format t a a))
</source>
