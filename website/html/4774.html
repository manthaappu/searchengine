The '''Business Operating System''', or '''BOS''', is an early [[cross-platform]] [[operating system]] originally produced for [[Intel 8080]] and [[Motorola 6800]] [[computer]]s, subsequently for [[Zilog Z80]]-based computers, and then later for most [[microcomputer]]s of the 1980s.  [[CAP Ltd]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] company and at the time one of the world's largest [[Information Technology]] consulting firms, developed BOS.  CAP designed BOS and BOS applications for [[platform-independent|platform-independence]].

Via a [[management buyout]] (MBO) in 1981, BOS was spun off to three interlinked companies, MPSL (MicroProducts Software Ltd) which looked after the sales and marketing of BOS, MPPL (MicroProducts Programming Ltd) which looked after both the development of BOS and various horizontal software packages, and MicroProducts Training Ltd. BOS was distributed on a global basis, mainly to the United States and British Commonwealth, by a variety of independent and MPSL-owned companies.

The small BOS dealer/distributor network and its [[command line interface]] structure met its demise when [[graphical user interface]] operating systems became prevalent.

MPSL developed numerous products for BOS, generally targeting the horizontal markets, leaving the vertical markets (i.e. niche) to independent software vendors [[ISV]]. Examples of MPSL developed software include [[BOS/Finder]] ([[database]]), [[BOS/Planner]] ([[spreadsheet]]), BOS/Writer (word processor) and [[BOS/AutoClerk]] ([[report generation]]).  Companies sold various BOS [[accounting software]] suites in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and United States.  In the UK, BOS accounting packages were considered to be the industry standard by some accountants.

BOS applications were compiled to a ''[[p-code machine|p-code]]'' and [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreted]] as they ran.  BOS had a p-code interpreter so efficient that programs, even the [[BOS/Writer]] [[word processor]], ran sufficiently fast to satisfy users.  Apart from a 2-[[kilobyte]] (Kb) [[server (computing)/host]] [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]], BOS is written in [[BOS/MicroCobol]], a language based on [[COBOL]] but with system level programming constructs added and elements of structured programming, which bore a vague similarity to [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]].  In recent computing, programming languages such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] have re-introduced the concept of p-code "[[virtual machine]]s".

BOS required 48 Kb of [[RAM]] and two 250 Kb [[floppies]], though it was more commonly deployed on machines equipped with 64 [[kilobytes]] of RAM and a [[hard drive]].  A computer with 128 [[kilobyte|KB]] RAM and a 10-megabyte (Mb) hard drive could run as many as five [[concurrent user]]s.  When the [[IBM PC XT]] came out in 1983, BOS served over eight concurrent [[dumb terminals]] on it.  At the time, this made BOS very attractive.

With user-management tools and [[application programming interface]]s, BOS was considered an alternative even to the platform-specific operating systems on machines such as the [[PDP-11]] and the [[VAX]].

Despite, or because of its command line interface, BOS remains popular with medium to large organizations in the UK.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

== Other use ==
The phrase "Business Operating System" or "BOS" is also utilized to describe the standard, enterprise-wide collection of [[business process]]es used in many diversified industrial companies such as [[Ingersoll Rand]], [[Honeywell]], or [[Danaher]].  Each of these companies have adopted a standard, common collection of business processes and/or [[business process management|business process improvement methodologies]].  Specifically, Ingersoll Rand has established the Ingersoll Rand Business Operating System (BOS) to describe the six Enterprise Focus Areas—or strategic areas of focus—and its process improvement method known as [[Lean Six Sigma]].  Similarly, Honeywell has established the Honeywell Operating System (HOS) and Danaher is well known for its Danaher Business System (DBS).  While these standard Business Operating Systems may inform or be linked to a company's technology platform, they more commonly refer to the way the company manages complex business processes in a common way across its diverse portfolio of businesses.
