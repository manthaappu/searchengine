The '''Dutch Author Identification''' system assigns a unique number to all authors in the Dutch research system. The DAI links the PICA database in institutional libraries with the METIS national [[Current Research Information System|research information system]].

The Digital Author Identification (DAI) is a unique national number for every author active within a Dutch university, [[Vocational university|university of applied sciences]] or research institute. The DAI is prepared for the international [[List of ISO standards|ISO standard]] “ISNI” ([[International Standard Name Identifier]]). The DAI brings several publications from an author together, and distinguishes between authors with the same name.

== Other Author Identifiers ==

The DAI is part of the national knowledge infrastructure. In the [[scientific community]] other identifiers are in use as well, like ResearcherID<ref>[http://www.researcherid.com/ ResearcherID]</ref> or ScopusId<ref>[http://info.scopus.com/setup/admin/customizing/ ScopusID]</ref>. The DAI however is the only independent (non-commercial) number for the Dutch researcher.

== DAI in connections ==

SURFfoundation<ref>[http://www.surffoundation.nl/en/Pages/default.aspx SURFfoundation]</ref> has, in cooperation with OCLC PICA<ref>[http://www.oclc.org/uk/en/default.htm OCLC PICA]</ref>, created a connection with PICA National Thesaurus Authornames (NTA) that is supplied and maintained by university libraries. Important herin is the connection between the researchinformation system Metis<ref>[http://metis.hosting.kun.nl/metis/default.cfm?i=aboutmetis Metis]</ref> and the repositories.

== Applications ==

There are many potential applications of the DAI. Publications by an author can be collected more easily, even though the author may have worked at several institutions. When an author changes name, e.g. because of marriage, the DAI remains the same, enabling one to find publications from before the change of name. A case of an applications of the DAI is given by NARCIS<ref>[http://www.narcis.info/index NARCIS]</ref>. With a tool publicationslists can be generated on basis of the DAI. These publications are collected from the several repositories from Dutch scientific institutions. With the DAI this information can be presented integrated into one list.

In July 2009 an article was published in the Dutch newspaper NRC titled “No names, numbers!”. This article was a reaction to the publication in [[The Lancet]] in June about the Thompson ResearcherID. Two Dutch researchers advocated in this article an independent author ID. However, they were ignorant of the DAI, which could provide the solution to their problem.
