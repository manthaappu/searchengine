The '''Zero One or Infinity''' (ZOI) rule is a [[rule of thumb]] in [[software design]]. It suggests that arbitrary limits on the number of instances of a particular entity should not be allowed. Specifically, that an entity should either be forbidden entirely, one should be allowed, or any number (presumably, to the limit of available storage) of them should be allowed. It should not be the software that puts a hard limit on the number of instances of the entity.

Examples of this rule may be found in file directories.  The top-most directory has zero parent directories.  Each subdirectory has exactly one parent directory.  Each directory may contain an arbitrary number of files or subdirectories.  An example of a violation of this rule is that some operating systems impose a hard limit of 65,536 files in a directory.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.linux.org/docs/ldp/howto/UMSDOS-HOWTO-9.html | title = UMSDOS-WHY-TO | work = Linux Online | accessdate = 5 January 2010}}</ref>

A similar rule is mentioned in [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'' where it is asserted: "Two is an impossible number, and can't exist" referring to universes, deities, etc.
