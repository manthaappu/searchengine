'''''Foundations of Economic Analysis''''' is a book by [[Paul A. Samuelson]] published in 1947 (Enlarged ed., 1983). 
It sought to demonstrate a common mathematical structure underlying multiple branches of economics from two basic principles: [[mathematical programming|optimizing]] behavior of [[agent (economics)|agents]] and stability of [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] as to economic systems (such as markets or economies). Among other contributions, it advanced the theory of [[index numbers]] and generalized [[welfare economics]].  It is especially known for definitively stating and formalizing [[qualitative economics|qualitative]] and quantitative versions of the "[[comparative statics]]" method for calculating how a change in any [[parameter]] (say, a change in tax rates) affects an economic system. One of its key insights about comparative statics, called the [[Comparative statics#Stability|correspondence principle]], states that [[General equilibrium#Stability|stability]] of equilibrium implies testable predictions about how the equilibrium changes when parameters are changed. 

==Introduction==
The front page quotes the motto of [[J. Willard Gibbs]]:  "Mathematics is a language."  The book begins with this exacting statement:
:''The existence of analogies between central features of various theories implies the existence of a general theory which underlies the particular theories and unifies them with respect to those central features.''  This fundamental principle of generalization by abstraction was enunciated by the eminent American mathematician [[E. H. Moore]] more than thirty years ago.  It is the purpose of the pages that follow to work out its implications for theoretical and applied economics.

Its other stated purpose (p. 3) is to show how ''[[Falsifiability|operationally meaningful]] theorems'' can be described with a small number of ''analogous methods''. Thus, "a general theory of economic theories" (1983, p. xxvi).

== Methods and analysis ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Le Chatelier's principle]] -->
Samuelson's ''Foundations'' demonstrates that economic analysis benefits from the parsimonious and fruitful language of mathematics.  In its original version as a dissertation submitted to the David A. Wells Prize Committee of Harvard University in 1941, it was subtitled "The Observational Significance of Economic Theory" (p. ix). 

One unifying theme, on the striking formal similarities of analysis in seemingly diverse fields, occurred only in the course of writing on them—from consumer's behavior and production economics of the firm to international trade, business cycles, and income analysis.  It dawned on the author that he was prodigal "in proving essentially the same theorems" over and over.  His failure of initial intuition, so he suggests, might be less surprising in light of the few economic writings then extant concerned with formulating ''meaningful theorems'' -- hypotheses ''about'' empirical data—that could [[The Logic of Scientific Discovery|conceivably be refuted]] ''by'' empirical data (pp. 3–5).  

Samuelson (pp. 5, 21-24) finds three sources of meaningful theorems sufficient to illuminate his purposes:
* ''maximizing behavior'' of economic units (as to ''utility'' for a consumer and ''profit'' for a firm) 
* economic ''systems'' (including ''market''s and ''economies'') in ''stable'' equilibrium
* [[Qualitative economics|qualitative properties]] between two or more variables, such as an alleged technological relation or psychological law (indexed by the sign of the relevant functional relationship).
Part I conjectures that meaningful theorems for economic units and for their respective aggregates are almost all derivable  from general conditions of equilibrium. The equilibrium conditions can in turn be stated as ''maximization conditions''.  So, meaningful theorems reduce to [[Extremum|maximization conditions]].  The calculus of the relations is at a high level of abstraction but with the advantage of numerous applications.  Finally, Part I illustrates that there ''are'' meaningful theorems in economics, which apply to diverse fields.  

Part II concentrates on aggregation of economic units into equilibrium of the system. But the symmetry conditions required for direct maximization of the ''system'', whether a market or even the simplest model of the business cycle, are lacking, in contrast to an economic ''unit'' or its corresponding aggregate.  What can be hypothetically derived (or rejected in some cases) is a ''stable'' equilibrium of the system.  (This is an equilibrium of the system such that, if a variable disturbs equilibrium, the system converges to equilibrium.)  ''Stability of equilibrium'' is proposed as the principal source of operationally meaningful theorems for economic systems (p. 5).     

Analogies from physics (and biology) are conspicuous, such as the [[Le Chatelier's principle|Le Chatelier principle]] and  [[correspondence principle]], but they are given a nontrivially generalized formulation and application.  They and mathematical constructions, such as [[Lagrange multipliers|Lagrangian multipliers]], are given an operational economic interpretation.  The generalized ''Le Chatelier principle'' is for a maximum condition of equilibrium:   where all unknowns of the function are independently variable, auxiliary constraints ("just-binding" in leaving initial equilibrium unchanged)  reduce the response to a parameter change.  Thus, factor-demand and commodity-supply [[Elasticity (economics)|elasticities]] are hypothesized to be lower in the [[short run]] than in the [[long run]] because of the fixed-cost constraint in the short run.<ref>Eugene Silberberg, 2008. "Le Chatelier principle," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]''. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_L000049&edition=current&q=Le%20Chatelier%20principle&topicid=&result_number=11 Abstract.]]</ref>  In the course of analysis,  ''[[comparative statics]]'', changes in equilibrium of the system that result from a [[parameter]] change of the system, is formalized and most clearly stated (Kehoe, 1987, p. 517).<ref>Timothy Kehoe, 1987. "Comparative statics," ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 1, pp. 517–20.</ref>  The ''correspondence principle'' is that the  ''stability'' of equilibrium for a system (such as a market or economy) implies meaningful theorems in comparative statics.   Alternatively, the hypothesis of stability imposes directional restrictions on the movement of the system (Samuelson, pp. 258, 5).  The correspondence is between comparative [[statics]] and the dynamics implied by stability of equilibrium.

|The starting point of the analysis is the postulate of maximizing behavior.  The point is not (or not only) that everyone is out to maximize (Fischer, 1987, p. 235),<ref name="Fischer">[[Stanley Fischer]], 1987. "Samuelson, Paul Anthony," ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 4, pp. 234–41.</ref> even if true. Rather, first- and in particular higher-order (derivative) conditions of equilibrium at the maximum imply local behavioral relations (Samuelson, p. 16).  The stability of equilibrium with sufficient other hypothetical qualitative restrictions then generates testable hypotheses (pp. 16, 28-29).  Even where there is no context for purposive maximizing behavior, reduction to a maximization problem may be a convenient device for developing properties of the equilibrium, from which, however, no "[[Teleology|teleological]] or [[normative economics|normative]] welfare significance" is warranted (pp. 52–53).

Chapter VIII on [[welfare economics]] is described as an attempt "to give a brief but fairly complete survey of the whole field of welfare economics" (p. 252). This Samuelson does in 51 pages, including his exposition of what became known as the [[social welfare function#Bergson-Samuelson social welfare function|Bergson-Samuelson social welfare function]].  Theorems derived in welfare economics, he notes, are deductive implications of assumptions that are not refutable, thus not meaningful in a certain sense.   Still, the social welfare function can represent any index ([[cardinal utility|cardinal]] or not) of the economic measures of any logically possible ethical belief system that is required to [[total ordering|order]] any (hypothetically) feasible social configurations as "better than", "worse than",  or "indifferent to" each other (p. 221).  It also definitively elucidates the notion of [[Pareto optimality]] and the "germ of truth in Adam Smith's doctrine of the [[Invisible Hand]]" (Samuelson, 1983, p. xxiv; Fischer, 1987, p. 236<ref name="Fischer"/>).          

The final pages of the book (pp. 354–55) outline possible directions analytical methods might take, including for example models that show how:
* [[Deficit spending|deficit financing]] could produce positive short-run effects on the economy that are swamped by adverse long-run effects on capital accumulation (seriously reconsidered later as [[Crowding out (economics)|crowding out]])
* declines in [[Mortality rate|age-specific mortality]] affect the [[demography|net reproductive rate]] (whose the implications for [[population growth]] are [[:Image:Population curve.svg|less abstract]] than they might first appear).
Samuelson closes by expressing hope in the future use of ''comparative dynamics'' to:
: aid in the attack upon diverse problems -- from the trivial behavior of a single small commodity, to the fluctuations of important components of the business cycle, and even to the majestic problems of economic development.

== Appendices ==
There are two mathematical appendices totalling 83 pages. The first gathers and develops "very briefly" and "without striving for rigor" results on maximization conditions and [[quadratic forms]] used in the book and not conveniently collected elsewhere (p. 389).  The other is on [[difference equations]] ("for the dynamic economist") and other functional equations.

== Enlarged edition ==
The 1983 Enlarged edition includes an additional 12-page "Introduction" and a new 145-page appendix with some post-1947 developments in analytical economics, including how conclusions of the book are affected by them.
