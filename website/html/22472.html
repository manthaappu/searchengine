In [[computing]], '''locale''' is a set of [[parameter]]s that defines the user's language, country and any special variant preferences that the user wants to see in their [[user interface]]. Usually a locale identifier consists of at least a language identifier and a region identifier.

On [[Unix]], [[Linux]] and other [[POSIX]]-type platforms, locale identifiers are defined similar to the [[BCP 47]] definition of language tags, but the locale variant modifier is defined differently, and the [[character set]] is included as a part of the identifier. It is defined in this format: <tt><nowiki>[language[_territory][.codeset][@modifier]]</nowiki></tt>. (For example, [[Australian English]] using the [[UTF-8]] encoding is <tt>en_AU.UTF-8</tt>.)

== General locale settings ==

These settings usually include the following display (output) format settings:

* Number format setting
* Character classification, case conversion settings
* Date/Time format setting
* String collation setting
* Currency format setting
* Paper size setting
* other minor settings ...

The locale settings are about formatting output given a locale. So, the timezone information and daylight saving time are not usually part of the locale settings.
Less usual, but worth mentioning, is the input format setting. This is mostly defined on a per application basis.

Furthermore, the General settings usually include the [[keyboard layout]] setting.

== Programming/markup language support ==
In these environments,

{{multicol}}
* [[C (programming language)|C]]
* [[C++ (programming language)|C++]]
* [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]]
* [[Java (programming language)|Java]]
{{multicol-break}}
* [[Microsoft .NET]] framework
* [[REBOL]]
* [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]
* [[Perl (programming language)|Perl]]
{{multicol-break}}
* [[PHP]]
* [[Python (programming language)|Python]]
* [[XML]]
{{multicol-end}}

and other (nowadays) [[Unicode]]-based environments, they are defined in a format similar to [[BCP 47]]. They are usually defined with just [[ISO 639]] and [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] codes.

== POSIX-type platforms ==
On [[Unix]], [[Linux]] and other [[POSIX]]-type platforms, locale identifiers are defined similar to the [[BCP 47]] definition of language tags, but the locale variant modifier is defined differently, and the [[character set]] is included as a part of the identifier.

In the next example there is an output of command <code>locale</code> for [[Czech language]] (cs), [[Czech Republic]] (CZ) with explicit [[UTF-8]] encoding:

 $ '''locale'''
 LANG=cs_CZ.UTF-8
 LC_CTYPE="cs_CZ.UTF-8"
 LC_NUMERIC="cs_CZ.UTF-8"
 LC_TIME="cs_CZ.UTF-8"
 LC_COLLATE="cs_CZ.UTF-8"
 LC_MONETARY="cs_CZ.UTF-8"
 LC_MESSAGES="cs_CZ.UTF-8"
 LC_PAPER="cs_CZ.UTF-8"
 LC_NAME="cs_CZ.UTF-8"
 LC_ADDRESS="cs_CZ.UTF-8"
 LC_TELEPHONE="cs_CZ.UTF-8"
 LC_MEASUREMENT="cs_CZ.UTF-8"
 LC_IDENTIFICATION="cs_CZ.UTF-8"
 LC_ALL=

== Specifics for Microsoft platforms ==
Locale identifier (LCID) for [[Managed code|unmanaged code]] on [[Microsoft Windows]], a number such as 1033 for English (United States) or 1041 for Japanese (Japan). These numbers consist of a language code (lower 10 bits) and culture code (upper bits) and are therefore often written in [[hexadecimal]] notation, such as 0x0409 or 0x0411. The list of those codesets are described in [[character encoding]].
[[Microsoft]] is beginning to introduce unmanaged code [[Application programming interface]]s (APIs) for .NET that use this format. One of the first to be generally released is a function to mitigate issues with [[internationalized domain name]]s,[http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/intl/nls_DownlevelGetLocaleScripts.asp] but more are in [[Windows Vista]] Beta 1.

Beginning with [[Windows Vista]], [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd373814(v=VS.85).aspx new functions] that use [[BCP 47]] locale names have been introduced to replace nearly all LCID-based APIs.
