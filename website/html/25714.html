==Physical Space==
In February 2008 NYC Resistor took up residence at 397 Bridge Street in Brooklyn NY's [[MetroTech]] area.  The 800+ sqft warehouse conversion houses, a small kitchen, several shop tables, an epilog laser cutter, and a small machine shop.  Numerous electronics projects and personal tools litter shelves of members at the space.  A drink mixing robot also has become a permanent fixture at the location.  In March 2009 NYC Resistor acquired the neighboring warehouse space on the fifth floor of 397 bridge street and converted it to a machine shop.

March 2010, NYC Resistor moved to a new, larger space on 3rd Avenue in [[Boerum Hill]] upstairs from [[Makerbot]].
