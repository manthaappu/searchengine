<html> <head> <title>Robot learning</title></head><body>'''Robot learning''' is a subset of [[machine learning]] and [[robotics]].
Usually "robot learning" refers to learning to perform tasks such as [[obstacle avoidance]], [[Control engineering|control]] and various other motion-related tasks.  While [[machine learning]] is frequently used by [[computer vision]] algorithms employed in the context of robotics, these applications are usually not referred to as "robot learning"  Robot learning can be closely related to [[adaptive control]] and [[reinforcement learning]].
