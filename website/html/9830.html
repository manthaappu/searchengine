In [[topology]], a '''retraction''', as the name suggests, "retracts" an entire [[space (mathematics)|space]] into a [[Subspace topology|subspace]]. A '''deformation retraction''' is a [[function (mathematics)|map]] which captures the idea of ''[[continuous function|continuously]] shrinking'' a space into a subspace.

== Definitions ==

=== Retract ===

Let ''X'' be a [[topological space]] and ''A'' a subspace of ''X''. Then a continuous map 

:<math>r:X \to A</math> 

is a ''retraction'' if the [[function (mathematics)#Restrictions and extensions|restriction]] of ''r'' to ''A'' is the [[Identity_function|identity map]] on ''A''; that is, ''r''(''a'') = ''a'' for all ''a'' in ''A''. Equivalently, denoting by 

:<math>\iota : A \hookrightarrow X</math> 

the [[Inclusion_map|inclusion]], a retraction is a continuous map ''r'' such that 

:<math>r \circ \iota = id_A,</math> 

that is, the composition of ''r'' with the inclusion is the identity of ''A''. Note that, by definition, a retraction maps ''X'' [[onto]] ''A''. A subspace ''A'' is called a '''retract''' of ''X'' if such a retraction exists. For instance, any space retracts to a point in the obvious way (the constant map yields a retraction). If ''X'' is hausdorff, then ''A'' must be closed.

A space ''X'' is known as an '''absolute retract''' (or '''AR''') if for every [[normal space]] ''Y'' that embeds ''X'' as a closed subset, ''X'' is a retract of ''Y''. The unit cube ''I<sup>n</sup>'' as well as the [[Hilbert cube]] ''I<sup>ω</sup>'' are absolute retracts.

=== Neighborhood retract ===

If there exists an [[open set]] ''U'' such that 

:<math>A \subset U \subset X</math> 

and ''A'' is a retract of ''U'', then ''A'' is called a '''neighborhood retract''' of ''X''.

A space ''X'' is an '''absolute neighborhood retract''' (or '''ANR''') if for every normal space ''Y'' that embeds ''X'' as a closed subset, ''X'' is a neighborhood retract of ''Y''. The ''n''-sphere ''S<sup>n</sup>'' is an absolute neighborhood retract.

=== Deformation retract and Strong deformation retract===

A continuous map 

:<math>F:X \times [0, 1] \to X</math> 

is a ''deformation retraction'' of a space ''X'' onto a subspace ''A'' if, for every ''x'' in ''X'' and ''a'' in ''A'',

:<math> F(x,0) = x, \; F(x,1) \in A ,\quad \mbox{and} \quad F(a,1) = a.</math>

In other words, a deformation retraction is a [[homotopy]] between a retraction and the identity map on ''X''. The subspace ''A'' is called a '''deformation retract''' of ''X''. A deformation retract is a special case of [[homotopy equivalence]].

A retract need not be a deformation retract. For instance, having a single point as a deformation retract would imply a space is path connected (in fact, it would imply contractibility of the space).

''Note:'' An equivalent definition of deformation retraction is the following. A continuous map ''r'': ''X'' &rarr; ''A'' is a deformation retraction if it is a retraction and its composition with the inclusion is homotopic to the identity map on ''X''. In this formulation, a deformation retraction carries with it a homotopy between the identity map on ''X'' and itself. 

If, in the definition of a deformation retraction, we add the requirement that 

:<math>F(a,t) = a\,</math> 

for all ''t'' in [0, 1], ''F'' is called a '''strong deformation retraction'''. In other words, a strong deformation retraction leaves points in ''A'' fixed throughout the homotopy. (Some authors, such as [[Allen Hatcher]], take this as the definition of deformation retraction.)

==Neighborhood deformation retract==

A pair <math>(X, A)</math> of spaces in U is an NDR-pair if there exists a map <math>u:X \rightarrow I</math> such that <math>A = u^{-1} (0)</math> and a homotopy
<math>h:I \times X \rightarrow X</math> such that <math>h(0, x) = x</math> for all <math>x \in X</math>, <math>h(t, a) = a</math> for all
<math>(t, a) \in I \times A</math>, and <math>h(1, x) \in A</math> for all <math>x \in u^{-1} [ 0 , 1)</math>. The pair <math>(h, u)</math> is said to
be a representation of <math>(X, A)</math> as an NDR-pair.

==Properties==

Deformation retraction is a particular case of homotopy equivalence. In fact, two spaces are [[homotopy equivalent]] [[if and only if]] they are both deformation retracts of a single larger space. 

Any topological space which deformation retracts to a point is [[contractible space|contractible]] and vice versa. However, there exist contractible spaces which do not strongly deformation retract to a point.
