In [[cryptography]], '''MultiSwap''' is a [[block cipher]]/[[message authentication code|MAC]] created by [[Microsoft]] in 1999 as part of its [[Windows Media DRM]] service (WMDRM). Microsoft's internal name for the algorithm is not publicly known; it was dubbed MultiSwap in a 2001 report on WMDRM under the pseudonym "Beale Screamer".

The cipher has a [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] of 64 bits, but the two halves are processed nearly separately. All arithmetic operations are performed [[modular arithmetic|mod]] 2<sup>32</sup>. In the encryption process, each half block has added to it the output of the previous half block. Next it undergoes 5 multiplications by odd 32-bit subkeys, each followed by a swap of its 16-bit halves. Then a final subkey is added to it. As the half blocks use separate subkeys, and the multipliers are forced to be odd, the total [[key size]] is 374 bits. The name MultiSwap comes from the cipher's multiplications and swaps. WMDRM uses this algorithm only as a MAC, never for encryption.

Borisov, et al. applied a multiplicative form of [[differential cryptanalysis]] to break MultiSwap.
