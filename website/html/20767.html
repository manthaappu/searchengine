'''Knowledge compilation''' is a family of approaches for addressing the intractability of
a number of [[artificial intelligence]] problems.

A propositional model is compiled in an off-line phase in order to support some queries in polytime. Many ways of compiling a propositional models exist <ref name="darwiche">Adnan Darwiche, Pierre Marquis, "[http://www.jair.org/media/989/live-989-2063-jair.pdf A Knowledge Compilation Map]", Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research 17 (2002) 229-264</ref>.
Among others: [[Negation normal form|NNF]], DNNF, d-DNNF, [[Binary decision diagram|BDD]], [[Multi-valued Decision Diagram|MDD]], [[Disjunctive normal form|DNF]] and [[Conjunctive normal form|CNF]].

Different compiled representations have different properties.
The three main properties are:
* The compactness of the representation
* The queries that are supported in polytime
* The transformations of the representations that can be performed in polytime
