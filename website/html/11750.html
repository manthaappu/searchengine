An '''effective method''' (also called an '''effective procedure''') is one which reduces the solution of some class of problems to a series of rote steps  which, if followed to the letter, and as far as may be necessary, is bound to:
*always give some answer rather than ever give no answer;
*always give the right answer and never give a wrong answer;
*always be completed in a finite number of steps, rather than in an infinite number;
*work for all instances of problems of the class.

An effective method for calculating the values of a function is an [[algorithm]]; functions with an effective method are sometimes called '''effectively calculable.'''

Several independent efforts to give a formal characterization of effective calculability led to a variety of proposed definitions ([[Recursion|general recursion]], [[Turing machine]]s, [[λ-calculus]]) that later were shown to be equivalent; the notion captured by these definitions is known as [[Computable function|(recursive) computability]].

[[Church's thesis]] states that the two notions coincide: any [[number-theoretic function]] that is effectively calculable is [[computable function|recursively computable]]. Church's thesis is not a mathematical statement and cannot be proved by a [[mathematical proof]].

A further elucidation of the term "effective method" may include the requirement that, when given a problem from outside the class for which the method is effective, the method may halt or loop forever without halting, but must not return a result as if it were the answer to the problem. 

An essential feature of an effective method is that it does not require any [[ingenuity]] from any person or machine executing it.<ref>The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, ''effective procedure''</ref>
