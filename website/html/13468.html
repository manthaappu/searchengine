<html> <head> <title>Fiber (mathematics)</title></head><body>In [[mathematics]], the '''fiber''' of a point ''y'' in ''Y'' under a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is the [[inverse relation|inverse]] [[image (mathematics)|image]] of [[singleton (mathematics)|{''y''}]] under ''f'', that is, <math>f^{-1}(\{y\})=\{x \in X : f(x) = y\}</math>

In a variant phrase, this is also called the '''fiber''' of ''f'' at ''y''. It is also commonly denoted <math>f^{-1}(y)</math>.

In various applications, this is also called:
# The '''preimage''' of ''y'' under ''f'', or the '''preimage''' of ''f'' at ''y''. (However, this terminology can also be used in such a way that we would speak of the preimages of ''subsets'' of Y; thus, we would say the preimage of {''y''} under ''f'')
# The '''[[level set]]''' of ''y'' under ''f'', or the '''level set''' of ''f'' at ''y''.

In algebraic geometry, the notion of a fiber of a morphism of schemes must be defined more carefully because in general, not every point is closed. In this case, if ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' is a morphism of schemes, the fiber of a point ''p'' in ''Y'' is the fibered product <math>X\times_Y \mathrm{Spec}\, k(p)</math> where ''k''(''p'') is the residue field at ''p''.
In the same contexts, the spelling '''fibre''' is also seen.
