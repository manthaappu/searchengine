They randomly generate events as those produced in [[particle accelerators]], [[collider]] experiments or during the initial phases of the Universe creation.
Events come in different types called ''processes'' as discussed in the [[Automatic calculation of particle interaction or decay]] article.

Despite the simple structure of the tree-level [[perturbation theory|perturbative]] [[quantum field theory]] description of the [[collision]] and [[radioactive decay|decay]] processes in an event, the observed high-energy process usually contains significant amount of modifications, like [[photon]] and [[gluon]] ''[[bremsstrahlung]]'' or loop [[Feynman diagram|diagram]] corrections, that usually are too complex to be easily evaluated in real calculations directly on the diagrammatic level. Furthermore, the non-perturbative nature of [[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] [[bound state]]s makes it necessary to include information that is beyond the reach of perturbative quantum field theory, and well beyond present ability of computation in [[lattice QCD]]. And in collisional systems more complex than a few [[lepton]]s and [[hadron]]s (e.g. heavy-ion collisions), the collective behavior of the system would involve a [[phenomenology (particle physics)|phenomenological]] description that also cannot be easily obtained from the fundamental field theory by a simple calculus.

Any realistic test of the underlying physical process in a [[particle accelerator]] [[experiment]], therefore, requires an adequate inclusion of these complex behaviors surrounding the actual process. Based on the fact that in most processes a [[factorization]] of the full process into individual problems is possible (which means a negligible effect from [[interference]]{{dn}}), these individual processes are calculated separately, and the [[probability|probabilistic]] branching between them are performed using [[Monte Carlo method]]s.

The final-state particles generated by event generators can be fed into the detector simulation, allowing a precise prediction and verification for the entire system of experimental setup. However, as the detector simulation is usually a complex and computationally expensive task, simple event analysis techniques are also performed directly on event generator results.

A typical hadronic event generator simulates the following subprocesses:

* Initial-state composition and substructure
* Initial-state [[particle shower|shower]]s
* The hard process
* [[Resonance]] decay
* Final-state showers
* Accompanying semi-hard processes
* [[Hadronization]] and further decay

A typical heavy-ion event generator usually can be less strict in simulating the rare and rather negligible processes found in a hadronic generator, but would need to simulate the following subprocesses, in addition to those in a hadronic generator:

* [[atomic nucleus|Nuclear]] initial-state
* High multiplicity, soft processes
* In-medium energy loss
* Collective behavior of the medium ''(not handled properly by any generators sofar)''

Partly due to historic reasons, most event generators are written in [[FORTRAN 77]], with a few [[C++]] generators slowly emerging in recent years. The [[Particle Data Group]] maintains a [[Standardization|standard]] for designating [[Standard Model]] particles and [[Resonance#Quantum field theory|resonances]] with [[integer]] [[code]]s in event generators (also known as the "PDG code").
