'''PAWN''', formerly known as '''Small''', is an [[open source]] [[programming language]] primarily intended as an embeddable [[scripting language]]. It is maintained by a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] company named CompuPhase, which released the first version in 1998.<ref name="history.txt">history.txt, distributed with the source code</ref> The language was known as Small until version 3 was released in March 2005.<ref name="history.txt" />

PAWN is a [[dynamic typing|typeless]] language influenced by [[Small-C]].<ref name="lang-guide"/> and has [[C syntax|C-like syntax]]<ref>{{cite web | title=The Pawn language | url=http://www.compuphase.com/pawn/pawn.htm | accessdate=2008-03-08}}</ref>

PAWN has been used in a few projects. It is the principal coding language, along with [[C++]], in [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas#Other additions and changes|Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Multiplayer]] servers. It is also used in the Half-Life mod, AMX Mod X and Source Engine based SourceMod. 

== Design ==
PAWN code is compiler-oriented. Source code is stored in a PWN format file, which is the equivalent of a text file. Once compiled, an AMX format file is created, which stores the actual, encrypted code. Once it is in the AMX format, it requires a decrypting tool or interpreter in order to be utilized. In some cases, it can be seamlessly integrated with other languages as well.

<!-- == Features ==

* pawn is a simple, C-like, language.
* pawn is a robust language with a compiler that performs a maximum of static checks, and an [[abstract machine]] with (static) P-code verification and dynamic checks.
* For [[porting]] purposes, pawn is written in [[ANSI C]] as much as possible; [[Endian]] issues are handled.
* To suit internationalization and localization, pawn supports Unicode/UCS-4 and UTF-8, as well as codepages. The compiler can convert source code entered in a particular codepage to Unicode; it also supports source code files in UTF-8 format.
* pawn is quick.
* pawn is small. It has been fitted on an Atmel ATmega128 microcontroller, Philips LPC2138 and LPC2106 microcontrollers (ARM7TDMI core with 32 kiB RAM), as well as on a Texas Instrument's MSP430F1611 (MSP430 core with 10 kiB RAM and 48 kiB Flash ROM). Using code overlays that are loaded on demand, pawn is able to run large scripts in little memory.
* Documenting the source code can be done with "documentation comments"; the pawn compiler extracts those comments, combines them with information it deduces from the source code and writes an XML file that is immediately viewable (and printable) with a web browser.
* pawn supports states and automatons in the language, including state-local variables.
Removed because it is ad-like. If someone could fix it up, it would be great. -->

== Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Multiplayer ==
A common use for PAWN is in the popular unofficial [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]] modification "[http://www.sa-mp.com San Andreas Multiplayer]". This allows server hosts to enable their scripts to perform all the tasks available to players of the single player version of "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas". This is made possible by the ability for server hosts to create their own "game modes" with the PAWN compiler. The implementation of the PAWN language also allows users to interact with the game in ways previously not possible in the single player environment.

== Side-script design ==
PAWN is designed to be used a a side-script with code from other languages. PAWN does not ship with native functions which can be used for developing, instead PAWN's functions come from "include" files.
