'''Bash Bish Falls State Park''' is a [[Massachusetts]] [[state park]] located in [[Mount Washington, Massachusetts|Mount Washington]] which is named after [[Bash Bish Falls]], Massachusetts' highest single-drop [[waterfall]] (60 ft), which lies within its borders. The park is managed by the [[Department of Conservation and Recreation (Massachusetts)|Department of Conservation and Recreation]] and provides scenic views and a number of recreational opportunities, including fishing and hiking &ndash; but swimming or climbing near the falls is prohibited.

Bash Bish State Park consists of numerous [[Canyon|gorges]] and an [[Eastern Hemlock]] ravine forest.  The slopes around the waterfall are covered by forests of trees such as [[maple]], [[oak]], and [[beech]]. Wildlife includes the [[timber rattlesnake]], the [[peregrine falcon]], [[bobcat]]s, [[American black bear|black bear]]s, and [[porcupine]]s.  

The park is open from dawn to dusk. The falls are reached via a moderately strenuous uphill trail. No facilities are provided. Carry in â€“ carry out all belongings.

The park is one of a cluster of nature preserves in the extreme southwestern corner of Massachusetts noted for their scenery. It is adjacent to the [[Mount Everett State Reservation]] and the {{convert|4000|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Mount Washington State Forest]], as well as New York's {{convert|5000|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Taconic State Park]].<ref>[http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/western/bash.htm Bash Bish Falls State Park]</ref>
