'''Unicon''' is a [[programming language]] designed by American computer scientist Clint Jeffery. Unicon descended from [[Icon programming language|Icon]] and its preprocessor, [[IDOL]], that offers better access to the [[operating system]] as well as support for [[object-oriented programming]]. Unicon began life as a merger of three popular Icon extensions: an OO preprocessor named Idol, a [[POSIX]] filesystem and networking interface, and an [[Open Database Connectivity|ODBC]] facility.  The name is shorthand for "Unified Extended Dialect of Icon." 

Compared with Icon, many of the new features of Unicon are extensions to the I/O and system interface, to complement Icon's core control and data structures. Rather than providing lower-level API's as-is from C, Unicon implements higher level and easier to use facilities, enabling rapid development of graphic- and network-intensive applications in addition to Icon's core strengths in text and file processing.
 
* classes and packages
*[[Exception handling|exceptions]] as a contributed class library - see mailing list
* loadable child programs 
* monitoring of child programs
* dynamic loading of C modules (some platforms)
* multiple inheritance, with novel{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} semantics
* ODBC database access
* dbm files can be used as associative arrays
* posix system interface
* 3D graphics

When run as a graphical IDE, the Unicon program ui.exe continues to offer links to Icon help.

The official [http://unicon.sourceforge.net/book/ub.pdf Unicon programming book in PDF format] is a popular way to learn Unicon.  The book includes an introduction to object-oriented development as well as [[Unified_Modeling_Language|UML]].  It includes useful chapters on topics such as the use of Unicon for CGI.  Recent additions to Unicon include [[XMLHttpRequest]] and [[SNOBOL]]-style pattern matching.

Unicon is not yet [[Unicode]]-compliant and there are opportunities posted at a help-wanted page.<ref>http://unicon.sourceforge.net/helpwanted.html</ref>

==Example==
<source lang="lua">
procedure main()
	w := open("test UNICON window", "g")
	write( w, "testing")
	write( w, "Any key will close this window")
	read(w)
	close(w)
end
</source>
