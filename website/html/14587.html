The '''GNU Compiler Collection''' (usually shortened to '''GCC''') is a [[compiler]] system produced by the [[GNU Project]] supporting various [[programming language]]s. GCC is a key component of the [[GNU toolchain]]. As well as being the official compiler of the unfinished [[GNU]] operating system, GCC has been adopted as the standard compiler by most other modern [[Unix-like]] computer [[operating system]]s, including [[GNU]]/[[Linux]], the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] family and [[Mac OS X]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} GCC has been [[porting|ported]] to a wide variety of [[processor architecture]]s, and is widely deployed as a tool in commercial, [[proprietary software|proprietary]] and [[closed source software]] development environments. GCC is also available for most embedded platforms, for example [[Symbian]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/symbian-gcc/|title=Symbian GCC Improvement Project|accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref> [[AMCC]] and [[Freescale]] [[Power Architecture]]-based chips.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/overview.jsp?code=CW_BSP&fsrch=1|title=Linux Board Support Packages|accessdate=2008-08-07}}</ref> The compiler can target a wide variety of platforms, including [[videogame consoles]] such as the [[PlayStation 2]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ps2stuff.playstation2-linux.com/gcc_build.html |title=setting up gcc as a cross-compiler |work=ps2stuff |date=2002-06-08 |accessdate=2008-12-12}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> and [[Dreamcast]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ngine.de/gccguide.html |title=sh4 g++ guide |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021220025554/http://www.ngine.de/gccguide.html |archivedate=2002-12-20 |accessdate=2008-12-12 |quote=This guide is intended for people who want to compile C++ code for their Dreamcast systems }}</ref> Several companies<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fsf.org/resources/service|title=FSF Service Directory}}</ref> make a business out of supplying and supporting GCC ports to various platforms, and chip manufacturers today consider a GCC port almost essential to the success of an architecture.

Originally named the '''GNU C Compiler''', because it only handled the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], GCC 1.0 was released in 1987, and the compiler was extended to compile [[C++]] in December of that year.<ref name="release-history"/> [[Compiler#Front_end|Front ends]] were later developed for [[Fortran]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[Objective-C]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], and [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.4.0/gcc/G_002b_002b-and-GCC.html#G_002b_002b-and-GCC|title=Programming Languages Supported by GCC|accessdate=2009-05-03|publisher=GNU Project}}</ref>

The [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) distributes GCC under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GNU GPL). GCC has played an important role in the growth of [[free software]], as both a tool and an example.

==History==
[[Richard Stallman]] started GCC in 1985. He extended an existing compiler to compile C. The compiler originally compiled [[Pastel (programming language)|Pastel]], an extended, nonportable dialect of [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], and was written in Pastel. It was rewritten in C by [[Leonard H. Tower Jr.|Len Tower]] and Stallman,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Stallman | first = Richard M. | title = GNU Status| journal = GNU's Bulletin | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | publisher = Free Software Foundation |date=February 1986 | url = http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~trent/gnu/bull/01/bull01.txt | accessdate = 2006-09-26 }}</ref> and released in 1987<ref>Tower, Leonard (1987) "[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.misc/msg/32eda22392c20f98 GNU C compiler beta test release,]" ''comp.lang.misc'' USENET newsgroup; see also http://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html#timeline</ref> as the compiler for the GNU Project, in order to have a compiler available that was [[free software]]. Its development was supervised by the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF).<ref>Stallman, Richard M. (2001) "[http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-2.95.3/gcc_23.html#SEC260 Contributors to GCC,]" in [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-2.95.3/gcc.html#SEC_Top ''Using and Porting the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)''] for gcc version 2.95 (Cambridge, Mass.: Free Software Foundation)</ref>

By 1991, GCC 1.x had reached a point of stability, but architectural limitations prevented many desired improvements, so the FSF started work on GCC 2.x.

As GCC was free software, programmers wanting to work in other directions—particularly those writing interfaces for languages other than [[C (programming language)|C]]—were free to develop their own [[fork (software)|fork]] of the compiler. Multiple forks proved inefficient and unwieldy, however, and the difficulty in getting work accepted by the official GCC project was greatly frustrating for many. The FSF kept such close control on what was added to the official version of GCC 2.x that GCC was used as one example of the "cathedral" development model in [[Eric S. Raymond]]'s essay ''[[The Cathedral and the Bazaar]]''.

With the release of [[4.4BSD]] in 1994, GCC became the default compiler for BSD systems.

===EGCS fork===
In 1997, a group of developers formed EGCS (Experimental/Enhanced GNU Compiler System),<ref>{{cite web|title=Pentium Compiler FAQ|url=http://home.schmorp.de/pgcc-faq.html#egcs}}</ref> to merge several experimental forks into a single project. The basis of the merger was a GCC development snapshot taken between the 2.7 and 2.81 releases. Projects merged included g77 ([[Fortran|FORTRAN]]), PGCC ([[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]] [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]]-optimized GCC), many [[C++]] improvements, and many new architectures and [[operating system]] variants.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Brief History of GCC|url=http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/History}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Short History of GCC development|url=http://www.softpanorama.org/People/Stallman/history_of_gcc_development.shtml}}</ref>

EGCS development proved considerably more vigorous than GCC development, so much so that the FSF officially halted development on their GCC 2.x compiler, "blessed" EGCS as the official version of GCC and appointed the EGCS project as the GCC maintainers in April 1999. Furthermore, the project explicitly adopted the "bazaar" model over the "cathedral" model. With the release of GCC 2.95 in July 1999, the two projects were once again united.

GCC is now maintained by a varied group of programmers from around the world, under the direction of a steering committee.<ref>{{cite web
 |url=http://gcc.gnu.org/steering.html
 |title=GCC steering committee}}</ref>
It has been ported to more kinds of [[central processing unit|processors]] and [[operating system]]s than any other compiler.<ref>[http://www.linfo.org/gcc.html Linux Information Project] (LINFO) accessed 2010-04-27</ref>

==Uses==
GCC is often the compiler of choice for developing software that is required to execute on a wide variety of hardware and/or operating systems. System-specific compilers provided by hardware or OS vendors can differ substantially, complicating both the software's source code and the scripts which invoke the compiler to build it. With GCC, most of the compiler is the same on every platform, so only code which explicitly uses platform-specific features must be rewritten for each system.

===Current GCC release===
The current stable release of GCC is '''4.5.2''', and was released on December 16, 2010.

Version 4.5 includes several minor new features (new targets, new language dialects) and a couple major new features:
* ''Link-time optimization'' optimizes across object file boundaries to directly improve the linked binary. Link-time optimization relies on an intermediate file containing the serialization of some -Gimple- representation included in the object file [http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/LinkTimeOptimization]. The file is generated alongside the object file during source compilation. Each source compilation generates a separate object file and link-time helper file. When the object files are linked, the compiler is executed again and uses the helper files to optimize code across the separately compiled object files.
* ''[[Plugins]]'' can extend the GCC compiler directly [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Plugins.html]. Plugins allow a stock compiler to be tailored to specific needs by external code loaded as plugins. For example, plugins can add, replace, or even remove middle–end passes operating on ''Gimple'' representations. Several GCC plugins have already been published, notably:
** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Treehydra TreeHydra] to help with Mozilla code development
** [http://dragonegg.llvm.org/ DragonEgg] to use the GCC front-end with [[LLVM]]
** [http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/MiddleEndLispTranslator MELT] (site [http://gcc-melt.org/ GCC MELT]) to enable coding GCC extensions in a [[Lisp (programming language)|lisp]]y [[Domain Specific Language|domain-specific language]] providing powerful [[Pattern-matching]]
** [http://ctuning.org/wiki/index.php/CTools:MilepostGCC MILEPOST] [http://ctuning.org/ CTuning] to use [[machine learning]] techniques to tune the compiler.

===The GCC trunk (preparing next GCC release)===

Most of the development work happens inside the GCC '''trunk'''. The next major release of GCC should be '''4.6''' and is worked upon inside the ''GCC trunk''. It should notably provide support for the [[Go_(programming_language)|Go]] programming language and for quad-precision floating point. ''GCC 4.6'' will probably be released in 2011.

==Languages==
<!-- dates of the first release for each language would be a useful add. -->
The standard compiler release 4.3 includes front ends for [[C (programming language)|C]] (<tt>gcc</tt>), [[C++]] (<tt>g++</tt>), [[Java (programming language)|Java]] (<tt>[[gcj]]</tt>), [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] ([[GNAT]]), [[Objective-C]] (<tt>gobjc</tt>), [[Objective-C#Objective-C++|Objective-C++]] (<tt>gobjc++</tt>), and [[Fortran]] (<tt>[[gfortran]]</tt>). Also available, but not in standard are [[Modula-2]], [[Modula-3]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] (<tt>[[GNU Pascal|gpc]]</tt>), [[PL/I]], [[D (programming language)|D]] (<tt>gdc</tt>), [[Mercury (programming language)|Mercury]], and [[VHDL]] (<tt>ghdl</tt>).<ref>[http://gcc.gnu.org/frontends.html GCC Front Ends], GCC.org, Retrieved May 11, 2008.</ref> A popular parallel language extension, [[OpenMP]], is also supported. The GCC steering committee has recently announced that it will also support the [[Go (programming language)|Go]] programming language in GCC 4.5 or later.<ref>[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gcc.devel/111603 "gccgo language contribution accepted"], gmane.org, Retrieved January 26, 2010.</ref>

The Fortran front end was <tt>g77</tt> before version 4.0, which only supports [[FORTRAN 77]]. In newer versions, <tt>g77</tt> is dropped in favor of the new <tt>[[gfortran]]</tt> front end that supports [[Fortran 95]] and parts of [[Fortran 2003]] as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Fortran2003|title=Fortran 2003 Features in GNU Fortran}}</ref> As the later Fortran standards incorporate the F77 standard, standards-compliant F77 code is also standards-compliant F90\5 code, and so can be compiled without trouble in gfortran. A front-end for [[CHILL]] was dropped due to a lack of maintenance.<ref>[http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2002-04/msg00887.html [PATCH&#93; Remove chill], gcc.gnu.org, Retrieved July 29, 2010.</ref>

A few experimental branches exist to support additional languages, such as the GCC [[Unified Parallel C|UPC]] compiler<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intrepid.com/upc.html |title=GCC UPC (GCC Unified Parallel C) &#124; intrepid.com |publisher=intrepid.com<! |date=2006-02-20 |accessdate=2009-03-11}}</ref> for [[Unified Parallel C]].

The [[gcj]] Java compiler can target either a native machine language architecture or the [[Java Virtual Machine]]'s [[Java bytecode]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://gcc.gnu.org/java/ | title = The GNU Compiler for the Java Programming Language | accessdate = 2010-04-22}}</ref> When [[retargetable compiler|retargeting]] GCC to a new platform, [[bootstrapping (compilers)|bootstrapping]] is often used.

==Structure==
GCC's external interface is generally standard for a [[UNIX]] compiler. Users invoke a driver program named <code>gcc</code>, which interprets [[Command-line argument|command arguments]], decides which language compilers to use for each input file, runs the [[Assembly language#Assembler|assembler]] on their output, and then possibly runs the [[Linker (computing)|linker]] to produce a complete [[executable]] binary.

Each of the language compilers is a separate program that inputs source code and outputs assembly code. All have a common internal structure. A per-language front end [[parsing|parses]] the source code in that language and produces an [[abstract syntax tree]] ("tree" for short).

These are, if necessary, converted to the middle-end's input representation, called ''GENERIC'' form; the middle-end then gradually transforms the program towards its final form. [[Compiler optimization]]s and [[static code analysis]] techniques (such as FORTIFY_SOURCE,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/Features |title=Security Features: Compile Time Buffer Checks (FORTIFY_SOURCE) |publisher=fedoraproject.org |accessdate=2009-03-11}}</ref> a compiler directive which attempts to discover some [[buffer overflow]]s) are applied to the code. These work on multiple representations, mostly the architecture-independent GIMPLE representation and the architecture-dependent [[Register Transfer Language|RTL]] representation. Finally, assembly language is produced using architecture-specific [[pattern matching]] originally based on an algorithm of [[Jack Davidson]] and [[Chris Fraser]].

GCC is written primarily in [[C (programming language)|C]] except for parts of the [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] front end. The distribution includes the standard libraries for Ada, [[C++]], and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] whose code is mostly written in those languages.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ohloh.net/projects/gcc/analyses/latest | title = languages used to make GCC }}</ref><!-- primary source --> On some platforms, the distribution also includes a low-level runtime library, '''libgcc''', written in a combination of machine-independent C and processor-specific assembly language, designed primarily to handle arithmetic operations that the target processor cannot perform directly.<ref>[http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Libgcc.html GCC Internals], GCC.org, Retrieved March 01, 2010.</ref>

In May 2010, the GCC steering committee decided to allow use of a C++ compiler to compile GCC.<ref>
{{cite news
 |title=GCC allows C++ – to some degree
 |url=http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/GCC-allows-C-to-some-degree-1012611.html
 |publisher=[[Heinz Heise|The H]] |date=1 June 2010}}</ref>  The compiler will be written in C plus a subset of features from C++.  In particular, this was decided so that GCC's developers could use the "[[Destructor (computer science)|destructors]]" and "[[Generic programming|generics]]" features of C++.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2010-07/msg00518.html|title=An email by Richard Stallman on emacs-devel|quote=The reason the GCC developers wanted to use it is for destructors and generics.  These aren't much use in Emacs, which has GC and in which data types are handled at the Lisp level.}}</ref>

===Front-ends===
Frontends vary internally, having to produce trees that can be handled by the backend. Currently, the parsers are all hand-coded [[recursive descent parser]]s, though there is no reason why a [[parser generator]] could not be used for new front-ends in the future (version 2 of the C compiler used a [[GNU bison|bison]] based grammar).

Until recently, the tree representation of the program was not fully independent of the processor being targeted.

The meaning of a tree was somewhat different for different language front-ends, and front-ends could provide their own tree codes. This was simplified with the introduction of GENERIC and GIMPLE, two new forms of language-independent trees that were introduced with the advent of GCC 4.0. GENERIC is more complex, based on the GCC 3.x Java front-end's intermediate representation. GIMPLE is a simplified GENERIC, in which various constructs are ''lowered'' to multiple GIMPLE instructions. The [[C (Programming Language)|C]], [[C++]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] front ends produce GENERIC directly in the front end. Other front ends instead have different intermediate representations after parsing and convert these to GENERIC.

In either case, the so-called "gimplifier" then lowers this more complex form into the simpler [[Static single assignment form|SSA]]-based GIMPLE form which is the common language for a large number of new powerful language- and architecture-independent global (function scope) optimizations.

===GENERIC and GIMPLE===
''GENERIC'' is an [[intermediate representation]] language used as a "middle-end" while compiling source code into executable binaries. A subset, called ''GIMPLE'', is targeted by all the front-ends of GCC.

The middle stage of GCC does all the code analysis and optimization, working independently of both the compiled language and the target architecture, starting from the GENERIC representation and expanding it to [[Register Transfer Language]]. The GENERIC representation contains only the subset of the imperative [[computer programming|programming]] constructs optimised by the middle-end.

In transforming the source code to GIMPLE, complex [[Expression (programming)|expressions]] are split into a [[three address code]] using [[temporary variable]]s. This representation was inspired by the SIMPLE representation proposed in the McCAT [[compiler]]<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20040812030043/www-acaps.cs.mcgill.ca/info/McCAT/McCAT.html McCAT]</ref> by Laurie J. Hendren<ref>[http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/~hendren/ Laurie J. Hendren]</ref> for simplifying the analysis and [[Optimization (computer science)|optimization]] of [[Imperative programming|imperative programs]].

===Optimization===
Optimization can occur during any phase of compilation, however the bulk of optimizations are performed after the syntax and semantic analysis of the front-end and before the code generation of the back-end, thus a common, even though somewhat contradictory, name for this part of the compiler is "middle end."

The exact set of GCC optimizations varies from release to release as it develops, but includes the standard algorithms, such as [[loop optimization]], [[jump threading]], [[common subexpression elimination]], [[instruction scheduling]], and so forth. The [[Register transfer language|RTL]] optimizations are of less importance with the addition of global SSA-based optimizations on [[GIMPLE]] trees,<ref>
[http://www.redhat.com/magazine/002dec04/features/gcc/ From Source to Binary: The Inner Workings of GCC], by Diego Novillo, [[Red Hat#Red Hat Magazine|''Red Hat Magazine'']], December 2004</ref>
as RTL optimizations have a much more limited scope, and have less high-level information.

Some of these optimizations performed at this level include [[dead code elimination]], [[partial redundancy elimination]], [[global value numbering]], [[sparse conditional constant propagation]], and [[scalar replacement of aggregates]]. Array dependence based optimizations such as [[automatic vectorization]] and [[automatic parallelization]] are also performed. [[Profile-guided optimization]] is also possible as demonstrated here: http://gcc.gnu.org/install/build.html#TOC4

===Back-end===
The behavior of GCC's back end is partly specified by [[C preprocessor|preprocessor macros]] and functions specific to a target architecture, for instance to define the [[endianness]], [[word size]], and [[calling convention]]s. The front part of the back end uses these to help decide RTL generation, so although GCC's RTL is nominally processor-independent, the initial sequence of abstract instructions is already adapted to the target. At any moment, the actual RTL instructions forming the program representation have to comply with the [[Front-end and back-end|machine description]]{{clarify|date=October 2010}} of the target architecture.

Towards the end of compilation, valid RTL is further reduced to a ''strict'' form in which each instruction refers to real machine registers and real instructions from the target's [[instruction set]]. Forming strict RTL is a very complicated task, done mostly by the [[register allocation]] first but completed only by a separate "reloading" phase which must account for the vagaries of all of GCC's targets.

The final phase is somewhat anticlimactic, because the patterns to match were generally chosen during reloading, and so the assembly code is simply built by running substitutions of registers and addresses into the strings specifying the instructions.

==Compatible IDEs==
Most [[integrated development environment]]s written for [[GNU/Linux]] and some for other operating systems support GCC. These include:
* [[Anjuta]]
* [[Code::Blocks]]
* [[CodeLite]]
* [[Dev-C++]]
* [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]]
* [[geany]]
* [[KDevelop]]
* [[NetBeans]]
* [[Qt Creator]]
* [[Xcode]]

==Debugging GCC programs==
The primary tool used to debug GCC code is the [[GNU Debugger]] (gdb). Among more specialized tools are [[Valgrind]], for finding memory errors and leaks, and the graph profiler ([[gprof]]) which can determine how much time is spent in which routines, and how often they are called; this requires programs to be compiled with [[Software profiling|profiling]] options.
