==Software development==
[[Image:Android mobile phone platform early device.jpg|thumb|200px|Early Android device.]]
The early feedback on developing applications for the Android platform was mixed.<ref name="MixedFeedback">{{cite web |url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071219-google-android-plagued-by-dysfunctional-development-process.html |title=Developing apps for Google Android: it's a mixed bag |accessdate=2007-12-19 |last=Paul |first=Ryan |date=2007-12-19 |work=[[Ars Technica]]}}</ref> Issues cited include bugs, lack of documentation, inadequate QA infrastructure, and no public issue-tracking system.

The [[Android Dev Phone]] is a [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM]]-unlocked and hardware-unlocked device that is designed for advanced developers. While developers can use regular consumer devices purchased at retail to test and use their applications, some developers may choose not to use a retail device, preferring an unlocked or no-contract device.

===Software development kit===
The Android [[software development kit]] (SDK) includes a comprehensive set of development tools.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/index.html |title = Tools Overview |work = Android Developers |date = 21 July 2009}}</ref> These include a [[debugger]], [[Software library|libraries]], a handset [[emulator]] (based on [[QEMU]]), documentation, sample code, and tutorials. Currently supported development platforms include computers running [[Linux kernel|Linux]] (any modern desktop [[List of GNU/Linux distributions|Linux distribution]]), [[Mac OS X]] 10.4.9 or later, [[Windows XP]] or later. The officially supported [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) is [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] (currently 3.4, 3.5 or 3.6) using the Android Development Tools (ADT) Plugin, though developers may use any text editor to edit Java and XML files then use [[command line]] tools ([[Java Development Kit]] and [[Apache Ant]] are required) to create, build and debug Android applications as well as control attached Android devices (e.g., triggering a reboot, installing software package(s) remotely).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://jonwestfall.com/2009/08/backup-restore-android-apps-using-adb/ |title = Backup & Restore Android Apps Using ADB |first = Jon |last = Westfall |date = 25 August 2009 |work = JonWestfall.com |accessdate =2009-12-07}}</ref>

A preview release of the Android SDK was released on 12 November 2007. On 15 July 2008, the Android Developer Challenge Team accidentally sent an email to all entrants in the Android Developer Challenge announcing that a new release of the SDK was available in a "private" download area. The email was intended for winners of the first round of the Android Developer Challenge. The revelation that Google was supplying new SDK releases to some developers and not others (and keeping this arrangement private) led to widely reported frustration within the Android developer community at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/14/android_developer_unrest/ |title=Google plays Hide and Seek with Android SDK |first=Cade |last=Metz |date=14 July 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-23 |work=[[The Register]]}}</ref>

On 18 August 2008 the Android 0.9 SDK beta was released. This release provided an updated and extended API, improved development tools and an updated design for the home screen. Detailed instructions for upgrading are available to those already working with an earlier release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://code.google.com/android/intro/upgrading.html |title=Android — An Open Handset Alliance Project: Upgrading the SDK |accessdate=2008-10-24}}{{Dead link|date=September 2009}}</ref> On 23 September 2008 the Android 1.0 SDK (Release 1) was released.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://developer.android.com/sdk/older_releases.html |title=Other SDK Releases |accessdate=2009-09-02 |work=Android Developers}}</ref> According to the release notes, it included "mainly bug fixes, although some smaller features were added". It also included several API changes from the 0.9 version. Multiple versions have been released since.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://developer.android.com/sdk/older_releases.html |title=SDK Archives}}</ref>

Enhancements to Android's SDK go hand in hand with the overall Android platform development. The SDK also supports older versions of the Android platform in case developers wish to target their applications at older devices. Development tools are downloadable components, so after one has downloaded the latest version and platform, older platforms and tools can also be downloaded for compatibility testing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://developer.android.com/sdk/tools-notes.html |title=SDK Tools}}</ref>

Android applications are packaged in [[APK (file format)|.apk]] format  and stored under <code>/data/app</code> folder on the Android OS (the folder is accessible to root user only for security reasons). APK package contains .dex files<ref>{{cite web |url=http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/glossary.html |title=Android SDK Glossary}}</ref> (compiled byte code files called [[Dalvik Virtual Machine|Dalvik]] executable), resource files, etc.

===Android Market===
{{Main|Android Market}}
Android Market is the online software store developed by Google for Android devices. An application program ("app") called "Market" is preinstalled on most Android devices and allows users to browse and download apps published by third-party developers, hosted on Android Market. {{As of|2010|December}} there were about 200,000 games, applications and widgets available on the Android Market, with an estimated 2.5 billion total downloads.<ref name="200,000">{{cite web |title=Android App Stats|url=http://www.androlib.com/appstats.aspx|accessdate=31 December 2010}}</ref>

Only devices that comply with Google's compatibility requirements are allowed to preinstall Google's closed-source Android Market app and access the Market.<ref>{{Cite web

Google announced the Android Market on 28 August 2008, and it was available to users on 22 October 2008. Support for paid applications was available from 13 February 2009 for US and UK developers,<ref>{{cite web |title=Android Market Update Support |url=http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/02/android-market-update-support-for.html}}</ref> with additional support from 29 countries on 30 September 2010.<ref>{{cite web |title= More Countries More Sellers More Buyers|url=http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/09/more-countries-more-sellers-more-buyers.html}}</ref>

Alternatives to the official Android Market are available, such as SlideME and [[GetJar]].

Obstacles to development include the fact that Android does not use established Java standards, i.e. [[Java SE]] and [[Java ME|ME]]. This prevents compatibility among Java applications written for those platforms and those for the Android platform. Android only reuses the Java language syntax, but does not provide the full-class libraries and APIs bundled with Java SE or ME.<ref>{{cite web

===Native code===
Libraries written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and other languages can be compiled to [[ARM architecture|ARM]] [[native code]] and installed using the Android [[Native Development Kit]]. Native classes can be called from Java code running under the Dalvik VM using the <code>System.loadLibrary</code> call, which is part of the standard Android Java classes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://davanum.wordpress.com/2007/12/09/android-invoke-jni-based-methods-bridging-cc-and-java/ |title=Android — Invoke JNI based methods (Bridging C/C++ and Java) |last=Srinivas |first=Davanum |date=2007-12-09 |accessdate=2008-12-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/System.html |title=java.lang.System |work=Android Developers |accessdate=2009-09-03}}</ref>

===Community-based firmware===
There is a community of open-source enthusiasts that build and share Android-based firmware with a number of customizations and additional features, such as [[FLAC]] lossless audio support and the ability to store downloaded applications on the [[microSD]] card.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=448 |work=xda-developers forum |title=Dream android development |accessdate=2009-09-11}}</ref> This usually involves [[Rooting (Android OS)|rooting]] the device. Rooting allows users root access to the operating system, giving more control over their environment variables. In order to use custom firmwares the devices bootloader must be unlocked. Rooting alone does not allow the flashing of custom firmware. Modified firmwares allow users of older phones to use applications available only on newer releases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://voltmobileandtech.com/blog/ |title= Android 2.1 from Motorola Droid Ported to G1 |work=[[Volt Mobile]] |date= March 10, 2010}}</ref>

Those firmware packages are updated frequently, incorporate elements of Android functionality that haven't yet been officially released within a carrier-sanctioned firmware, and tend to have fewer limitations. [[CyanogenMod]] and [[VillainROM]] are two examples of such firmware.

Even though most of  Android OS is open source, phones come packaged with closed-source Google applications for functionality such as the application store and GPS navigation. Google has asserted that these applications can only be provided through approved distribution channels by licensed distributors. Cyanogen has complied with Google's wishes and is continuing to distribute this mod without the proprietary software.

The [[Free Software Foundation]] has said that Google could have avoided this suit by building Android on top of [[IcedTea]] whose [[GPL license]] provides some protection against patents, instead of implementing it independently under the [[Apache License]]. It has also called the suit a "clear attack against someone's freedom to use, share, modify, and redistribute software".<ref name='ogfsf'>{{cite web
