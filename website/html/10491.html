'''Digital transformation''' refers to the changes associated with the application of [[digital technology]] in all aspects of [[human society]].<ref>Erik Stolterman, Anna Croon Fors, "Information TEchnology and the Good Life", in:  "Information systems research: relevant theory and informed practice", 2004, ISBN 1402080948, [http://books.google.com/books?id=6fmSk7ykB2sC&pg=PA689&dq=%22digital+transformation%22&hl=en&ei=cVU3Td_oKYu6sQPkjpz_Ag&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCYQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=%22digital%20transformation%22&f=false p. 689]</ref> Digital transformation may be thought as the third stage of embracing digital technologies: [[digital competence]] -> [[digital literacy]] -> digital transformation.
