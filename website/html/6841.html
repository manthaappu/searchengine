'''[http://ctuning.org/cdatabase Collective Optimization Database]'''<ref>Grigori Fursin and Olivier Temam. ''Collective optimization''. Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Embedded Architectures & Compilers (HiPEAC 2009), Paphos, Cyprus, January 2009 ([http://fursin.net/wiki/index.php5?title=Research:Dissemination#FT2009 link])</ref> is an open repository to enable sharing of benchmarks, data sets and optimization cases from the community, provide web-services and plugins to analyze optimization data and predict program transformations or better hardware designs for multi-objective optimizations based on statistical and [[machine learning]] techniques provided there is enough information collected in the repository from multiple users. It is also intended to improve the quality and reproducibility of the research on code and architecture design, characterization and optimization. It includes [http://ctuning.org/cpredict online machine learning-based program optimization predictor] that can suggest profitable optimizations to improve program execution time/code size/compilation time, etc based on similarities between programs (program features). Collective Optimization Database is an important part of the [[Collective Tuning Initiative]]<ref>Grigori Fursin. Collective Tuning Initiative: automating and accelerating development and optimization of computing systems. Proceedings of the GCC Summit'09, [[Montreal|Montreal, Canada]], June 2009 ([http://unidapt.org/index.php/Dissemination#Fur2009 link])</ref><ref>''Rethinking code optimization for mobile and multicore'', [[InfoWorld]], July 2009 ([http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/rethinking-code-optimization-mobile-and-multicore-505 link])</ref> to develop [[Open source|open-source]] R&D tools for self-tuning computing systems.
