<html> <head> <title>Landmark point</title></head><body>In [[morphometrics]], '''landmark point''' or shortly '''landmark''' is a point in a [[shape]] object in which correspondences between and within the populations of the object are preserved. In other disciplines, landmarks may be known as [[vertex|vertices]], [[anchor]] points, control points, sites, profile points, 'sampling' points, nodes, markers, [[Fiduciary marker|fiducial markers]], etc.  Landmarks can be defined either manually by experts or automatically by a [[computer program]]. There are three basic types of landmarks: anatomical landmarks, mathematical landmarks or pseudo-landmarks. 

An anatomical landmark is a [[biology|biologically]]-meaningful point in an [[organism]]. Usually experts define anatomical points to ensure their correspondences within the same [[species]]. Examples of anatomical landmark in shape of a [[human skull|skull]] are the eye corner, tip of the nose, jaw, etc. Anatomical landmarks determine [[homology (biology)|homologous]] parts of an organism, which share a common ancestry.

Mathematical landmarks are points in a shape that are located according to some mathematical or geometrical property, for instance, a high [[curvature]] point or an [[extreme point]]. A computer program usually determines mathematical landmarks used for an automatic [[pattern recognition]].

Pseudo-landmarks are constructed points located between anatomical or mathematical landmarks. A typical example is an equally-spaced set of points between two anatomical landmarks to get more sample points from a shape. Pseudo-landmarks are useful during shape matching, when the matching process requires a large number of points.
