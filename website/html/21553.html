<html> <head> <title>Lexical substitution</title></head><body>'''Lexical substitution''' is the task of identifying a substitute for a [[word]] in the context of a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. For instance, given the following sentence: "After the ''match'', replace any remaining ﬂuid deﬁcit to prevent chronic dehydration throughout the tournament", a substitute of ''game'' might be given.

Lexical substitution is strictly related to [[Word Sense Disambiguation]] (WSD), in that both aim to determine the [[meaning]] of a word. However, while WSD consists of automatically assigning the appropriate [[word sense|sense]] from a fixed sense inventory, lexical substitution does not impose any constraint on which substitute to choose as the best representative for the word in context. By not prescribing the inventory, lexical substitution overcomes the issue of the granularity of sense distinctions and provides a level playing field for automatic systems that automatically acquire word senses (a task referred to as [[Word Sense Induction]]).

== Evaluation ==

In order to evaluate automatic systems on lexical substitution, a task was organized at the [http://www.dianamccarthy.co.uk/task10index.html Semeval-2007] evaluation competition held in [[Prague]] in [[2007]]. A [http://lit.csci.unt.edu/index.php/Semeval_2010 Semeval-2010] task on cross-lingual lexical substitution is being organized.
