'''Cipherspace''' or '''cypherspace''' is the [[encrypt]]ed (and often [[pseudonymity|pseudonymous]] or fully [[anonymity|anonymous]]) equivalent to [[cyberspace]]. Examples of cipherspaces include [[Freenet]], [[I2P]], [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]], and some [[Anonymity|anonymous]] mail-forwarding services.

According to its advocates, it should be impossible to know the actual identity of anyone in cipherspace. Therefore, it would be impossible to impose any censorship and to enforce any law. Because of that, they assert that concepts like [[copyright]] would be unenforceable inside cipherspace. Some doubt the possibility of complete [[anonymity]], citing that real networks, even [[virtual private networks]], need access to external resources, which tend to be trackable.<!-- wtf, just take a look at the Crypto-anarchy article -->

Critics{{Who|date=May 2009}} of the cipherspace argue that such a "digital zone" cannot be legally validated and would need to become illegal, as anonymity is both antisocial and protective for any kind of illegal acts. {{POV-statement|date=December 2010}}
