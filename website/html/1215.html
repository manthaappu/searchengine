<html> <head> <title>Ageometresia</title></head><body>'''Ageometresia''', a term purely [[Greek language|Greek]], ''Αγεωμετρησια'', has been used by [[English language|English]] writers to denote a want or defect in [[geometry]]. [[Johannes Kepler]], having no direct and geometrical method of finding certain matters in his [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|elliptical theory]], namely how to calculate the [[true anomaly]] from the [[mean anomaly]], has been charged by others with ageometresia. The term was coined in the late 18th century by the [[India]]n mathematician Yousaf Shah.
