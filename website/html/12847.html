<html> <head> <title>Explanatory gap</title></head><body>The '''explanatory gap''' is the claim that [[consciousness]] and human experiences such as [[qualia]] cannot be fully [[Explanation|explained]] only by [[Mechanics|physical mechanical processes]]. Proponents of this view claim that the [[mind]] is substantially and qualitatively different from the [[brain]] and that the existence of something [[metaphysics|metaphysically]] extra-physical is required to 'fill the gap.' The explanatory gap has vexed and intrigued [[philosopher]]s and [[artificial intelligence|AI]] researchers alike for decades and caused considerable debate.

To take a condition in which there is no gap, imagine a modern computer: as marvelous as these devices are, their behavior can be fully explained by their circuitry, and vice versa. By contrast, it is thought by some that consciousness constitutes a separate effect that demands another cause, and that this cause is either outside of the physical world ([[dualism]]) or due to as yet unknown physical phenomena (see for instance [[Quantum mind]], [[Indirect realism]]).

A noted proponent of the explanatory gap is Joseph Levine, who fleshes out the theory in his papers ''Conceivability, Identity, and the Explanatory Gap'' and ''Materialism and Qualia: The Explanatory Gap''.  Levine agrees that conceivability (as used in the [[philosophical zombie|Zombie]] and [[inverted spectrum]] arguments) is flawed as a means of establishing metaphysical realities; but he points out that even if we come to the ''metaphysical'' conclusion that qualia are physical, they still present an ''explanatory'' problem.  
<blockquote>While I think this materialist response is right in the end, it does not suffice to put the mind-body problem to rest. Even if conceivability considerations do not establish that the mind is in fact distinct from the body, or that mental properties are metaphysically irreducible to physical properties, still they do demonstrate that we lack an explanation of the mental in terms of the physical.</blockquote>

However, such an [[epistemological]] or explanatory problem might indicate an underlying metaphysical issue—the non-physicality of qualia, even if not proven by conceivability arguments is far from ruled out.
<blockquote>In the end, we are right back where we started. The explanatory gap argument doesn't demonstrate a gap in nature, but a gap in our understanding of nature. Of course a plausible explanation for there being a gap in our understanding of nature is that there is a genuine gap in nature. But so long as we have countervailing reasons for doubting the latter, we have to look elsewhere for an explanation of the former.<ref>[http://cognet.mit.edu/posters/TUCSON3/Levine.html Levine, J.
