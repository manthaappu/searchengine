The '''Smart-UPS''' is a series of enterprise-level [[uninterruptible power supply|uninterruptible power supplies]] (UPS) made by [[American Power Conversion]] (APC).<ref>[http://www.apc.com/products/family/index.cfm?id=165 APC - Smart-UPS - Product Information<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The units have a ''Smart Slot'' which accepts an optional interface card providing features ranging from network connectivity to temperature and humidity monitoring.<ref name="SmartSlot">[http://www.apc.com/products/family/index.cfm?id=98 APC - UPS Network Management Cards - Product Information<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  With the exception of the RT series, Smart-UPS units are [[Uninterruptible power supply#Line-interactive|line-interactive]] UPS systems, only running their inverters when grid power is unavailable.

All Smart-UPS units work with APC's PowerChute software which is available for a variety of OS'. Legacy Smart=UPS (Not SMX, SMT, or SURTD series) can also work with Network UPS Tools (NUT), a third party application, under Linux.<ref>[http://eu1.networkupstools.org/compat/stable.html Network UPS Tools: UPS hardware compatibility list (stable)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The software is designed to safely and automatically shut down any connected computers before the batteries are depleted.

== Models ==

There are a few different variations in the Smart-UPS lineup.

== Smart Slot ==

Most Smart-UPS units have at least one Smart Slot, with the larger (and in many cases older) models supporting two.  Installing an add-on card into the Smart Slot will provide the UPS with additional features, beyond the default serial or USB connectivity.<ref name="SmartSlot"/>  The base AP9617 card provides fairly advanced features, such as e-mail notification and [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]] monitoring, as well as allowing remote control of the UPS via a web browser or telnet (to remotely switch off the load, for example.)<ref>[http://www.apc.com/resource/include/techspec_index.cfm?base_sku=AP9617 UPS Network Management Card<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The Smart Slot is powered by the battery even when the UPS is switched off, allowing the UPS to be remotely cold-started even in a power loss situation (providing the network infrastructure is still powered up and functioning.)  The card will also continue to work for a short while after the UPS has switched off due to a low battery condition.{{Fact|date=July 2008}}
