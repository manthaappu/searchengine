[[File:Swiftkey-google-nexus-one.jpg|thumb|SwiftKey on a Google Nexus One]]'''SwiftKey''' is an [[Application software|app]] for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[smartphone]]s designed to speed up text entry by not only guessing the remaining letters in a word (as in [[predictive text]]ing) but also predicting a user's next word. It does this using language models that understand the relationship between words, and dynamically adapt over time to learn the vocabulary and writing style of the user.

SwiftKey was unveiled at the 2010 [[Mobile World Congress]] in Barcelona<ref>http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/31476/swiftkey-android-keyboard-mobile-app</ref> by TouchType Ltd., a London-based company founded in 2008 by Jonathan Reynolds and Ben Medlock, who met while studying at Cambridge University. After a six-month alpha testing phase, the app was launched as a public [[Beta testing|beta]] on 14 July 2010 to users of Google's [[Android Market]].<ref>http://www.swiftkey.net/blog/?p=15</ref> On 23 September 2010 a full version was launched.

SwiftKey's word predictions are produced by TouchType's Fluency Prediction Engine, which uses a patent-pending technique to analyze billions of words across the internet to create its language models.<ref>http://www.touchtype-online.com/products</ref> The initial analysis was performed using the supercomputer grid of the [[Large Hadron Collider]].<ref>http://www.screenwerk.com/2010/09/23/swiftkey-for-android-is-a-must-download/</ref>

TouchType claims that using the Fluency technology, its app can improve text input speed by up to 50% thanks to the accuracy of its predictions. On the [http://www.swiftkey.net/ SwiftKey website] it claims, “With SwiftKey, your next word is predicted with such incredible accuracy that a third of suggestions are right first time and usually you won’t need to press more than two letters.”<ref>http://www.swiftkey.net</ref>

SwiftKey currently supports US English, UK English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese and Swedish.<ref>http://www.swiftkey.net/what-is-swiftkey.html</ref>
