{{lowercase|title=arpwatch}}
'''arpwatch''' is a computer [[software]] tool for monitoring [[Address Resolution Protocol]] traffic on a [[computer network]]. It generates a log of observed pairing of [[IP address]]es with MAC addresses along with a timestamp when the pairing appeared on the network.

Network administrators monitor ARP activity to detect [[ARP spoofing]].

arpwatch was developed by [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], Network Research Group, as [[open-source]] software and is released under the [[BSD license]].
