<html> <head> <title>Livermore loops</title></head><body>'''Livermore loops''' (also known as the '''Livermore Fortran kernels''' or '''LFK''') is a [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] for [[parallel computing|parallel computers]]. It was created by Francis H. McMahon from scientific [[source code]] run on computers at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]. It consists of 24 [[Do while loop|do loops]], some of which can be vectorized, and some of which cannot. 

The benchmark was published in 1986 in ''Livermore fortran kernels: A computer test of numerical performance range''.<ref>F. H. McMahon. Livermore fortran kernels: A computer test of numerical performance range. Technical Report UCRL-53745, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA, December 1986. NTIS report #[http://www.ntis.gov/search/product.aspx?ABBR=DE87009360 DE87009360].</ref>

The Livermore loops were originally written in [[Fortran]], but have since been ported to many programming languages. 

Each loop carries out a different mathematical kernel<!-- The article titled [[kernel (mathematics)]] does not include this usage.  What does it mean? -->. Those kernels are: [[hydrodynamics]] fragment, incomplete [[Cholesky decomposition|Cholesky]] [[conjugate gradient]], [[inner product]], banded [[linear system]]s solution, tridiagonal linear systems solution, general [[linear recurrence]] equations, [[equation of state]] fragment, alternating direction [[implicit integration]], [[integrate predictor]]s, [[difference predictor]]s, first sum, [[difference operator|first difference]], 2-D particle in a cell, 1-D particle in a cell, casual Fortran, [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] search, implicit [[conditional computation]], 2-D explicit hydrodynamics fragment, general linear recurrence equations, discrete [[ordinates transport]], [[matrix-matrix transport]], [[Planckian distribution]], 2-D implicit hydrodynamics fragment, and location of a first array minimum.<ref>Xingfu Wu.
