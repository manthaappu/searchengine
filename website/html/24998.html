'''Mondex''' is a [[smart card]] [[electronic cash]] system which was originally developed by [[National Westminster Bank]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and subsequently sold to [[MasterCard International]]. Mondex launched in a number of markets during the 1990s, expanding from an original trial in [[Swindon]], UK to [[Hong Kong]], [[Guelph]], and [[New York]] [http://www.efc.ca/pages/media/globe.01nov98.html]. It was also trialled on several British university campuses from the late 1990s, including the [[University of Edinburgh]], [[University of Exeter]] (between 1997 and 2001), [[University of York]], [[University of Nottingham]], [[Aston University]] and [[Sheffield Hallam University]].

The [[Z notation]] was used to prove security properties about Mondex, allowing it to achieve [[ITSEC]] level E6, ITSEC's highest granted security-level classification.<ref>Susan Stepney, David Cooper, and [[Jim Woodcock]], ''[http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~susan/bib/ss/z/prg126.pdf An Electronic Purse: Specification, Refinement, and Proof]''.
