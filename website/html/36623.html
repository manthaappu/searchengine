<html> <head> <title>TATP Benchmark</title></head><body>The '''Telecommunication Application Transaction Processing Benchmark''' (TATP) is a benchmark designed to measure performance of in-memory database transaction systems.

As database and microprocessor architectures change, so must the benchmarks that are employed to measure the combined performance of these critical components. While other [[Standardization|industry standard]] throughput workloads already exist, none was designed specifically to exercise the relationship between in-memory [[Database management system|database software]] and the memory processing subsystem in which it transacts. The Telecommunication Application [[Transaction processing|Transaction Processing]] (TATP) Benchmark is a new [[open source]] workload designed specifically for [[high-throughput]] applications, well suited for in-memory database [[performance analysis]] and system comparison.

The TATP benchmark simulates a typical [[Network Switching Subsystem|Home Location Register]] (HLR) database used by a mobile carrier. The HLR is an application [[Mobile phone|mobile network]] operators use to store all relevant information about valid subscribers, including the mobile [[Telephone number|phone number]], the services to which they have subscribed, access privileges, and the current location of the subscriber's handset. Every call to and from a mobile phone involves look ups against the HLRs of both parties, making it is a perfect example of a demanding, high-throughput environment where the workloads are pertinent to all applications requiring extreme speed: telecommunications, [[financial services]], gaming, event processing and alerting, reservation systems, [[Software as a Service|software as a service]] (SaaS), and so on.

The benchmark generates a flooding load on a [[database server]]. This means that the load is generated up to the maximum throughput point that the server can sustain. The load is generated by issuing pre-defined transactions run against a specified target database. The target [[database schema]] is made to resemble a typical HLR database in a [[Cellular network|mobile phone network]]. The algorithm of what is known as the TATP Benchmark was originally published in a Master's Thesis <ref>Toni Strandell: "Open Source Database Systems: Systems study, Performance and Scalability". Master's Thesis, [[University of Helsinki]], Department of [[Computer science|Computer Science]], May 2003, 54 p, at: http://ethesis.helsinki.fi/julkaisut/mat/tieto/pg/strandell/.

The benchmark was modeled after a real test program that was used by a telecom equipment manufacturer to evaluate the applicability of various [[relational database]] systems to service control programming in mobile networks. Another derivative of the original test is the Network Database Benchmark <ref>"Network Database Benchmark", an open-source project, at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/ndbb/</ref>. TATP executes seven pre-defined transactions that insert, update, delete and query the data in the database. The TATP results show Mean Qualified Throughput (MQTh) of the target database system, and the [[response time]] distributions per transaction types for all seven types of transactions.
