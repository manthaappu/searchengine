In [[metadata]], a '''match report''' is a report that compares two distinct [[data dictionary|data dictionaries]] and creates a list of the [[data element]]s that have been identified as [[Semantic equivalence|semantically equivalent]].

== Use of match reports ==

Match reports are critical for systems that wish to automatically exchange data such as intelligent software agents.  If one computer system is requesting a report from a remote system that uses a distinct data dictionary and all of the data elements on the report manifest are included in the '''match report''' the report request can be executed.

Match reports are useful if data dictionaries use a metadata tagging system such as the [[UDEF]].
