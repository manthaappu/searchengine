The '''Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps''' ({{lang-de|Alpenvereinseinteilung der Ostalpen}}) or '''AVE''' is a division of the Eastern Alps  into 75 mountain groups and is commonly used in [[mountaineering]]. There is a basic division into the ''[[Northern Limestone Alps]], [[Central Eastern Alps]], [[Western Limestone Alps]],'' and ''[[Southern Limestone Alps]].'' These four main groups are further divided into 75 sub-groups.

== History ==
The Alpine Club's classification of the Eastern Alps was compiled by Franz Graßler in 1982 and published in 1984 in the Alpine Club yearbook, ''Berg '84''. It is based on the ''Moriggl Classification (ME)'' by [[Josef Moriggl]], the General Secretary of the [[German and Austrian Alpine Club]] (DuÖAV), which was first published in 1924 in the ''Ratgeber für Alpenwanderer'' ("Guide for Alpine Walkers", 2nd edition, 1928). This division of the Eastern Alps established for the German-speaking world (less Switzerland) was compiled by the [[German Alpine Club|German]], [[Austrian Alpine Club|Austrian]] and [[South Tyrol Alpine Club]]s. 

The classification is used ''inter alia'' for the basic numbering of [[Alpine Club maps]].

== Classification system ==
The Eastern Alps are divided into four areas: the Northern Limestone Alps, Central Eastern Alps, Southern Limestone Alps and Western Limestone Alps. The Northern Limestone and Central Eastern Alps are the largest with 27 groups each. The Southern Limestone Alps have 15 groups and there are six in the Western Limestone Alps.

The classification is based principally on [[orographic]] considerations and takes account of the regional usage in terms of the names of the mountain groups. The Graßler amendments of 1984 address a number of geological problems and have dropped many of Morrigl's groups, making more precise sub-divisions for them in other areas. These changes are evident from the missing serial numbers and sub-division letters. New areas were added to the Western Limestone Alps. This area is one not covered by the alpine clubs and is actually a continuation of the Southern and Central Alps.

Unlike the previous scheme, the [[Salzburg Slate Alps]] were assigned to the Northern Limestone Alps because they are part of the [[greywacke zone]] that forms the [[bedrock]] of the Alps. The [[Ortler Alps]] and [[Sobretta Gavia Group]] were grouped into the Southern Limestone Alps, geologically speaking, they are north of the [[Periadriatic Seam]] are counted as Austro-alpine.

== Geographical characteristics == 
The Eastern Alps extend across six countries: [[Germany]], [[Italy]] [[Liechtenstein]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Slovenia]]. With 57 mountain groups, Austria has the largest share. It is followed by Italy with 23 and Switzerland with ten. There are seven mountain ranges in Germany and four in Slovenia. Liechtenstein shares one group.

The only [[four-thousander]] and the highest mountain in the Eastern Alps is the [[Piz Bernina]] at {{Höhe|4046}}. Thus the [[Bernina]] is the highest of all the groups in the Eastern Alps. Next are the [[Ortler Alps]], whose highest peak, the [[Ortler]] ({{Höhe|3905}}), is the highest mountain in South Tyrol. The third highest range is the [[Glockner Group]] with the highest mountain in Austria: the [[Grossglockner]] ({{Höhe|3798}}). Another 22 groups reach a height of 3,000 metres. The only group in the Northern Limestone Alps with a three-thousander is the [[Lech Valley Alps]], whose highest summit is the [[Parseierspitze]] ({{Höhe|3036}}). 39 groups are over 2000 metres high. Seven of the groups exceed 1000 metres and only one does not reach that mark: the [[Vienna Woods]]. Its highest mountain, the [[Schöpfl]] is just  {{Höhe|893}} high.
