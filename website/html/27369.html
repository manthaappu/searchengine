The '''OpenFabrics Alliance''', a non-profit organization,  evangelizes and facilitates the adoption of [[remote direct memory access]] (RDMA) [[switched fabric]] technologies for server and storage connectivity. These high-speed data-transport technologies are used worldwide in corporate data centers, high-performance computing facilities, research institutes, and industries such as bioinformatics, electronic design, engineering, entertainment & media, financial services, and oil & gas.

Technology-wise, the OpenFabrics Alliance aims to develop a unified, open-source software stack that supports the two major RDMA fabric technologies -- [[InfiniBand]] and [[iWARP]] (also known as [[RDMA]] over [[Ethernet]]).  The software stack includes two packages, one that runs on [[Linux]] and one that runs on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].  The OpenFabrics Alliance is working with the two largest Linux distributors -- [[Novell]] and [[Red Hat]] -- as well as [[Microsoft]] to ensure that the OpenFabrics software stack is compatible with their respective operating systems.

Members of the OpenFabrics Alliance include leading chip-manufacturers, database providers, national laboratories, network equipment manufacturers, server & storage vendors, software companies, workstation manufacturers, and more.

==History ==
Founded in June 2004 as the OpenIB Alliance, the organization originally focused on developing a standardized, Linux-based InfiniBand software stack.  Initial funding for the Alliance was provided by the U.S. Department of Energy.

In 2005 the OpenIB Alliance committed itself to supporting Microsoft Windows, a move that would make the Alliance's software stack truly cross-platform.  And in 2006, the organization again expanded its charter to include support for iWARP, which is a transport technology that competes with InfiniBand.  It was at this time that the OpenIB Alliance changed its name to the OpenFabrics Alliance.

The OpenIB Alliance released the first version of the OpenFabrics software stack, known as OFED (OpenFabrics Enterprise Distribution) in 2005.  It supported InfiniBand and ran on Linux.  Subsequent releases have added support for iWARP and Windows.  OFED-1.5.2 is the latest stable release of the OpenFabrics software stack.

The OpenFabrics Alliance provides architectures, software repositories, interoperability tests, bug databases, workshops, and BSD- and GPL-licensed code to facilitate development.

The OFED stack includes [[Device driver | software driver]]s, core kernel-code, middleware, and user-level interfaces.  It offers a range of standard protocols, including IPoIB (IP over [[InfiniBand]]<ref>

==Interoperability testing ==
On June 25, 2007, the OpenFabrics Alliance announced the OFA-UNH-IOL Logo Program in partnership with the [[University of New Hampshire InterOperability Laboratory]].  The program enables manufacturers of InfiniBand and iWARP products to test and certify that their products support the OpenFabrics software stack, and test the compatibility of their software and hardware with other products that have earned the OFA-UNH-IOL logo.

The OpenFabrics Alliance sponsors multiple interoperability events at the [[University of New Hampshire]] each year, providing vendors with ongoing opportunities to earn the OFA-UNH-IOL logo for their products. The test scenarios are available to the public, as are the test results for all products that earn the logo.  During interoperability events, all participating companies have the opportunity to observe all tests run on all products.

== Current members==
Corporate members of the OpenFabrics Alliance include [[Advanced Micro Devices]], [[Appro]], [[Chelsio Communications]], [[Cisco Systems]], [[Data Direct Networks]], [[Flextronics]], [[Hewlett Packard]], [[IBM]], [[Intel]], [[LSI Corporation]], [[Mellanox Technologies]], [[NetEffect]], [[Neterion]], [[NetApp]], [[NetXen]], [[Oracle Corporation]], [[QLogic]], [[Silicon Graphics]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[System Fabric Works]], [[Voltaire]], and [[Xsigo Systems]].
