<html> <head> <title>System testing</title></head><body>'''System testing''' of software or hardware is testing conducted on a complete, integrated system to evaluate the system's compliance with its specified [[requirements]].  System testing falls within the scope of [[black box testing]], and as such, should require no knowledge of the inner design of the code or logic. <ref name="ieee">''IEEE Standard Computer Dictionary: A Compilation of IEEE Standard Computer Glossaries''; ''[[IEEE]]''; New York, NY.; 1990.</ref>

As a rule, system testing takes, as its input, all of the "integrated" software components that have successfully passed [[integration testing]] and also the software system itself integrated with any applicable hardware system(s). The purpose of integration testing is to detect any inconsistencies between the software units that are integrated together (called ''assemblages'') or between any of the ''assemblages'' and the hardware.  System testing is a more limited type of testing; it seeks to detect defects both within the "inter-assemblages" and also within the system as a whole.

==Testing the whole system==
System testing is performed on the entire system in the context of a [[Functional requirements|Functional Requirement]] Specification(s) (FRS) and/or a [[Requirements analysis|System Requirement]] Specification (SRS).  System testing tests not only the design, but also the behaviour and even the believed expectations of the customer.  It is also intended to test up to and beyond the bounds defined in the software/hardware requirements specification(s).{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

== Types of tests to include in system testing ==
The following examples are different types of testing that should be considered during System testing:

* [[GUI software testing]]
* [[Usability testing]]
* [[Performance testing]]
* [[Compatibility testing]]
* [[Error handling testing]]
* [[Load testing]]
* [[Volume testing]]
* [[Stress testing]]
* [[Security testing]]
* [[Scalability testing]]
* [[Sanity test]]ing
* [[Smoke_test#Smoke_testing_in_software_development|Smoke testing]]
* [[Exploratory testing]]
* [[Ad hoc testing]]
* [[Regression testing]]
* [[Reliability testing]]
* [[Installation testing]]
* [[Maintenance testing]]
* [[Recovery testing]] and  failover testing.
* [[Accessibility]] testing, including compliance with:
** [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]
** [[Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973]]
** [[Web Accessibility Initiative]] (WAI) of the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C)

Although different testing organizations may prescribe different tests as part of System testing, this list serves as a general framework or foundation to begin with.
