'''''MASSIVE''''' (Multiple Agent Simulation System in Virtual Environment) is a high-end [[computer animation]] and [[artificial intelligence]] software package used for generating crowd-related visual effects for film and television. 

==Overview==
''Massive'' is a software package developed by [[Stephen Regelous]] for the visual effects industry. Its flagship feature is the ability to quickly and easily create thousands - or millions - of agents that all act as individuals. Through the use of [[fuzzy logic]], the software enables every agent to respond individually to its surroundings, including other agents. These reactions affect the agent's behaviour, changing how they act by controlling pre-recorded animation clips, for example by blending between such clips, to create characters that move, act, and react realistically. These pre-recorded animation clips can come from motion-capture sessions, or can be hand-animated in other 3D animation software packages.

In addition to the [[artificial intelligence]] abilities of Massive, there are numerous other features, including cloth simulation, [[rigid body dynamics]] and graphics processing unit ([[GPU]]) based hardware rendering. Massive Software has also created several pre-built agents ready to perform certain tasks, such as stadium crowd agents, rioting 'mayhem' agents and simple agents who walk around and talk to each other.

==History==
''Massive'' was originally developed in Wellington, New Zealand. [[Peter Jackson]] required software that allowed armies of hundreds of thousands of soldiers to fight, a problem that had not been solved in filmmaking before. Regelous created ''Massive'' to allow [[Weta Digital]] to create many of the award-winning visual effects, particularly the battle sequences, for the ''[[The Lord of the Rings#The Lord of the Rings on film|Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy of films. Since then, it has evolved into a complete product and has been licensed by many other visual effects houses.

==In production==
''Massive'' has been used in many productions, both commercials and feature-length films, small-scale and large. 

Some significant examples include:
*''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''
*''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|The Lord of the Rings]]''
*''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]''
*''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' (Jackson 2005)
*''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of our Fathers]]'' (besides battle and crowd scenes, even shots of seacraft crossing the Pacific were created with Massive)
*''[[Carlton Draught: Big Ad]]''
*''[[Mountain (advert)|Mountain]]'', a television commercial for the [[PlayStation 2]] console
*''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]
*''[[Category 7: The End of the World]]''
*''[[Blades of Glory]]''
*''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]''
*''[[Happy Feet]]''
*''[[300 (film)|300]]''
*''[[The Ant Bully (film)|The Ant Bully]]'' (the first film to use computer animated characters as Massive agents rather than motion capture.  Also first to use facial animation within Massive)
*''[[Doctor Who]]'' ("[[Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)|Partners in Crime]]" is the first example of Massive used in television.)
*''[[Changeling (film)|Changeling]]''
*''[[Speed Racer (film)|Speed Racer]]'' (Car A.I. and crowds)
*''[[Wall-E]]''
*[[Up (2009 film)]]
