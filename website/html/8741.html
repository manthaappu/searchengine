<html> <head> <title>Customer Service Excellence</title></head><body>The '''Customer Service Excellence''', (previously the "'''Charter Mark'''") is an accreditation for organisations and an independent validation of achievement. 

==History==
The Charter Mark was an award demonstrating the achievement of ''national standard for excellence in customer service'' in [[United Kingdom]] [[public sector]] organisations. Introduced in 1991, it was replaced in 2008 by Customer Service Excellence standard, with the last issued Charter Marks expiring in 2011. The Charter Mark was one of the consequences of a political initiative, the [[Citizen's Charter]], by [[Prime Minister]] [[John Major]] in 1991, to improve the face of government.

In 2005, the system was reviewed, and it was recommended the scheme be replaced. Accordingly, the Customer Service Excellence standard was launched, and a phased transfer was initiated. Applications for Charter Marks were officially closed on 30 June 2008, with the official final validity date becoming 30 June 2011<ref>[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/chartermark/new_standard.aspx Cabinet Office FAQ page] Accessed 5 September 2008</ref>.

==Recipients==
The scope of public sector organisations includes departments of local councils, voluntary organisations having more than 10% public funding, and also private subcontractors on public contracts. It also includes public transport operators and the gas, electricity and water utilities. A number of [[Park and Ride bus services in the United Kingdom|Park and Ride bus schemes]] gained Charter Marks, displaying the mark on their [[bus]]es<ref>[http://stevemaskell.fotopic.net/p49117085.html Fotopic image of an Ipswich Park and Ride bus prominently displaying the Charter Mark]</ref>.

==Assessment==
Assessment for the award, made by one of four certification bodies, is on achievement of goals to:

# Set standards and perform well 
# Actively engage with customers, partners and staff 
# Be fair and accessible to everyone and promote choice 
# Continuously develop and improve 
# Use resources effectively and imaginatively 
# Contribute to improving opportunities and quality of life in the communities served

On receipt, an award was valid for three years, after which the organisation must re-apply.
