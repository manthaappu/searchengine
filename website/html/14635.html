<html> <head> <title>GOSUB</title></head><body>'''GOSUB''' is a command in many versions of the [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] computer [[programming language]]. GOSUB statements branch to simple kinds of [[Subroutine|subroutines]] without (sometimes with) parameters or local [[variable (computer science)|variables]], the [[Return statement|RETURN]] command resuming [[program flow]] from the point at which GOSUB was invoked. The GOSUB command is convenient for performing the same function several times in a BASIC program without duplicating the code.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qbasicnews.com/qboho/qckadvr.gosubr.shtml|title=GOSUB...RETURN Statement Details.|date=1988|accessdate=2008-07-04|author=|publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref> 

Not all BASIC implementations support GOSUB.  For example, in [[FreeBASIC]] it is considered as deprecated in favor of [[Subroutine|SUB]]/FUNCTION, and is disabled by default.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freebasic.net/wiki/wikka.php?wakka=KeyPgGosub|title=GOSUB|date=2008-05-08|accessdate=2008-07-04|author=|publisher=|quote="Gosub support is disabled by default in the -lang fblite unless the Option Gosub statement is used."}}</ref>
