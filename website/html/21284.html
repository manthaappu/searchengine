<html> <head> <title>Layer (object-oriented design)</title></head><body>In [[object-oriented design]], a '''layer''' is a group of [[class (computer science)|class]]es that have the same set of link-time [[Module (programming)|module]] [[dependency (computer science)|dependencies]] to other modules. In other words, a layer is a group of reusable [[software componentry|component]]s that are [[reusability|reusable]] in similar circumstances. In programming languages, the layer distinction is often expressed as "import" dependencies between software modules.

Layers are often arranged in a [[tree (data structure)|tree]]-form [[hierarchy]], with dependency relationships as links between the layers. Dependency relationships between layers are often either [[inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]], [[Object_composition|composition]] or [[Object_composition#Aggregation|aggregation]] relationships, but other kinds of dependencies can also be used.

Layers is an [[Architectural pattern (computer science)|architectural pattern]] described in many books, for example Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture<ref>http://hillside.net/patterns/books/Siemens/abstracts.html Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture - A System of Patterns</ref>
