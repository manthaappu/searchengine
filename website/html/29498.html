<html> <head> <title>Pointcheval-Stern signature algorithm</title></head><body>In [[cryptography]], the '''Pointcheval-Stern signature algorithm''' is a [[digital signature]] scheme based on the closely related [[ElGamal signature scheme]]. It changes the ElGamal scheme slightly to produce an algorithm which has been proven secure in a strong sense against [[adaptive chosen-message attack]]s. That is, if the [[discrete log problem|discrete logarithm problem]] is intractable in a strong sense.<ref>D Pointcheval and J Stern. Security proofs for signature schemes. in U Maurer, ed.

David Pointcheval and [[Jacques Stern]] developed the ''[[forking lemma]]'' technique in constructing their proof for this algorithm. It has been used in other security investigations of various cryptographic algorithms.
