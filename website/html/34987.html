'''Software engineering''' ('''SE''') is a [[profession]] dedicated to designing, implementing, and modifying [[computer software|software]] so that it is of higher quality, more affordable, maintainable, and faster to build. It is a "systematic approach to the analysis, design, assessment, implementation, test, maintenance and reengineering of software, that is, the application of engineering to software."

''[[Software development]]'', a much used and more generic term, does not necessarily subsume the engineering paradigm. Although it is questionable what impact it has had on actual software development over the last more than 40 years,<ref>[http://alistair.cockburn.us/The+end+of+software+engineering+and+the+start+of+economic-cooperative+gaming The end of software engineering and the start of economic-cooperative gaming]</ref><ref>[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=15417224 35 years on: to what extent has software engineering design achieved its goals?]</ref> the field's future looks bright according to [[Money Magazine]] and [http://salary.com/ Salary.com], which rated "[[software engineer]]" as the best job in the United States in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web

==History==
{{Main|History of software engineering}}

When the first modern digital [[computer]]s appeared in the early 1940s,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leondes|title= intelligent systems: technology and applications|year=2002| publisher=CRC Press| isbn =9780849311215 | quote = }}</ref> the instructions to make them operate were wired into the machine.  Practitioners quickly realized that this design was not flexible and came up with the "stored program architecture" or [[von Neumann architecture]].  Thus the first division between "hardware" and "software" began with [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] being used to deal with the complexity of computing.

[[Programming languages]] started to appear in the 1950s and this was also another major step in abstraction.  Major languages such as [[Fortran]], [[ALGOL]], and [[COBOL]] were released in the late 1950s to deal with scientific, algorithmic, and business problems respectively.  [[Edsger Dijkstra|E.W. Dijkstra]] wrote his seminal paper, "Go To Statement Considered Harmful",<ref>{{Cite journal
  | last = Dijkstra   | first = E. W.   | authorlink = Edsger_Dijkstra
  | title = Go To Statement Considered Harmful   | journal = [[Communications of the ACM]]   | volume = 11   | issue = 3   | pages = 147–148

}}</ref> to help programmers deal with the ever increasing complexity of [[software systems]].  A software system for managing the hardware called an [[operating system]] was also introduced, most notably by [[Unix]] in 1969. In 1967, the [[Simula]] language introduced the [[object-oriented programming]] paradigm.

These advances in [[software]] were met with more advances in [[computer hardware]].  In the mid 1970s, the [[microcomputer]] was introduced, making it economical for hobbyists to obtain a [[computer]] and write [[software]] for it.  This in turn led to the now famous [[Personal Computer]] (PC) and [[Microsoft Windows]].  The [[Software Development Process|Software Development Life Cycle]] or SDLC was also starting to appear as a consensus for centralized construction of software in the mid 1980s. The late 1970s and early 1980s saw the introduction of several new Simula-inspired object-oriented programming languages, including [[Smalltalk]], [[Objective-C]], and [[C++]].

[[Open-source]] software started to appear in the early 90s in the form of [[Linux]] and other software introducing the "bazaar" or decentralized style of constructing software.<ref>[[Eric S. Raymond|Raymond, Eric S.]] ''[[The Cathedral and the Bazaar]]''. ed 3.0. 2000.</ref>  Then the [[World Wide Web]] and the popularization of the [[Internet]] hit in the mid 90s, changing the engineering of software once again.  [[Distributed systems]] gained sway as a way to design systems, and the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programming language was introduced with its own [[virtual machine]] as another step in [[abstraction]].  [[Programmers]] collaborated and wrote the [[Agile Manifesto]], which favored more lightweight processes to create cheaper and more timely software.

The current definition of ''software engineering'' is still being debated by practitioners today as they struggle to come up with ways to produce software that is "cheaper, better, faster". [[Spend management|Cost reduction]] has been a primary focus of the IT industry since the 1990s.  [[Total cost of ownership]] represents the costs of more than just acquisition. It includes things like productivity impediments, upkeep efforts, and resources needed to support infrastructure.

==Profession==
{{Main|Software engineer}}

Legal requirements for the licensing or certification of professional software engineers vary around the world.  In the UK, the [[British Computer Society]] licenses software engineers and members of the society can also become [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|Chartered Engineers]] (CEng), while in some areas of Canada, such as Alberta, Ontario,<ref>{{cite conference | first = N.S.W. | last = Williams | title = Professional Engineers Ontario's approach to licensing software engineering practitioners | booktitle = Software Engineering Education and Training, 2001 Proceedings. 14th Conference on | pages = 77–78 | publisher = [[IEEE]]| date = 19–21 February 2001 | location = Charlotte, NC | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> and Quebec, software engineers can hold the Professional Engineer (P.Eng)designation and/or the Information Systems Professional (I.S.P.) designation; however, there is no legal requirement to have these qualifications. In [[Israel]] a person with an appropriate engineering degree  has the right to be listed in Israel's Registry of Engineers and Architects<ref>[http://www.tamas.gov.il/NR/exeres/DACD5881-70D5-463A-BDF2-AA363197FB2F.htm]</ref>, and Israeli engineering law<ref>[http://www.moit.gov.il/NR/exeres/AACCF3CC-C47C-4D2F-BF49-FDB4185C6E55.htm ]</ref> says that a person calling themselves an engineer without the proper license / registration could be sentenced to up to 6 months in jail.

The [[IEEE Computer Society]] and the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]], the two main professional organizations of software engineering, publish guides to the profession of software engineering. The IEEE's ''Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge - 2004 Version'', or [[SWEBOK]], defines the field and describes the knowledge the IEEE expects a practicing [[software engineer]] to have.  The IEEE also promulgates a "Software Engineering Code of Ethics".<ref>[http://www.computer.org/portal/cms_docs_computer/computer/content/code-of-ethics.pdf ''Software Engineering Code of Ethics'']</ref>

===Employment===
In 2004, the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics|U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics]] counted 760,840 [[software engineer]]s holding jobs in the [[United States|U.S.]]; in the same time period there were some 1.4 million practitioners employed in the U.S. in all other engineering disciplines combined.<ref>Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, [ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/news.release/ocwage.txt ''USDL 05-2145: Occupational Employment and Wages, November 2004''], Table 1.</ref> Due to its relative newness as a field of study, formal education in software engineering is often taught as part of a computer science curriculum, and many software engineers hold computer science degrees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=12|title=Software Engineering|accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref>

Many [[software engineer]]s work as employees or contractors. Software engineers work with businesses, government agencies (civilian or military), and non-profit organizations. Some software engineers work for themselves as [[freelancer]]s. Some organizations have specialists to perform each of the tasks in the [[software development process]]. Other organizations require software engineers to do many or all of them. In large projects, people may specialize in only one role. In small projects, people may fill several or all roles at the same time. Specializations include: in industry ([[Requirements analysis|analysts]], [[Software architecture|architects]], [[Software developer|developers]], [[Software testing|testers]], [[technical support]], [[middleware analyst]]s, [[Project management|managers]]) and in academia ([[educator]]s, [[researcher]]s).

Most software engineers and programmers work 40 hours a week, but about 15 percent of software engineers and 11 percent of programmers worked more than 50 hours a week in 2008. Injuries in these occupations are rare. However, like other workers who spend long periods in front of a computer terminal typing at a keyboard, engineers and programmers are susceptible to eyestrain, back discomfort, and hand and wrist problems such as carpal tunnel syndrome.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos303.htm#training|title=Computer Software Engineers and Computer Programmers|accessdate=2009-12-17}}</ref>

===Certification===
The [[Software Engineering Institute]] offers certifications on specific topics like Security, [[Process improvement]] and [[Software architecture]].<ref>[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/certification/ SEI certification page]</ref> [[Apple certification programs|Apple]], [[Information Technology Architect Certification|IBM]], [[Microsoft Certified Professional|Microsoft]] and other companies also sponsor their own certification examinations.  Many [[Information technology|IT]] [[Professional certification (Computer technology)|certification]] programs are oriented toward specific technologies, and managed by the vendors of these technologies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1180991|title=The Top 10 Problems with IT Certification in 2008|last=Wyrostek|first=Warren |date=March 14, 2008|work=InformIT|accessdate=2009-03-03}}</ref> These certification programs are tailored to the institutions that would employ people who use these technologies.

Broader certification of general software engineering skills is available through various professional societies. {{As of|2006}}, the [[IEEE]] had certified over 575 software professionals as a [[Certified Software Development Professional]] (CSDP).<ref name="ieee2006">{{Cite web|author=IEEE Computer Society|url=http://www.ifip.org/minutes/GA2006/Tab18b-US-IEEE.pdf|format=PDF|title=2006 IEEE computer society report to the IFIP General Assembly|accessdate=2007-04-10}}</ref> In 2008 they added an entry-level certification known as the Certified Software Development Associate (CSDA).<ref>{{Cite web|author=IEEE|url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/certification/csda|title=CSDA|accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref> In the U.K. the [[British Computer Society]] has developed a legally recognized professional certification called ''Chartered IT Professional (CITP)'', available to fully qualified Members (''MBCS''). In Canada the [[Canadian Information Processing Society]] has developed a legally recognized professional certification called ''Information Systems Professional (ISP)''.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Canadian Information Processing Society|url=http://www.cips.ca/standards/isp|title=I.S.P. Designation|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref> The [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] had a professional certification program in the early 1980s,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} which was discontinued due to lack of interest. The ACM examined the possibility of professional certification of software engineers in the late 1990s, but eventually decided that such certification was inappropriate for the professional industrial practice of software engineering.<ref name="acm2000">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.wm.edu/~coppit/csci690-spring2004/papers/selep_main.pdf|title=A Summary of the ACM Position on Software Engineering as a Licensed Engineering Profession|last=ACM|date=July 17, 2000|publisher=Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)|accessdate=2009-03-03|quote=At its meeting in May 2000, the Council further concluded that the framework of a licensed professional engineer, originally developed for civil engineers, does not match the professional industrial practice of software engineering. Such licensing practices would give false assurances of competence even if the body of knowledge were mature; and would preclude many of the most qualified software engineers from becoming licensed.}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

===Impact of globalization===
The initial impact of outsourcing, and the relatively lower cost of international human resources in developing third world countries led to the dot com bubble burst of the 1990s. This had a negative impact on many aspects of the software engineering profession. For example, some students in the [[developed world]] avoid education related to software engineering because of the fear of [[offshore outsourcing]] (importing software products or services from other countries) and of being displaced by [[Foreign Worker Visa|foreign visa workers]].<ref>[http://www.computerworld.com/printthis/2006/0,4814,111202,00.html As outsourcing gathers steam, computer science interest wanes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Although statistics do not currently show a threat to software engineering itself; a related career, [[computer programming]] does appear to have been affected.<ref>[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos110.htm#outlook Computer Programmers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/03/13/HNslowsoftdev_1.html Software developer growth slows in North America | InfoWorld | News | 2007-03-13 | By Robert Mullins, IDG News Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Nevertheless, the ability to smartly leverage offshore and near-shore resources in an efficient fashion has improved the overall operational capability of many organizations.<ref>[http://www.cognizant.com/html/content/news/GartnerMQ_Cognizant.pdf Gartner Magic Quadrant]</ref> When Europeans are leaving work, Asians are just arriving to work. When Asians are leaving work, Europeans are arriving to work. This provides a continuous ability to have human oversight on business-critical processes 24 hours per day, without paying overtime compensation or disrupting key human resource sleep patterns.

==Education==
A knowledge of [[programming]] is a pre-requisite to becoming a software engineer. In 2004 the [[IEEE Computer Society]] produced the [[SWEBOK]], which has been published as ISO/IEC Technical Report 19759:2004, describing the body of knowledge that they believe should be mastered  by a graduate software engineer with four years of experience.<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last = Abran |editor1-first=  Alain | title = Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge | publisher = IEEE Computer Society | location = Los Alamitos |year= 2005 | isbn = 0769523307 | url= http://www.computer.org/portal/web/swebok |accessdate=2010-09-13|origyear= 2004|chapter= Chapter 1: Introduction to the Guide|chapterurl= http://www.computer.org/portal/web/swebok/html/ch1 |quote= The total volume of cited literature is intended to be suitable for mastery through the completion of an undergraduate education plus four years of experience.}}</ref>
Many software engineers enter the profession by obtaining a university degree or training at a vocational school. One standard international curriculum for undergraduate software engineering degrees was defined by the [[CCSE]], and updated in 2004.<ref>[http://sites.computer.org/ccse/ SE2004 Software Engineering Curriculum]</ref> A number of universities have Software Engineering degree programs; {{As of|2010|lc=on}}, there were 244 Campus programs, 70 Online programs, 230 Masters-level programs, 41 Doctorate-level programs, and 69 Certificate-level programs in the United States.<ref>[http://www.gradschools.com/search-programs/software-engineering] Degree programs in Software Engineering</ref>

In addition to university education, many companies sponsor internships for students wishing to pursue careers in information technology. These internships can introduce the student to interesting real-world tasks that typical software engineers encounter every day. Similar experience can be gained through [[military service]] in software engineering.

==Sub-disciplines==
Software engineering can be divided into ten subdisciplines. They are:<ref name="BoDu04"/>
* [[Software requirements]]: The elicitation, analysis, specification, and validation of [[requirements]] for [[software]].
* [[Software design]]: The design of software is usually done with [[Computer-Aided Software Engineering]] (CASE) tools and use standards for the format, such as the Unified Modeling Language ([[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]).
* [[Software development]]: The construction of software through the use of programming languages.
* [[Software testing]]
* [[Software maintenance]]: Software systems often have problems and need enhancements for a long time after they are first completed.  This subfield deals with those problems.
* [[Software configuration management]]: Since software systems are very complex, their configuration (such as versioning and source control) have to be managed in a standardized and structured method.
* Software engineering management: The management of software systems borrows heavily from [[project management]], but there are nuances encountered in software not seen in other management disciplines.
* [[Software development process]]: The process of building software is hotly debated among practitioners; some of the better-known processes are the Waterfall Model, the Spiral Model, Iterative and Incremental Development, and Agile Development.
* Software engineering tools, see [[Computer Aided Software Engineering]]
* [[Software quality]]

==Related disciplines==
Software engineering is a direct subfield of computer science and has some relations with [[management science]]. It is also considered a part of overall [[systems engineering]].  

===Systems engineering===
[[Systems engineering|Systems engineers]] deal primarily with the overall system design, specifically dealing more with physical aspects which include hardware design. Those who choose to specialize in computer hardware engineering may have some training in software engineering.

===Computer Software Engineers===
Computer Software Engineers are usually systems level (software engineering, information systems) computer science or software level computer engineering graduates. This term also includes general computer science graduates with a few years of practical on the job experience involving software engineering.
