<html> <head> <title>IF-MAP</title></head><body>The Interface for Metadata Access Points (IF-MAP) is an open standard [[client/server]] protocol developed by the [[Trusted Computing Group]] (TCG) as one of the core protocols of the [[Trusted Network Connect]] (TNC) open architecture. 

IF-MAP provides a common interface between the Metadata Access Point (MAP), a database server acting as a clearinghouse for information about security events and objects, and other elements of the TNC architecture.[http://www.computer.org/portal/web/computingnow/archive/news065]

The IF-MAP protocol defines a publish/subscribe/search mechanism with a set of identifiers and data types.

==History==
The IF-MAP protocol was first published by the TCG on April 28, 2008. Originally, the IF-MAP specification was developed to support data sharing across various vendor’s devices and applications for network security.[http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/042808-interop-tcg.html] The standard has also been adopted for additional use cases of data-sharing including physical security.[http://www.securitymagazine.com/Articles/Online_Exclusives/BNP_GUID_9-5-2006_A_10000000000000886666]

Version 2.0 of the IF-MAP spec was published on September 13, 2010. The 2.0 version separated the base protocol from the metadata definitions that standardize how different types of information are represented. The goal in separating the base protocol from the metadata definitions within the standard was to allow the standard to be adopted across other technologies, such [[cloud computing]],[http://opencloudconsortium.org/2010/02/22/if-map-based-intercloud-testbed] [[Industrial Control Systems]],[http://www.automation.com/content/securing-scada-and-control-networks] [[smart grid]], to leverage their existing data models within the MAP framework.[https://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/091310-trusted-computing-group-cloud-security.html]

==IF-MAP Community==
IF-MAP.com is the meeting place for IF-MAP Community. Launched in December 2010, [http://www.if-map.com IF-MAP.COM] is expected to serve as a platform for innovators collaborating and contributing to the IF-MAP world.
