'''E-mail injection''' is a [[security vulnerability]] that can occur in [[Internet]] [[application software|applications]] that are used to send [[e-mail]] messages. It is the email equivalent of [[HTTP Header Injection]]. Like [[SQL injection]] attacks, this vulnerability is one of a general class of vulnerabilities that occur when one [[programming language]] is embedded within another.

When a form is added to a [[World Wide Web|Web]] page that submits data to a Web application, a malicious user may exploit the [[MIME]] format to append additional information to the message being sent, such as a new list of recipients or a completely different message body. Because the MIME format uses a [[carriage return]] to delimit the information in a message, and only the raw message determines its eventual destination, adding carriage returns to submitted form data can allow a simple guestbook to be used to send thousands of messages at once. A malicious [[spam (electronic)|spammer]] could use this tactic to send large numbers of messages anonymously.

More information on this topic, including examples and ways to avoid the vulnerability, can be found at the [http://www.damonkohler.com/2008/12/email-injection.html SecurePHP Wiki].
However, this vulnerability is not limited to [[PHP]]; it can potentially affect ''any'' application that sends e-mail messages based on input from arbitrary users.
