In [[geometric graph theory]], a '''unit disk graph''' is the [[intersection graph]] of a family of [[unit circle]]s in the [[Euclidean plane]]. That is, we form a vertex for each circle, and connect two vertices by an edge whenever the corresponding circles cross each other.

There are several possible definitions of the unit disk graph, equivalent to each other up to a choice of scale factor:
* An intersection graph of equal-radius circles, or of equal-radius disks
* A graph formed from a collection of equal-radius circles, in which two circles are connected by an edge if one circle contains the center of the other circle
* A graph formed from a collection of points in the Euclidean plane, in which two points are connected if their distance is below a fixed threshold

Every [[induced subgraph]] of a unit disk graph is also a unit disk graph. An example of a graph that is not a unit disk graph is the [[Star (graph theory)|star]] K<sub>1,7</sub> with one central node connected to seven leaves: if each of seven unit disks touches a common unit disk, some two of the seven disks must touch each other.

Beginning with the work of {{harvtxt|Huson|Sen|1995}}, unit disk graphs have been used in [[computer science]] to model the topology of [[Mobile ad-hoc network|ad-hoc wireless communication networks]]. In this application, nodes are connected through a direct wireless connection without a [[base station]]. It is assumed that all nodes are homogeneous and equipped with [[omnidirectional antenna]]s. Node locations are modeled as Euclidean points, and the area within which a signal from one node can be received by another node is modeled as a circle. If all nodes have transmitters of equal power, these circles are all equal. Random geometric graphs, formed as unit disk graphs with randomly generated disk centers, have also been used as a model of percolation and various other phenomena.<ref>See, e.g., {{harvtxt|Dall|Christensen|2002}}.</ref>

It is [[NP-hard]] to determine whether a graph, given without geometry, can be represented as a unit disk graph.<ref>{{harvtxt|Breu|Kirkpatrick|1998}}.</ref> However, many important and difficult graph optimization problems such as [[maximum independent set]], [[graph coloring]], and minimum [[dominating set]] can be [[Approximation algorithm|approximated]] efficiently by using the geometric structure of these graphs,<ref>{{harvtxt|Marathe|Breu|Hunt, III|Ravi|1994}}; {{harvtxt|Matsui|2000}}.</ref> and the [[maximum clique problem]] can be solved exactly for these graphs in polynomial time, given a disk representation.<ref>{{harvtxt|Clark|Colbourn|Johnson|1990}}.</ref>

When a given vertex set forms a subset of a [[Hexagonal lattice|triangular lattice]], a necessary and sufficient condition for the [[perfect graph|perfectness]] of a unit graph is known.<ref>{{harvtxt|Miyamoto|Matsui|2005}}.</ref> For the perfect graphs, a number of NP-complete optimization problems ([[graph coloring problem]], [[maximum clique problem]], and [[maximum independent set problem]]) are polynomially solvable.
