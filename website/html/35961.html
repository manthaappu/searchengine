'''''Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs''''' ('''''SICP''''') is a textbook published in 1984<ref>[http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/ Official SICP site]</ref> about general [[computer programming]] concepts from [[MIT Press]] written by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] professors [[Harold Abelson]] and [[Gerald Jay Sussman]], with [[Julie Sussman]].  It was used as the textbook of [[MIT]]'s old introductory programming class [http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-001Spring-2005/CourseHome/index.htm '''6.001'''] (this class has been replaced by [http://course.mit.edu/6.01 6.01], which uses [[Python (programming language)|Python]].<ref>"I talked to Professor Sussman on the phone ... He said that he'd actually been trying to have 6.001 replaced for the last ten years (and I read somewhere that Professor Abelson was behind the move too). Understanding the principles is not essential for an introduction to the subject matter anymore. He sees 6.001 as obsolete." From [http://www.mitadmissions.org/topics/learning/coursework/the_end_of_an_era_1.shtml MIT Admissions Blog, 'The End of an Era'], retrieved 2008-08-05</ref>), and at [http://www.schemers.com/schools.html other schools]. The second edition (ISBN 0-262-51087-1) appeared in 1996.  Widely considered a classic text in computer science,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grokcode.com/11/the-top-9-in-a-hackers-bookshelf/ |title=The Top 9 1/2 Books in a Hacker's Bookshelf |accessdate = 2010-10-23}}</ref> it is also known as the '''Wizard Book''' (there is a wizard on the cover), and less commonly, the '''Purple Book'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/ |title=Official SICP site |accessdate = 2010-09-07}}</ref>.

Using a dialect of the [[Lisp programming language]] known as [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], the book explains core computer science concepts, including [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]], [[recursion]], [[interpreter (computing)|interpreters]] and [[metalinguistic abstraction]], and teaches [[modular programming]].

The program also introduces a practical implementation of the [[register machine]] concept, defining and developing an [[Assembly language#Assember|assembler]] for such a construct, which is used as a [[virtual machine]] for the implementation of interpreters and compilers in the book, and as a testbed for illustrating the implementation and effect of modifications to the evaluation mechanism.  Working Scheme systems based on the design described in this book are quite common student projects.

==Characters==
The book uses some fictional characters repeatedly:
* Ben Bitdiddle. He considerably predates this class, having been created by Steve Ward for use in problem sets for its predecessor, 6.031, in the 1970s. He has since appeared in a large number of other locations, including other classes at MIT and other institutions.
* Eva Lu Ator – the evaluator
* Louis Reasoner – the loose reasoner
* Alyssa P. Hacker – a lisp hacker

SICP has been influential in computer science education, and a number of later books have been inspired by its style.

* ''[[Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics]] (SICM)'', another book by Gerald Jay Sussman that uses Scheme
* ''[[How to Design Programs]] (HtDP)'', which intends to be a more accessible book for introductory Computer Science, and to address perceived incongruities in SICP (see references below)
* ''[[Essentials of Programming Languages]] (EoPL)'' is a book for Programming Languages courses
* ''[[Lisp in Small Pieces]] (LiSP)'', a book full of Scheme interpreters and compilers
* ''[[Simply Scheme]]'' was written as a "prequel" to SICP
* ''[[Concrete Abstractions]]'' has more examples and assumes less math than SICP and has "plenty of echos [sic]" of SICP (out of print but freely available online[http://gustavus.edu/+max/concrete-abstractions.html])
