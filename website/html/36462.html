'''System 1''', also known as Mac System Software, was the original Macintosh operating system, and a part of the [[Classic Mac OS]] family, and ran on the 68K processor architecture. It was released on January 24, 1984 and replaced by System 1.1 on May 5, 1984. (Note: Eventually, the "Systems" were renamed "Mac OS") System 1 was originally released with the first [[Macintosh]], later named the [[Macintosh 128k]]. System 1 introduced many features that would appear for years to come, some even still existing in Mac OS X. These features included a total lack of a command line, the Finder, and the menu bar. In addition to this, it popularized the [[graphical user interface]] and [[desktop metaphor]].
