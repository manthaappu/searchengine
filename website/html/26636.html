[[Image:Normal map example.png|thumb|Normal mapping used to re-detail simplified meshes.]]
In [[3D computer graphics]], '''normal mapping''', or "Dot3 bump mapping", is a technique used for faking the lighting of bumps and dents. It is used to add details without using more [[polygonal modeling|polygon]]s. A normal map is usually an [[RGB]] image that corresponds to the X, Y, and Z coordinates of a [[surface normal]] from a more detailed version of the object. A common use of this technique is to greatly enhance the appearance and details of a [[low poly|low polygon model]] by generating a normal map from a high polygon model.

== History ==
The idea of taking geometric details from a high polygon model was introduced in "Fitting Smooth Surfaces to Dense Polygon Meshes"
by Krishnamurthy and Levoy, Proc. [[SIGGRAPH]] 1996, where this approach was used for creating [[displacement mapping|displacement maps]] over [[nurbs]]. In 1998, two papers were presented with the idea of transferring details with normal maps from high to low polygon meshes: "Appearance Preserving Simplification", by Cohen et al. SIGGRAPH 1998, and  "A general method for preserving attribute values on simplified meshes" by Cignoni et al. IEEE Visualization '98. 
The former presented a particular constrained simplification algorithm that during the simplification process tracks how the lost details should be mapped over the simplified mesh. The latter presented a simpler approach that decouples the high and low polygonal mesh and allows the recreation of the lost details in a way that is not dependent on how the low model was created. This latter approach (with some minor variations) is still used by most currently available tools.

==How it works==
To calculate the [[Lambertian]] (diffuse) lighting of a surface, the unit [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] from the shading point to the light source is [[dot product|dotted]] with the unit vector normal to that surface, and the result is the intensity of the light on that surface. Imagine a polygonal model of a sphere - you can only approximate the shape of the surface. By using a 3-channel bitmap textured across the model, more detailed normal vector information can be encoded. Each channel in the bitmap corresponds to a spatial dimension (X, Y and Z). These spatial dimensions are relative to a constant coordinate system for object-space normal maps, or to a smoothly varying coordinate system (based on the derivatives of position with respect to texture coordinates) in the case of tangent-space normal maps. This adds much more detail to the surface of a model, especially in conjunction with advanced lighting techniques.

==Calculating Tangent Space==
In order to find the perturbation in the normal the tangent space must be correctly calculated.
Most often the normal is perturbed in a fragment shader after applying the model and view matrices.
Typically the geometry provides a normal and tangent.  The tangent is part of the tangent plane
and can be transformed simply with the [[Affine_transformation | linear]] part of the matrix
(the upper 3x3).  However, the normal needs to be transformed by the [[Surface_normal#Transforming_normals|inverse transpose]]. Most applications will want bitangent to
match the transformed geometry (and associated uv's).  So instead of enforcing the bitanget to
be normal to the tangent, it is generally preferable to transform the bitangent just like the
tangent.  Let ''t'' be tangent, ''n'' be normal, ''b'' be bitangent, ''M<sub>3x3</sub>'' be linear part of model matrix, and ''V<sub>3x3</sub>'' be the linear part of the view matrix.
:<math>t' = t \times M_{3x3} \times V_{3x3}</math>
:<math>n' = n \times (M_{3x3} \times V_{3x3})^{-1T} = n \times M_{3x3}^{-1T} \times V_{3x3}^{-1T}</math>
:<math>b' = b \times M_{3x3} \times V_{3x3}</math>

==Normal mapping in video games==
Interactive normal map rendering was originally only possible on [[PixelFlow]], a [[parallel rendering]] machine built at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. It was later possible to perform normal mapping on high-end [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] workstations using multi-pass rendering and [[framebuffer]] operations or on low end PC hardware with some tricks using paletted textures.  However, with the advent of [[shader]]s in personal computers and game consoles, normal mapping became widely used in [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[Commerce|commercial]] video games starting in late 2003, and followed by open source games in later years. Normal mapping's popularity for real-time rendering is due to its good quality to processing requirements ratio versus other methods of producing similar effects.  Much of this efficiency is made possible by distance-indexed detail scaling, a technique which selectively decreases the detail of the normal map of a given texture (cf. [[mipmapping]]), meaning that more distant surfaces require less complex lighting simulation.

Basic normal mapping can be implemented in any hardware that supports palettized textures. The first game console to have specialized normal mapping hardware was the Sega [[Dreamcast]]. However, Microsoft's [[Xbox]] was the first console to widely use the effect in retail games. Out of the [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|sixth generation consoles]], only the [[PlayStation 2]]'s [[PlayStation 2#Technical specifications|GPU]] lacks built-in normal mapping support. Games for the [[Xbox 360]] and the [[PlayStation 3]] rely heavily on normal mapping and are beginning to implement [[parallax mapping]]. The [[Nintendo 3DS]] has been shown to support normal mapping, as demonstrated by [[Resident Evil: Revelations]] and [[Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater#Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater 3D|Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater]].
