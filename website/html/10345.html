In [[computer graphics]], a hard- or software implementation of a '''[[Digital Differential Analyzer]] (DDA)''' is used for linear interpolation of variables over an interval between start and end point. DDAs are used for rasterization of lines, triangles and polygons. In its simplest implementation the DDA algorithm interpolates values in interval [(x<sub>start</sub>, y<sub>start</sub>), (x<sub>end</sub>, y<sub>end</sub>)] by computing for each x<sub>i</sub> the equations x<sub>i</sub> =  x<sub>i−1</sub>+1, y<sub>i</sub> =  y<sub>i−1</sub> + Δy/Δx, where Δx = x<sub>end</sub> − x<sub>start</sub> and  Δy = y<sub>end</sub> − y<sub>start</sub>.

== Performance ==
The DDA method can be implemented using [[floating-point]] or [[integer]] arithmetic. The native floating-point implementation requires one addition and one rounding operation per interpolated value (e.g. coordinate x, y, depth, color component etc.) and output result. This process is only efficient when an [[Floating-point unit|FPU]] with fast add and rounding operation is available.

The [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] integer operation requires two additions per output cycle, and in case of fractional part overflow, one additional increment and subtraction. The probability of fractional part overflows is proportional to the ratio m of the interpolated start/end values.

DDAs are well-suited for hardware implementation and can be pipelined for maximized throughput.
