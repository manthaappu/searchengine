<html> <head> <title>SIMPLE algorithm</title></head><body>In [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD), '''SIMPLE algorithm''' is a widely used [[numerical algorithm|numerical procedure]] to solve the [[Navier-Stokes equation]]s. ''SIMPLE'' is an acronym for Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations.

The SIMPLE algorithm was developed by Prof. [[Brian Spalding]] and his student [[Suhas Patankar|S V Patankar]] at [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]], London in the early 1970s. Since then it has been extensively used by many researchers to solve different kinds of fluid flow and heat transfer problems.<ref>[https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME608/webpage/project-reports/SIMPLE-DrivenCavity.pdf SIMPLE solver for driven cavity flow problem]</ref><ref>[http://www.opensourcecfd.com/conference2008/2007/media/proceedings/OFIC-07_ManganiLuca.pdf?phpMyAdmin=f7f6d5b5be922e9db00b8b978b532798 Heat transfer applications in turbomachinery]</ref>  

Many popular books on computational fluid dynamics discuss the SIMPLE algorithm in detail.<ref>{{cite book |last=Patankar |first=S.

A modified variant is the '''SIMPLER Algorithm''' (SIMPLE Revised), that was [[1979]] introduced by [[Suhas Patankar|Patankar]].
