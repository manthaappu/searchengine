'''Moni Naor''' ({{lang-he|מוני נאור}}) is an [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[computer scientist]], currently a professor at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]]. Naor received his Ph.D. in [[1989]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. His adviser was [[Manuel Blum]]. 

He works in various fields of [[computer science]], mainly the foundations of [[cryptography]]. He is especially notable for creating [[Malleability (cryptography)|non-malleable cryptography]], [[Visual cryptography]] (with [[Adi Shamir]]), and suggesting various methods for verifying that users of a computer system are human (leading to the notion of [[CAPTCHA]]).

His brother [[Seffi Naor]] is also a computer scientist. 

He was named an [[International Association for Cryptologic Research|IACR]] fellow in 2008.
