A '''robotic arm''' is a [[robot]]ic [[manipulator]], usually programmable, with similar functions to a human [[arm]]. The links of such a manipulator are connected by joints allowing either rotational motion (such as in an [[articulated robot]]) or translational (linear) displacement.<ref>[http://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/otm_iv/otm_iv_4.html OSHA Technical Manual]</ref><ref>[http://www.ssl.umd.edu/projects/rangertsx/data/spacerobotics-UNDSPST470.pdf Paper on Space Robotics, pg 9]</ref> The links of the manipulator can be considered to form a [[kinematic chain]]. The business end of the kinematic chain of the manipulator is called the [[end effector]] and it is analogous to the human [[hand]]. The end effector can be designed to perform any desired task such as welding, gripping, spinning etc., depending on the application. For example robot arms in [[automotive]] [[assembly line]]s perform a variety of tasks such as [[welding]] and parts rotation and placement during assembly. 

In [[Outer space|space]] the [[Space Shuttle]] Remote Manipulator System also known as [[Canadarm]] or [[SSRMS]] and its successor [[Canadarm2]] are examples of multi [[Degrees of freedom (engineering)|degree of freedom]] robotic arms that have been used to perform a variety of tasks such as inspections of the Space Shuttle using a specially deployed boom with cameras and [[sensor]]s attached at the end effector and [[satellite]] deployment and retrieval manoeuvres from the [[cargo bay]] of the Space Shuttle.<ref name="IEEE">[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/9317/29659/01347668.pdf IEEE Xplore:The Canadarm grasps this boom and can position it in the necessary positions to permit a complete inspection ]</ref> 

The robot arms can be [[autonomous robot|autonomous]] or controlled manually and can be used to perform a variety of tasks with great accuracy.  

The robotic arm can be fixed or mobile (i.e. wheeled) and can be designed for [[Industrial robots|industrial]] or home applications.

==Types==
[[Image:Industrial robots-transparent.gif|right|thumb|250px|6 Axis Articulated Robots from [[KUKA]]]]
'''*[[Cartesian robot]] / Gantry robot''':Used for pick and place work, application of sealant, assembly operations, handling machine tools and arc welding. It's a robot whose arm has three prismatic joints, whose axes are coincident with a Cartesian coordinator. 
'''
*Cylindrical robot''':Used for assembly operations, handling at machine tools, spot welding, and handling at diecasting machines. It's a robot whose axes form a cylindrical coordinate system. 

'''*[[Spherical robot]] / Polar robot (such as the [[Unimate]])''':Used for handling at machine tools, spot welding, diecasting, fettling machines, gas welding and arc welding. It's a robot whose axes form a polar coordinate system. 
'''
*[[SCARA robot]]''':Used for pick and place work, application of sealant, assembly operations and handling machine tools. It's a robot which has two parallel rotary joints to provide compliance in a plane. 

'''*[[Articulated robot]]''':Used for assembly operations, diecasting, fettling machines, gas welding, arc welding and spray painting. It's a robot whose arm has at least three rotary joints. 

'''*[[Parallel robot]]''':One use is a mobile platform handling cockpit flight simulators. It's a robot whose arms have concurrent prismatic or rotary joints.
