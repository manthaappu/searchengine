'''Jena''' is an [[open source]] [[Semantic Web]] framework for [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. It provides an [[API]] to extract data from and write to [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] graphs. The graphs are represented as an abstract "model". A model can be sourced with data from files, databases, URLs or a combination of these. A Model can also be queried through [[SPARQL]] and updated through [[SPARUL]].

Jena is similar to [[Sesame (framework)|Sesame]]; though, unlike Sesame, Jena provides support for OWL ([[Web Ontology Language]]). The framework has various internal reasoners and the [[Pellet reasoner]] (an open source Java OWL-DL reasoner) can be set up to work in Jena.

Jena supports serialisation of RDF graphs to:
*a [[relational database]]
*[[RDF/XML]]
*[[Turtle (syntax)|Turtle]]
*[[Notation 3]]

==Joseki==
[[Joseki (RDF server)|Joseki]] is an [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] server.
The goal of Joseki is to provide an HTTP interface to RDF data. It fully supports [[SPARQL]] for querying and updating. The project is a sub-project of Jena and is developed as a [[Java EE]] application. Joseki can also be run stand-alone server as it ships preconfigured with the [[Jetty (web server)|Jetty]] web server.
