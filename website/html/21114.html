A '''landline''' (or '''land line''') was originally an overland [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] wire,<ref>{{cite web| title=History of the Atlantic Cable & Undersea Communications |url=http://atlantic-cable.com/CableCos/NorthernLine/index.htm}}</ref> as opposed to an [[Submarine communications cable|undersea cable]]. Currently, '''landline''' (or '''land phone''' or '''main line''' or '''fixed-line''') refers to a [[telephone line]] which travels through a solid medium, either metal [[wire]] or [[optical fibre]], as distinguished from a [[mobile phone|mobile cellular line]], where transmission is via [[radio waves]]. Landlines usually have a lower price for calling time, and the user hardware costs less than mobile phones, but they are less convenient. A land line is also used to increase the security of communications, as it cannot be intercepted by a receiver without [[wiretapping|physical access]] to the line. (This does not, however, mean that a [[telephone company]] will not send the call over the air on some point in the journey.)
In 2003, the [[CIA World Factbook|CIA]] reported approximately 1.263 billion main [[telephone]] lines worldwide.  [[China]] had more than any other country, at 350 million, and the [[United States]] was second with 268 million - this compared with 219.4 million cellular telephones, a number which is expected to exceed the landline number within a few years.

In 2008 there were 1,270,000,000 fixed line subscribers in the world.<ref>{{cite book|title=Measuring the Information Society: The ICT Development Index|publisher=International Telecommunication Union|date=2009|pages=108|isbn=9261128319|url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/publications/idi/2009/material/IDI2009_w5.pdf}}</ref> The number of households having a mobile phone but not a landline (Cellphone Only or CPO) reached 18% in the United States and the number of landlines used in developed countries began to decline.<ref>[http://www.examiner.com/x-7097-Philadelphia-Gadgets-Examiner~y2009m4d18-Getting-rid-of-the-landline-telephone Getting rid of the landline telephone] Philadelphia examiner</ref>

== Fixed phone ==
A '''fixed phone''' line (a line that is not a [[mobile phone]] line) can be hard-[[wire]]d or [[wireless]].

Fixed wireless refers to the operation of wireless devices or systems in fixed locations such as homes and offices. Fixed wireless devices usually derive their electrical power from the utility [[mains electricity]], unlike mobile wireless or portable wireless which tend to be [[battery-power]]ed. Although mobile and portable systems can be used in fixed locations, efficiency and bandwidth are compromised compared with fixed systems. Mobile or portable, battery-powered wireless systems can serve as emergency backups for fixed systems in case of a power blackout or natural disaster.

The technology for wireless connection to the [[Internet]] is as old as the Net itself. [[Amateur radio]] operators began "patching" into telephone lines with fixed, mobile, and portable two-way voice radios in the middle of the 20th Century. A [[wireless modem]] works something like an amateur-radio "[[Military Affiliate Radio System|phone patch]]," except faster. High-end fixed wireless employs [[broadband modem]]s that bypass the telephone system and offer Internet access hundreds of times faster than twisted-pair hard-wired connections or cell-phone modems.

== Dedicated lines ==
The term '''landline''' is also used to describe a connection between two or more points that consists of a dedicated physical cable, as opposed to an always-available private link that is actually implemented as a circuit in a wider switched system (usually the [[public switched telephone network]]). So-called [[leased line]]s are invariably of the latter type; the implications of a landline in this context are security and [[survivability]]. For example, a military headquarters might be linked to front-line units "by landline" to ensure that communication remains possible even if the conventional telephone network is damaged or destroyed. This was the case in the [[Second World War]], in which the [[RAF Fighter Command]] had its radar stations and aerodromes connected to headquarters by land lines; its more mobile opponent, the German [[Luftwaffe]], used radio - and so its commands were intercepted and deciphered by the British (see [[Ultra]]).

Some telecommunications experts have at times seen the more popular use as a misuse of the word. As a consequence, in professional contexts the terms "fixed line" or "wireline" are more commonly used than "landline." "Landline Check" refers to calling a landline and checking to see if there is connectivity, to make sure emergency landline phones are working.
