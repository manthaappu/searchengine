<html> <head> <title>Bandit project</title></head><body>The '''Bandit''' project is an [[open source]] collection of loosely-coupled components to provide consistent identity services.

It implements open standard protocols and specifications such that identity services can be constructed, accessed, and integrated from multiple identity sources. Portions of the identity services are an implementation of the [[Higgins trust framework]].   The Bandit system supports many authentication methods and provides user-centric credential management. On this base of a common identity model, Bandit is building additional services needed for Role Based Access Control [[RBAC]] and for the emission of records to verify compliance with higher level policies.
