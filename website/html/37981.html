A '''touchscreen remote control''' is a handheld [[remote control]] device which uses a [[touchscreen]] [[user interface]] to replace most of the hard, built-in physical buttons used in normal remote control devices. Such devices may either be specially designed for the purpose of remote control of other devices (usually for controlling media playback and navigation) or may have be allowing of user-installed remote control application options.

Touchscreen remote controls, which control other devices through various methods ([[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]], [[infrared]] or [[Wireless USB]]), incorporate less crowded, more dynamic and fluid user interfaces for virtual buttons; in the case of controlling another, larger visual device (such as a television), most touchscreen RC interfaces also incorporate in-remote [[virtual keyboard]]s for simultaneous text input onto the screen.
