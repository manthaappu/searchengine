<html> <head> <title>Stieltjes matrix</title></head><body>In [[mathematics]], particularly [[matrix theory]], a '''Stieltjes matrix''' is a [[real numbers|real]]  [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]] [[positive definite]] [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] with [[nonpositive]] [[off-diagonal]] entries.  A Stieltjes matrix is necessarily an [[M-matrix]].  Every ''nÃ—n'' Stieltjes matrix is invertible to a nonsingular symmetric matrix with [[nonnegative]] entries, though the converse of this statement is not true in general for ''n'' > 2.

From the above definition, a Stieltjes matrix is a symmetric invertible [[Z-matrix_(mathematics)|Z-matrix]] whose eigenvalues have positive real parts. As it is a Z-matrix, its off-diagonal entries are less than or equal to zero.
