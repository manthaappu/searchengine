'''James Clark''', (February 23, 1964) is the author of [[Groff (software)|groff]] and [[Expat (XML)|expat]] and has done much work with [[open-source software]] and [[XML]].  Born in [[London]], and educated at [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]] and [[Merton College, Oxford]], Clark has lived in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]] since 1995, and is now a permanent resident. He owns a company called Thai Open Source Software Center, which provides him a legal framework for his open-source activities.

James Clark served as Technical Lead of the Working Group that developed XML, notably contributing the self-closing, empty-element tag syntax  (for example: "<tagname/>"), and the name "XML".<ref>{{cite web | title = The History of XML | url = 
http://www.totalxml.net/history-xml.php}}</ref>

James Clark's contributions to XML are cited in dozens of books on the subject.<ref>{{cite web | title = Books listed on Amazon mentioning James Clark | url = http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=james+clark+xml&x=0&y=0}}</ref>

For the [[GNU project]], he wrote [[Groff (software)|groff]] and an XML editing mode for [[GNU Emacs]].

James is the author or co-author of a number of influential specifications and implementations, including:
* [[DSSSL]] - An SGML transformation and styling language.
* [[Expat (XML)]] - An open-source XML parser.
* [[XSLT]] - XSL Transformations, a part of the XSL family.
* [[TREX]] - An XML Schema language.
* [[RELAX NG]] - An XML Schema language with both an explicit XML form and a compact form, with an implementation, Jing.

He is listed as part of the Working Group that developed the Java Streaming API for XML ( StAX ) JSR 173 at the JCP.

From November 2004 until late 2006, he worked for Thailand's Software Industry Promotion Agency (SIPA), to promote [[open source]] technologies and [[open standards]] in the country. This work included  pushing the Thai [[software localization|localization]] of [[OpenOffice.org]] office suite and [[Mozilla Firefox]] Web browser, along with other open source software packages.

==Projects at SIPA==
* Chantra : An [[Open-source software|open source]] Thai project with programs for Windows. Like the OpenCD project.
