'''TRIPOS''' ('''TRI'''vial '''P'''ortable '''O'''perating '''S'''ystem) is a [[computer]] [[operating system]]. Development started in [[1976]] at the [[University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory|Computer Laboratory]] of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] and it was headed by Dr. [[Martin Richards (computer scientist)|Martin Richards]]. The first version appeared in January 1978 and it originally ran on a [[PDP-11]]. Later it was ported to the [[Computer Automation LSI4]] and the [[Data General Nova]]. Work on a [[Motorola 68000]] version started in 1981 at the [[University of Bath]]. [[MetaComCo]] acquired the rights to the 68000 version and continued development until TRIPOS was chosen by [[Commodore Amiga]] in March 1985 to form part of an operating system for their new computer.

==Influences on the Amiga computer==
In July 1985, the [[Amiga]] was introduced, incorporating TRIPOS in the [[AmigaDOS]] module of [[AmigaOS]]. AmigaDOS included a [[command line interface]] and the [[Amiga Old File System|Amiga File System]]. The entire AmigaDOS module was originally written in [[BCPL]] (an ancestor of the [[C programming language]]), the same language used to write TRIPOS.

==Features==
TRIPOS provided features such as [[pre-emptive multi-tasking]] (using strict-priority scheduling), a hierarchical file system and multiple [[command line interpreter]]s.

The most important TRIPOS concepts have been the non-memory-management approach (meaning no checks are performed to stop programs from using unallocated memory) and message passing by means of passing pointers instead of copying message contents. Those two concepts together allowed for sending and receiving over 1250 packets per second on a 10 MHz [[Motorola]] [[68010]] CPU.

Most of TRIPOS was implemented in [[BCPL]]. The [[kernel (computers)|kernel]] and [[device driver]]s were implemented in [[assembly language]].

TRIPOS was ported to a number of machines, including the [[Data General Nova|Data General Nova 2]], the [[Computer Automation LSI4]], plus [[Motorola 68000]] and [[Intel 8086]]- based hardware. It included support for the [[Cambridge Ring]] [[local area network]]. More recently, Martin Richards produced a port of TRIPOS to run under [[Linux]], using BCPL Cintcode.

TRIPOS is still actively maintained by [[Open G I]] Ltd. (formerly Misys Financial Systems) in Worcestershire, UK. Many British insurance brokers have a Motorola 68000 based (and latterly Linux/Intel based) TRIPOS system serving either [[Qume]] terminals or Qume [[terminal emulator]]s over a [[Telnet]] style [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] connection - the systems are used to run Open G I's BROOMS Application suite. Open G I have added a number of features to support the modern office such as the ability to print to Windows/[[SAMBA]] or [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] [[JetDirect]] printers, and [[XML]] Integration services.

==Cintpos==
'''Cintpos''' is an experimental interpretive version of TRIPOS which runs on the Cintcode BCPL [[virtual machine]], also developed by Martin Richards.
