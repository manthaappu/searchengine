'''Hunch''' is a website, designed as a [[collective intelligence]] decision-making system that uses [[decision tree]]s to make decisions based on users' interest. Hunch is building the 'taste graph' for the internet, mapping every person to every entity — and their affinity for that entity. The system asks users a series of questions about a topic to help weigh the options. Upon completion of the questions, the user is presented with results, where he or she can agree or disagree with the results to help "train" the system. Users can also add pros and cons about results. Hunch was launched publicly on June 15, 2009, and since then has been fully open and available to the public.<ref>http://vator.tv/news/show/2009-06-15-hunch-launches-today</ref> The website reached a total worldwide site traffic of 1.2 million unique visitors in February 2010.

== History ==

Hunch started a private preview period in December 2008, but opened the preview to the public in March 2009 as an invitation-only [[software testing|private beta]].  Users had to request an invitation at Hunch.com, which took a few days to receive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hunch.com/forums/ideas/wikipedia-article-about-hunch-could-use-some/ | title=Official Forum Clarification on Hunch's History | accessdate=2010-03-01}}</ref>
