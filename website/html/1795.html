The theory describes dynamical phenomena which occur on objects modelled by fractals.
It studies questions such as "how does heat diffuse in a fractal?" and "How does a fractal vibrate?"

In the smooth case the operator that occurs most often in the equations modelling these questions is the [[Laplacian]], so the starting point for the theory of analysis on fractals is to define a Laplacian on fractals. This turns out not to be a full [[differential operator]] in the usual sense but has many of the desired properties. There are a number of approaches to defining the Laplacian: probabilistic, analytical or measure theoretic.
