'''''{{lang|la|Magia Naturalis}}''''' (in English, '''''Natural Magic''''') is a work of [[popular science]] by [[Giambattista della Porta]] first published in [[Naples]] in 1558.  Its popularity  ensured it was republished in five [[Latin]] editions within ten years, with translations into [[Italian language|Italian]] (1560), [[French language|French]], (1565) and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (1566) printed.

''Natural Magic'' was revised and considerably expanded throughout the author's lifetime; its twenty books (Naples 1589) include observations upon [[geology]], [[optics]], [[medicine]]s, [[poison]]s, [[cooking]], [[metallurgy]] and [[magnetism]] as well as [[cosmetics]], [[perfume]]s, [[gunpowder]] and [[invisible writing]].

''Natural Magic'' is a fine example of pre-[[Francis Bacon|Baconian]] science. Its sources include the ancient world learning of [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Theophrastus]] as well as numerous scientific observations made by Della Porta. ''Natural Magic'' was translated  and published in the [[English language]] in 1658.
