A '''pancake''' is a thin, flat cake prepared from a [[batter (cooking)|batter]] and cooked on a hot [[griddle]] or [[frying pan]]. Most pancakes are [[quick bread]]s; some use a [[yeast (baking)|yeast]]-raised or fermented batter. Most pancakes are cooked one side on a griddle and flipped partway through to cook the other side. Depending on the region, pancakes may be served at any time, with a variety of toppings or fillings including jam, chocolate chips, fruit, syrup or meat.

Archaeological evidence suggests that varieties of pancakes are probably the earliest and most widespread types of cereal food eaten in prehistoric societies whereby dry carbohydrate-rich seed flours mixed with the available protein-rich liquids, usually milk and eggs, were baked on hot stones or in shallow earthenware pots over an open fire to form a nutritious and highly palatable foodstuff.<ref>Jones, M. Feast; Why Humans share food, [[Oxford University Press]], 2007</ref>

In the medieval and modern Christian period, especially in Britain, pancakes were made to use up store items prior to the period of [[Lent]] [[fasting]] beginning on [[Shrovetide]].

The pancake's shape and structure varies worldwide. There are numerous variations of them throughout Europe. In [[Germany]], pancakes can be made from potatoes.  A [[crêpe]] is a French variety of thin pancake cooked on one or both sides in a special crepe pan to achieve a network of fine bubbles often compared to [[lace]] - a savory variety made from [[buckwheat]] is usually known as a [[galette]]. 

==Etymology==
The [[Middle English]] word ''Pancake'' appears in an [[England|English]] culinary manuscript from 1430.<ref>[http://www.pancakeology.com/node/5 Pancake History] Pancakeology</ref><ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=p&p=2 Online Etymology Dictionary]</ref>

==Regional varieties==
===Northern Europe===

[[France|French]] '''[[crêpes]]''', popular in [[France]], [[Canada]], and [[Brazil]] (where they may be called pancakes or crêpes) are made from flour, milk, and eggs. They are thin and are usually served with a large amount of sweet or savory filling, ranging from fruit or ice cream, to [[seafood]] (in Brazil, most usually ground meat).

A [[Galette|'''Breton galette''']] is a large thin pancake made of [[buckwheat]] flour, mostly associated with the regions of [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]] in France. It is often cooked on one side only.

[[Germany|German]] pancakes are called '''Pfannkuchen''' (''Pfanne'' and ''Kuchen'' meaning 'pan' and 'cake'). In some regions (Berlin, Brandenburg, Saxonia) pancakes are called ''Eierkuchen'', as the term ''Pfannkuchen'' refers to [[Berliner (pastry)|Berliners]] there. In [[Swabia]] sliced pancake strips (''Flädle'') are often served in soup.

In the [[Netherlands]] and [[Flanders]], pancakes are called [[pannenkoek]]en and eaten at [[dinner]]time. Pancake [[restaurant]]s are popular family restaurants and serve many varieties of sweet, savory, and stuffed pancakes. Pannekoeken are slightly thicker than crêpes and usually quite large (12" or more) in diameter. The batter is egg-based and the fillings can include sliced apples, cheese, ham, bacon, candied ginger and many other ingredients — alone or in combination — as well as "stroop" (molasses), a thick sugar syrup. One classical Dutch filling is a combination of bacon and stroop.

[[Poffertjes]] are another Dutch pancake-type dish. They resemble American pancakes somewhat, but are sweeter, and much smaller. The require a specially dimpled pan, preferably in copper.  The technique used also varies; they are flipped repeatedly before a side is completely done, in order to attain a softer interior.

Scandinavian pancakes are similar to the French [[crêpe]]s. They are served with jam as a main dish with a variety of savory fillings. Traditional [[Sweden|Swedish]] variations can be exotic. Beside the usual thin pancakes, called pannkakor, which resembles the French crêpes and, often served with whipped cream and jam, are eaten for lunch on Thursdays with [[pea soup]], the Swedish cuisine has ''plättar'' which resemble tiny English pancakes, and are fried several at a time in a special pan. Others resemble German pancakes but include fried pork in the batter; these are baked in the oven. [[Potato pancakes]] called ''raggmunk'' contain shredded raw potato, and may contain other vegetables (sometimes the pancake batter is omitted, producing ''rårakor''). ''Raggmunk'' and ''rårakor'' are traditionally eaten with pork rinds and [[lingonberry]] jam. A special Swedish pancake is ''saffron pancake'' from Gotland, made with saffron and rice, baked in the oven. The Norwegian variety is commonly eaten for dinner, traditionally with jam or sugar. Some people add lemon juice to the sugar for extra taste. The Icelandic pancake is very similar to a traditional Scandinavian one but is served differently. The pancakes are usually a bit browner than the traditional Swedish one and rolled up in usually sugar or cream.

Another special ``Swedish pancake´´ is the äggakaka (eggcake), also called skånsk äggakaka (scanian eggcake),it is almost like an ordinary Swedish pancake but it's a lot thicker and also a lot more difficult to make due to the risk of burning it. It's made in a fryingpan and is about 1½ to 2 inches thick and is served with lingonberries and bacon.

[[Finland|Finnish]] pancakes greatly resemble "Plättar" and are called "Lettu".
In [[Finland]] pancakes are usually eaten as dessert with whipped cream and/or pancake-jam, sugar or vanilla ice-cream. In finnish, "Lettu" and "Pannukakku" (literally "Pancake") have different meanings, the latter having structurally closer resemblance to hotcake, and baked in an oven instead of using a frying pan.

===United Kingdom===

[[England|English]] pancakes have three key ingredients: plain flour, eggs, and milk. The batter is runny and forms a thin layer on the bottom of the [[frying pan]] when the pan is tilted. It may form some bubbles during cooking, which results in a pale pancake with dark spots where the bubbles were, but the pancake does not rise. English pancakes are similar to [[French cuisine|French]] [[crêpe]]s, and [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] [[crespelle]], but are not "lacy" in appearance.  They may be eaten as a sweet dessert with the traditional topping of lemon juice and sugar, drizzled with [[golden syrup]], or wrapped around savory stuffings and eaten as a main course. [[Yorkshire pudding]] is made from a similar recipe, but baked instead of fried. This batter rises because the air beaten into the batter expands, without the need for baking powder; the result is eaten as part of the traditional roast beef dinner. [[Oatcakes]] are a savory variety of pancake particularly associated with [[Staffordshire]].

'''Scotch pancakes''' are more like the American type and are served as such. In Scotland they are also referred to as ''drop scones'' or ''dropped scones''.<ref name="McNeill">McNeill, F.

They can be served with jam and cream or just with butter. In [[Scotland]] pancakes are generally served at [[Tea (meal)#United_Kingdom|teatime]].

'''Welsh pancakes''' (known as ''crempog'', ''ffroes'' and other names) vary considerably. Some are very much like American pancakes, others may be made with yeast (called ''crempog furum'') or oatmeal (although this is also true of American pancakes) and some are like Scotch pancakes.<ref>Freeman, Bobby ''First catch your peacock: her classic guide to Welsh food '' Y Lolfa; New edition edition (30 October 2006) ISBN 978-0-86243-315-4 pp.195-196 [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-gwkXuzJOPQC&pg=PA195&dq=Welsh+pancakes&ei=UpmUS47wOYPkzASfzPi2CA&cd=1#v=onepage&q=Welsh%20pancakes&f=false Google Books]

'''[[Crumpets]]''' and '''pikelets''' are sometimes considered a variety of pancake.

===North America===

[[File:Silver dollar pancakes.JPG|right|thumb|Stacks of "silver dollar" pancakes.]]
American or Canadian pancakes (sometimes called '''hotcakes''', '''griddlecakes''', or '''flapjacks''') are pancakes which contain a [[raising agent]] such as [[baking powder]]; proportions of eggs, flour, and milk or [[buttermilk]] create a thick batter. Many recipes remind the reader that the ingredients should be mixed until they are just combined, even if lumps remain, as the lumps will smoothen out during the cooking process.<ref>Example: [http://www.cookingforengineers.com/recipe/47/Basic-Pancakes Cookingforengineerse.com]</ref><ref>Example: [[wikiHow:Make-Pancakes|Wiki page on how to make pancakes]]</ref> Sugar and spices such as [[cinnamon]], vanilla and [[nutmeg]] are sometimes added. The pancakes can be made sweet or savory by adding ingredients such as [[blueberry|blueberries]], strawberries, cheese, bacon, bananas, apples or chocolate chips to the batter. This batter is ladled or poured onto a hot surface, and spreads to form a circle about ¼ or ⅓ inch (1 cm) thick. The raising agent causes bubbles to rise to the uncooked side, before the pancake is flipped. These pancakes, very light in texture, are usually served at breakfast topped with [[maple syrup]], [[butter]], [[peanut butter]], [[jelly]], [[jam]], [[chocolate]], [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[ketchup]], [[fruit]] and/or [[honey]]. Some places also serve pancakes with whipped cream. In the [[Southern United States]], cane syrup and [[molasses]] have also been common toppings. Some pancake recipes call for [[yogurt]] to give the pancakes a semi-thick, relatively moist consistency.

[[File:Johnny Cakes food.jpg|thumb|right|Johnny Cakes made in Rhode Island from Kenyon's Corn Meal]]
'''[[Jonnycake]]''' (also spelled "'''johnnycake'''," '''johnny cake''', and "'''journey cake'''") or '''Johnny Bread''' is a [[cornmeal]] [[flatbread]] that was an early American [[staple food]], and is still eaten in the [[West Indies]] and [[Bermuda]].<ref>Darwin Porter, Danforth Prince, ''Frommer's 2010 Bermuda'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=SI-AxOABRM8C&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=%22johnny+bread%22+frommer&source=bl&ots=-8AcoxUTvo&sig=ZS_YbvvTgDn021ttGj-9EVeqKtE&hl=en&ei=vEP_SuL_LePJlQeJutzXDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=&f=false Excerpt at Google Books]</ref>  The modern johnnycake is stereotypically identified with today's [[Rhode Island]] foods, though jonnycakes are a cultural staple in all of the [[Northern United States|northern US]].<ref name="necs">[http://books.google.com/books?id=5IEnJBtqfRsC&source=gbs_navlinks_s New England Country Store Cookbook by Peter W. Smith (iUniverse 2003)]</ref> A modern jonnycake is fried cornmeal [[gruel]], which is made from yellow or white [[cornmeal]] mixed with salt and hot water or milk, and frequently lightly sweetened.

'''Yaniqueques''' or '''yanikeke''' are a [[Dominican Republic]] version of the jonnycake. They are a fried bread rather than a pancake and are a popular beach food.<ref>[http://www.hoy.com.do/vivir/2010/2/25/315391/Antojos-criollos Uribie, Millizen "Creole Cravings" '''Hoy Digital''' 25 February 2010]</ref><ref>[http://dr1.com/news/2008/dnews121108.shtml#13  "Yaniqueques: food and security" DR1 11 December 2008]</ref>

[[Sourdough]] was used by prospectors and pioneers to make sourdough pancakes without having to buy yeast. [[Prospectors]] would carry a pot of sourdough to make pancakes and bread as it could last indefinitely, needing only flour and water to replenish it.<ref>Ridgwell, Jenny ''Finding Out About Food'' Oxford University Press Oxford (30 June 1983) ISBN 978-0-19-832716-5 p.89</ref> Sourdough pancakes are now a particular speciality in [[Alaska]].<ref>DuFresne, Jim; Aaron Sprizter ''Alaska'' Lonely Planet Publications; 6th Revised edition edition (1 April 2006) ISBN 978-1-74059-991-7 p.40</ref>

A '''flapjack''' is a thick small pancake, generally around 10 cm in diameter. Flapjacks are often served in a stack with syrup and butter, which can be accompanied by bacon. The terms pancake and flapjack are often confused and today in the US are nearly [[synonymous]]. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] records the word flapjack as being used as early as the beginning of the 17th century, referring to a flat tart or pan-cake. [[Shakespeare]] refers to pancakes in ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' and to flap-jacks in ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'':<ref>Thiselton, T.F> ''Folklore of Shakespeare'' Kessinger Publishing Co (11 January 2004) ISBN 978-0-7661-8308-7 p.281 [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zUazrtUN0loC&pg=PA281&dq=flapjacks+shakespeare+pancake&as_brr=3&cd=8#v=onepage&q=pancake&f=false Google Books]</ref>

:"Come, thou shant go home, and we'll have flesh for holidays, fish for fasting-days, and moreo'er puddings and flap-jacks, and thou shalt be welcome."
::Act II Scene I

The word elements: ''flap-'' meaning a tossed mixture and ''jack'', an uncertain word suggesting a variety, imply any ingredients could be called a flapjack.

A '''silver dollar pancake''' refers to a pancake about two to three inches (5 to 7 cm) in diameter, or just a bit bigger than the pre-1979 [[Dollar coin (United States)|silver dollar coins in the United States]], for which they are named.  It is usually made by frying a small spoonful of the same batter as any other pancake.  One serving is usually five to ten silver dollar pancakes.

'''German Pancakes''' or '''[[Dutch baby pancake]]s''' served in American pancake houses are bowl-shaped. They are eaten with lemons and powdered sugar, jam, or caramelized apples, as well as fritters.

'''[[Mexico|Mexican]] hotcakes''' are similar to US pancakes. Hotcakes are often made with cornmeal — as well as, or instead of wheat flour. Hotcakes are popular breakfast items at restaurants throughout the country, and are often sold by street vendors in cities and during the local celebrations of towns through the day; the vendors sell a single hotcake topped with different sauces such as [[condensed milk]], fruit jam or a sweet goat milk spread called "[[cajeta]]".

'''[[Guatemalan]] pancakes''' are called Panqueques. They are made with the same ingredients as US pancakes. The toppings are usually fruits
and honey. They are a very popular breakfast meal in Guatemala. Depending on where you are in the country, the "Panqueque" can be thin as a 
"Crêpe" or as fluffy as a North American pancake.
===Asia===

In [[India]] the '''Pooda''' (sometimes called '''Cheela''') is a pancake. They can be made either sweet or salty and are of different thicknesses in different places. They are made in a frying pan and are of a similar batter as their European counterpart

[[Dosa]], [[Appam]], [[Neer dosa]] and [[Uttapam]] could be said to be another Indian pancakes. They are prepared by fermenting rice batter and split skinned [[urad bean]] (black lentil) blended with water. What [[Punjabis]] call a ''Meetha Pooda'' which are a common breakfast food item in the Punjab. It is a sweet pancake which can be eaten with pickles and [[chutney]]. Most of the [[Assamese Jolpan#Pitha|pitha]]s in [[Assam]] are type of pancakes served on occasions such as [[Bihu]].

[[Chinese pancake]]s may be either savory or sweet, and are generally made with dough rather than batter.

In [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], a pancake-like snack known as Apam Balik or Apom Balik(in Malay) or Ban Chian Kuih (面煎粿 in Chinese). The Chinese version is made with a filling, traditionally ground peanut with sugar, butter and additional condiments such as sweetened coconut or egg. Increasingly non-traditional condiments such as cheese, kaya (egg and coconut milk custard), blueberry or chocolate are used in variations. There are other variations, such as those made with [[soya bean]] milk replacing egg and water. The Malay version (Apom Balik) frequently has sweet corn and condensed milk as filling.

In the [[Philippines]], pancakes or "hotcakes" are also served with syrup (maple or imitation corn syrup) margarine and sugar or condensed milk. They are served for breakfast, but there are roving street stalls that sell smaller hotcakes topped with margarine and sugar as an afternoon snack. In [[Vietnamese cuisine]] there is a variety of traditional pancakes; these include ''[[bánh xèo]]'' and ''[[bánh khọt]]'' in southern Vietnam, and ''[[bánh căn]]'' and ''[[bánh khoái]]'' in [[central Vietnam]]. In [[Nepal]], the [[Newar]] have a savory rice pancake called ''[[chataamari]]'' cooked with meat or eggs on top. The [[Indonesia]]n pancake [[serabi]] is made from rice flour and coconut milk. In [[Korea]], pancakes include ''[[jeon (food)|jeon]]'', ''[[pajeon]]'', ''[[bindaetteok]]'', ''[[kimchijeon]]'', and ''[[hotteok]]''.

[[Banana]] pancakes are a menu item in Western-oriented [[backpacking (travel)|backpacker]]s' cafes in Asian countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, India, and China. This has elicited the term ''[[Banana Pancake Trail]]''.

===Australia===
In Australia and New Zealand, small pancakes (about 75mm in diameter), known as '''pikelets''' are also eaten. They are traditionally served with jam and/or whipped cream, or solely with butter, at afternoon tea.  However, they are also common at morning tea. They are made with milk, self-raising flour, eggs and a small amount of [[icing sugar]].

In some circles in New Zealand, very thin, crêpe-like or UK pancake-like pancakes (around 20 cm in diameter), are known as "flapjacks".  This may refer to their thinness, making them more likely to "flap".   They are traditionally served with butter, or butter and lemon, possibly something sweet, and then rolled up and eaten.

American style pancakes are also popular in Australasia. They are eaten for breakfast or as a dessert, with lemon juice and sugar, butter and maple syrup, stewed fruits such as strawberries and cream, ice cream or [[mascarpone]].


===Central and Eastern Europe===
In [[Austria]], the [[Czech Republic]], and [[Slovakia]] pancakes are called [[palatschinke]], palačinka, and palacinka, respectively (plurals palatschinken, palačinky, palacinky). In [[Romania]] they are called clătită (plural clătite). In countries of [[former Yugoslavia]] ([[Slovenia]], [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonia]], and [[Bosnia]]) they are called palačinka (plural palačinke). In these languages, the word derives from Latin ''placenta'', meaning cake. These pancakes are thin and filled with apricot, plum, [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|lingonberry]], strawberry or apple jam, chocolate sauce or [[hazelnut]] spread. [[Kaiserschmarrn]] is an Austrian pancake including raisins, almonds, apple jam or small pieces of apple, split into pieces and sprinkled with powdered sugar.

[[File:Nalesniki.jpg|thumb|left|Home-made ''naleśniki'' filled with sweet white cheese (Poland)]]
[[File:Hortobagy palacsinta.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Hortobágyi palacsinta]]'']]
In [[Hungary]], pancakes called [[palacsinta]] (also derived from Latin ''placenta'') are made from flour, milk or soda water, sugar and eggs. Sweet wine is added to the batter. The filling is usually jam, sugared and ground walnuts or poppy seeds, sugared cottage cheese, sugared cocoa or cinnamon powder, but – especially in [[hortobágyi palacsinta]] – meat and mushroom fillings are also used. [[Gundel palacsinta]] is an Hungarian pancake, stuffed with walnuts, zest, raisins and rum, served in chocolate sauce. The dish is often flambéed. Hungarian pancakes are served as a main dish or as a dessert.

In [[Poland]], thin crêpe-style pancakes are called ''naleśniki'' (pronounced ''naleshniki''). Like any crêpe or blintz, they can be served with a variety of savory or sweet fillings as a main dish or a dessert. Sweet fillings include fresh fruits (e.g. [[bilberry|bilberries]]), jams, and soft white cheese with sugar. Savory fillings include fried vegetables, fried chicken, minced meat, and a variety of added ingredients such as potatoes, mushrooms, cabbage, or ham. The Polish pancake was adopted by the [[Russian cuisine|Russian]] and the [[Ukrainian cuisine|Ukrainian]] cuisines, which call them ''nalesniki''.<ref>[http://www.langet.ru/html/n/nalesniki.html ''Nalesniki''] in V.V. Pokhlebkin's ''Culinary Dictionary'', 2002 {{ru icon}}</ref>

In [[Russia]], [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]], pancakes may be breakfast food, appetizer, main course, or even dessert. [[Blintz]]es ({{lang-ru|блинчики}} ''blinchiki'') are thin crepes made without yeast. [[Blini]] ({{lang-ru|блины}}) are thicker pancakes made from wheat or buckwheat flour, butter, eggs, and milk, with yeast added to the batter. Blini cooking has a long history in Russia, dating back to pagan traditions and feasts, which are reflected in today's "[[Maslenitsa|pancake week]]" celebrated in the winter before the [[Great Lent]]. Small thick pancakes made from [[yogurt]] or [[buttermilk]] based batter (without yeast) are called ''oladyi'' ([[:ru:Оладьи|оладьи]]) (diminutive: ''oladushki'' оладушки, further abbreviated as ''ladushki'' ладушки).

===Africa===
"Pancakes" in South Africa refer to crepes. They are traditionally prepared by the [[Afrikaans]] community on gas stoves, and called a ''pannekoek'' in Afrikaans, eaten on wet and cold days. ''Pannekoeke'' are served with cinnamon-flavored sugar (and sometimes lemon juice); the sugar may be left to dissolve onto the pancake; if eaten immediately the pancake is crispy. It is a staple at [[Dutch Reformed Church]] fetes.<ref>[http://www.landbou.com/LandbouWeekblad/Kos_en_resepte/0,,1294-1317_1737818,00.html Boer op ons werf] Landbou.com</ref>
American-style "silver dollar" pancakes are eaten in South Africa, as "plaatkoekies" or "flapjacks".
In South Africa there is a variation of the pancake called a crumpet. It is made from self-raising flour, eggs, milk and a pinch of salt. The smooth batter is fried in butter resulting in a slightly raised flat cake. Crumpets are always served hot, usually for breakfast, with butter and golden syrup.

In [[Kenya]] pancakes are eaten for breakfast as an alternative to bread. They are served plain with the sugar already added to the batter to sweeten them.
Kenyan pancakes are similar to English pancakes and French crepes.

==Pancake restaurant chains==
[[File:Local IHOP.jpg|thumb|right|An IHOP restaurant in [[Poughkeepsie]], New York]]
In the US, Mexico and Canada, a franchised restaurant chain named [[IHOP|International House of Pancakes]] (IHOP) has restaurants serving pancakes at all hours of the day. [[The Original Pancake House]] is another chain of pancake restaurants across the US, and [[Walker Brothers]] is a series of pancake houses in the [[Chicago area]] that developed as a franchised spin-off of ''The Original Pancake House''.

The popularity of pancakes in [[Australia]] has spawned the [[Pancake Parlour]] and ''Pancakes on the Rocks'' franchised restaurants. In [[British Columbia]] and [[Alberta]], the restaurant chain ''De Dutch'' serves Dutch- and Flemish-style pannenkoeken.

(Shrove Tuesday is better known in the United States, France and other countries as [[Mardi Gras]] or [[Fat Tuesday]].)  Historically, pancakes were made on Shrove Tuesday so that the last of the fatty and rich foods could be used up before [[Lent]].

Charity and school events are organized on Pancake Day: in a "pancake race" each participant carries a pancake in a frying pan. All runners must toss their pancakes as they run and catch them in the frying pan. This event is said to have originated in [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney, England]] in 1444 when a housewife was still busy frying pancakes to eat before the Lenten fast when she heard the bells of [[St Peter]] and [[Saint Paul (apostle)|St Paul]]'s Church calling her to the [[Confession|Shriving]] Service. Eager to get to church, she ran out of her house still holding the frying pan complete with pancake, and still wearing her [[apron]] and headscarf.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Pancake Day is widely celebrated in Australia.

Every Shrove Tuesday since 1950 the towns of Olney<ref name="Olney race">[http://olney100.ning.com/video/pancake-race-2007-1 Olney Pancake Race 2007 Video]</ref> and [[Liberal, Kansas|Liberal]], [[Kansas]] have competed in the International Pancake Race. Only local women may compete; they race, and their times are compared to determine the international winner. In Olney the main women's race is augmented by races for local schoolchildren and for men.

The ''Rehab UK Parliamentary Pancake Race'' takes place every Shrove Tuesday, with teams from the British lower house (the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]), the upper house (the [[House of Lords]]), and the [[Fourth Estate]], contending for the title of Parliamentary Pancake Race Champions. The fun relay race is to raise awareness of the work of the national [[Acquired brain injury|brain injury]] charity, Rehab UK, and the needs of people with acquired brain injury. In 2009, the Lords won.<ref name="BBC">{{cite
