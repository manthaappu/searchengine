<html> <head> <title>MacSpeech Scribe</title></head><body>'''MacSpeech Scribe''' is speech recognition software for Mac OS X designed specifically for transcription of recorded voice dictation. It runs on Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. The software transcribes dictation recorded by an individual speaker. Typically the speaker will record their dictation using a digital recording device such as a handheld digital recorder, mobile smartphone (e.g. iPhone), or desktop or laptop computer with a suitable microphone. MacSpeech Scribe supports specific audio file formats for recorded dictation: .aif, .aiff, .wav, .mp4, .m4a, and .m4v.

MacSpeech Scribe was originally developed by [[MacSpeech]], Inc. and released February 11, 2010 at Macworld Expo in San Francisco. The product is now owned by [[Nuance Communications]] which acquired MacSpeech on February 16, 2010. Nuance is the developer of other speech recognition products including Dragon [[NaturallySpeaking]] for Windows, [[DragonDictate|Dragon Dictate for Mac]] (formerly "[[MacSpeech Dictate]]"), and Dragon Dictation apps for iOS.

Jeffery Battersby of Macworld noted in his September 2010 review [http://www.macworld.com/reviews/product/664604/review/scribe_11.html] of MacSpeech Scribe v1.1:
<blockquote>Small foibles aside, MacSpeech Scribe is a powerful and intelligent tool for transcribing your recorded speech. A simple training process and access to a wide variety of standard audio formats mean that youâ€™ll be moving your spoken text to the printed page in a matter of minutes and with a minimum of hassle. Scribe is the best, simplest way for you to get your spoken word to the printed page.</blockquote>
