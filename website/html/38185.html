A '''treasure hunt''' is one of many different types of games which can have one or more players who try to find hidden articles, locations or places by using a series of clues. This is a fictional activity; [[treasure hunting]] can also be a real life activity. Treasure hunt games may be an indoor or outdoor activity. Outdoors they can be played in a garden or the treasure could be located anywhere around the world.

A [[puzzlehunt]] is a typical treasure hunt game involving clues. Sometimes though a hunt may not have clues because of the age of the children. An example of this is an [[Easter egg hunt]] that is performed on a day near [[Easter]] Sunday. Young children just search for as many eggs as they can find whilst older children may have clues to one egg.

Treasure hunt are sometimes organised by parents as a game to be played at children's parties. This could be in a range of formats; just searching for items, following clues as a group or splitting into teams to race to a prize.

An armchair treasure hunt is any activity that requires solving [[puzzle]]s or [[riddle]]s in some easily portable and widely reproduced format (often an illustrated children's book), and then using clues hidden either in the story or the graphics of the book to find a real treasure somewhere in the physical world. However, although these may seem to be for children, this genre is aimed at dedicated adults.

The use of a treasure hunt as a party game is attributed to socialite [[Elsa Maxwell]]. She said that:
:''In the Treasure Hunt . . . intellectual men were paired off with great beauties, glamor with talent. In the course of the night's escapades anything could happen.''<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,796902-2,00.html Time article ''Elsa at War''] retrieved April 10, 2007</ref>

Adult treasure hunts are becoming increasingly popular {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.  Some {{Who|date=May 2010}} theorize this is due to the extended adolescence. Others {{Who|date=May 2010}} cite the difficulty in meeting new people with the breakdown of traditional community organizations. Regardless, more adults find themselves participating in enormous city wide treasure and scavenger hunts like those of Treasure War Network in New Jersey.

There is a growing market for treasure hunts consisting of fixed landmarks in the real world, rather than a specially-laid trail at a particular event.  Companies are providing these hunts as corporate team building activities in cities around the world with London, Dublin and Sydney key examples.  One of these companies is Events4teams [http://www.events4teams.co.uk Events4teams.co.uk] which provides DIY hunts in 12 locations around the UK.

[[Geocaching]] is an outdoor treasure-hunting game in which the participants use a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver or other navigational techniques to hide and seek containers (called "geocaches" or "caches") anywhere in the world.

An armchair treasure hunt uses a book or a puzzle as basis, in which clues are hidden. This type of Treasure Hunt normally takes months to solve and has immense prizes to be won. 

[[Online Treasure Hunts]] are a new development where participants follow clues and visit different websites (or even physical locations) to solve riddles. Participants can win prizes for correctly solving puzzles to win treasure hunts. Many of these online hunts are subject to internet gaming laws that vary between jurisdiction. An example is [[CashTreasureHunt.com]]<ref>[http://www.cashtreasurehunt.com Cash Treasure Hunt] retrieved September 2, 2010</ref>.

[[Letterboxing]] is another treasure hunt game. It is played outdoors and combines elements of [[orienteering]], art and problem-solving. Letterboxers hide small, [[weatherproof]] boxes in publicly-accessible places (like parks) and distribute clues to finding the box in printed catalogs, on one of several web sites (see below), or by word of mouth. Individual letterboxes usually contain a logbook and a rubber stamp.

A [[photo treasure hunt]] is a new way to play the well-known Treasure Hunt game. The main difference between them is that in a Photo Treasure Hunt the competitors have to collect pictures rather than collecting items.{{fact|date=June 2010}}

In 1956, comedian [[Jan Murray]] created and hosted a variation for television, also known as ''[[Treasure Hunt (television)|Treasure Hunt]]''. The game pitted a pair of contestants answering questions to qualify to go on a "treasure hunt" that involved choosing from among thirty treasure chests that included anything from gag prizes to valuable merchandise and/or cash. The show also offered home viewers a chance for a treasure hunt, when a postcard was chosen from a large drum by a young guest who revolved the drum several times to mix up the entries. The show aired daily in the morning and once a week in the evening until 1959, when the networks began cancelling game shows offering sizeable-valued prizes in the wake of the [[quiz show scandal]].
