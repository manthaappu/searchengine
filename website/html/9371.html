<html> <head> <title>Data extraction</title></head><body>'''Data extraction''' is the act or process of retrieving ([[binary data|binary]]) [[data]] out of (usually [[unstructured data|unstructured]] or poorly structured) [[data source]]s for further [[data processing]] or [[data storage device|data storage]] ([[data migration]]). The [[data import|import]] into the intermediate extracting system is thus usually followed by [[data transformation]] and possibly the addition of [[metadata]] prior to [[data export|export]] to another stage in the data [[workflow]].<ref>[http://www.extractingdata.com Definition of data extraction.]</ref>

Usually, the term data extraction is applied when ([[experiment]]al) data is first imported into a computer from primary sources, like [[measuring device|measuring]] or [[recording device]]s. Today's [[electronic device]]s will usually present a [[electrical connector]] (e.g. [[USB]]) through which '[[raw data]]' can be [[data stream|streamed]] into a [[personal computer]].

Typical unstructured data sources include web pages, emails, documents, PDFs, scanned text, mainframe reports, spool files etc.  Extracting data from these unstructured sources has grown into a considerable technical challenge where as historically data extraction has had to deal with changes in physical hardware formats, the majority of current data extraction deals with extracting data from these unstructured data sources, and from different software formats.  This growing process of data extraction from the web is referred to as [[Web scraping]].

The act of adding structure to unstructured data takes a number of forms
* Using text pattern matching also known as [[Regular expression]] to identify small or large-scale structure e.g. records in a report and their associated data from headers and footers; 
* Using a table-based approach to identify common sections within a limited domain e.g. in emailed resumes, identifying skills, previous work experience, qualifications etc using a standard set of commonly used headings (these would differ from language to language), eg Education might be found under Education/Qualification/Courses;
* Using text analytics to attempt to understand the text and link it to other information
