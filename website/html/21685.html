'''Linda-like systems''' are parallel and distributed programming models that use unstructured collections of tuples as a communication mechanism between different processes.  In addition to proper [[Linda (coordination language)|Linda]] implementations, these include other systems such as the following:

Because of this restriction Concurrent Collections has a deterministic execution semantics, but has difficulties with storage deallocation.
