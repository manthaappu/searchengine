'''Bi-quinary coded decimal''' is a [[numeral system|numeral encoding scheme]] used in many [[abacus]]es and in some early computers, including the [[Colossus computer|Colossus]].  The term '''''bi-quinary''''' indicates that the code comprises both a two-state (''bi'') and a five-state (''quin''ary) component. The encoding resembles that used by many abaci, with four beads indicating either 0..4 or 5..9 and another bead indicating which of those ranges.

Several human languages, most notably [[Khmer numerals|Khmer]] and [[Wolof language|Wolof]], also use biquinary systems.  For example, the Khmer word for 6, ''pram muoy'', literally means ''five [plus] one''.

==Decoding==
To decode the Biquinary code use the number '''5043210'''. 

At each digit multiply the biquinary number by the number 5043210. This will give you one decimal digit. 

For example take the number 0110000. To change this into decimal:
::(5 × 0) + (0 × 1) + (4 × 1) + (3 × 0) + (2 × 0) + (1 × 0) + (0 × 0) = 4

==Examples==
Several different representations of bi-quinary coded decimal have been used by different machines.  The two-state component is encoded as one or two [[bit]]s, and the five-state component is encoded using three to five bits.  Some examples are:

*[[IBM 650]] &ndash; 7 bits (two ‘bi’ bits: 0 5 and five ‘quinary’ bits: 0 1 2 3 4) with error checking (exactly one ‘bi’ bit and one ‘quinary’ bit set in a valid digit); in the picture of the front panel below, the bi-quinary encoding of the internal workings of the machine are evident in the arrangement of the lights &ndash; the 'bi' bits form the top of a T for each digit, and the 'quinary' bits form the vertical stem (the machine was running when the photograph was taken and the active bits are just discernible)
