An '''inverse''' or '''negative relationship''' is a [[mathematical relationship]] in which one [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]], say '''y''',  decreases as another, say '''x''', increases.  For a linear (straight-line) relation, this can be expressed as '''y = a-bx''', where '''-b''' is a constant value less than zero and '''a''' is a constant.  For example, there is an inverse relationship between education and unemployment — that is, as education increases, the rate of unemployment decreases.

Inverse relationships and their counterpart, ''[[direct relationship]]s'', are widely used in the [[physical science]]s to describe the relationship between two variables in an equation. 

In [[economic graph]]ing, two variables are said to have an inverse relationship if the graph line slopes downward to the right.
