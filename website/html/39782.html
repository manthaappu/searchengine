A '''walled garden''' is an analogy used in various senses in information technology. In the telecommunications and media industries, a "walled garden" refers to a carrier's or service provider's control over applications, content, and media on platforms (such as mobile devices) and restriction of convenient access to non-approved applications or content. For example, in telecommunications, the services and applications accessible on any device on a given wireless network were historically tightly controlled by the mobile operators. The mobile operators determined which applications from which developers were available on a device's home portal or home page. This has long been a central issue constraining the telecommunications sector, as developers face huge hurdles in getting their applications onto devices and into the hands of end-users. 

More generally, a '''walled garden''' refers to a closed or exclusive set of information services provided for users.  This is in contrast to giving consumers open access to applications and content.  

Another use of the term refers to quarantining [[malware]]-infected computers which exhibit symptoms of [[botnet]] activity in such a way that the user can still access tools to disinfect the machine, usually with a [[Web browser]].<ref>[http://www.maawg.org/about/whitepapers/MAAWG_Walled_Garden_BP_2007-09.pdf MAAWG Best Practices for the Use of a Walled Garden], [[MAAWG]] whitepaper, October, 2007.</ref> 

The term can also refer to a situation in which an unauthenticated user is given access to a limited environment for the purpose of setting up an account. After the account is established, the user is allowed out of the walled garden. Some walled gardens are created and maintained by the use of firmware upgrades that wall out alternatives (e.g., [[Apple Inc.]] [[iPhone]] hacks).  

Alternatively, a walled garden can be information that has few authors and rich interlinkage, but a paucity of links to and from its surrounding information network.<ref>[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WalledGarden Walled gardens on the Wiki Wiki Web]</ref> (See [[Wikipedia: Walled garden]].)
