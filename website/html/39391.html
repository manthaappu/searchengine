[[Image:Vidalia-0.0.11-svn.png|right|thumb|The Vidalia network map.]]

'''Vidalia''' is a cross-platform controller [[GUI]] for [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]], built using the [[Qt (framework)|Qt]]. It allows the user to start, stop, and view the status of Tor; monitor bandwidth usage; view, filter, and search log messages; and configure some aspects of Tor. Vidalia also makes it easier to contribute to the Tor network by optionally helping the user set up a Tor server.

Another prominent feature of Vidalia is its Tor network map, which lets the user see the geographic location of servers on the Tor network, as well as where the user's application traffic is going.

Since "Tor" stands for "The Onion Router," it is appropriate that its GUI be named Vidalia (see [[Vidalia onion]]).

Vidalia is released under the [[GNU General Public License]]. It runs on any platform supported by Qt 4.2, including [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[Linux]] or other [[Unix-like]] variants using the [[X11]] window system.
