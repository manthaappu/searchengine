'''SciNet''' is a consortium of the [[University of Toronto]] and affiliated Ontario hospitals.  It has received funding from both the federal and provincial government, Faculties at the University of Toronto, and affiliated hospitals.

The supercomputer operates on 30,240 intel 5500 series 2.53 GHz processor cores arranged in 45 file-like stacks can perform 300 trillion calculations per second which will be used for highly calculation-intensive tasks.

It is one of seven regional High Performance Computing consortia across Canada and is the most powerful University HPC system outside of the US.  As of November 2008, the partially constructed systems were already ranked at #53 on the Top 500 List.  It is also the only Canadian HPC in top 100 of the list. The parallel systems were anticipated to rank around #50 and #25 upon completion in June 2009.   The TOP500 list for June 2009 ranked the GPC, iDadaplex, system at #16 while the TCS dropped to #80.

The SciNet offices are based on the St. George street campus, however, to accommodate the large floor space and power needs, the datacentre facility is housed in a warehouse about 30 km north of campus in Vaughan.

At the core of SciNet research are six key areas of study: Astronomy and Astrophysics, Aerospace and Biomedical Engineering, High Energy Particle Physics, Integrative Computational Biology, Planetary Physics, and Theoretical Chemical Physics.

== History ==

SciNet was initially formed in the fall of 2004 following an agreement between the Canadian [[high-performance computing]] community to develop a response to the newly created National Platform Fund.  The community felt that funding from the NPF would enable the development of a collective national capability in HPC.  The Canadian HPC community was successful in its NPF proposal and SciNet was awarded a portion of that funding.

SciNet finalized its contract with [[IBM]] to build the system in July 2008 and the formal announcement was August 14th, 2008. <ref>{{cite web | title=U of T to acquire Canada's most powerful supercomputer from IBM | url=http://www.news.utoronto.ca/campus-news/u-of-t-to-acquire-canadas-most-powerful-supercomputer-from-ibm.html | publisher=University of Toronto | date=2008-08-14 | accessdate=2009-05-08}}</reF>  On Thursday, June 18, 2009, the most powerful [[supercomputer]] in [[Canada]] went online and would have ranked twelfth most powerful computer worldwide had it been completed six months earlier.<Ref name="CBC June">{{cite web

== Specifications==
The [[IBM]] [[IBM System x|System x]] iDataPlex Supercomputer operates on 30,240 intel 5500 series 2.53 GHz processor cores arranged in 45 file-like stacks.  The computer will use the same amount of energy which could be used to power 4,000 homes and is water cooled.  To utilize the cold Canadian climate the system is notified when external temperatures go below a certain point.  At that point the chiller switches over to use the "free-air" cooling available.  SciNet, [[IBM]] Corp and [[Compute Canada]] collaborated on the supercomputer venture.<ref name="CBC June"/><Ref name="UofT">{{cite web

The SciNet HPC systems are two compute clusters that are optimized for different types of computing.

One is a [[Multiprocessing| Tighly-coupled Capability System]] (TCS) which has 104 Power 6 nodes, wherein each node contains 32 cores (4.7 GHz) and 128 GiB RAM.  Theoretical peak is 60 [[TFLOPS| TFlops]] and 14 TiB of RAM.

The second is the General Purpose Cluster (GPC) which has 30,240 cores of an Intel [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem]]-based processor, each with 2GiB RAM. Theoretical peak is 306 TFlops and 60 TiB of RAM.

The computer room itself is {{convert|3000|sqft|m2}} on a raised floor.  IT has a 735 ton chiller and cooling towers for “free-air” cooling.  A significant research area that will be addressed using the SciNet machines is that of climate change and global warming, which is why creating one of the greenest datacenters in the world was of key importance in this project.  A traditional datacenter generally uses 33% of the energy going into its centre for cooling and other non-computing power consumption; however, SciNet and IBM have successfully created a centre that uses less than 20% towards these areas.

==Common uses==
{{Wikinews|Canada's supercomputer goes online}}
The U of T supercomputer which can perform 300 trillion calculations per second will be used for highly calculation-intensive tasks such as problems involving [[quantum mechanical physics]], [[weather forecasting]], climate research, climate change models, [[computational chemistry|molecular modeling]] (computing the structures and properties of chemical compounds, biological [[macromolecules]], polymers, and crystals), physical simulations (such as simulation of the [[big bang]] theory in conjunction with the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) in [[CERN]], [[Geneva]] which will produce cataclysmic conditions that will mimic the beginning of time,and the U of T supercomputer will examine the particle collisions.<Ref name="AHN UT"/><ref name="CBC June"/><Ref name="UofT"/>  Part of the collaboration with LHC will be to answer questions about why matter has mass and what comprises the Universe's mass?  Additional areas of research will be models of greenhouse gas-induced global warming and the effect on Arctic sea ice.  The international ATLAS project will be explored by the new supercomputer to discover forces which govern the universe.<Ref name="world">{{cite web
