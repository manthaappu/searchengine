'''''Current Contents''''' is a rapid alerting service database from the [[Institute for Scientific Information]], now part of [[Thomson Reuters]], that is published online and in several different printed subject sections. 

==History==
''Current Contents'' was first published in paper format, in a single edition devoted only to biology and medicine. Other subject editions were added later. Initially, it consisted simply of a reproduction of the title pages from several hundred major [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]]s, and was published weekly, with the issues containing title pages from journal issues only a few weeks previously, a shorter time lag than any service then available. There was an author index and a crude keyword subject index only. Author addresses were provided so readers could send reprint requests for copies of the actual articles.

==Current status==
Still published in print, it is presently available as one of the databases included in Thomson's [[ISI Web of Knowledge]] with daily updates, and also through other database aggregators. 

==Editions==
The following different editions exist:
*Current Contents Agricultural, Biological, and Environmental Sciences
*Current Contents Arts and Humanities
*Current Contents Clinical Practice 
*Current Contents Engineering , Technology, and Applied  Sciences
*Current Contents Life Sciences
*Current Contents Physical Chemical and Earth Sciences
*Current Contents Social & Behavioral Sciences
