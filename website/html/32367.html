<html> <head> <title>Rodnay Zaks</title></head><body>'''Rodnay Zaks''' (born 10 February 1946, [[Paris]]) is a prolific French-born American author of books on computer programming,<ref>[http://www.isbn.pl/A-rodnay-zaks/ Rodnay Zaks - new and used books<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> including the seminal ''Programming the [[Z80]]'' and ''Programming the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]]''. He is the founder of independent computer books publisher [[Sybex]] and was its president and CEO until it was bought out by [[John Wiley and Sons]] in May 2005.

Zaks has an engineering degree from the renowned [[École Centrale Paris]] and a Master's degree from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he also was the third person to receive a Ph.D. from the then new [[Computer Science]] department. He started a career in training engineers and managers in the then new [[microprocessor]] technology and subsequently founded Sybex in 1976.

Zaks has been a director of [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]'s Special Interest Group on Microarchitecture (SIGMICRO) and founder of the non-profit organization [[EUROMICRO]].

An early publication of Zaks' from [[Sybex]] was ''A microprogrammed APL implementation''<ref>ISBN 0895880059</ref> which is the complete, total source listing for the microcode for a Digital Scientific Corporation Meta 4 microprogrammable processor implementing the [[APL (programming language)|APL]] programming language.
