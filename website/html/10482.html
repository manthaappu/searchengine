'''Digital signal processing''' ('''DSP''') is concerned with the representation of [[signal (electronics)|signal]]s by a sequence of numbers or symbols and the processing of these signals. Digital signal processing and [[analog signal processing]] are subfields of [[signal processing]]. DSP includes subfields like: [[audio signal processing|audio]] and [[speech signal processing]], sonar and radar signal processing, sensor array processing, spectral estimation, statistical signal processing, [[digital image processing]], signal processing for communications, control of systems, biomedical signal processing, seismic data processing, etc.

The goal of DSP is usually to measure, filter and/or compress continuous real-world analog signals. The first step is usually to convert the signal from an analog to a digital form, by ''sampling'' it using an [[analog-to-digital converter]] (ADC), which turns the analog signal into a stream of numbers. However, often, the required output signal is another analog output signal, which requires a [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC). Even if this process is more complex than analog processing and has a [[discrete signal|discrete value range]], the application of computational power to digital signal processing allows for many advantages over analog processing in many applications, such as [[error detection|error detection and correction]] in transmission as well as [[data compression]].<ref>{{cite book | title = Digital Signal Processing: Instant access | author = James D. Broesch, Dag Stranneby and William Walker | publisher = Butterworth-Heinemann | page = 3}}</ref>

DSP [[algorithm]]s have  long been run on standard computers, on specialized processors called [[digital signal processor]]s (DSPs), or on purpose-built hardware such as [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASICs). Today there are additional technologies used for digital signal processing including more powerful general purpose [[microprocessor]]s, [[field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGAs), [[Digital Signal Controller|digital signal controllers]] (mostly for industrial apps such as motor control), and [[stream processing|stream processors]], among others.<ref>{{cite book | title = Digital Signal Processing and Applications | author = Dag Stranneby and William Walker | edition = 2nd ed. | publisher = Elsevier | year = 2004 | isbn = 0750663448 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=NKK1DdqcDVUC&pg=PA241&dq=called+digital+signal+processor+hardware+application-specific+integrated+circuit+general-purpose+microprocessors+field-programmable+gate+arrays+dsp+asic+fpga+stream&as_brr=3&ei=cA0mSLWwB4qIswOEvsC5DQ&sig=EwJs3lv92Kai7Xw0i2XG9UpBVuA }}</ref>

== DSP domains ==

In   DSP, engineers usually study digital signals in one of the following domains: [[time domain]] (one-dimensional signals), spatial domain (multidimensional signals), [[frequency domain]], [[autocorrelation]] domain, and [[wavelet]] domains. They choose the domain in which to process a signal by making an informed guess (or by trying different possibilities) as to which domain best represents the essential characteristics of the signal. A sequence of samples from a measuring device produces a time or spatial domain representation, whereas a [[discrete Fourier transform]] produces the frequency domain information, that is the [[frequency spectrum]]. Autocorrelation is defined as the [[cross-correlation]] of the signal with itself over varying intervals of time or space.

== Signal sampling ==

{{Main|Sampling (signal processing)}}

With the increasing use of [[computer]]s the usage of and need for digital signal processing has increased. In order to use an analog signal on a computer it must be digitized with an analog-to-digital converter.
Sampling is usually carried out in two stages, [[discretization]] and [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]]. In the discretization stage, the space of signals is partitioned into [[equivalence class]]es and quantization is carried out by replacing the signal with representative signal of the corresponding equivalence class.
In the quantization stage the representative signal values are approximated by values from a finite set.

The [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]] states that a signal can be exactly reconstructed from its samples if the [[sampling frequency]] is greater than twice the highest frequency of the signal; but requires an infinite number of samples . In practice, the sampling frequency is often significantly more than twice that required by the signal's limited bandwidth.

A digital-to-analog converter is used to convert the digital signal back to analog. The use of a digital computer is a key ingredient in [[digital control|digital control systems]].

== Time and space domains ==

{{Main|Time domain}}

The most common processing approach in the time or space domain is enhancement of the input signal through a method called filtering. [[Digital filter]]ing generally consists of some linear transformation of a number of surrounding samples around the current sample of the input or output signal. There are various ways to characterize filters; for example:

* A "linear" filter is a [[linear transformation]] of input samples; other filters are "non-linear". Linear filters satisfy the superposition condition, i.e. if an input is a weighted linear combination of different signals, the output is an equally weighted linear combination of the corresponding output signals.

* A "causal" filter uses only previous samples of the input or output signals; while a "non-causal" filter uses future input samples. A non-causal filter can usually be changed into a causal filter by adding a delay to it.

* A "time-invariant" filter has constant properties over time; other filters such as [[adaptive filter]]s change in time.

* Some filters are "stable", others are "unstable". A stable filter produces an output that converges to a constant value with time, or remains bounded within a finite interval. An unstable filter can produce an output that grows without bounds, with bounded or even zero input.

* A "finite impulse response" ([[Finite impulse response|FIR]]) filter uses only the input signals, while an "infinite impulse response" filter ([[IIR]]) uses both the input signal and previous samples of the output signal. FIR filters are always stable, while IIR filters may be unstable.

Filters can be represented by block diagrams which can then be used to derive a sample processing [[algorithm]] to implement the filter using hardware instructions. A filter may also be described as a [[difference equation]], a collection of [[Zero (complex analysis)|zeroes]] and [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s or, if it is an FIR filter, an [[impulse response]] or [[step response]].

The output of a digital filter to any given input may be calculated by [[convolution|convolving]] the input signal with the [[impulse response]].

== Frequency domain ==

{{Main|Frequency domain}}

Signals are converted from time or space domain to the frequency domain usually through the [[Fourier transform]]. The Fourier transform converts the signal information to a magnitude and phase component of each frequency. Often the Fourier transform is converted to the power spectrum, which is the magnitude of each frequency component squared.

The most common purpose for analysis of signals in the frequency domain is analysis of signal properties. The engineer can study the spectrum to determine which frequencies are present in the input signal and which are missing.

In addition to frequency information, phase information is often needed. This can be obtained from the Fourier transform. With some applications, how the phase varies with frequency can be a significant consideration.

Filtering, particularly in non-realtime work can also be achieved by converting to the frequency domain, applying the filter and then converting back to the time domain. This is a fast, O(n log n) operation, and can give essentially any filter shape including excellent approximations to [[brickwall filter]]s.

There are some commonly used frequency domain transformations. For example, the [[cepstrum]] converts a signal to the frequency domain through Fourier transform, takes the logarithm, then applies another Fourier transform. This emphasizes the frequency components with smaller magnitude while retaining the order of magnitudes of frequency components.

Frequency domain analysis is also called ''spectrum-'' or ''spectral analysis''.

==Z-plane analysis==

Whereas analog filters are usually analysed in terms of [[transfer function]]s in the [[s plane]] using [[Laplace transform]]s, digital filters are analysed in the z plane in terms of [[Z-transform]]s. A digital filter may be described in the z plane by its characteristic collection of [[Zero (complex analysis)|zeroes]] and [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]].

== Applications ==

The main applications of DSP are [[audio signal processing]], [[audio compression]], [[digital image processing]], [[video compression]], [[speech processing]], [[speech recognition]], [[digital communication]]s, [[RADAR]], [[SONAR]], [[seismology]], and [[biomedicine]]. Specific examples are [[speech compression]] and transmission in digital [[mobile phone]]s, [[digital room correction|room correction]] of sound in [[hi-fi]] and [[sound reinforcement]] applications, [[weather forecasting]], [[economic forecasting]], [[seismology|seismic]] data processing, analysis and control of [[industrial process]]es, [[medical imaging]] such as [[CAT]] scans and [[MRI]], [[MP3]] compression, [[computer graphics]], [[image manipulation]], hi-fi [[loudspeaker]] [[audio crossover|crossovers]] and [[equalization]], and [[audio effect]]s for use with [[electric guitar]] [[amplifiers]].

== Implementation ==

Digital signal processing is often implemented using [[Digital signal processor|specialised microprocessors]] such as the [[Motorola 56000|DSP56000]], the [[TMS320]], or the [[Super Harvard Architecture Single-Chip Computer|SHARC]]. These often process data using [[fixed-point arithmetic]], although some versions are available which use [[floating point arithmetic]] and are more powerful. For faster applications [[FPGA]]s<ref>{{cite web

Beginning in 2007, multicore implementations of DSPs have started to emerge from companies including [[Freescale]] and [[Stream Processors, Inc]]. For faster applications with vast usage, [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]]s might be designed specifically. For slow applications, a traditional slower processor such as a microcontroller may be adequate. Also a growing number of DSP applications are now being implemented on [[Embedded Systems]] using powerful PCs with a [[Multi-core processor]].
