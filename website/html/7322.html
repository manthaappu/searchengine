A '''component''' in the [[Unified Modeling Language]] "represents a [[modular]] part of a [[system]], that encapsulates its content and whose manifestation is replaceable within its [[built environment|environment]]. A component defines its [[behavior]] in terms of ''provided'' and ''required'' [[Interface (computer science)|interfaces]]".<ref name= "OMG UML V2.1.2"> OMG (2008). ''[http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.1.2/Superstructure/PDF OMG Unified Modeling Language (OMG UML), Superstructure, V2.1.2]'' p.146.</ref>

A component may be replaced by another if and only if their provided and required interfaces are identical. This idea is the underpinning for the [[plug-and-play]] capability of [[component-based]] systems and promotes [[software reuse]]<ref name= "OMG UML V2.1.2"/>.

As can be seen from the above definition, UML places no restriction on the granularity of a component. Thus, a component may be as small as a ''figures-to-words converter'', or as large as an entire ''[[document management system]]''.

Larger pieces of a [[system]]'s functionality may be assembled by reusing components as parts in an encompassing component or assembly of components, and wiring together their required and provided interfaces."<ref name= "OMG UML V2.1.2"/> Such assemblies are illustrated by means of [[component diagram]]s.
