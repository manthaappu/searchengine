{{Main|History of Wikipedia}}
[[File:ImageNupedia.png|thumb|alt=Logo reading "Nupedia.com the free encyclopedia" in blue with large initial "N."|Wikipedia originally developed from another encyclopedia project, [[Nupedia]].]]
Wikipedia began as a complementary project for [[Nupedia]], a free online [[English language|English-language]] encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process. Nupedia was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of [[Bomis|Bomis, Inc]], a [[web portal]] company. Its main figures were [[Jimmy Wales]], Bomis [[CEO]], and [[Larry Sanger]], [[Editing|editor-in-chief]] for Nupedia and later Wikipedia. Nupedia was licensed initially under its own Nupedia [[Open Content]] License, switching to the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] before Wikipedia's founding at the urging of [[Richard Stallman]].<ref name="stallman1999">{{cite web

Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, [[Slashdot]] postings, and [[web search engine]] indexing. It grew to approximately 20,000 articles and 18 language editions by the end of 2001.

Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control in a perceived English-centric Wikipedia, users of the [[Spanish Wikipedia]] [[Fork (software development)|forked]] from Wikipedia to create the ''[[Enciclopedia Libre Universal en Español|Enciclopedia Libre]]'' in February 2002.<ref>{{cite web|title=<nowiki>[long] Enciclopedia Libre: msg#00008</nowiki> |url=http://osdir.com/ml/science.linguistics.wikipedia.international/2003-03/msg00008.html |work=Osdir |accessdate=2008-12-26}}</ref> Later that year, Wales announced that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and its website was moved to wikipedia.org.<ref name=Shirky>{{Cite book|author= Clay Shirky|authorlink=Clay Shirky|title=Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations|date=February 28, 2008|publisher=The Penguin Press via Amazon Online Reader|url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1594201536/ref=sib_dp_srch_pop?v=search-inside&keywords=spanish&go.x=0&go.y=0&go=Go%21 |isbn=1-594201-53-6|page=273 |accessdate=2008-12-26}}</ref> Various other wiki-encyclopedia projects have been started, largely under a different philosophy from the open and [[NPOV]] editorial model of Wikipedia.

[[File:EnwikipediaGom.PNG|thumb|300px|Number of articles in the English Wikipedia plotted against [[Gompertz function]] tending to 4.4 million articles.]]
Though the English Wikipedia reached three million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the numbers of articles and of contributors, appeared to have flattened off around early 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/aug/12/wikipedia-deletionist-inclusionist |title=Wikipedia approaches its limits |author=Bobbie Johnson | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=2009-08-12 | accessdate=2010-03-31}}</ref> In 2006, about 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia; by 2010 that average was roughly 1,000.<ref>[[Wikipedia:Size_of_Wikipedia#Annual_growth_rate]]</ref> A team at the [[Palo Alto Research Center]] speculated that this is due to the increasing exclusiveness of the project.<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://www.wikisym.org/ws2009/procfiles/p108-suh.pdf |title=The Singularity is Not Near: Slowing Growth of Wikipedia |year=2009|location=Orlando, Florida |conference=the International Symposium on Wikis}}</ref> New or occasional editors have significantly higher rates of their edits reverted (removed) than an elite group of regular editors, colloquially known as the "[[cabal]]." This could make it more difficult for the project to recruit and retain new contributors, over the long term resulting in stagnation in article creation. Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because the [[wikt:low-hanging fruit|low-hanging fruit]], obvious articles like [[China]], already exist.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bostonreview.net/BR34.6/morozov.php |title=Edit This Page; Is it the end of Wikipedia |publisher=Boston review |author=Evgeny Morozov}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/weekinreview/29cohen.html New York Times]</ref>

In November 2009, a Ph.D thesis written by Felipe Ortega, a researcher at the [[Rey Juan Carlos University]] in Madrid, found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, the project lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/nov/26/wikipedia-losing-disgruntled-editors |title=Wikipedia falling victim to a war of words |publisher=Guardian |author=Jenny Kleeman | location=London | date=2009-11-26 | accessdate=2010-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://libresoft.es/Members/jfelipe/thesis-wkp-quantanalysis |title=Wikipedia: A quantitative analysis |format=PDF}}</ref> ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported that "unprecedented numbers of the millions of online volunteers who write, edit and police [Wikipedia] are quitting."

{{quote|Here, as in other human endeavours, it is evident that the active attention of many, when concentrated on one point, produces excellence. |Goethe, The Experiment as Mediator between Subject and Object, 1772}}

In departure from the style of traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia employs an open, "[[wiki]]" editing model. Except for a few particularly vandalism-prone pages, every article may be edited anonymously or with a user account, while only registered users may create a new article (only in the English edition). No article is owned by its creator or any other editor, or is vetted by any recognized authority; rather, the articles are agreed on by {{srlink|WP:CONSENSUS|consensus}}.<ref>[[Wikipedia:Ownership of articles]]</ref>

Importantly, when changes to an article are made, they usually become available immediately before undergoing any review, no matter if they contain an error, are somehow misguided, or even patent nonsense. The German and the Hungarian editions of Wikipedia are exceptions to this rule: the German Wikipedia has been testing a system of maintaining "stable versions" of articles,<ref>{{cite mailing list|first=P. |last=Birken |url=http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikide-l/2008-December/021594.html |title=Bericht Gesichtete Versionen |mailinglist=Wikide-l |date=2008-12-14 |language=German |publisher=Wikimedia Foundation |accessdate=2009-02-15}}</ref> to allow a reader to see versions of articles that have passed certain reviews. In June 2010, it was announced that the English Wikipedia would remove strict editing restrictions from "controversial" or vandalism-prone articles (such as [[George W. Bush]], [[David Cameron]] or [[homework]]) by using reviews.<ref>{{cite web| title = Wikimedia blog » Blog Archive » A quick update on Flagged Revisions| accessdate = 2009-08-30| url = http://blog.wikimedia.org/2009/08/26/a-quick-update-on-flagged-revisions/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Wikipedia:Flagged protection and patrolled revisions – Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia| accessdate = 2009-08-25| url = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Flagged_protection_and_patrolled_revisions#cite_ref-7}}</ref> In place of an editing prohibition for new or unregistered users, there would be a "new system, called 'pending changes'" which, [[Jimmy Wales]] told the [[BBC]], would enable the English Wikipedia "to open up articles for general editing that have been protected or semi-protected for years." The "pending changes" system was introduced on June 15, shortly after 11pm GMT. Edits to specified articles are now "subject to review from an established Wikipedia editor before publication." Wales opted against the German Wikipedia model of requiring editor review before edits to ''any'' article, describing it as "neither necessary nor desirable." He added that the administrators of the German Wikipedia were "going to be closely watching the English system, and I'm sure they'll at least consider switching if the results are good."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/10312095.stm "Wikipedia introduces edit mechanism for divisive pages"], Jonathan Frewin, BBC, June 15, 2010</ref>

[[File:History comparison example.png|thumb|left|alt=Web page showing side-by-side comparison of an article highlighting changed paragraphs.|[[Editor]]s keep track of changes to articles by checking the difference between two revisions of a page, displayed here in red.]]
Contributors, registered or not, can take advantage of features available in the software that powers Wikipedia. The "History" page attached to each article records every single past revision of the article, though a revision with libelous content, criminal threats or copyright infringements may be removed afterwards.<ref name="Torsten_Kleinz"/><ref>The [[Japanese Wikipedia]], for example, is known for deleting every mention of real names of victims of certain high-profile crimes, even though they may still be noted in other language editions.</ref> This feature makes it easy to compare old and new versions, undo changes that an editor considers undesirable, or restore lost content. The "Discussion" pages associated with each article are used to coordinate work among multiple editors.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.research.ibm.com/visual/papers/wikipedia_coordination_final.pdf|format=PDF|author=Fernanda B.

[[File:Wikipedia editing interface.png|thumb|right|The editing interface of Wikipedia.]]
Articles in Wikipedia are organized roughly in three ways according to: development status, subject matter and the access level required for editing. The most developed state of articles is called "featured article" status: articles labeled as such are the ones that will be featured in the main page of Wikipedia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2365/2182 |title=First Monday |publisher=First Monday |date= |accessdate=2010-07-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.research.ibm.com/visual/papers/hidden_order_wikipedia.pdf|author=Fernanda B.

A WikiProject is a place for a group of editors to coordinate work on a specific topic. The discussion pages attached to a project are often used to coordinate changes that take place across articles. Wikipedia also maintains a style guide called the [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] or MoS for short, which stipulates, for example, that, in the first sentence of any given article, the title of the article and any alternative titles should appear in bold.

=== Rules and laws governing content ===
For legal reasons, content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular [[copyright|copyright law]]) of [[Florida]], where Wikipedia servers are hosted. Beyond that, the Wikipedian editorial principles are embodied in the "{{srlink|WP:Five pillars|five pillars}}", and numerous {{srlink|Wikipedia:List of policies and guidelines|policies and guidelines}} are intended to shape the content appropriately. Even these rules are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors as a community write and revise those policies and guidelines<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/index.php/id;1866322157;fp;2;fpid;2 |title=Who's behind Wikipedia?|publisher=PC World |date=2008-02-06 |accessdate=2008-02-07}}</ref> and enforce them by deleting, annotating with tags, or modifying article materials failing to meet them. The rules on the non English editions of the Wikipedia branched off a translation of the rules on the English Wikipedia and have since diverged to some extent. While they still show broad-brush similarities, they differ in many details.

According to the rules on the English Wikipedia, each entry in Wikipedia to be worthy of inclusion must be about a topic that is [[wikt:encyclopedic|encyclopedic]] and is not a [[dictionary]] entry or dictionary-like.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:ISNOT |title=Wikipedia:ISNOT |accessdate=2010-04-01 |quote=Wikipedia is not a dictionary, usage, or jargon guide.}}</ref> A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of "[[Notability in Wikipedia|notability]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability |title=Wikipedia:Notability |accessdate=2008-02-13 |quote=A topic is presumed to be notable if it has received significant coverage in reliable secondary sources that are independent of the subject.}}</ref> which usually means that it must have received significant coverage in reliable secondary sources such as mainstream media or major academic journals that are independent of the subject of the topic. Further, Wikipedia must expose knowledge that is already established and recognized.<ref name=NOR>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research |title=Wikipedia:No original research |accessdate=2008-02-13|quote=Wikipedia does not publish original thought}}</ref> In other words, it must not present, for instance, new information or original works. A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source. Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as "verifiability, not truth" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability |title= Wikipedia:Verifiability |accessdate=2008-02-13 |quote=Material challenged or likely to be challenged, and all quotations, must be attributed to a reliable, published source.}}</ref> Finally, Wikipedia must not take a side.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view|title=Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view|accessdate=2008-02-13 |quote=All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view, representing significant views fairly, proportionately and without bias.}}</ref> All opinions and viewpoints, if attributable to external sources, must enjoy an appropriate share of coverage within an article.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/61365/?page=entire|title=Will Unethical Editing Destroy Wikipedia's Credibility?|author=Eric Haas|publisher=AlterNet.org|date=2007-10-26|accessdate=2008-12-26}}</ref> This is known as neutral point of view, or NPOV.

Wikipedia has many methods of settling disputes. A "bold, revert, discuss" cycle sometimes occurs, in which a user makes an edit, another user reverts it, and the matter is discussed on the appropriate talk page. In order to gain a broader community consensus, issues can be raised at the Village Pump, or a Request for Comment can be made soliciting other users' input. "Wikiquette Alerts" is a non-binding noticeboard where users can report impolite, uncivil, or other difficult communications with other editors.

Specialized forums exist for centralizing discussion on specific decisions, such as whether or not an article should be deleted. [[Mediation]] is sometimes used, although it has been deemed by some Wikipedians to be unhelpful for resolving particularly contentious disputes. The [[Wikipedia Arbitration Committee]] settles disputes when other methods fail. The ArbCom generally does not rule on the factual correctness of article content, although it sometimes enforces the "Neutral Point of View" policy. Statistical analyses suggest that Wikipedia's dispute resolution ignores the content of user disputes and focuses on user conduct instead, functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting users, but to weed out problematic users while weeding potentially productive users back in to participate. Its remedies include banning users from Wikipedia (used in 15.7% of cases), subject matter remedies (23.4%), article bans (43.3%) and cautions and [[probation]]s (63.2%). Total bans from Wikipedia are largely limited to instances of impersonation and [[anti-social behavior]]. Warnings tend to be issued for editing conduct and conduct that is anti-consensus, rather than anti-social.<ref>{{Cite document|title=Wikitruth through Wikiorder|url=http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/elj/59/59.1/Hoffman_Mehra.pdf|publisher=Emory Law Journal|volume=59|issue=1|year=2009|pages=151–210|author=Hoffman, David A.; Mehra, Salil K.|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

=== Content licensing ===
All text in Wikipedia was covered by [[GNU Free Documentation License]] (GFDL), a [[copyleft]] license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work,<ref>[[Wikipedia:Copyrights]]</ref> up until June 2009, when the site switched to [[Creative Commons]] Attribution-ShareAlike (CC-by-SA) 3.0.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.wikimedia.org/2009/05/21/wikimedia-community-approves-license-migration/ |title=Wikimedia community approves license migration |work=Wikimedia Foundation|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation |accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref> Wikipedia had been working on the switch to [[Creative Commons licenses]] because the GFDL, initially designed for software manuals, was not considered suitable{{Clarify|date=January 2011}} for online reference works and because the two licenses were incompatible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:License_update

The handling of media files (e.g., image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under [[fair use]] doctrine, while the others have opted not to. This is in part because of the difference in copyright laws between countries; for example, the notion of fair use does not exist in [[Japanese copyright law]]. Media files covered by [[free content]] licenses (e.g., Creative Commons' cc-by-sa) are shared across language editions via [[Wikimedia Commons]] repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation.

=== Reusing Wikipedia's content ===
Because Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can re-distribute it at no charge. The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside of the Wikipedia website.

Thousands of "[[mirror site]]s" exist that republish content from Wikipedia; two prominent ones, that also include content from other reference sources, are [[Reference.com]] and [[Answers.com]]. Another example is [[Wapedia]], which began to display Wikipedia content in a mobile-device-friendly format before Wikipedia itself did.

Some [[web search engine]]s also display content from Wikipedia on search results: examples include [[Bing.com]] (via technology gained from [[Powerset (company)|Powerset]])<ref>[http://www.bing.com/toolbox/blogs/search/archive/2009/07/27/researching-with-bing-reference.aspx Researching With Bing Reference]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}, Bing Community blog, July 27, 2009</ref> and [[Duck Duck Go]].

Some wikis, most notably Enciclopedia Libre and Citizendium, began as forks of Wikipedia content.

The website [[DBpedia]], begun in 2007, is a project that extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia and makes it available in a queriable [[Semantic Web|semantic]] format, [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]. The possibility has also been raised to have Wikipedia export its data directly in a semantic format, possibly by using the [[Semantic MediaWiki]] extension. Such an export of data could also help Wikipedia reuse its own data, both between articles on the same language Wikipedia and between different language Wikipedias.<ref>[http://technologyreview.com/web/25728/page2/ Wikipedia to Add Meaning to Its Pages], Tom Simonite, ''Technology Review'', July 7, 2010</ref>

Collections of Wikipedia articles have also been published on [[optical disk]]s. An English version, [[Wikipedia CD Selection|2006 Wikipedia CD Selection]], contained about 2,000 articles.<ref>"[http://www.wikipediaondvd.com/ Wikipedia on DVD]." Linterweb. Accessed June 1, 2007. "Linterweb is authorized to make a commercial use of the Wikipedia trademark restricted to the selling of the Encyclopedia CDs and DVDs."</ref><ref>"[http://www.wikipediaondvd.com/site.php?temp=buy Wikipedia 0.5 Available on a CD-ROM]."

"Wikipedia for Schools", the Wikipedia series of CDs/DVDs, produced by Wikipedians and [[SOS Children's Villages UK|SOS Children]], is a free, hand-checked, non-commercial selection from Wikipedia targeted around the [[National Curriculum (UK)|UK National Curriculum]] and intended to be useful for much of the English-speaking world.<ref>[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia CD Selection|Wikipedia CD Selection]]. Retrieved 8 September 2009.</ref> The project is available online; an equivalent print encyclopedia would require roughly 20 volumes.

There has also been an attempt to put a select subset of Wikipedia's articles into printed book form.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Wikipedia turned into book|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/5549589/Wikipedia-turned-into-book.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5jeCgQjpj|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|work=Telegraph.co.uk|date=2009-06-16|accessdate=2009-09-08|archivedate=2009-09-08 | location=London}}</ref><ref>[http://schools-wikipedia.org/ Wikipedia Selection for Schools].

However while access by human being is easy, obtaining the full content of Wikipedia for reuse is not. Direct cloning by the web bot is forbidden. Various dumps that should be a replacement contain no images and may be significantly out of date.<ref>[[Wikipedia:Database download|Wikipedia policies]] on data download</ref>

=== Defenses against undesirable edits ===
The open nature of the editing model has been central to most criticism of Wikipedia. For example, a reader of an article cannot be certain that it has not been compromised by the insertion of false information or the removal of essential information.<!-- eventually we have to merge this sentence with a paragraph on vandalism below. --> Former ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' editor-in-chief [[Robert McHenry]] once described this by saying:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caslon.com.au/wikiprofile1.htm |title=Caslon.com |publisher=Caslon.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-13}}</ref>

For example, in August 2007, the website [[WikiScanner]] began to trace the sources of changes made to Wikipedia by anonymous editors without Wikipedia accounts. The program revealed that many such edits were made by corporations or government agencies changing the content of articles related to them, their personnel or their work.<ref name="Seeing Corporate Fingerprints">{{Cite news

In practice, Wikipedia is defended from attack by multiple systems and techniques. These include users checking pages and edits (e.g. '[[Help:Watching pages|watchlist]]'s and '[[Help:Recent changes|recent changes]]'), computer programs ('bots') that are carefully designed to try to detect attacks and fix them automatically (or semi-automatically), filters that warn users making undesirable edits,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2009-03-23/Abuse_Filter |title=Wikipedia signpost: Abuse Filter is enabled |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date=2009-03-23 |accessdate=2010-07-13}}</ref> blocks on the creation of links to particular websites, blocks on edits from particular accounts, IP addresses or address ranges.

For heavily attacked pages, particular articles can be ''semi-protected'' so that only well established accounts can edit them,<ref>[[Protection policy#Semi-protection|English Wikipedia's semi-protection policy]]</ref> or for particularly contentious cases, locked so that only administrators are able to make changes.<ref>[[Wikipedia:Full protection|English Wikipedia's full protection policy]]</ref> Such locking is applied sparingly, usually for only short periods of time while attacks appear likely to continue.

=== Coverage of topics ===
{{See also|Notability in Wikipedia}}
[[File:Wikipedia content by subject.png|thumb|right|Pie chart of Wikipedia content by subject as of January 2008.<ref name=Kittur2009/>]]

Wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia. Since it has virtually unlimited disk space it can have far more topics than can be covered by any conventional print encyclopedias.<ref>[[Wikipedia:PAPER]]</ref> It also contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_censored |title=Wikipedia is not censored |publisher=Wikipedia |accessdate=2008-04-30}}</ref> It was made clear that this policy is not up for debate, and the policy has sometimes proved controversial. For instance, in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of [[Online petition on Wikipedia Muhammad article|Muhammad's depictions]] in its [[English Wikipedia|English edition]], citing this policy. The presence of politically sensitive materials in Wikipedia had also led the [[Blocking of Wikipedia by the People's Republic of China|People's Republic of China to block access]] to parts of the site.<ref name=Taylor>{{Cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idINIndia-32865420080405|title=China allows access to English Wikipedia|work=Reuters|author=Sophie Taylor|date=2008-04-05|accessdate=2008-07-29}}</ref> (See also: [[Internet Watch Foundation and Wikipedia|IWF block of Wikipedia]])

{{As of|2009|9}}, Wikipedia articles cover about half a million places on Earth. However, research conducted by the Oxford Internet Institute has shown that the geographic distribution of articles is highly uneven. Most articles are written about North America, Europe, and East Asia, with very little coverage of large parts of the developing world, including most of Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zerogeography.blogspot.com/2009/11/mapping-geographies-of-wikipedia.html |title=Mapping the Geographies of Wikipedia Content |work=Mark Graham Oxford Internet Institute|publisher=ZeroGeography |accessdate=2009-11-16}}</ref>

* Religions and belief systems: 2% (38%)
* Health: 2% (42%)

However, it must be considered that these numbers relate only to articles; it is possible that one topic contains a lot of short articles and another one quite large ones.

Furthermore, the exact coverage of Wikipedia is under constant review by the editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see also [[deletionism and inclusionism in Wikipedia|deletionism and inclusionism]]).<ref>{{Cite news|title=The battle for Wikipedia's soul |url=http://www.economist.com/printedition/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10789354 |publisher=The Economist|date=2008-03-06 |accessdate=2008-03-07 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3354752/Wikipedia-an-online-encyclopedia-torn-apart.html|title=Wikipedia: an online encyclopedia torn apart |date=2007-11-10|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2010-11-23|location=London|first=Ian|last=Douglas}}</ref>

=== Quality ===
Because contributors usually rewrite small portions of an entry rather than making full-length revisions, high- and low-quality content may be intermingled within an entry. Critics sometimes argue that non-expert editing undermines quality. For example, historian [[Roy Rosenzweig]] claimed that: "Overall, writing is the [[Achilles' heel]] of Wikipedia. Committees rarely write well, and Wikipedia entries often have a choppy quality that results from the stringing together of sentences or paragraphs written by different people."<ref name=Rosenzweig>{{cite web

Economist [[Tyler Cowen]] writes, "If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true, after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia." He comments that many traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases. Novel results are over-reported in journal articles, and relevant information is omitted from news reports. However, he also cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites, and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tnr.com/story.html?id=82eb5d70-13bd-4086-9ec0-cb0e9e8411b3

He also said that "a generation of intellectual sluggards incapable of moving beyond the Internet" was being produced at universities. He complains that the web-based sources are discouraging students from learning from the more rare texts which are either found only on paper or are on subscription-only web sites. In the same article Jenny Fry (a research fellow at the [[Oxford Internet Institute]]) commented on academics who cite Wikipedia, saying that: "You cannot say children are intellectually lazy because they are using the Internet when academics are using search engines in their research. The difference is that they have more experience of being critical about what is retrieved and whether it is authoritative. Children need to be told how to use the Internet in a critical and appropriate way."<ref name="stothart" />

Speaking at a conference in Pennsylvania, Wales said he receives about ten e-mails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited Wikipedia. According to ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' of London, Wales told the students they got what they deserved.

As Wikipedia grows with an unconventional model of encyclopedia building, "Who writes Wikipedia?" has become one of the questions frequently asked on the project, often with a reference to other Web 2.0 projects such as [[Digg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viktoria.se/altchi/submissions/submission_edchi_1.pdf |title=Power of the Few vs. Wisdom of the Crowd: Wikipedia and the Rise of the Bourgeoisie |first=Aniket |last=Kittur |format=PDF | accessdate =2008-02-23}}</ref> Jimmy Wales once argued that only "a community ... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore "much like any traditional organization." Wales performed a study finding that over 50% of all the edits are done by just 0.7% of the users (at the time: 524 people). This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by [[Aaron Swartz]], who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia |title=Raw Thought: Who Writes Wikipedia? |first=Aaron |last=Swartz |date=2006-09-04 |accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref> A 2007 study by researchers from [[Dartmouth College]] found that "anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia ... are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site."<ref>{{Cite news

In a 2003 study of Wikipedia as a community, economics [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low [[transaction cost]]s of participating in [[wiki]] software create a catalyst for collaborative development, and that a "creative construction" approach encourages participation.<ref>

Wikipedians sometimes award one another [[barnstar]]s for good work. These personalized tokens of appreciation reveal a wide range of valued work extending far beyond simple editing to include social support, administrative actions, and types of articulation work. The barnstar phenomenon has been analyzed by researchers seeking to determine what implications it might have for other communities engaged in large-scale collaborations.<ref>{{Cite document|title=Articulations of wikiwork: uncovering valued work in wikipedia through barnstars|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1460563.1460573|publisher=Proceedings of the ACM|author=T Kriplean, I Beschastnikh, et al|year=2008|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

60% of registered users never make another edit after their first 24 hours.

Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs; the contributor is expected to build a user page, learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to an arcane dispute resolution process, and learn a "baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references." Non-logged-in users are in some sense second-class citizens on Wikipedia,<ref>{{Cite document|title=Wikipedia's Labor Squeeze and its Consequences|publisher=Journal on Telecommunications and High Technology Law|author=Goldman, Eric|volume=8|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> as "participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation,"<ref>{{Cite document|title=Wikipedia and the Future of Legal Education|author=Noveck, Beth Simone|publisher=Journal of Legal Education|volume=57|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> but the contribution histories of IP addresses cannot necessarily with any certainty be credited to, or blamed upon, a particular user.

== Operation ==
=== Wikimedia Foundation and the Wikimedia chapters ===
[[File:Wikimedia Foundation RGB logo with text.svg|thumb|upright|[[Wikimedia Foundation]] logo]]
Wikipedia is hosted and funded by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], a non-profit organization which also operates Wikipedia-related projects such as [[Wiktionary]] and [[Wikibooks]]. The Wikimedia chapters, local associations of users and supporters of the Wikimedia projects, also participate in the promotion, the development, and the funding of the project.

=== Software and hardware ===
The operation of Wikipedia depends on [[MediaWiki]], a custom-made, [[free software|free]] and [[open source software|open source]] [[wiki software]] platform written in [[PHP]] and built upon the [[MySQL]] database.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nedworks.org/~mark/presentations/san/Wikimedia%20architecture.pdf |format=PDF|title=Wikimedia Architecture |author=Mark Bergman |publisher=Wikimedia Foundation Inc. |accessdate=2008-06-27}}</ref> The software incorporates programming features such as a [[Macro (computer science)|macro language]], [[variable (programming)|variables]], a [[transclusion]] system for [[Web template|templates]], and [[URL redirection]]. MediaWiki is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally, Wikipedia ran on [[UseModWiki]] written in [[Perl]] by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required [[CamelCase]] for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a [[PhpWiki|PHP wiki]] engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the [[Exponential growth|exponentially increasing]] demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by [[Lee Daniel Crocker]].
Several MediaWiki extensions are installed<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Version#Installed_extensions
|title=Version: Installed extensions}}</ref> to extend the functionality of MediaWiki software.
In April 2005 a [[Lucene]] extension<ref>{{cite web

In January 2005, the project ran on 39 [[Dedicated hosting service|dedicated servers]] in Florida. This configuration included a single master [[database server]] running [[MySQL]], multiple slave database servers, 21 [[web server]]s running the [[Apache HTTP Server]], and seven [[Squid (software)|Squid cache]] servers.

Wikipedia receives between 25,000 and 60,000 page requests per second, depending on time of day.<ref>"[[tools:~leon/stats/reqstats/reqstats-monthly.png|Monthly request statistics]]," Wikimedia. Retrieved on 2008-10-31.</ref> Page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of [[Squid (software)|Squid caching]] servers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dammit.lt/uc/workbook2007.pdf |format=PDF|title=Wikipedia: Site internals, configuration, code examples and management issues |author=Domas Mituzas |publisher=MySQL Users Conference 2007 |accessdate=2008-06-27}}</ref> Further statistics are available based on a publicly available 3-months Wikipedia access trace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globule.org/publi/WWADH_comnet2009.html |title=Wikipedia Workload Analysis for Decentralized Hosting |author=Guido Urdaneta, Guillaume Pierre and Maarten van Steen |publisher=Elsevier Computer Networks 53(11), pp. 1830–1845, June 2009}}</ref> Requests that cannot be served from the Squid cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the [[Linux Virtual Server]] software, which in turn pass the request to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database. The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses. Two larger clusters in the Netherlands and Korea now handle much of Wikipedia's traffic load.

=== Mobile access{{anchor|Wikipedia mobile access|Wikipedia mobile}} ===
Wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard [[web browser]] through a fixed [[internet access|internet connection]]. However, Wikipedia content is now also accessible through the [[mobile web]].

Access to Wikipedia from [[mobile phone]]s was possible as early as 2004, through the [[Wireless Application Protocol]] (WAP), via the [[Wapedia]] service. In June 2007, Wikipedia launched [http://en.mobile.wikipedia.org/ en.mobile.wikipedia.org], an official website for wireless devices. In 2009 a newer mobile service was officially released,<ref>{{cite web|title=Wikimedia Mobile is Officially Launched|url=http://techblog.wikimedia.org/2009/06/wikimedia-mobile-launch/|date=2009-06-30|work=Wikimedia Technical Blog|accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref> located at [http://en.m.wikipedia.org/ en.m.wikipedia.org], which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the [[iPhone]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]]-based devices, or the [[Palm Pre]]. Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged (See {{srlink|Help:Mobile access}}). Several devices and applications optimise or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia [[metadata]] (See {{srlink|Wikipedia:Metadata}}), such as [[geoinformation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/articles/comments/15802/ |title=iPhone Gems: Wikipedia Apps |date=30 November 2008 |accessdate=22 July 2008 }}</ref>

== Language editions ==
{{See also|List of Wikipedias}}
[[File:PercentWikipediasGraph.png|thumb|right|Percentage of all Wikipedia articles in English (red) and top ten largest language editions (blue). As of July 2007, less than 23% of Wikipedia articles are in English.]]

There are currently 262 [[List of Wikipedias|language editions (or language versions) of Wikipedia]]; of these, 3, the English, German, and French Wikipedias have over 1 million articles, 24 have over 100,000 articles and 81 have over 1,000 articles.<ref name="ListOfWikipedias">{{cite web| url = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Statistics | title = Statistics | publisher = [[English Wikipedia]] | accessdate = 2008-06-21 }}</ref> The largest, the English Wikipedia, has {{NUMBEROFARTICLES}} articles. According to Alexa, the English [[subdomain]] (en.wikipedia.org; [[English Wikipedia]]) receives approximately 54% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining split among the other languages (Japanese: 10%, German: 8%, Spanish: 5%, Russian: 4%, French: 4%, Italian: 3%).<ref name="AlexaStats" /> As of July 2008, the five largest language editions are (in order of article count) [[English Wikipedia|English]], [[German Wikipedia|German]], [[French Wikipedia|French]], [[Polish Wikipedia|Polish]], and [[Japanese Wikipedia]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Multilingual_statistics |title=Wikipedia:Multilingual statistics |publisher=English Wikipedia |accessdate=2007-12-23}}</ref>

Since Wikipedia is web-based and therefore worldwide, contributors of a same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the [[English Wikipedia|English edition]]). These differences may lead to some conflicts over [[American and British English spelling differences|spelling differences]], (e.g. ''color'' vs. ''colour'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Spelling|title= spelling | work = Manual of Style | publisher = Wikipedia |accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref> or points of view.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias|title=Countering systemic bias|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref>
Though the various language editions are held to global policies such as "neutral point of view," they diverge on some points of policy and practice, most notably on whether images that are not [[free content|licensed freely]] may be used under a claim of [[fair use]].<ref>{{cite web

Jimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as "an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language."<ref>[[Jimmy Wales]], "[http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2005-March/020469.html Wikipedia is an encyclopedia]," March 8, 2005, <Wikipedia-l@wikimedia.org></ref> Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all of its projects (Wikipedia and others).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/|title=Meta-Wiki|accessdate=2009-03-24|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation}}</ref> For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Statistics|title=Meta-Wiki Statistics|accessdate=2008-03-24|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation}}</ref> and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have|title=List of articles every Wikipedia should have|accessdate=2008-03-24|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation}}</ref> The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, foodstuffs, and mathematics. As for the rest, it is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might only be available in English.

Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because automated translation of articles is disallowed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Translations |title=Wikipedia: Translation |work=English Wikipedia |accessdate=2007-02-03}}</ref> Articles available in more than one language may offer "[[Interwiki links]]", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions.

In July 2007, Wikipedia was the focus of a 30-minute documentary on [[BBC Radio 4]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/pip/efv21/|title=Radio 4 Documentary |accessdate=2008-12-26}}</ref> which argued that, with increased usage and awareness, the number of references to Wikipedia in popular culture is such that the term is one of a select band of 21st-century nouns that are so familiar ([[Google]], [[Facebook]], [[YouTube]]) that they no longer need explanation and are on a par with such 20th-century terms as [[The Hoover Company|Hoovering]] or [[Coca-Cola]]. Many parody Wikipedia's openness, with characters vandalizing or modifying the online encyclopedia project's articles. Notably, comedian [[Stephen Colbert]] has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' and coined the related term "[[wikiality]]."<ref name="wikiality" />

On September 28, 2007, Italian politician [[Franco Grillini]] raised a parliamentary question with the Minister of Cultural Resources and Activities about the necessity of [[Panoramafreiheit|freedom of panorama]].

Some media sources satirize Wikipedia's susceptibility to inserted inaccuracies. An example can be found in a front-page article in ''[[The Onion]]'' in July 2006, with the title "Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/content/node/50902 |title=Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years Of American Independence |accessdate=October 15, 2006 |year=2006 |work=[[The Onion]]}}</ref> Others draw upon Wikipedia's motto, such as in "[[The Negotiation]]," an episode of ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', where character [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] says "Wikipedia is the best thing ever. Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information." "[[My Number One Doctor]]", a 2007 episode of the TV show ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', also lampooned Wikipedia's reliance on editors who edit both scholarly and pop culture articles with a scene in which Dr. [[Perry Cox]] reacts to a patient who says that a Wikipedia article indicates that the [[raw food diet]] reverses the effects of [[bone cancer]] by retorting that the same editor who wrote that article also wrote the [[List of Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) episodes|''Battlestar Galactica'' episode guide]].<ref>Bakken, Janae. "[[My Number One Doctor]]"; ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]''; [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]; December 6, 2007</ref>

In July 2009, [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast a comedy series called ''[[Bigipedia]]'', which was set on a website which was a [[parody]] of Wikipedia. Some of the sketches were directly inspired by Wikipedia and its articles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/radio/bigipedia/interview/|title=Interview With Nick Doody and Matt Kirshen|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|accessdate=31 July 2009}}</ref>

A number of interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]], which included text (entered on [[BBC Micro]] computers) and photographs from over 1 million contributors in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], and covering the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user-interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008.<ref name="Domesday Project">[http://www.domesday1986.com/ Website discussing the emulator of the Domesday Project User Interface] for the data from the Community Disc (contributions from the general public); the site is currently out of action following the death of its creator</ref> One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was [[h2g2]], which was created by [[Douglas Adams]] and is run by the [[BBC]]. The h2g2 encyclopedia was relatively light-hearted, focusing on articles which were both witty and informative. Both of these projects had similarities with Wikipedia, but neither gave full editorial privileges to public users. A similar non-wiki project, the [[GNUPedia]] project, co-existed with Nupedia early in its history; however, it has been retired and its creator, [[free software]] figure [[Richard Stallman]], has lent his support to Wikipedia.<ref name="stallman1999" />

Wikipedia has also spawned several sister projects, which are also run by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. The first, "In Memoriam: September<!--Do not reformat this date, it is quoted--> 11 Wiki,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sep11memories.org/wiki/In_Memoriam |title=In Memoriam: September 11, 2001 |accessdate=2007-02-06}}</ref> created in October 2002,<ref>[http://www.sep11memories.org/index.php?title=In_Memoriam&oldid=1502 First edit to the wiki] In Memoriam: September 11 wiki (October 28, 2002),</ref> detailed the [[September 11 attacks]]; this project was closed in October 2006. [[Wiktionary]], a dictionary project, was launched in December 2002;<ref>"[http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikimedia_News&diff=prev&oldid=4133 Announcement of Wiktionary's creation]," December 12, 2002. Retrieved on 2007-02-02.</ref> [[Wikiquote]], a collection of quotations, a week after Wikimedia launched, and [[Wikibooks]], a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts. Wikimedia has since started a number of other projects, including [[Wikiversity]], a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities.<ref name="OurProjects">"[http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Our_projects Our projects]," [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. Retrieved on 2007-01-24</ref> None of these sister projects, however, has come to meet the success of Wikipedia.

Several languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk, where volunteers answer questions from the general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the Journal of Documentation, the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library reference desk, with an accuracy of 55%.<ref>"[http://www.slis.indiana.edu/news/story.php?story_id=2064 Wikipedia Reference Desk]," fetched 17 February 2010</ref>

Other websites centered on collaborative [[knowledge base]] development have drawn inspiration from or inspired Wikipedia. Some, such as [[Susning.nu]], [[Enciclopedia Libre Universal en Español|Enciclopedia Libre]], [[Hudong]], [[Baidu Baike]], and [[WikiZnanie]] likewise employ no formal review process, whereas others use more traditional [[peer review]], such as [[Encyclopedia of Life]], [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], [[Scholarpedia]], [[h2g2]], and [[Everything2]].
