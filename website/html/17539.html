'''IGOR Pro''' is a [[Science|scientific]] data analysis software, numerical computing environment and programming language  that runs on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] or [[Mac OS X|Mac]] operating systems. It is developed by [[WaveMetrics|WaveMetrics Inc.]], and was originally aimed at [[time series]] analysis, but has since then evolved and covers other applications such as [[curve fitting]] and [[image processing]]. It comes with a comprehensive [[programming language]] with [[compiler]], but many functions are also accessible through [[Menu (computing)|menus]]. IGOR Pro's strengths include its graphics capabilities, and the possibility of extending the built-in functions with external operations (XOP) allowing [[data acquisition]], manipulation and analysis features, communication with external devices and in principle any other task that can be programmed in [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[C++]].

== Community ==

Complementing the professional development and support provided by WaveMetrics, a broad community of users and enthusiast provide user-to-user support  through a mailing list and IgorExchange, a collaborative web site sponsored by WaveMetrics which main features are a forum and places where programmers can share extensions, complete projects or "code snippets".
