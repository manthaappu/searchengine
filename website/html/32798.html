On some [[Unix-like]] platforms, '''SIGEMT''' is the [[Signal (computing)|signal]] sent to [[computer program]]s when an [[emulator]] trap occurs. The [[C preprocessor|symbolic constant]] for SIGEMT is defined in <code>signal.h</code>. Symbolic signal names are used because signal numbers can vary across platforms.

==Etymology==
''SIG'' is a common [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] for signal names. ''EMT'' is an [[abbreviation]] for ''emulator trap''; it is the name of an instruction on the highly influential [[PDP-11]] architecture.

==Usage==
{{Expand section|date=January 2007}}
On the PDP-11 architecture, EMT, TRAP, BPT and IOT were instructions used for program traps. EMT was for system software, TRAP for programmer use, BPT for [[debugging]], and IOT for [[input/output|I/O]] routines. Currently EMT does not have a standardised usage.

[[Solaris Operating System|Solaris]] sends SIGEMT to new [[lightweight process]]es to enable them to reset hardware performance counters.<ref>{{cite web
