<html> <head> <title>Alternative terms for free software</title></head><body>'''Alternative terms for free software''' have been a controversial issue among [[free software]] users from the late 1990s onwards.  Coined in 1983 by [[Richard Stallman]], "free software" is used to describe [[software]] which can be used, modified, and redistributed with little or no restriction.  These freedoms are formally described in [[The Free Software Definition]], first published in February 1986.<ref name=bull6>{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull1.txt|title=GNU's Bulletin, Volume 1 Number 1, page 8}}</ref>

Alternatives for "free software" were sought for marketing purposes and because of a perceived "moralising and confrontational" attitude that had been associated with the term.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opensource.org/history|title=History of OSI|quote=conferees decided it was time to dump the moralizing and confrontational attitude that had been associated with "free software" in the past and sell the idea strictly on the same pragmatic, business-case grounds}}</ref> In addition, the "available at no cost" ambiguity of the word "free" was seen as discouraging business adoption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html|title=Goodbye, "free software"; hello, "open source"|quote=The problem with it is twofold. First, ... the term "free" is very ambiguous ... Second, the term makes a lot of corporate types nervous.}}</ref>  In a 1998 strategy session in [[California]], "[[open source software]]" was selected by [[Todd Anderson]], [[Larry Augustin]], [[Jon "maddog" Hall|Jon Hall]], [[Sam Ockman]], [[Christine Peterson]], and [[Eric S. Raymond]].<ref>{{cite web

Those at the meeting described "open source" as a "replacement label" for free software <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html|title=Goodbye, "free software"; hello, "open source"|author=[[Eric Raymond]]|quote=we have a problem with the term "free software" ... we came up with a replacement label we all liked: "open source".
}}</ref> and [[Open Source Initiative]] was soon-after founded by Eric Raymond and [[Bruce Perens]] to promote the term as part of "a marketing program for free software".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060423094434/www.opensource.org/advocacy/faq.html|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Open Source Initiative|quote=How is "open source" related to "free software"?  The Open Source Initiative is a marketing program for free software.}}</ref>  Stallman and others object to the term "open source software" because it does not make people think of the freedoms that the software in question gives users.

Each of the terms "free software" and "open source software" has fans and critics. Partly because of the failure to adopt one specific term, other terms have been proposed.  These include "Software Libre" (or libre software), "FLOSS" (Free/Libre/Open Source Software), and "FOSS" (or F/OSS, [[Free and open source software|Free and Open Source Software]]). These terms share almost identical licence criteria and development practices.

== FOSS and F/OSS ==

{{Main|Free and open source software}}
The first known use of the phrase "free open source software" on [[Usenet]] was in a posting on 18 March 1998, just a month after the term "open source" itself was coined.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/groups/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&num=10&q=%22free+open+source+software%22&safe=off&qt_s=Search&as_drrb=b&as_mind=1&as_minm=1&as_miny=1981&as_maxd=1&as_maxm=6&as_maxy=1998
|title=Posting re "free open source software", 18 March 1998.}}</ref>
In February 2002, "F/OSS" appeared on a [[Usenet]] newsgroup dedicated to [[Amiga]] [[computer games]].<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://groups.google.com/group/comp.sys.amiga.games/msg/4a192ea899e10c55
|title=using m$ products is supporting them :(}}</ref>  In early 2002, [[MITRE]] used the term "FOSS" in what would later be their 2003 report ''[[Use of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) in the U.S. Department of Defense]].''

== FLOSS ==

"FLOSS" was used in 2001 as a project acronym by [[Rishab Aiyer Ghosh]] as an acronym for ''free/libre/open source software''. Later that year, the [[European Commission]] (EC) used the phrase when they funded a study on the topic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flossproject.org/|title=Free/Libre and Open Source Software: Survey and Study}}</ref>

Unlike "libre software", which aimed to solve the ambiguity problem, "FLOSS" aimed to avoid taking sides in the debate over whether it was better to say "free software" or to say "open source software".

Proponents of the term point out that parts of the FLOSS acronym can be translated into other languages, with for example the "F" representing ''free'' (English) or ''frei'' (German), and the "L" representing ''libre'' (Spanish or French), ''livre'' (Portuguese), or ''libero'' (Italian), and so on. However, this term is not often used in official, non-English, documents, since the words in these languages for "free as in freedom" do not have the ambiguity problem of English's "free".

By the end of 2004, the FLOSS acronym had been used in official English documents issued by South Africa,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naci.org.za/floss/index.html|title=Free/Libre and Open Source Software and Open Standards in South Africa: A Critical Issue for Addressing the Digital Divide|publisher=National Advisory Council on Innovation}}</ref> Spain,<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/1637/470|title=FLOSS deployment in Extremadura, Spain}}</ref> and Brazil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.softwarelivre.org/news/1727|title=Relatório da ONU aponta o Software Livre (FLOSS) como melhor}}</ref>

Richard Stallman endorses the term FLOSS to refer to "open source" and "free software" without necessarily choosing between the two camps, however, he asks people to consider supporting the "free software" camp.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/rms-interview-edinburgh.html|title=Interview with Richard Stallman, Edinburgh, 2004
|publisher=Free Software Foundation}}</ref> Stallman has suggested that the term "unfettered software" would be an appropriate, non-ambiguous replacement, but that he would not push for it because there was too much momentum and too much effort behind the term "free software".

== Software Libre==

"Software Libre" was first used publicly in 2000, by the [[European Commission]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eu.conecta.it/|title=European Working Group on Software Libre}}</ref>  The word "libre", borrowed from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]] languages, means having liberty.  This avoids the freedom/cost ambiguity of the [[English language|English]] word "free".

==Non-English terms in anglophone regions==

The [[free software community]] in [[India]] sometimes uses the term "[[wikt:Swatantra|Swatantra]] software" since the term "Swatantra" means free in [[Sanskrit]], which is the ancestor of all [[Indo-European Languages]] of India, including [[Hindi]], despite [[English language|English]] being the [[lingua franca]].<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.fsf.org.in/
|title=FSF-India's homepage
|quote=Think of it as swatantra software
}}</ref>

In [[The Philippines]], "malayang software" is sometimes used.  The word "libre" exists in the [[Filipino language]], and it came from the Spanish language, but has acquired the same cost/freedom ambiguity of the English word "free".<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://archives.free.net.ph/message/20020628.083546.ed5f57f6.en.html
|title=Re: Free Software, some thoughts
|quote=My suspicion is that if RMS were Filipino, he would have used Malayang Software to avoid the confusion regarding economics v. liberty.
}}</ref>

==Ownership and attachments==

None of these terms, or the term "free software" itself, have been trademarked. [[Bruce Perens]] of OSI attempted to register "open source" as a [[service mark]] for OSI in the [[United States of America]], but that attempt failed to meet the relevant [[trademark]] standards of specificity. OSI claims a trademark on "OSI Certified", and applied for trademark registration, but did not complete the paperwork.  The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] labels it as "abandoned".<ref>{{cite web

|title=Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS)
|quote=(Direct link not possible, site search required) Word Mark: OSI CERTIFIED ... Goods and Services: (ABANDONED) IC A . US A . G & S: software licensed under open source licenses. ... Serial Number: 76020694 ... Owner: (APPLICANT) Open Source Initiative ... Live/Dead Indicator: DEAD
}}</ref>

While the term "free software" is associated with FSF's definition, and the term "open source software" is associated with OSI's definition, the other terms have not been claimed by any group in particular.  FSF's and OSI's definitions are worded quite differently but the set of software that they cover is almost identical.<ref>{{cite web

|quote=(javascript slide #3)When I say "Open Source", I mean the same thing as Free Software.
}}</ref>

All of the terms are used interchangeably, the choice of which to use is mostly political (wanting to support a certain group) or practical (thinking that one term is the clearest).

==Licenses==
The choice of term has little or no impact on which licences are valid.  The vast majority of software referred to by these terms is distributed under a small set of licences, all of which are unambiguously accepted by the various de facto and de jure guardians of each of these terms.  50-70% of this software is under the [[GNU General Public License]], and most of the rest is distributed under the terms of the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]], the [[BSD licenses]], the [[Mozilla Public License]], the [[MIT License]], and the [[Apache License]], each with a share of between 2% and 10%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html|title=Make Your Open Source Software GPL-Compatible. Or Else.}}</ref>

The [[Free Software Foundation]] and the [[Open Source Initiative]] each publish lists of licenses that they accept as complying with their definitions of free software and open source software respectively.

*[[List of FSF approved software licenses]]
*[[List of OSI approved software licenses]]

Apart from these two organisations, the [[Debian]] project is seen by some to provide useful advice on whether particular licences comply with their [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]].  Debian does not publish a list of "approved" licences, but its judgments can be tracked by checking what licences are used by software they have allowed into their distribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.debian.org/legal/licenses/|title=License information|publisher=Debian}}</ref>  In addition, the [[Fedora Project]] does provide a list of approved licenses (for Fedora) based on approval of the Free Software Foundation (FSF), the Open Source Initiative (OSI), and consultation with Red Hat Legal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing/|title=Licensing|publisher=Fedora}}</ref>

There is also a class of software that is covered by the names discussed in this article, but which doesn't have a licence: software for which the source code is in the [[public domain]].  The use of such source code, and therefore the executable version, is not restricted by copyright and therefore does not need a [[free software licence]] to make it free software.
