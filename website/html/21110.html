<html> <head> <title>Land grading</title></head><body>[[File:Section through railway track and foundation.png|520px|thumb|right|Section through railway track and foundation showing the sub-grade.]]'''Grading''' in civil engineering and construction is the work of ensuring a level base, or one with a specified [[Grade (slope)|slope]], for a construction work such as a [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]], the [[base course]] for a [[road]] or a [[Rail tracks|railway]], or [[landscape]] and [[garden]] improvements, or surface drainage.  The earthworks created for such a purpose are often called the '''sub-grade''' or '''finished contouring'''  (see diagram).

==Transportation==
In the case of [[gravel road]]s and [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]] for certain purposes, grading forms not just the base but the cover and surface of the finished construction, and is often called '''finished grade'''.

==Environmental design==
In the [[environmental design]] professions grading is a specifications and construction component in [[landscape design]], [[landscape architecture]], and [[architecture]] projects. It is used for buildings or outdoor amenities regarding [[Foundation (architecture)|foundations and footings]],  [[Grade (slope)|slope]] [[Terrace (agriculture)|terracing]] and stabilizing, aesthetic contouring, and directing [[surface runoff]] drainage of [[stormwater]] and domestic/irrigation runoff flows.
