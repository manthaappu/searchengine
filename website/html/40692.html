'''XML Pretty Printers''' are a type of [[Prettyprint]] or code beautifier that specifically improve the readability of [[XML]].  XML as a standard is designed to be human readable, but is sometimes generated by a computer as tightly compressed or compacted, and hence more difficult to read and edit.  Running the XML file through a pretty printer will improve its readability and editability.
