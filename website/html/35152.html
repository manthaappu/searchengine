'''Source''' is a [[game engine|3D game engine]] developed by [[Valve Corporation]]. It debuted in June 2004 with ''[[Counter-Strike: Source]]'' and shortly thereafter ''[[Half-Life 2]]''. Other notable games using the engine include first-person shooter ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'', the physics sandbox ''[[Garry's Mod]]'', first-person action RPG games ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines]]'' and ''[[Dark Messiah of Might and Magic]]'', the first-person puzzle game ''[[Portal]]'', first-person [[beat-em-up]] ''[[Zeno Clash]]'' and the [[MMORPG]] ''[[Vindictus]]'' developed by [[Nexon]].

|quote=''Since they licensed and integrated it into Source, Valve have been tweaking and adding to Havok to the point it's virtually a new animal. Almost every aspect of the Source engine follows on from the physics — including the sound, graphics, AI and animation. When asked whether or not they would be upgrading to Havok 2, Valve seemed to suggest they probably wouldn't, in part because H2 wouldn't be much of a step forward from what they currently have.

== Modularity and notable upgrades ==

Source was created to evolve incrementally as technology moves onwards, as opposed to the [[backwards compatibility]]-breaking "version jumps" of its competitors. With [[Steam (software)|Steam]], Valve can distribute automatic updates with new versions of the engine among its many users.

In practice however, there have been occasional breaks in this chain of compatibility. The release of [[Half-Life 2: Episode One]] and [[The Orange Box]] both introduced new versions of the engine that could not be used to run older games or [[mod (computer gaming)|mods]] without the developers performing upgrades to code and, in some cases, content. But both times the work required to move from the older version to the newer was significantly less than what one might have come to expect from other engines - as was demonstrated in 2010, when Valve updated all of their core Source games to the very latest engine build.<ref name="vdc_src2009">{{cite web|title=Source 2009|url=http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_2009#Availability|work=Valve Developer Community|accessdate=17 September 2010}}</ref>

; [[High dynamic range rendering]] (2005, [[Day of Defeat: Source]])
: Simulation of a camera [[aperture]] and the ability to fake the effects of brightness values beyond computer monitors' actual range. Required all of the game's shaders to be rewritten.<ref name="hdr_shaders">{{cite video game|title=[[Half-Life 2: Lost Coast]]|developer=[[Valve Corporation]] |year=2005|platform=PC|quote='''Chris Green''': The Source engine supports a wide variety of shaders. The refraction shader on the window here requires us to copy the scene to a texture, refract it, and then apply it the window surface. To fully support HDR, every shader in the engine needed to be updated, so this refraction shader was improved to the support the full range of contrast.}}</ref>

; [[Mac OS X]] support (2010)
: Starting in April 2010, Valve has announced the availability of [[OpenGL]] rendered [[Left 4 Dead]], [[Left 4 Dead 2]], [[Team Fortress 2]], [[Counter-Strike: Source]], [[Portal (video game)|Portal]], [[Day of Defeat: Source]], and the [[Half-Life (series)|Half-Life series]] on [[Mac OS X]].

== Future technology ==

=== Cloth ===

[[Dota 2]] will introduce [[Soft body dynamics#Cloth simulation|cloth simulation]].<ref name="dota2-announce">{{cite web|title=Valve's New Game Announced, Detailed: Dota 2|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/10/13/dota-2-announced-details.aspx|publisher=[[GameInformer]]|date=13 October 2010|accessdate=14 December 2010}}</ref>

=== Source Filmmaker ===
The tool used to create [[Team Fortress 2]]'s "Meet the Team" videos as well as [[Left 4 Dead]]'s introduction videos is the ''Source Filmmaker'', a video capture and editing application that works from inside the engine.<ref name="vdc_filmmaker">{{cite web|url=http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_Filmmaker|title=Source Filmmaker|work=Valve Developer Community|accessdate=August 4, 2009}}</ref> It allows users to record themselves many times over in the same scene, creating the illusion of many participants, as well as supporting a wide range of [[cinematographic]] effects and techniques such as [[motion blur]], [[Tyndall effect]]s, Dynamic Lighting, and [[depth of field]]. (Motion blur has now been added to the games themselves, though only when the view is moving at high speeds&mdash;not per-object as in the film-maker.) It also allows manual animation of bones and facial features, allowing the user to create scenes that can't happen in-game. This tool is expected to be released to the public upon release of the final "Meet the Team" video.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Currently this tool can be found in the very first release of Team Fortress 2, but there is no official support for it.

=== Image-Based Rendering ===

[[Image-based modeling and rendering|Image-based rendering]] technology had been in development for [[Half-Life 2]]<ref name="driverheaven-2003">{{cite web | url=http://www.driverheaven.net/dhinterviews/gabenewell/ | title=Interview with Gabe Newell | work=DriverHeaven.net | accessdate=2009-11-21 }}</ref> but was cut from the engine before its release. It was mentioned again by [[Gabe Newell]] in 2006 as a piece of technology he would like to add to his company's engine in order for them to support far larger scenes than are possible with strictly [[polygon (computer graphics)|polygonal]] objects.<ref name="1up-valveweek">{{cite web|url=http://valve.1up.com/|work=[[1UP.com]]|title=Valve Week| accessdate = 2006-07-14}}</ref>

== Origins ==

[[File:Zeno Clash - Fight.jpg|thumb|Screenshot from ''[[Zeno Clash]]'', a third-party Source game.]]

Source distantly originates from the [[GoldSrc]] engine, itself a heavily modified version of the [[QuakeWorld]] iteration of [[John D. Carmack]]'s [[Quake engine]], as is explained by Valve employee Erik Johnson on the [[Valve Developer Community]]:<ref name="goldsrc-src-quote">{{cite web|url=http://developer.valvesoftware.com/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Erik_Johnson&oldid=10088#GoldSource|title=Talk:Erik Johnson|work=Valve Developer Community|author=Erik Johnson|date=2005-09-01|accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref>

<blockquote>When we were getting very close to releasing ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' (less than a week or so), we found there were already some projects that we needed to start working on, but we couldn't risk checking in code to the shipping version of the game. At that point we [[fork (software development)|forked]] off the code in [[Microsoft Visual SourceSafe|VSS]] to be both <code>$/Goldsrc</code> and <code>/$Src</code>. Over the next few years, we used these terms internally as "Goldsource" and "Source". At least initially, the Goldsrc branch of code referred to the codebase that was currently released, and Src referred to the next set of more risky technology that we were working on. When it came down to show ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' for the first time at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]], it was part of our internal communication to refer to the "Source" engine vs. the "Goldsource" engine, and the name stuck.</blockquote>

Source was developed part-by-part from this fork onwards, slowly replacing GoldSrc in Valve's internal projects<ref>{{cite book | author=Hodgson, David | year=2004 | title=Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar|publisher=[[Prima Games]] | isbn=0-7615-4364-3}}</ref> and explaining in part the reasons behind its unusually modular nature. Valve's development of Source since has been a mixture of licensed [[middleware]] ([[Havok (software)|Havok Physics]], albeit heavily modified, and [[MP3]] playback<!--we'll go on who you need to pay for secondary licenses, though I can't think of anything else anyway-->) and in-house-developed code.

John Carmack commented on his [[blog]] in 2004 that "there are still bits of early ''Quake'' code in ''Half-Life 2''".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armadilloaerospace.com/n.x/johnc/recent%20updates/archive?news_id=290|date=2004-12-31|work=John Carmack's Blog|title=Welcome, Q3 source, Graphics}}</ref>

== Criticism ==
=== Toolset ===
{{OR-section|date=January 2010}}
The [[Source SDK]] tools are criticised for being outdated and difficult to use.<ref name="dirigible-toolsblog">{{cite web|url=http://www.dirigible-games.com/diary/?p=15|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071227044928/http://www.dirigible-games.com/diary/?p=15|archivedate=2007-12-27|author=Neale Roberts|title=Stuck Valve|work=Dirigible Development Diary|date=November 15, 2006|accessdate=December 20, 2007}}</ref><ref name="jed_hlcoders09">{{cite web|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/hlcoders@list.valvesoftware.com/msg28135.html|author=Neil Jedrzejewski|publisher=hlcoders (official Valve mailing list)|title=Re: whats happening with this engine|date=July 23, 2009|accessdate=July 29, 2009}}</ref> A large number of the tools, including those for texture and model compilation, require varying levels of text-editor scripting from the user before they are executed at the command line with sometimes quite lengthy console commands.<ref name="vdc_vtex">{{cite web|url=http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Vtex_CLI_use|title=Vtex CLI use|work=Valve Developer Community|date=August 28, 2007|accessdate=July 21, 2008}}</ref> This obtuseness was cited by the [[University of London]] when they moved their exploration of professional architectural visualisation in computer games to [[Bethesda Softworks]]' [[Gamebryo]]-based Oblivion engine after a brief period with Source.<ref name="digitalurban-engineswitch">{{cite web|url=http://digitalurban.blogspot.com/2006/09/half-life-0-oblivion-1-half-life-update.html|title=Half Life 0 Oblivion 1 - Half Life Update|work=Digital Urban|date=September 28, 2006|accessdate=December 20, 2007}}</ref> Third-party tools provide [[Graphical User Interface|GUI]]s,<ref name="vdc-3rdpartytools">{{cite web|url=http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Category:Third_Party_Tools|title=Category:Third Party Tools|work=Valve Developer Community|accessdate=October 20, 2007}}</ref> but are not supported by Valve.

The interface of Valve's [[Hammer Editor]], the SDK's world-creation tool, has not changed significantly since its initial release for [[GoldSrc]] and the original [[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]] in 1998.

== Valve Developer Community ==
On June 28, 2005, Valve opened the [http://developer.valvesoftware.com/ Valve Developer Community] [[Wiki]]. VDC replaced Valve's static Source SDK documentation with a full [[MediaWiki]]-powered community site; within a matter of days Valve reported that "the number of useful articles nearly doubled". These new articles covered the previously undocumented ''[[Counter-Strike: Source]]'' bot (added by the bot's author, Mike Booth), Valve's [[Non-Player Character|NPC]] AI, advice for mod teams on setting up [[source control]], and more.

== Papers ==

Valve staff occasionally produce papers for various events and publications, including [[SIGGRAPH]], [[Game Developer (magazine)|Game Developer Magazine]] and [[Game Developers Conference]], explaining various aspects of Source's development. They are aimed at professional audiences and often discuss complex concepts. They are listed [http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/publications.html on Valve's corporate website].
