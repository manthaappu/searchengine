<html> <head> <title>Small subgroup confinement attack</title></head><body>In [[cryptography]], a '''subgroup confinement attack''' (or '''small subgroup confinement attack''') on a cryptographic method that operates in a large [[finite group]] is where an attacker attempts to compromise the method by forcing a key to be confined to an unexpectedly small [[subgroup]] of the desired [[group (mathematics)|group]].

Several methods have been found to be vulnerable to subgroup confinement attack, including some forms or applications of [[Diffie-Hellman key exchange]] and [[Encrypted key exchange|DH-EKE]].
