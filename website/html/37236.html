'''The Centre for Applied Genomics''' is a genome centre in the Research Institute of [[Sickkids|The Hospital for Sick Children]], and is affiliated with the [[University of Toronto]]. TCAG also operates as a Science and Technology Innovation Centre of [http://www.genomecanada.ca Genome Canada],<ref>Genome Canada Science and Technology Platforms [http://www.genomecanada.ca/en/portfolio/science.aspx]</ref> with an emphasis on [[next-generation sequencing]] (NGS) and [[bioinformatics]] support. Research at TCAG focuses on the [[genetics|genetic]] and genomic basis of human variability, health and disease, including research on the genetics of [[autism spectrum disorder]] and structural variation of the [[human genome]]. The Centre is located in the [[MaRS Discovery District]] in downtown [[Toronto]], [[Canada]]. 

==History==
The need for a centralized core facility for human genome research at [[Sickkids|SickKids Hospital]] prompted the establishment of The Centre for Applied Genomics (TCAG) in 1998. The Founding Director and Associate Director were Drs. [[Lap-Chee Tsui]] and [[Stephen W. Scherer]], respectively. Dr. Scherer is now the Scientific Director. 
[[Image:TCAG hall.jpg|left|320px|thumb|The Centre for Applied Genomics]]
Funding from the [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]] (CFI) enabled TCAG to form by consolidating existing core facilities including the [[Medical Research Council of Canada]] Genome Resource Facility, the [http://www.cgdn.ca/ Canadian Genetic Diseases Network] (CGDN) large insert clone core, the CGDN [[Dna sequencing|DNA Sequencing]] Core and the [[Sickkids|SickKids]] Biotechnology Service [[Dna sequencing|DNA Sequencing]] and Synthesis labs. A genome-wide [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]] [[genotyping]] laboratory at the [[OHRI|Ottawa Health Research Institute]] led by Dr. Dennis  Bulman was added. Subsequently, operational funding from the [[CIHR]] Genomics Special Projects panel provided for additional staff.

In 2001, a proposal entitled "Genome Resource Core Platform" was submitted to the then newly formed [http://www.genomecanada.ca Genome Canada]. This provided operational support, enhancing existing facilities and adding a mouse [[genotyping]] core at the [[University Of Toronto|University of Toronto]] led by Dr. Lucy Osborne. In 2002, [[Sickkids|SickKids]] built a new [[Affymetrix]] [[microarray]] facility. This core has quickly grown to become the largest such service centre in Canada and is in the top ten in North America<ref>Data provided by Affymetrix, Inc.</ref>. 

In 2004, TCAG entered a second phase of development driven by a $12 million [[Canada Foundation for Innovation|CFI]]/[http://www.oit.on.ca/Pages/Home.html Ontario Innovation Trust] funded project entitled "Integrative Genomics for Health Research"<ref>Integrative Genomics for Health Research news item (Ontario Innovation Trust website) [http://www.oit.on.ca/Pages/SStories21-40/StorySickKidsScherer.html]</ref>, allowing for consolidation of the mouse [[genotyping]] core with the [[Sickkids|SickKids]] facilities. This award also supported the establishment of an "Ontario Population Genomics Repository" (OPGP) to be used as controls in studies of common diseases. To efficiently complete this project, TCAG partnered with Dr. John McLaughlin's group at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto)]].

In May, 2004, an application to the newly announced [[Canada Foundation for Innovation|CFI]] Research Hospital Fund resulted in a $10.9 million dollar award to build out lab space and consolidate all operations on the 14th and 15th floors of the Toronto Medical Discovery Tower (TMDT) in the [[MaRS Discovery District]]. TCAG was the first occupant of TMDT (in August, 2005), quickly followed by other [[Sickkids|SickKids]] scientists. Most recently, investments in computer infrastructure from the 2003 [[Canada Foundation for Innovation|CFI]]/[http://www.oit.on.ca/Pages/Home.html Ontario Innovation Trust] competition have resulted in the establishment of new phases of the [http://ccb.sickkids.ca/hpf_index.html high-performance computing cluster] (HPF) that is currently used by TCAG and many other users, to allow analysis of large [[genomic]] datasets arising from new [[Dna microarray|microarray]] and [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] technologies. Further enhancements to the TCAG infrastructure will be supported by a $10.7 million renewal grant from CFI's Leading Edge Fund competition, entitled "Integrative Genomics for Health Research - Phase II",  awarded in June of 2009<ref>SickKids press release, June 18, 2009 [http://www.sickkids.ca/AboutSickKids/News-Room/Past-News/2009/cfi-funding.html]</ref>.

From January, 2006, through March, 2011, TCAG is operating in large part on renewal funds from [http://www.genomecanada.ca Genome Canada], administered by the [http://www.ontariogenomics.ca Ontario Genomics Institute].

==Research==
Current research at TCAG centres around large-scale projects performed by facility personnel, including support of [http://www.genomecanada.ca Genome Canada] projects, and a significant focus on the genetics of [[autism spectrum disorder]]s and structural variation of the [[human genome]]. Service work is also performed for over 600 other academic, private sector and government labs each year, drawn from 30 different countries and spanning a wide variety of research disciplines.<ref>Data from progress reports submitted to the Ontario Genomics Institute</ref>

Past research at TCAG is reflected by numerous peer-reviewed scientific publications. In 2008, TCAG Scientific Directors, Associate Scientists and staff co-authored 58 peer-reviewed manuscripts dependent in some way (either entirely, or in part) on the platform infrastructure, as documented in [[Pubmed|PubMed]].<ref>PubMed search for publications authored by these individuals during calendar year 2008, excluding Dr. Brudno who was added in 2009 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}</ref> Since 2002, over 270 such papers have been published.<ref>PubMed search for publications authored by these individuals, 2002 through present, excluding Drs.

==Core Facilities==
[[Image:TCAG lab.jpg|right|320px|thumb|TCAG DNA Synthesis Facility]]
TCAG employs a variety of genomic technologies to support different types of experimentation. These are organized into separate Core Facilities, with dedicated managers. An integrated [[Bioinformatics]] team assists with data handling and analysis, and develops new algorithms and analytical methods.

===DNA Sequencing and Synthesis===
The DNA Sequencing and Synthesis Core Facility has a dedicated manager for DNA Synthesis. The DNA Sequencing component shares a manager with the [[The_Centre_for_Applied_Genomics#Genetic_and_Statistical_Analysis|Genetic and Statistical Analysis Core Facility]]. This latter manager is responsible for the [[genotyping]] functions within that facility.

The facility uses conventional capillary [[Sanger sequencing]] on [[Applied Biosystems]] 3730xl instruments, governed by a [[Lims|Laboratory Information Management System]] (LIMS). Additionally, [[next-generation sequencing]] (NGS) using an [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] Genome Analyzer II, four [[Applied Biosystems]] SOLiD version 4, and a [[454 Life Sciences|454]]/[[Roche Diagnostics|Roche]] GS-FLX Titanium instrument is performed. A key component of this facility is the use of high-performance computing and [[bioinformatics]] support for NGS analysis and assembly.

The [[Oligonucleotide#Synthesis|Oligonucleotide Synthesis]] component of this facility makes conventional, long (up to 120 [[DNA base|bases]]) and modified [[oligonucleotide]]s, and purifies these by desalting, cartridge or high-performance liquid chromatography ([[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]]).

===Microarray and Gene Expression===
The [[Microarray]] and Gene Expression Core Facility has a dedicated manager, and operates [[Affymetrix]] and [[Agilent]] technologies. All [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] technologies are contained within the [[The_Centre_for_Applied_Genomics#Genetic_and_Statistical_Analysis|Genetic Analysis Core Facility]]. [[Affymetrix]] MegAllele and [[Single nucleotide polymorphism|Single Nucleotide Polymorphism]] (SNP) [[DNA microarray|microarrays]], [[Affymetrix]] [[gene expression]], tiling, [[promotor (biology)|promoter]] and [[exon]] [[DNA microarray|microarrays]], and [[Agilent]] [[oligonucleotide]] [[DNA microarray|microarrays]] are all run. Additionally, there is a wide variety of analytical [[software]] packages available for on-site data analysis.

===Cytogenomics and Genome Resources===
The Cytogenomics and Genome Resources Core Facility has a single manager between these two functions. Cytogenomics includes karyotyping and spectral (SKY) [[Karyotype|karyotyping]] (for [[mouse]], [[human]], and other species), fluorescent ''in situ'' hybridization ([[Fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH]]) mapping, transgenic insertion site mapping (G-to-FISH mapping) and clone labeling for [[Fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH]] experiments. The Genome Resources components includes a clone repository (Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) [[cDNA]] ([[mouse]] and [[human]]), genomic clones including human [[bacterial artificial chromosome]]s (BACs)) and provides project consultation and design assistance ([[Annotation#Computational_biology|annotation]], database [[Information retrieval|queries]], probe selection). It also provides [[Cdna library|cDNA library]] screening and [[QPCR|quantitative PCR]].

===Genetic and Statistical Analysis===
This Core Facility shares a manager (of the Genetic Analysis, or [[genotyping]] component) with the [[The_Centre_for_Applied_Genomics#DNA_Sequencing_and_Synthesis|DNA Sequencing and Synthesis]] facility. The Statistical Analysis component has its own dedicated manager.

The Genetic Analysis area includes all [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] technologies, including genome-wide (Infinium) and custom content (iSelect and GoldenGate) [[genotyping]], [[Methylation#Biological_methylation|methylation]], [[microRNA]], and [[gene expression]] [[DNA microarray|microarrays]]. It also performs capillary-based [[genotyping]] ([[Applied Biosystems]] [[Taqman]] and SNaPshot, [[microsatellite]]s), custom [[genotyping]] (e.g. [[heteroduplex]] analysis), [[mouse]] [[genotyping]] (for cross progeny and [[genetic linkage]] analysis), and [[methylation]] analysis (for [[epigenetics]] research).

The Statistical Analysis component provides project consultation and [[Statistical power|power analysis]], statistical analysis ([[Genetics|genetic]], [[DNA microarray|microarray]], and [[Biochemical pathway|pathway]] data, [[epidemiology]], [[population genetics]]), and [[copy number variation]] analysis, as well as developing new statistical methods. 

===Biobanking===
The Biobanking Core Facility has its own dedicated manager. It performs [[White blood cell|white cell]] immortalization (from [[blood]]) and banking, [[fibroblast]] [[Cell culture|culture]] and banking, culture and banking of other cell types including non-human cells, [[Nuclear DNA|genomic DNA]] preparation from [[blood]], [[saliva]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] or [[Cell (biology)|cells]], and [[Whole genome amplification|whole-genome amplification]] (WGA).

==Funding Sources==
TCAG is funded by several agencies, including the [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]] (CFI), [http://www.genomecanada.ca Genome Canada] through the [http://www.ontariogenomics.ca Ontario Genomics Institute], the [[Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation]], and the [[Wellcome Trust]].
