<html> <head> <title>BIOSCI</title></head><body>'''BIOSCI''', also known as '''Bionet''', is a set of electronic communication forum used by life scientists around the world.  It includes the Bionet [[Usenet]] newsgroups and parallel e-mail lists, with public archives since 1992 at [http://www.bio.net www.bio.net].  BIOSCI/Bionet provides public, [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] biology news and discussion for areas such as molecular biology methods and reagents, bioinformatics software and computational biology, toxicology, and several organism communities including yeast, C.elegans and annelida (worms), the plant arabidopsis, fruitfly, maize (corn), and others.<ref name="gilbert2004">{{cite journal | author=Gilbert, D.G. | title=Software Review: Bioinformatics software resources | journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics | year=2004 | volume=5 | issue=3 | pages= 300–304 | url=http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/5/3/300.pdf | doi=10.1093/bib/5.3.300 | pmid=15383216}}</ref>

BIOSCI/Bionet was started as part of the [[GenBank]] public biosequence database project by Intelligenetics at [[Stanford University]] in the mid 1980s, in collaboration with Martin Bishop and [[Michael Ashburner]] in the [[University of Cambridge]] <ref name="benton1990">{{cite journal | author=Benton, D. | title=Recent changes in the GenBank On-line Service | journal=Nucleic Acids Research | year=1990 | volume=18 | issue=6 | pages= 1517–1520 | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/pagerender.fcgi?artid=330520 | doi=10.1093/nar/18.6.1517 | pmid=2326192 | pmc=330520}}</ref>.  It latter moved to the [[United Kingdom| United Kingdom's]]  MRC [[Rosalind Franklin]] Centre for Genomics Research (RFCGR).  In 2005, with the closing of RFCGR, BIOSCI/Bionet moved to [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] Biology Department's IUBio Archive.
As one of the earliest [[bioinformatics]] community projects on the Internet, [[GenBank]]  acquired the bio.net domain and the Usenet hierarchy of Bionet for promoting open access communications among bioscientists, in conjunction with public biology data distribution.

[[Michael Ashburner]], co-founder of BIOSCI with Dave Kristofferson of [[GenBank]]  (Intelligenetics), writes of its origins <blockquote> ... in the early 1980s, Martin Bishop and I ran an email news service for a sequence analysis service that we ran on the Cambridge IBM3084Q mainframe.  I was also a user of MOLGEN at Stanford, and  there Dave Kristofferson ran an internal bulletin board using ANU News. We combined forces to start the Bulletin boards. </blockquote>

The [[Usenet]] hierarchy of '''Bionet.*''' includes bionet.announce (general biology announcements), and research communities of bionet.microbiology, bionet.molbio.methds-reagnts, bionet.neuroscience, bionet.genome.arabidopsis, bionet.plants.education, bionet.drosophila, bionet.biology.computational plus 50 other active areas of discussion.
