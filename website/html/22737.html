'''Luca Cardelli''' is an Italian [[computer scientist]] who is currently an Assistant Director at [[Microsoft Research]] in [[Cambridge, UK]]. Cardelli is well-known for his research in [[type theory]] and [[operational semantics]].<ref name="onunderstanding">{{cite journal| first=Luca| last=Cardelli|coauthors=Wegner, Peter| title=On understanding types, data abstraction, and polymorphism |url=http://lucacardelli.name/Papers/OnUnderstanding.A4.pdf| year=1985 | accessdate=2010-07-12| doi=10.1145/242224.242415| journal = ACM Comput.

Recently, he helped develop the [[Polyphonic C sharp|Polyphonic C#]] experimental programming language.

He was born in [[Montecatini Terme]], [[Italy]]. He attended the [[University of Pisa]] before receiving his Ph. D. from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1982. Before joining Microsoft Research in 1997, he worked for [[Bell Labs]] and [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]. 

In 2004 he was inducted as a Fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]. He is a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]].  In 2007, Cardelli was awarded the Senior AITO [[Dahl-Nygaard Prize|Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard prize]] ([http://www.aito.org/Dahl-Nygaard/2007.html Official Link]).
