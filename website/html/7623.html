'''ConTeXt''' is a general-purpose [[document processor]]. It is especially suited for structured documents, automated document production, very fine typography, and multi-lingual typesetting. It is based in part on the [[TeX]] [[typesetting]] system, and uses a [[document markup language]] for manuscript preparation.  The typographical and automated capabilities of ConTeXt are extensive, including interfaces for handling [[microtypography]], multiple footnotes and footnote classes, and manipulating [[OpenType]] fonts and features. Moreover, it offers extensive support for colors, backgrounds, hyperlinks, presentations, figure-text integration, and conditional compilation. It gives the user extensive control over formatting while making it easy to create new layouts and styles without learning the low-level TeX macro language.

ConTeXt may be compared and contrasted with [[LaTeX]], but the primary thrust of the two are rather distinct. ConTeXt from the ground up is a typography and typesetting system meant to provide users easy and consistent access to advanced typographical control—important for general-purpose typesetting tasks. The original vision of LaTeX is to insulate the user from typographical decisions—a useful approach for submitting, say, articles for a scientific journal. LaTeX has evolved from that original vision; at the same time, ConTeXt’s unified design avoids the package clashes that can happen with LaTeX<ref>[http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=context FAQ of the UK TeX Archive]</ref><ref name="whatiscontextwiki">[http://wiki.contextgarden.net/What_is_ConTeXt "What is ConTeXt" page at contextgarden]</ref>.

ConTeXt provides a multi-lingual user interface with support for markup in English, Dutch, German, French, and Italian and support for output in many languages including western European, eastern European, Arabic-script, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. It also allows the user to use different TeX engines like [[pdfTeX]], [[XeTeX]], and [[LuaTeX]] without changing the user interface<ref name="whatiscontextwiki"/>.

As its native drawing engine, ConTeXt integrates a superset of [[MetaPost]] called [[MetaFun]]<ref name="whatiscontextwiki"/> which allows the users to use the drawing abilities of MetaPost for page backgrounds and ornaments. Metafun can also be used with stand alone MetaPost. ConTeXt also supports the use of other external drawing engines, like [[PGF/TikZ]]<ref>[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pgf/base/doc/generic/pgf/pgfmanual.pdf PGF/TikZ official manual. Version 2.0]. Section 9.1.3 "Using the ConTeXt Format". p. 88</ref> and PSTricks<ref name="list-modules">[http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Modules List of ConTeXt modules at contextgarden]</ref>.

ConTeXt also provides a [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] package for typesetting [[chemical structure]] diagrams with [[TeX]] called [http://dante.ctan.org/CTAN/help/Catalogue/entries/ppchtex.html PPCHTeX]<ref>[http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Chemistry PPCHTeX Module for ConTeXt reference page at contextgarden]</ref>, as well as many other modules<ref name="list-modules"/><ref>[http://modules.contextgarden.net/ List of ConTeXt modules (static page)]</ref><ref>[http://dl.contextgarden.net/modules/ List of ConTeXt modules in web server for downloading]</ref>. This package can also be used with plain TeX and LaTeX.

ConTeXt was developed from 1990{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} by Hans Hagen from [http://www.pragma-ade.com/ PRAGMA Advanced Document Engineering] (Pragma ADE), a Netherlands-based company.

== Versions ==

Mark IV (abbreviated MKIV) is the current version of ConTeXt. It's a development version and new features are being added constantly, but it's fully usable. There is also a frozen version called Mark II (abbreviated MKII) which is still maintained. The main difference between MKII and MKIV is that MKIV is based on the [[LuaTeX]] engine<ref>[http://www.pragma-ade.com/general/manuals/mk.pdf MKIV reference manual. (page 7)]</ref> and MKII is based on pdfTeX and XeTeX<ref>[http://www.luatex.org/support.html LuaTeX support page]. In this page there is a comment that MKII is based on pdfTeX and XeTeX while MKIV is based on LuaTeX.</ref> (although it could be select the TeX engine used in ConTeXt<ref>[http://wiki.contextgarden.net/TeX_Distributions#alternative_TeX_processors TeX processors in ConTeXt]</ref>). There are some documents describing the necessity of this change<ref>[http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb28-3/tb90hagen.pdf Hans Hagen "ConTEXt MkIV: Going UTF". TUGboat, Volume 28 (2007), No. 3 — Proceedings of the 2007 Annual Meeting. p314-316 (pdf)]</ref>, how the process is being carried out, and its benefits<ref>[http://www.ntg.nl/maps/34/05.pdf Hans Hagen "MKII-MKIV". MAPS journal 34. p. 9-21 (pdf)]</ref>.

There are other minor differences between MKII and MKIV<ref>[http://wiki.contextgarden.net/MkIV_Differences MKIV differences at context wiki]</ref>.

Apart from the new features of MKIV, the changes between the code of MKII and MKIV are not visible in the user interface (in syntax document level).

Both MKIV and MKII released at the same time<ref>[http://wiki.contextgarden.net/FAQ#How_does_ConTeXt_versioning_work.3F FAQ of ConTeXt]</ref>

The oldest version of ConTeXt is Mark I in which all the low-level code is written in Dutch. It's unmaintained.

== History ==
ConTeXt was created by Hans Hagen<ref name="walden-hans">[http://www.tug.org/interviews/interview-files/hans-hagen.html Dave Walden interview Hans Hagen. TeX User Group 2006.]</ref> and Ton Otten of Pragma ADE in the Netherlands<ref>[http://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2005-1/asknelly/ "Ask Nelly ..." PracTeX Journal. TeX User Group. 2005]. Includes an example of ConTeXt document with source code.</ref> around 1991<ref name="taco-history">[http://meeting.contextgarden.net/2007/share/taco/history.pdf Taco Hoekwater "A short History of $2^4$ parts". ConTeXt User Meeting 2007 (march 24)]</ref><ref name="CUM-programme-2007">[http://meeting.contextgarden.net/2007/programme.shtml Programme of the ConTeXt User Meeting 2007]</ref> due to the need for educational typesetting material.

Around 1996, Hans Hagen coined the name ConTeXt meaning "text with tex" (con-tex-t; "[[con]]" is a Latin preposition meaning "together with")<ref name="walden-hans"/>. Before 1996 ConTeXt was used only within Pragma ADE, but in 1996 it began to be adopted by a wider audience. The first users outside Pragma were [[Taco Hoekwater]], [[Berend de Boer]] and Gilbert van den Dobbelsteen, and the first user outside the Netherlands was Tobias Burnus<ref name="walden-hans"/>.

In July 2004, contextgarden.net wiki page was created<ref name="taco-history"/><ref>[http://contextgarden.wordpress.com/2009/07/17/happy-birthday-contextgarden/ contextgarden 5th birthday on 24 July 2009]</ref>.

ConTeXt low-level code was originally written in Dutch. Around 2005, the ConTeXt developers began translating this to English resulting in the version known as MKII, which is now stable and frozen{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.

In August 2007, Hans Hagen presented the MKIV version<ref name="CUM-programme-2007"/><ref>[http://meeting.contextgarden.net/2007/share/hans/mkiv-epen-2007.pdf Hans Hagen The Road to MKIV. ConTeXt User Meeting 2007.]</ref>, and the first public beta was released later that year.<ref>[http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Mark_IV MKIV at contextgarden]</ref>.

During the ConTeXt User Meeting 2008, Mojca Miklavec presented<ref>[http://meeting.contextgarden.net/2008/programme.shtml ConTeXt User Meeting 2008 web page]</ref> [http://minimals.contextgarden.net/ ConTeXt Minimals], a distribution of ConTeXt containing the latest binaries and intended to have a small memory footprint, thus demanding less bandwidth for updates.<ref>[http://wiki.contextgarden.net/ConTeXt_Minimals ConTeXt Minimals web page]</ref>. In August 2008, this distribution was registered as a project in launchpad web site.<ref>[https://launchpad.net/context ConTeXt at Launchpad.net]</ref>

In June 2008, Patrick Gundlach wrote the first post<ref>[http://contextgarden.wordpress.com/2008/06/23/garden-admins-at-the-context-meeting/ First ConTeXt blog post]</ref> in [http://contextgarden.wordpress.com ConTeXt blog].

In July 2009, ConTeXt started [http://dl.contextgarden.net/distribution/git/ git repository]<ref>[http://contextgarden.wordpress.com/2009/07/17/new-git-repository/ Post of announce of git repository]</ref>.

==Example of code==
Making ConTeXt documents is simple: one makes a plain text file (typically with .tex extension), and compiles it with the <code>texexec</code> script.<ref>[http://www.pragma-ade.com/general/manuals/mtexexec.pdf "TeXEXEC explained" manual. Pragma ADE.]</ref>. The result of this process is a [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] file (ConTeXt also can generate a [[DVI (file format)|DVI]] file). An example is shown below.

\title{\CONTEXT}

\section{Text}
\CONTEXT\ is a document preparation system for the \TEX\ typesetting
program. It offers programmable desktop publishing features and extensive
facilities for automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop
publishing, including numbering and cross-referencing (for example
to equation \in[eqn:famous-emc]), tables and figures, page layout,
bibliographies, and much more.

It was originally written around 1990 by Hans Hagen. It could be an
alternative or complement to \LATEX.

\section{Maths}
With \CONTEXT\ we could write maths. Equations can be automatically numbered.

\placeformula[eqn:famous-emc]
\startformula
    E = mc^2
\stopformula
with
\placeformula[eqn:def-m]
\startformula
    m = \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\stopformula
