'''European Spatial Planning Research and Information Database''' (ESPRID) is a [[web-based]] Information Resource ([[database]]) managed at [[Newcastle University]].

It provides a search platform for those interested in [[Spatial development]] Analysis, [[Planning]] and [[policy]] but especially [[Strategic]] Spatial Planning in a [[Europe]]an context. In the context of the contemporary devolution processes and the growing application of the [[European Spatial Development Perspective]] in planning practice and policy in many [[European countries]], ESPRID provides a range of online resources.

The [[database]] has been developed for [[researchers]] and [[policy-makers]] concerned with Strategic [[Spatial Planning]] in a [[Europe]]an context. It contains material from [[academic]] books and journals, policy reports, plans and policy statements, databases and websites, and also includes information on relevant [[experts]]. One of its targets is to aid those involved in [[Interreg]] programmes and those developing spatial strategies across [[Europe]].
