<html> <head> <title>National Portrait Gallery copyright dispute</title></head><body>In July 2009, lawyers representing the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery of London]] (NPG) sent a [[demand letter]] threatening possible legal action for alleged [[copyright infringement]], to an editor-user of the [[free content]] multimedia repository [[Wikimedia Commons]], a project of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. The letter claims that Wikipedia editor Derrick Coetzee obtained more than 3,000 high-resolution images from the British National Portrait Gallery in March 2009 and posted them on Wikimedia Commons.<ref name= "BBC-NPG legal threat-2009-07-15"/><ref name = "NYTimes-Cohen-2009-07-19"/><ref name = "Guardian-Kennedy-2009-07-14">

The NPG letter stated the claim that while the painted portraits may be old (and have thus fallen into the [[public domain]]), the high-quality photographic reproductions are recent works, and qualify as copyrighted works due to the amount of work it took to digitize and restore them,<ref name = "NYTimes-Cohen-2009-07-19">

Coetzee publicly posted a copy of the legal letter from the NPG, indicating that he desired to "enable public discourse on the issue".<ref name= "BBC-NPG legal threat-2009-07-15"/>
On July 17, 2009, NPG gallery spokesperson, Eleanor Macnair, stated that “contact has now been made” with the Wikimedia Foundation and “we remain hopeful that a dialogue will be possible.”<ref name = "NYTimes-Cohen-2009-07-19"/>
The NPG has stated that it would be willing to permit Wikipedia to use low-resolution images, and that it hoped to avoid taking any further legal action.<ref name= "BBC-NPG legal threat-2009-07-15"/> 
The NPG had previously attempted to contact the Wikimedia Foundation in April 2009 regarding this issue, but did not receive an immediate response.<ref name= "BBC-NPG legal threat-2009-07-15"/>

In early 2010, an NPG spokesperson reported to heise Open, a division of German publishing house [[Heinz Heise]], "We had a constructive discussion in December and are now considering how best to come to an agreement."<ref>

==Background==
The 1999 [[United States District Court]] case ''[[Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp.]]'' (in which [[Bridgeman Art Library]] sued the [[Corel Corporation]] for copyright infringement for distributing copies of digital reproductions of public domain paintings sourced from Bridgeman on a CD-ROM) established that "a photograph which is no more than a copy of a work of another as exact as science and technology permits lacks [[Threshold of originality|originality]]. That is not to say that such a feat is trivial, simply not original."<ref name="subjectmatter"> 
{{cite web | author=Filler, Stephen C. | title=Copyright Protection and Subject Matter in Photographs | url = http://www.nylawline.com/articlephotog1.htm  | date=December 9, 2006, from Internet Archive) |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061209234905/http://www.nylawline.com/articlephotog1.htm |archivedate = 2006-12-09}} 
</ref>
As a result, reproductions of works that have fallen into the public domain cannot attract any new copyright in the United States.<ref name="subjectmatter"/>  
As such, local policies of the Wikimedia Commons web site ignore any potential copyright that could subsist in reproductions of public domain works.<ref name="bjp-atwar"/> However, British case law can take into account the amount of [[Sweat of the brow|skill and labour]] that took place in the creation of a work for considering whether it can be copyrighted in the country.<ref name="bjp-atwar"/>

As a ruling made in a US court, ''Bridgeman v. Corel'' is not a binding precedent for any court in the UK (though it may be influential). The letter from the National Portrait Gallery implies that the case should be determined using UK law and not US law. The issue of jurisdiction is complicated as the National Portrait Gallery is located in England, but Wikimedia Commons, and the uploader, are both located within the United States. The letter also claims that by making the images freely available on Wikimedia Commons, Coetzee would also be liable under the British [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] for any [[copyright infringement]] committed by other users who download and use the images.<ref name= "BBC-NPG legal threat-2009-07-15">{{ cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/arts_and_culture/8151989.stm | title = Gallery in Wikipedia legal threat | date=July 15, 2009 | work = BBC News | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate=2009-07-27}}</ref><ref name="Register-Orlovski-2009-07-13"/>

==Reaction==
{{POV|section|date=October 2009}}
===Response by the Wikimedia Foundation===
[[Erik Möller]], deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, made a statement on the issue, clarifying the stance of the Wikimedia Foundation on the incident.<ref name = "BBC News-Cellan-Jones-2009-07-19">
{{cite news | title = Wikipedia painting row escalates | first = Rory  | last = Cellan-Jones  | work = BBC News | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8156268.stm | publisher = British Broadcasting Corporation | date = July 17, 2009 | accessdate = July 28, 2009 }}
</ref><ref name="Wikimedia Fdn-Möller-2009-16-2009"/>
Möller stated that although the NPG has agreed that the images are in the public domain, the NPG had contended that they own the exclusive rights to their reproductions of the images, using this to monetize their collection and assert control over public domain content.<ref name="Wikimedia Fdn-Möller-2009-16-2009">
{{cite web|title=Protecting the public domain and sharing our cultural heritage |url=http://blog.wikimedia.org/2009/07/16/protecting-the-public-domain-and-sharing-our-cultural-heritage/ |last=Möller|first=Erik |date=July 16, 2009|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=2009-07-28}}
</ref>
Möller also stated "It is hard to see a plausible argument that excluding public domain content from a free, non-profit encyclopaedia serves any public interest whatsoever." <ref name = "BBC News-Cellan-Jones-2009-07-19"/>
Möller further described the agreement that other cultural institutions have made with Wikipedia to disseminate images: two German photographic archives  donated 350,000 copyrighted images, and other institutions in the United States and the UK have made material available for use.<ref name = "BBC News-Cellan-Jones-2009-07-19"/> The NPG stated that the images released by the German archives were medium resolution images, and that the NPG had offered to share images of the same quality.<ref name = "BBC News-Cellan-Jones-2009-07-19"/>

A reporter for the BBC reported that the NPG made a total of £339,000 from licensing images for use in traditional publications in 2008.<ref name ="BBC News-Cellan-Jones-2009-07-19" />

===Response by the EFF===
Fred von Lohmann, an attorney with the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) remarked that the situation comes down to asking whether US companies and citizens would be "bound by the most restrictive copyright law anywhere on the planet, or by U.S. law?" <ref> 
{{cite news |first=Wendy |last=Davis  |title=Art Museum Threatens Lawsuit Over Public Domain Gallery Images Uploaded To Wikipedia  |url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.showArticle&art_aid=110207|publisher=Mediapost |date= 21 July 2009 |accessdate=3 August 2009}} 
</ref> 
In a legal analysis, Lohmann contended that under US law, the NPG's "[[browse wrap]]" contract was not enforceable, [[database right]]s are not implemented at all, and that "using [[Zoomify]] on public domain images doesn't get you a [[DMCA]] claim."<ref name="eff-wprightpd">

</ref>
{{quote|NPG seems to think that UK law should apply everywhere on the Internet. If that's right, then the same could be said for other, more restrictive copyright laws, as well (see, e.g., Mexico's copyright term of life of the author plus 100 years and France's copyright over fashion designs). That would leave the online world at the mercy of the worst that foreign copyright laws have to offer, an outcome no U.S. court has ever endorsed.|Fred von Lohmann<ref name="eff-wprightpd"/>}}
