'''Take Command Console''' (TCC), formerly known as '''4DOS for Windows NT''' and '''4NT''', is a [[command line interpreter]] by JP Software, designed as a substitute for the default command interpreter in Microsoft Windows. TCC is based on the earlier [[4DOS]] command shell for [[DOS]], and [[4OS/2]] for [[OS/2]].

Beginning with version 12 of 4NT, support for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT and 2000 were removed.<ref name="ossupport">[http://jpsoft.com/tcmddes.htm Supported Windows versions].</ref>

4NT was renamed to '''Take Command Console''' as part of JP Software's [[Take Command (command line interpreter)|Take Command]] version 9, a version of 4NT that has many more features and more extensive GUI integration.  The current version of TCC, and therefore the underlying scripting language variant, is 11.0.

TCC provides a rich set of both [[Command line interface|command line]] and [[Batch file|batch programming]] capabilities. Unlike NT-based command line interpreter, it does not directly accept [[Windows Script Host]] commands. It can work in conjunction with other [[scripting language]]s, such as [[REXX]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] and [[Perl]], or [[Windows Script Host|Windows Scripting languages]], in the form of [[Active Scripting]] engines such as [[VBScript]] and [[JScript]] as well as [[PerlScript]] (via ActivePerl), [[TclScript]] (via ActiveTcl), [[PythonScript]] (via [[ActivePython]]), and the scripting engine version of [[Object REXX]] to provide greater access to the [[operating system]].  TCC is used by [[data center]] operations, [[tech support]] staff and [[programmer]]s, as well as [[power user]]s.
