[[Windows XP Service Pack 2]] for Windows XP Tablet PC Edition which was incorporated into Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005 brought improved the handwriting recognition and allowed the Tablet PC Input Panel to be used in almost every application. The Tablet PC Input Panel was also revised to extend speech recognition services (input and correction) to other applications.

With the release of Windows Vista, the Tablet PC Input Panel is built into all editions of Windows Vista with the exception of Home Basic and Starter editions. The speech recognition features were moved into [[Windows Speech Recognition]].
