==Technology==
Windows Home Server is built on the same [[codebase]] as Windows Server 2003 SP2. It includes almost all technologies found in Windows Server 2003 SP2 but has been modified in some areas to remove or limit features. It also includes some new capabilities not found in Windows Server 2003 SP2:

=== Home Server Console ===
While the underlying operating system is built on [[Windows Server 2003]] [[Windows Server 2003#Service Pack 2|SP2]], the configuration interface is designed to be user friendly enough that it can be set up without prior knowledge of server administration. The configuration interface, called the ''Home Server Console'', is delivered as an [[Remote Desktop Protocol|RDP]] application to remote PCs - while the application runs on the server itself, the UI is rendered on the remote system. The Home Server Console client application can be accessed from any Windows PC. The server itself requires no video card or peripherals; it is designed to require only an [[Ethernet]] card and at least one [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]] or [[Windows 7]] computer.

=== Drive Extender ===
'''Windows Home Server Drive Extender''' is a file-based replication system that provides three key capabilities:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://blogs.technet.com/homeserver/archive/2007/02/15/the-death-of-the-drive-letter.aspx | title=The Death of the Drive Letter ... | date=2007-02-15 | work=Windows Home Server Team Blog | accessdate=2007-04-28}}</ref>
* Multi-disk redundancy so that if any given disk fails, data is not lost
* Arbitrary storage expansion by supporting any type of [[hard disk]] drive ([[Serial ATA]], [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], [[FireWire]] etc.) in any mixture and capacity &mdash; similar in concept to [[Non-RAID drive architectures#JBOD|JBOD]]
* A single folder namespace (no drive letters)

Users (specifically those who configure a family's home server) deal with storage at two levels: [[Shared resource|Shared Folders]] and Disks. The only concepts relevant regarding disks is whether they have been "added" to the home server's storage pool or not and whether the disk appears healthy to the system or not. This is in contrast with Windows' [[Logical Disk Manager]] which requires a greater degree of technical understanding in order to correctly configure a [[RAID]] array.

Shared Folders have a name, a description, permissions, and a flag indicating whether duplication (redundancy) is on or off for that folder.

If duplication is on for a Shared Folder (which is the default on multi-disk Home Server systems and not applicable to single disk systems) then the files in that Shared Folder are duplicated and the effective storage capacity is halved. However, in situations where a user may not want data duplicated (e.g. TV shows that have been archived to a Windows Home Server from a system running [[Windows Media Center]]), Drive Extender provides the capability to not duplicate such files if the server is short on capacity or manually mark a complete content store as not for duplication.

Additional information can be found on the ''[http://www.microsoft.com/DownLoads/details.aspx?familyid=40C6C9CC-B85F-45FE-8C5C-F103C894A5E2&displaylang=en Windows Home Server Technical Brief for Drive Extender]''.

A known limitation of Drive Extender is that it in some cases changes date/timestamp of directories and files when data is moved around between disks. According to Microsoft this is currently expected behaviour. This causes unexpected behaviour when using clients that sort media based on date. Examples are [[Xbmc]], [[MediaPortal]], [[Squeezebox Server]]. The aforementioned programs will work fine with WHS; however, files may appear out of order due to this caveat.

'''Drive Extender Cancellation'''

On 11/23/2010, Microsoft announced that Drive Extender would be removed from [[Windows Home Server V2]].<ref>http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/windowshomeserver/archive/2010/11/23/windows-home-server-code-name-vail-update.aspx</ref> This announcement has led to public outcry in the announcement's comments section. Criticism of Drive Extender's removal is mainly related to it being seen as a core feature of Windows Home Server and a key reason for adoption. As a replacement for Drive Extender, Microsoft states that OEMs will use RAID on their Windows Home Server products.

===Computer Backup and Restore===
'''Windows Home Server Computer Backup''' automatically backs up all of the computers in a home to the server using an image-based system that ensures point-in-time-based restoration of either entire PCs or specific files and folders.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://blogs.technet.com/homeserver/archive/2007/02/08/home-computer-backup.aspx | title=Home Computer Backup | date=2007-02-08 | work=Windows Home Server Team Blog | accessdate=2007-04-28}}</ref> Complete computer restores are initiated through a restore [[boot disk|bootable CD]], file based restores are initiated through the WHS client software which allows the users to open a backup and "drag and drop" files from it. This technology uses [[Volume Shadow Copy Service|Volume Shadow Services (VSS)]] technology on the client computer to take an image based backup of a running computer. Because the backup operates on data at the [[Cluster (file system)|cluster]] level, [[Single-instance storage|single instancing]] can be performed to minimize the amount of data that travels over the network and that will ultimately be stored on the home server. This single instancing gives the server the ability to store only one instance of data, no matter if the data originated from another computer, another file, or even data within the same file.

Computer backup images are not duplicated on the server, so if a server hard drive fails, backups could be lost. The "Server Backup" feature added in Power Pack 1 does not include duplication of backup images.

=== Remote File Access ===
[[Image:WindowsHomeServer (Web Interface, File UI).png|thumb|Web Interface showing the shared files UI]]
The system also offers an [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] secured [[web browser]] based interface over the [[Internet]] to the shared file stores.<ref name="privacyStatement">{{cite web
| url=http://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsHomeServer/content/content.aspx?ContentID=4318
| title=Microsoft Windows Home Server CTP Privacy Statement | date=January 2007
| work=Microsoft Connect | accessdate=2007-04-28}}
</ref> The release version offers access to the web interface via a free [[Windows Live]]-provided [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]], which uses [[Dynamic DNS]]. The web interface also allows the uploading to and downloading of files from the content stores.<ref name="blogRemoteAccess" /> However, there is a limit of 2 GB for a single batch of upload.<ref name="tbrief">{{cite web | url = http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=8505e3a8-bbbc-445d-ba65-13782661dcb0&DisplayLang=en | title = Technical Brief for Windows Home Server Remote Access| accessdate = 2007-10-04}}</ref>

=== Remote Desktop Services ===
The system also supports [[Terminal Services Gateway]], allowing [[Terminal Services|remote control of the desktop]] of any Windows computer on the home network.<ref name="tbrief"/><ref name="privacyStatement"/> Currently supported systems are those which would normally support [[Remote Desktop Connection|Remote Desktop]]: [[Windows XP]] Professional, Tablet and Media Center editions, [[Windows Vista]] Business, Enterprise and Ultimate editions and [[Windows 7]] Professional, Enterprise and Ultimate editions. The web interface also supports embedding the Remote Desktop [[ActiveX]] control, to provide remote access to home computers from within the web interface directly. Remote sessions can also connect to the Home Server console to configure the server over the internet.<ref name="tbrief"/>

=== Add-Ins ===
Windows Home Server allows for developers to publish community and commercial add-ins designed to enhance the Windows Home Server with added functionality.  As of January 2010, nearly 100 of these add-ins have been developed for WHS, including applications for antivirus & security, backups, disk management, automation, media, network/power management, remote access, BitTorrent and more.  The Windows Home Server SDK (Software Development Kit) provides developers with a set of APIs and tools to use when developing for and extending Windows Home Server.

==Compatibility==
Windows Home Server features integration with [[Windows XP]] (SP2 or newer), [[Windows Vista]], and [[Windows 7]] (after the release of Power Pack 3) through a software installation, either from a client CD or via a network share.<ref name="whsconnector">{{cite web|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee378523%28WS.10%29.aspx|title=Installing Windows Home Server Connector Software Without the CD |date=2009-08-12|accessdate=2009-09-24}}</ref> Files stored on Windows Home Server are also available through a [[Server Message Block|Windows share]], opening compatibility to a wide variety of operating systems. Also, the Administration console is available via Remote Desktop, allowing administration from unsupported platforms.

Windows Home Server does not support Microsoft's own MSE anti-virus program.<ref name="mseav">{{cite web|url=http://variableghz.com/2010/09/windows-home-server-is-incredibly-awkward/|title=Windows Home Server is Incredibly Awkward|date=2010-09-29|accessdate=2010-09-29}}</ref>

64-bit Windows client support was introduced in Power Pack 1, though the Restore Wizard on the Windows Home Server Restore CD is unable to restore clients running 64-bit operating systems.<ref name="powerpack1">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.technet.com/homeserver/archive/2008/07/21/power-pack-1-come-and-get-it.aspx|title=Power Pack 1 - come and get it! |date=2008-07-21|accessdate=2008-07-22}}</ref> Windows XP Professional x64 isn't officially supported. However, unofficial workarounds allow Connector software to work on XP x64.<ref>http://mswhs.com/2008/03/13/existing-connector-software-works-on-windows-xp-x64-sp2/</ref>

Integration of the file sharing service as a location for [[Mac OS X|Mac OS X's]] [[Time Machine (Apple software)|Time Machine]] was apparently being considered,<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/whs_preview.asp | title=Windows Home Server Preview | publisher=Paul Thurrott's SuperSite  | date=2007-01-07 | accessdate=2008-07-02}}</ref> but upon Mac OS X Leopard's release, Apple had removed the ability to use the SMB file sharing protocol for Time Machine backups.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.christopherprice.net/windows-home-server-time-machine-fall-apart-63.html | title=Windows Home Server & Time Machine Fall Apart | publisher=christopherprice.net | date=2007-10-26 | accessdate=2008-07-02}}</ref>  One WHS provider, [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], provides their own plug-in with their home server line capable of Time Machine backup to a home server.<ref name='blog-08-12'>{{cite web|url=http://technologyexpert.blogspot.com/2008/12/new-hp-mediasmart-nas-adds-os-x-time.html |title=New HP MediaSmart Server Adds MacOS Time Machine Support |accessdate=2009-03-02 |last=Technology |first=Expert |date=2008-12-29 |work=blogspot.com }}</ref>

Windows Home Server has not officially supported [[Domain Controller]] capability and cannot readily join a [[Windows Server domain]]. Wireless networking is not currently supported.

==Minimum system requirements==
The following minimum specs are needed:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/c/0/9c0ef09a-585f-4e20-a605-9f225cc11721/WHS_GettingStarted.pdf | title=Windows Home Server: Getting Started | publisher=Microsoft | date=2007-07-26 | accessdate=2008-07-14 }}</ref>

*100 Mbit/s wired [[Ethernet]]
Additionally, the following are required for installation of the operating system only:
*Bootable [[DVD]] drive or USB stick
*Display
*[[Keyboard (computing)|Keyboard]] and [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]
Dedicated devices will have the operating system pre-installed and may be supplied with a server recovery disk which reloads the OS over a network connection. This is utilized on the HP MediaSmart Server.<ref>http://www.hp.com/united-states/campaigns/mediasmart-server/index.html?jumpid=ex_r602_link/kimcon/zo/1Q09MediaSmartServer//DM:/351482/30295795/208134550/#/Main/</ref>

== Resolved issues ==
=== File corruption ===
The first release of Windows Home Server, RTM (Release to manufacturing), suffered from a file corruption flaw whereby files saved directly to or edited on shares on a WHS device could become corrupted.<ref name="MS-support-1">{{cite web |title=When you use certain programs to edit files on a home computer that uses Windows Home Server, the files may become corrupted when you save them to the home server |url=http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/946676/en-us?spid=12624 |publisher=Microsoft |date=2007-12-20 |accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref> Only the files that had [[NTFS]] [[NTFS#Alternate_data_streams_.28ADS.29|Alternate Data Stream]]s were susceptible to the flaw.<ref>{{Cite web |publisher=Microsoft |url=http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/943393/en-us |title=Data files that contain NTFS alternate data streams can be corrupted on a Windows Home Server-based computer}}</ref> The flaw led to data corruption only when the server was under heavy load at the time when the file (with ADS) was being saved onto a share.<ref name="ed"/>

Backups of client PCs made by Windows Home Server were not susceptible to the flaw.<ref name="ed">[http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=348 What’s the real story on the Windows Home Server data corruption bug?]</ref>

Even though the issue was first acknowledged in October 2007,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forums.microsoft.com/WindowsHomeServer/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=2234532&SiteID=50 |title=Known Issue: KB943393 - Data corruption issues identified |accessdate=2007-12-27 |publisher=Microsoft |date=2007-10-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071231144315/http://forums.microsoft.com/WindowsHomeServer/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=2234532&SiteID=50 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-12-31}}</ref> [[Microsoft]] formally warned users of the seriousness of the flaw on 20 December 2007. Microsoft then issued a list of applications, including [[Windows Live Photo Gallery]], [[Microsoft OneNote]], [[Microsoft Outlook]] and [[SyncToy]] 2.0, which might have triggered the flaw if they were used to edit the files on a WHS share directly.<ref name="MS-support-1" />

This issue was fixed by Power Pack 1, released on July 21, 2008.<ref name="powerpack1"/>

=== No native backup ===
Windows Home Server RTM did not include a mechanism for backing up the server.  Power Pack 1 added the ability to back up files stored on the Shared Folders, to an external drive.<ref name="powerpack1" />  Users can also subscribe to 3rd-party online services, for a fee.  However, there remains no way to back up the installed server operating system. Backing-up of the client backup database is available either manually using the instructions provided by Microsoft on page 24 of [http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/8/0/18096c95-4850-4176-9821-970691b98aaf/Windows_Home_Server_Technical_Brief_-_Home_Computer_Backup_and_Restore.docx this document] or can be done using the WHS BDBB add-in written by Alex Kuretz and available from [http://www.mediasmartserver.net/add-ins/ this website].

==Pricing==
While some hardware manufacturers have developed dedicated boxes,<ref>{{ cite web |title=List of dedicated WHS boxes offered by hardware manufacturers |url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/windowshomeserver/buy.mspx}}</ref> Microsoft has also released Windows Home Server under the [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]]/System Builder license. In November 2008 Microsoft lowered the price of the WHS System Builder SKU to US$100.<ref>{{ cite web
 | title = Windows Home Server price cut, plus surprising storage stats
 | url = http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/brierdudley/2008/11/05/windows_home_server_price_cut.html
 }}
</ref>

Users can also choose to use an existing PC or build their own systems, which would include the use of WHS System Builder.

As of March 23, 2009, Microsoft has also made Windows Home Server available to [[MSDN#Software subscriptions|MSDN]] and [[Microsoft Technet]] subscribers.<ref>{{cite web | title = Windows Home Server - Now available on MSDN | url = http://blogs.technet.com/homeserver/archive/2009/03/23/windows-home-server-now-available-on-msdn.aspx | publisher=Windows Home Server Team Blog| date = 2009-03-23}}</ref>

===Refund of Windows Home Server license fees===
Some computer systems are available only with a bundled Windows Home Server license. As is the case with other versions of Windows it is possible to request a [[Windows refund|refund of the license fees]] paid for Windows Home Server.<ref>{{ cite web
 | title = How to get a Windows Home Server license fee refund
