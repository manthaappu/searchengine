'''NeoDatis ODB'''  is an [[object database]] available the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]], hence usable in [[free (software)|free]] or [[Commerce|commercial]] applications. NeoDatis ODB is available both for [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[.NET Framework|.NET]], the latter being still under development.

==Features==
* Support for [[Native Queries]] (see [[#NativeQuery|below]]).
* NeoDatis is simple and intuitive. Objects can be easily be added to a database, requiring no boilerplate, nor modification to already existing classes.
* ODB Explorer: a graphical tool to browse, query, create, update, and delete object, as well as import/export the database from and to XML files.

==Types of Queries==
===NativeQuery===
To perform a native query, an object implementing a method named <code>match</code> is sent to the database. Such method receives each [[object (programming)|object]] of a determined class from the database, and returns a boolean value determining whether each one should be returned as part of the query result or not.
Usage of such queries would be for example<ref>http://www.neodatis.org/5m-tutorial#toc7</ref>:
<source lang="java">
IQuery query = new SimpleNativeQuery() {
    public boolean match(Player player) {
        return player.getFavoriteSport().getName().toLowerCase().startsWith("volley");
    }
};

Objects<Player> players = odb.getObjects(query);
</source>
Native queries have a reduced performance compared to other types of queries, since every object of a certain class in the database must be instantiated, along with its members, however, they maintain some principles of [[object-oriented programming]] (encapsulation and data abstraction), which other types of queries do not.

===CriteriaQuery===
A CriteriaQuery allow retrieval of objects by queries which compare object attributes. It's syntaxis is somewhat SQL-like. A simple example is:
<source lang="java">
IQuery query = new CriteriaQuery(Player.class, Where.equal("name", "olivier"));
    Objects<Player> players = odb.getObjects(query);
</source>
