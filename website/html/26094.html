'''NetLibrary''' is an electronic content provider and is a division of [[EBSCO Publishing]]. In 2002 NetLibrary was acquired by [[Online Computer Library Center]], who sold it to EBSCO Industries in 2010. NetLibrary provides audiobooks ([[Windows Media DRM|DRM protected]] [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]], [[MP3]]) and ebooks (viewable online or as [[Adobe Digital Editions|DRM protected PDF]]) through their website primarily to libraries. Libraries control which content is available in their portal by purchasing content from NetLibrary. NetLibrary offers a variety of value adding services to publishers, focusing mainly on bringing content into compliance with copyright and getting it ready for distribution<ref>{{Cite web|title=Custom Conversion Services|format=PDF|author=|url=http://extranet.netlibrary.com/extranet/publisher/specifications/documents/Custom_Conversion_Services.pdf}}</ref>.

NetLibrary, while a provider of library-like services, is better classed with institution database providers because of how their service is set up. Like the institution database providers the user must login before they have access to the content and like the database providers it is accessed through a single website (NetLibrary.com). However because of the type of content it offers, namely ebooks and audio books, NetLibrary falls in the same niche as [[OverDrive, Inc.|OverDriveâ€™s]] [[Digital Library Reserve]].
