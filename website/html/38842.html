'''Unison''' is a [[file synchronization]] program. It is used for synchronizing files between two directories, either on one computer, or between a computer and another storage device (e.g. another computer, or a removable disc).
It runs on [[Unix-like]] operating systems (including [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]]), as well as on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].

==Details==
Unison allows the same version of files to be maintained on multiple computing devices. In other words, when two devices are synchronized, the user can be sure that the most current version of a file is available on both devices, regardless of where it was last modified.

* It runs on many operating systems, and can synchronize files across platforms, so that for instance a Windows laptop may be synchronized with a Unix server.
* It detects 'conflicts' where a file has been modified on both sources, and displays these to the user
* It communicates over the TCP/IP protocol so that any two machines with an internet connection can be synchronized. This also means that the data transferred can be secured by tunneling over an encrypted [[Secure Shell|SSH]] connection.
* It uses the [[rsync]] algorithm developed by [[Andrew Tridgell]]. This algorithm transfers only the parts of a file that have changed, and so is faster than copying the whole file.
* It is designed to be robust in the event of a program or system crash or a communication failure.
* It is [[open-source]].
* It is written in the [[Objective Caml]] language.

File synchronization tools such as Unison are similar to [[version control]] tools ([[Git (software)|git]], CVS, Subversion, etc.), [[List of file systems#Distributed file systems|distributed filesystems]] ([[Coda (file system)|Coda]], [[Lustre (file system)|Lustre]], etc.), and [[mirror (computing)|mirroring]] utilities ([[rsync]], etc.), in that all these attempt to keep sets of files synchronized. However file synchronization tools can deal with modifications to both versions of the directory structure, without the overhead of version control.

==Development Status==
Unison is no longer under active development. However as the original developers still use Unison, they occasionally release bug fixes, small improvements, and contribute patches.<ref name="status" />

Support for Unison is provided by third parties for specific operating systems.

The latest stable version, as of February 2010, is 2.32.52 (available as source code). For binary stable versions, the following are available:
*Linux: 2.32.52
*Win32: 2.32.52
*Mac OS X: 2.32.12

The original developers began focusing on a project called 'Harmony', which they considered a natural progression from Unison, to synchronize any hierarchical structure expressed in XML<ref>http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~harmony/old/</ref>. However, Harmony has been abandoned, and the developers are now focusing on the [[Boomerang (programming language)|Boomerang]] project which creates 'lenses' for transforming string data<ref>http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~harmony/ Related projects - Harmony, Boomerang and Unison</ref>.
