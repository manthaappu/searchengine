'''Revision control''', also known as '''version control''' or '''source control''' (and an aspect of '''[[software configuration management]]''' or SCM), is the management of changes to documents, [[computer program|program]]s, and other information stored as [[computer file]]s. It is most commonly used in [[software development]], where a [[team]] of people may change the same files. Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the "revision number", "revision level", or simply "revision". For example, an initial set of files is "revision 1". When the first change is made, the resulting set is "revision 2", and so on. Each revision is associated with a [[timestamp]] and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.

Version control systems (VCSs – singular VCS) most commonly run as stand-alone applications, but revision control is also embedded in various types of software such as [[word processor]]s (e.g., [[Microsoft Word]], [[OpenOffice.org Writer]], [[KWord]], [[Pages]], etc.), spreadsheets (e.g.,  [[Microsoft Excel]], [[OpenOffice.org Calc]], [[KSpread]], [[Numbers (software)|Numbers]], etc.), and in various [[content management system]]s (e.g., [[Drupal]], [[Joomla]], [[WordPress]]). Integrated revision control is a key feature of [[wiki software]] packages such as [[MediaWiki]], [[DokuWiki]], [[TWiki]] etc. In [[wiki]]s, revision control allows for the ability to revert a page to a previous revision, which is critical for allowing editors to track each other's edits, correct mistakes, and defend public wikis against vandalism and [[Spam (electronic)|spam]].

==Overview==
Engineering revision control developed from formalized processes based on tracking revisions of early blueprints or [[whiteprint|bluelines]]. This system of control implicitly allowed returning to any earlier state of the design, for cases in which an engineering dead-end was reached in the development of the design. Likewise, in computer [[software engineering]], revision control is any practice that tracks and provides control over changes to source code. [[Software developer]]s sometimes use revision control software to maintain documentation and [[configuration file]]s as well as source code. Also, version control is widespread in business and law.  Indeed, "[[contract redline]]" and "[[legal blackline]]" are some of the earliest forms of revision control,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}<!-- need source for "earliest" --> and are still employed with varying degrees of sophistication.  An entire industry has emerged to service the document revision control needs of business and other users, and some of the revision control technology employed in these circles is subtle, powerful, and innovative.  The most sophisticated techniques are beginning to be used for the electronic tracking of changes to [[computer-aided design|CAD]] files (see [[product data management]]), supplanting the "manual" electronic implementation of traditional revision control.

As teams design, develop and deploy software, it is common for multiple versions of the same software to be deployed in different sites and for the software's developers to be working simultaneously on updates. [[Computer bug|Bugs]] or features of the software are often only present in certain versions (because of the fixing of some problems and the introduction of others as the program develops). Therefore, for the purposes of locating and fixing bugs, it is vitally important to be able to retrieve and run different versions of the software to determine in which version(s) the problem occurs. It may also be necessary to develop two versions of the software concurrently (for instance, where one version has bugs fixed, but no new features ([[Branch (software)|branch]]), while the other version is where new features are worked on ([[Trunk (software)|trunk]]).

At the simplest level, developers could simply retain multiple copies of the different versions of the program, and label them appropriately.  This simple approach has been used on many large software projects. While this method can work, it is inefficient as many near-identical copies of the program have to be maintained.  This requires a lot of self-discipline on the part of developers, and often leads to mistakes.  Consequently, systems to automate some or all of the revision control process have been developed.

Moreover, in software development, legal and business practice and other environments, it has become increasingly common for a single document or snippet of code to be edited by a team, the members of which may be geographically dispersed and may pursue different and even contrary interests.  Sophisticated revision control that tracks and accounts for ownership of changes to documents and code may be extremely helpful or even necessary in such situations.

Revision control may also track changes to configuration files, such as those typically stored in <code>/etc</code> or <code>/usr/local/etc</code> on Unix systems. This gives system administrators another way to easily track changes made and a way to roll back to earlier versions should the need arise.

==Source-management models==
Traditional revision control systems use a centralized model where all the revision control functions take place on a shared [[Server (computing)|server]]. If two developers try to change the same file at the same time, without some method of managing access the developers may end up overwriting each other's work. Centralized revision control systems solve this problem in one of two different "source management models": file locking and version merging.

===Atomic operations===
Computer scientists speak of ''atomic'' operations if the system is left in a consistent state even if the operation is interrupted. The ''commit'' operation is usually the most critical in this sense.  Commits are operations which tell the revision control system you want to make a group of changes you have been making final and available to all users.  Not all revision control systems have atomic commits; notably, the widely-used [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] lacks this feature.

===File locking===
The simplest method of preventing "[[concurrent access]]" problems involves [[file locking|locking files]] so that only one developer at a time has write access to the central "repository" copies of those files. Once one developer "checks out" a file, others can read that file, but no one else may change that file until that developer "checks in" the updated version (or cancels the checkout).

File locking has both merits and drawbacks.  It can provide some protection against difficult merge conflicts when a user is making radical changes to many sections of a large file (or group of files).  However, if the files are left exclusively locked for too long, other developers may be tempted to bypass the revision control software and change the files locally, leading to more serious problems.

===Version merging===
{{main | Merge (revision control) }}
Most version control systems allow multiple developers to edit the same file at the same time. The first developer to "check in" changes to the central repository always succeeds. The system may provide facilities to [[Merge (revision control)|merge]] further changes into the central repository, and preserve the changes from the first developer when other developers check in.

Merging two files can be a very delicate operation, and usually possible only if the data structure is simple, as in [[text file]]s. The result of a merge of two [[image file]]s might not result in an image file at all. The second developer checking in code will need to take care with the merge, to make sure that the changes are compatible and that the merge operation does not introduce its own [[logic]] errors within the files. These problems limit the availability of automatic or semi-automatic merge operations mainly to simple text based documents, unless a specific merge [[plugin]] is available for the file types.

The concept of a ''reserved edit'' can provide an optional means to explicitly lock a file for exclusive write access, even when a merging capability exists.

===Baselines, labels and tags===
Most revision control tools will use only one of these similar terms (baseline, label, tag) to refer to the action of identifying a snapshot ("label the project") or the record of the snapshot ("try it with baseline ''X''").  Typically only one of the terms ''baseline'', ''label'', or ''tag'' is used in documentation or discussion{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}; they can be considered synonyms.

In most projects some snapshots are more significant than others, such as those used to indicate published releases, branches, or milestones.

When both the term ''baseline'' and either of ''label'' or ''tag'' are used together in the same context, ''label'' and ''tag'' usually refer to the mechanism within the tool of identifying or making the record of the snapshot, and ''baseline'' indicates the increased significance of any given label or tag.

Most formal discussion of [[configuration management]] uses the term [[Baseline (configuration management)|''baseline'']].

==Distributed revision control==
{{main|Distributed revision control}}
Distributed revision control (DRCS) takes a peer-to-peer approach, as opposed to the client-server approach of centralized systems. Rather than a single, central repository on which clients synchronize, each peer's working copy of the codebase is a [[good faith|bona-fide]] repository.<ref>{{cite web

  | accessdate = May 8, 2007 }}</ref>
Distributed revision control conducts synchronization by exchanging [[Patch (Unix)|patches]] (change-sets) from peer to peer. This results in some important differences from a centralized system:

* No canonical, reference copy of the codebase exists by default; only working copies.
* Common operations (such as commits, viewing history, and reverting changes) are fast, because there is no need to communicate with a central server.<ref name='OSullivan'>{{cite web

  | title = Distributed revision control with Mercurial

  | accessdate = July 13, 2007 }}</ref>
Rather, communication is only necessary when pushing or pulling changes to or from other peers.
* Each working copy effectively functions as a remote backup of the codebase and of its change-history, providing natural protection against data loss.<ref name='OSullivan'/>

==Integration==
Some of the more advanced revision-control tools offer many other facilities, allowing deeper integration with other tools and software-engineering processes. [[Plugin]]s are often available for [[integrated development environment|IDEs]] such as [[Oracle JDeveloper]], [[IntelliJ IDEA]], [[Eclipse (computing)|Eclipse]] and [[Visual Studio]]. [[NetBeans|NetBeans IDE]] and [[Xcode]] come with integrated version control support.

; [[baseline (configuration management)|Baseline]] : An approved revision of a document or source file from which subsequent changes can be made.  See [[#Baselines, labels and tags|baselines, labels and tags]].
; [[branching (software)|Branch]] : A set of files under version control may be '''branched''' or '''forked''' at a point in time so that, from that time forward, two copies of those files may develop at different speeds or in different ways independently of each other.
; Change : A '''change''' (or '''[[diff]]''', or '''[[Delta encoding|delta]]''') represents a specific modification to a document under version control.  The granularity of the modification considered a change varies between version control systems.
; Change list : On many version control systems with [[atomic transaction|atomic]] multi-change commits, a '''changelist''', '''change set''', or '''patch''' identifies the set of '''changes''' made in a single commit.  This can also represent a sequential view of the source code, allowing the examination of source "as of" any particular changelist ID.
; Checkout : A '''check-out''' (or '''co''') is the act of creating a local working copy from the repository. A user may specify a specific revision or obtain the latest. The term 'checkout' can also used as a noun to describe the working copy.
; Commit : A '''commit''' ('''checkin''', '''ci''' or, more rarely, '''install''', '''submit''' or '''record''') is the action of writing or merging the changes made in the working copy back to the repository. The terms 'commit' and 'checkin' can also used in noun form to describe the new revision that is created as a result of committing.
; Conflict : A conflict occurs when different parties make changes to the same document, and the system is unable to reconcile the changes.  A user must '''resolve''' the conflict by combining the changes, or by selecting one change in favour of the other.
; Delta compression : Most revision control software uses [[delta compression]], which retains only the differences between successive versions of files.  This allows for more efficient storage of many different versions of files.
; Dynamic stream : A stream in which some or all file versions are mirrors of the parent stream's versions.
; Export : '''exporting''' is the act of obtaining the files from the repository. It is similar to '''checking-out''' except that it creates a clean directory tree without the version-control metadata used in a working copy. This is often used prior to publishing the contents, for example.
; Head: Also sometime called '''tip''', this refers to the most recent commit.
; Import : '''importing''' is the act of copying a local directory tree (that is not currently a working copy) into the repository for the first time.
; Label : See '''tag'''.
; Mainline : Similar to ''trunk'', but there can be a mainline for each branch.
; [[Merge (revision control)|Merge]] : A '''merge''' or '''integration''' is an operation in which two sets of changes are applied to a file or set of files. Some sample scenarios are as follows:
:* A user, working on a set of files, '''updates''' or '''syncs''' their working copy with changes made, and checked into the repository, by other users.<ref name="svnbook-merge">{{cite web|last=Collins-Sussman|first=Ben|title=Version Control with Subversion|url=http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.tour.cycle.html#svn.tour.cycle.resolve|accessdate=8 June 2010|coauthors=Brian W. Fitpatrick, and C. Michael Pilato|quote=The G  stands for merGed, which means that the file had local changes to begin with, but the changes coming from the repository didn't overlap with the local changes.}}</ref>

:* A user tries to '''check-in''' files that have been updated by others since the files were '''checked out''', and the '''revision control software''' automatically merges the files (typically, after prompting the user if it should proceed with the automatic merge, and in some cases only doing so if the merge can be clearly and reasonably resolved).
:* A set of files is '''branched''', a problem that existed before the branching is fixed in one branch, and the fix is then merged into the other branch.
:* A '''branch''' is created, the code in the files is independently edited, and the updated branch is later incorporated into a single, unified '''trunk'''.
; Promote : The act of copying file content from a less controlled location into a more controlled location. For example, from a user's workspace into a repository,  or from a stream to its parent.<ref>

; Repository : The '''repository''' is where files' current and historical data are stored, often on a server. Sometimes also called a '''depot''' (for example, by [[SVK]], [[AccuRev]] and [[Perforce]]).
; Resolve : The act of user intervention to address a conflict between different changes to the same document.
; Reverse integration : The process of merging different team branches into the main trunk of the versioning system.
; Revision : Also '''version''': A [[Software versioning|version]] is any change in form.  In [[SVK]], a Revision is the state at a point in time of the entire tree in the repository.
; Ring: {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} See '''tag'''.
; Share: The act of making one file or folder available in multiple branches at the same time. When a shared file is changed in one branch, it is changed in other branches.
; Stream : A container for branched files that has a known relationship to other such containers. Streams form a hierarchy; each stream can inherit various properties (like versions, namespace, workflow rules, subscribers, etc.) from its parent stream.
; [[Revision tag|Tag]] : A '''tag''' or '''label''' refers to an important snapshot in time, consistent across many files.  These files at that point may all be tagged with a user-friendly, meaningful name or revision number.  See [[#Baselines, labels and tags|baselines, labels and tags]].
; [[Trunk (software)|Trunk]]: The unique line of development that is not a branch (sometimes also called Baseline or Mainline)
; Update : An '''update''' (or '''sync''') merges changes made in the repository (by other people, for example) into the local '''working copy'''.<ref name="svnbook-merge"/>
; Working copy: The '''working copy''' is the local copy of files from a repository, at a specific time or revision. All work done to the files in a repository is initially done on a working copy, hence the name. Conceptually, it is a ''[[Sandbox (software development)|sandbox]]''.
