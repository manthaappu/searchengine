<html> <head> <title>Liskov substitution principle</title></head><body>'''Substitutability''' is a principle in [[object-oriented programming]]. It states that, if S is a [[subtype]] of T, then objects of [[datatype|type]] T in a [[computer program]] may be replaced with objects of type S (i.e., objects of type S may be ''substituted'' for objects of type T), without altering any of the desirable properties of that program (correctness, task performed, etc.).  More formally, the '''Liskov substitution principle''' ('''LSP''') is a particular definition of a [[subtyping]] relation, called '''(strong) behavioral subtyping''', that was initially introduced by [[Barbara Liskov]] in a 1987 conference keynote address entitled ''Data abstraction and hierarchy''. It is a [[Formal semantics of programming languages|semantic]] rather than merely syntactic relation because it intends to guarantee semantic interoperability of [[data type|types]] in a hierarchy, [[Object (computer science)|object type]]s in particular. Liskov and [[Jeannette Wing]] formulated the principle succinctly in a 1994 paper as follows:

:''Let <math>q(x)</math> be a property provable about objects <math>x</math> of type <math>T</math>. Then <math>q(y)</math> should be true for objects <math>y</math> of type <math>S</math> where <math>S</math> is a subtype of <math>T</math>.''

In the same paper, Liskov and Wing detailed their notion of behavioral subtyping in an extension of [[Hoare logic]], which bears a certain resemblance with [[Bertrand Meyer]]'s [[Design by Contract]] in that it considers the interaction of subtyping with pre- and postconditions.

== The principle ==

Liskov's notion of a behavioral subtype defines a notion of substitutability for [[mutable]] objects; that is, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program (e.g., [[correctness (computer science)|correctness]]).

Behavioral subtyping is a stronger notion than typical [[subtyping of functions]] defined in [[type theory]], which relies only on the [[covariance and contravariance (computer science)|contravariance]] of argument types and [[covariance and contravariance (computer science)|covariance]] of the return type. Behavioral subtyping is trivially [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] in general: if ''q'' is the property "method for [[halting problem|always terminates]]", then it's impossible for a program (compiler) to verify that it holds true for some subtype ''S'' of ''T'' even if ''q'' does hold for ''T''. The principle is useful however in reasoning about the design of class hierarchies.

Liskov's principle imposes some standard requirements on signatures that have been adopted in newer object-oriented programming languages (usually at the level of classes rather than types - see [[Subtype#Subtyping_schemes|nominal vs. structural subtyping]] for the distinction):

* [[covariance and contravariance (computer science)|Contravariance]] of method arguments in the subtype.
* [[covariance and contravariance (computer science)|Covariance]] of return types in the subtype.
* No new exceptions should be thrown by methods of the subtype, except where those exceptions are themselves subtypes of exceptions thrown by the methods of the supertype.

In addition to these, there is a number of behavioral conditions that subtype must meet. These are detailed in a terminology resembling that of [[design by contract]] methodology, leading to some restrictions on how contracts can interact with [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]]:

*[[Precondition]]s cannot be strengthened in a subtype.
*[[Postcondition]]s cannot be weakened in a subtype.
*[[Invariant (computer science)|Invariant]]s of the supertype must be preserved in a subtype.
* History constraint (the "history rule"). Objects are regarded as being modifiable only through their methods ([[Encapsulation (computer science)|encapsulation]]). Since subtypes may introduce methods that are not present in the supertype, the introduction of these methods may allow state changes in the subtype that are not permissible in the supertype. The history constraint prohibits this. It was the novel element introduced by Liskov and Wing. A violation of this constraint can be exemplified by defining a MutablePoint as a subtype of an ImmutablePoint. This is a violation of the history constraint, because in the history of the Immutable point, the state is always the same after creation, so it cannot include the history of a MutablePoint in general. Fields added to the subtype may however be safely modified because they are not observable through the supertype methods. One may derive a CircleWithFixedCenterButMutableRadius from ImmutablePoint without violating LSP.

== Origins ==

The rules on pre- and postconditions are identical to those introduced by Bertrand Meyer in his 1988 book. Both Meyer, and later Pierre America, who was the first to use the term ''behavioral subtyping'', gave [[proof-theoretic]] definitions of some behavioral subtyping notions, but their definitions did not take into account [[Aliasing (computing)|aliasing]] that may occur in programming language that supports references or pointers. Taking aliasing into account was the major improvement made by Liskov and Wing (1994), and a key ingredient is the history constraint. Under the definitions of Meyer and America a MutablePoint would be a behavioral subtype of ImmutablePoint, whereas LSP forbids this.

== A typical violation ==
{{further|[[Circle-ellipse problem]]}}
A typical example that violates LSP is a Square class that derives from a Rectangle class, assuming getter and setter methods exist for both width and height. The Square class always assumes that the width is equal with the height. If a Square object is used in a context where a Rectangle is expected, unexpected behavior may occur because the dimensions of a Square cannot (or rather should not) be modified independently. This problem cannot be easily fixed: if we can modify the setter methods in the Square class so that they preserve the Square invariant (i.e. keep the dimensions equal), then these methods will weaken (violate) the [[postcondition]]s for the Rectangle setters, which state that dimensions can be modified independently. Violations of LSP, like this one, may or may not be a problem in practice, depending on the postconditions or invariants that are actually expected by the code that uses classes violating LSP. Mutability is a key issue here. If Square and Rectangle had only getter methods (i.e. they were immutable objects), then no violation of LSP could occur.
