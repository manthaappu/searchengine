A '''''growth curve''''' is an empirical model of the evolution of a quantity over time. Growth curves are widely used in [[biology]] for quantities such as [[population]] size, body height or [[biomass]]. Values for the measured property can be plotted on a [[graph of a function|graph]] as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of time; see Figure 1 for an example. 

Growth curves are employed in many disciplines besides [[biology]], particularly in [[statistics]], which has an extensive literature on growth curves.<ref>

In [[mathematical statistics]], growth curves are often modeled as being [[continuous stochastic process|continuous]] [[stochastic process]]es, e.g. as being [[Sample-continuous process|sample paths]] that [[almost surely]] solve  [[stochastic differential equation]]s.<ref>

==Bacterial growth==
{{Main|Bacterial growth}}

In this example (Figure 1, see [[Lac operon]] for details) the number of [[bacterium|bacteria]] present in a nutrient-containing broth was measured during the course of an 8 hour [[cell growth]] [[experiment]]. The observed pattern of bacterial growth is bi-phasic because two different sugars were present, glucose and lactose. The bacteria prefer to consume glucose (Phase I) and only use the lactose (Phase II) after the glucose has been depleted. Analysis of the molecular basis for this bi-phasic growth curve led to the discovery of the basic mechanisms that control [[gene expression]].

==Cancer cell growth==
[[Cancer]] research is an area of biology where growth curve analysis [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Search&db=books&doptcmdl=GenBookHL&term=%22growth+curve%22%5BAll+Fields%5D+AND+cmed6%5Bbook%5D+AND+351845%5Buid%5D&rid=cmed6.section.10278] plays an important role. In many types of cancer, the rate at which [[tumor]]s shrink following [[chemotherapy]] is related to the rate of tumor growth before treatment. Tumors that grow rapidly are generally more sensitive to the toxic effects that conventional [[anticancer drugs]] have on the cancer [[cell (biology)|cell]]s. Many conventional anticancer drugs (for example, [[5-Fluoro Uracil]]) interfere with [[DNA replication]] and can cause the death of cells that attempt to replicate their DNA and divide. A rapidly growing tumor will have more actively dividing cells and more cell death upon exposure to such anticancer drugs.

[[Image:Cancergrowth.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Figure 2. Tumor growth curve.]]
In the example shown in Figure 2, a tumor is found after the cell growth rate has slowed. Most of the cancer cells are removed by surgery. The remaining cancer cells begin to proliferate rapidly and cancer chemotherapy is started. Many tumor cells are killed by the chemotherapy, but eventually some cancer cells that are resistant to the chemotherapy drug begin to grow rapidly. The chemotherapy is no longer useful and is discontinued.

==The growth of children==
Children who fall significantly below the normal range of growth curves for body height [http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/growthcharts/set1clinical/cj41c021.pdf] can be tested for [[growth hormone deficiency]] and might be treatable with hormone injections [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001176.htm].

==Exponential growth==
Some growth curves for certain biological systems display periods of [[exponential growth]]. Typically, periods of exponential growth are of limited duration due to depletion of some rate-limiting resource.
