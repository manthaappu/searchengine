'''Interactive Ruby Shell''' ('''IRB''') is a [[shell (computing)|shell]] for programming in the [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] [[scripting language]] [[Ruby programming language|Ruby]]. The program is launched from a [[Command line interface|command line]] and allows the execution of Ruby commands with immediate response, experimenting in real-time. It features [[command history]], line editing capabilities, and [[job control (Unix)|job control]], and is able to communicate directly as a [[shell script]] over the Internet and interact with a live server.  It was developed by [[Keiju Ishitsuka]].
Program usage:
 irb [ options ] [ ''programfile'' ] [ ''argument...'' ]

Example usage:
<source lang="ruby">
irb(main):001:0> n = 5
=> 5
irb(main):002:0> def fact(n)
irb(main):003:1>   if n <= 1
irb(main):004:2>     1
irb(main):005:2>   else
irb(main):006:2*     n * fact(n - 1)
irb(main):007:2>   end
irb(main):008:1> end
=> nil
irb(main):009:0> fact(n)
=> 120
