'''Nasir Gebelli''' ({{lang-fa|ناصر جبلی}}, also '''Nasser Gebelli''', born 1957) is an [[Iranian-American]] [[programmer]] and [[video game developer]]. Gebelli worked for [[Sirius Software]] and [[Square Co.|Square]] (now [[Square Enix]]), and also created his own company, [[Gebelli Software]].

==Sirius Software and Gebelli Software==
Born in [[Iran]], Gebelli later moved to the [[United States]] to study [[computer science]]. In 1980, Gebelli started Sirius Software with Jerry Jewell. While part of Sirius Software, Gebelli developed advanced graphics techniques for the [[Apple II]]. At this time, Gebelli gained a reputation for producing games at a rapid pace; among those games produced were his best-selling games, ''[[Space Eggs]]'' and ''[[Gorgon (computer game)|Gorgon]]''.

In 1981, Gebelli left Sirius to establish his own software company, Gebelli Software, through which he released ''[[Horizon V]]''. However, his company didn't prove very successful, and the [[video game crash of 1983]] sounded the death knell for Gebelli Software.

==Time at Square==

After Gebelli Software went bankrupt, Gebelli went on a long vacation traveling the world. He resurfaced in 1986 and went to visit his friend [[Doug Carlston]], owner of [[Brøderbund]]. Gebelli was interested in developing games again; Carlston told him about the rise of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and that Nasir should start programming on it. Gebelli was interested, and so Doug offered to fly to [[Japan]] with Nasir and introduce him to his friends at [[Nintendo]] and Square. Nasir met with [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] at Nintendo and several people at Square. Nintendo was apparently uninterested; the programmers at Square (especially [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], a long-time fan of Gebelli's work), however, were aware of Nasir's reputation and were excited to have him join.

Gebelli arrived at Square around the same time as [[Akitoshi Kawazu]] and [[Takashi Tokita]] became employed there. Along with Sakaguchi, their combined appearance culminated in the separation of the “[[Square Co.|Square]]” label from parent software company [[Denyuusha]].

While at Square, Nasir first programmed the game ''Tobidase Daisakusen'' for the [[Famicom Disk System]], which released in the U.S. as ''[[3-D Worldrunner]]'' for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]; his second Square project was ''[[Rad Racer]]''. Gebelli then teamed up with Sakaguchi, [[Nobuo Uematsu]], and [[Yoshitaka Amano]] as part of Square's A-Team to produce ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]''. He went on to program ''[[Final Fantasy II]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy III]]''. Midway through the development on these two games Gebelli was forced to return to [[Sacramento, California]] from Japan due to an expired work visa. The rest of the development staff followed him to Sacramento with needed materials and equipment and finished production of the games there.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mielke |first=James |authorlink= |coauthors=[[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] |year= |month= |title= |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]] |volume= |issue=232 |pages= |id= |url= |accessdate=2008-08-01 |quote=[...] So for ''Final Fantasy II'' and ''III'', our staff actually brought all the equipment, everything that was necessary to finish those games, to Sacramento, because (Gebelli) couldn't come back to Japan. [...] We finished ''Final Fantasy II'' and ''III'' in Sacramento, California. [''Laughs''] }}</ref> After completing ''Final Fantasy III'', Gebelli took another long vacation and later returned to work on ''[[Secret of Mana]]''. Nasir has since been succeeded (for the most part) by [[Ken Narita (programmer)|Ken Narita]].

==Life after Square==

Following ''Secret of Mana's'' completion, Gebelli once again disappeared to travel the world, essentially retiring with income from Square royalties.

In August 1998, Gebelli reappeared to attend [[John Romero|John Romero's]] 1998 Apple II Reunion in [[Dallas, Texas]] at the [[Ion Storm]] offices.

Currently, Nasir lives in [[Sacramento, California]], where he has lived most of his life. Sakaguchi and Nasir remain great friends.
