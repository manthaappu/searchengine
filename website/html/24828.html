<html> <head> <title>Moby Project</title></head><body>The '''Moby Project''' is a collection of public-domain lexical resources. It was created by [[Grady Ward]]. The resources were dedicated to the public domain, and are now mirrored at [[Project Gutenberg]]. {{As of|2007}}, it contains the largest free phonetic database, with 177,267 words and corresponding pronunciation.

==Hyphenator==
The '''Moby Hyphenator II''' contains 187,175 hyphenated words, with 9,752 indicating that they should not be hyphenated. Hyphenation is indicated by a character value 165 (hex A5).

==Language==
'''Moby Language II''' contains wordlists of five languages - [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]:

However, some of the lists are contaminated, for example the Japanese list contains English words such as ''abnormal'' and non-words such as ''abcdefgh'' and ''m,./''.

==Part-of-Speech==
'''Moby Part-of-Speech''' contains 233,356 words fully described by [[Lexical category|part(s) of speech]], listed in priority order. The format of the file is ''word\parts-of-speech'', with the following parts of speech being identified:

==Pronunciator==
The '''Moby Pronunciator II''' contains 177,267 words with corresponding pronunciation. The Project Gutenberg distribution also contains a copy of the [[cmudict]] v0.3. The file follows the format ''word[/part-of-speech] pronunciation''. The part-of-speech field is used to disambiguate 770 of the words which have differing pronunciations depending on their part-of-speech. For example for the words spelled ''close,'' the verb has the pronunciation {{IPA-en|ˈkloʊz|}}, whereas the adjective is {{IPA|/ˈkloʊs/}}. The parts-of-speech have been assigned the following codes:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Part-of-speech
! Code
|-
| [[Noun]]
| n
|-
| [[Verb]]
| v
|-
| [[Adjective]]
| aj
|-
| [[Adverb]]
| av
|-
| [[Interjection]]
| interj
|}

Following this is the pronunciation. Several special symbols are present:
