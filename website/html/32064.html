:''Not to be confused with [[Richard A. Karp]], one of the developers of [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]].''

'''Richard Manning Karp''' (born January 3, 1935) is a [[computer scientist]] and [[computational theorist]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], notable for research in the [[theory of algorithms]], for which he received a [[Turing Award]] in 1985, [[The Franklin Institute Awards|The Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science in 2004]], and the [[Kyoto Prize]] in 2008.<ref>http://www.inamori-f.or.jp/laureates/k24_a_richard/prs_e.html</ref>

== Biography ==
Born to Abraham and Rose Karp in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], Karp has three younger siblings: Robert, [[David A. Karp|David]], and Carolyn.  He attended [[Harvard University]], where he received his [[Bachelor's degree]] in 1955, his [[Master's degree]] in 1956, and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[applied mathematics]] in 1959. 

He started working at [[IBM]]'s [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]]. In 1968, he became Professor of Computer Science, Mathematics, and Operations Research at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Apart from a 4-year period as a professor at the [[University of Washington]], he has remained at Berkeley. From 1988 to 1995 and 1999 to the present he has also been a Research Scientist at the [[International Computer Science Institute]] in Berkeley, where he currently leads the Algorithms Group. 

Richard Karp was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]], and was the recipient of the Harvey Prize of the [[Technion]]  and the 2004 [[Franklin Institute#The Benjamin Franklin Awards|Benjamin Franklin Medal]] in Computer and Cognitive Science for his insights into [[computational complexity]]. In 1994 he was inducted as a [[Fellow]] of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]. He is the recipient of several honorary degrees.

== Work ==
He has made many other important discoveries in computer science and [[operations research]] in the area of [[Combinatorial optimization|combinatorial algorithm]]s. His major current research interests include [[bioinformatics]].

In 1971 he co-developed with [[Jack Edmonds]] the [[Edmonds–Karp algorithm]] for solving the max-flow problem on networks, and in 1972 he published a landmark paper in complexity theory, "Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems", in which he proved [[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems|21 Problems to be NP-complete]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Richard M. Karp | chapter = [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~luca/cs172/karp.pdf Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems] | title = Complexity of Computer Computations | editor = R. E. Miller and J. W. Thatcher (editors) | publisher = New York: Plenum | pages = 85&ndash;103 | year = 1972}}</ref>

In 1973 he and [[John Hopcroft]] published the [[Hopcroft–Karp algorithm]], still the fastest known method for finding maximum cardinality [[Matching (graph theory)|matchings]] in [[bipartite graph]]s.

In 1980, along with [[Richard J. Lipton]], Karp proved the [[Karp-Lipton theorem]] (which proves that, if [[Boolean satisfiability problem|SAT]] can be solved by [[Boolean circuit]]s with a polynomial number of [[logic gate]]s, then the [[polynomial hierarchy]] collapses to its second level).

In 1987 he co-developed with [[Michael O. Rabin]] the [[Rabin-Karp string search algorithm]]. 

=== Turing Award ===
His citation<ref>    {{cite web |url=http://awards.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3256708&srt=all&aw=140&ao=AMTURING&yr=1985 |title=ACM Award Citation/Richard M. Karp |author=Association for Computing Machinery |publisher= |accessdate=2010-01-17}}</ref> for the Turing Award was as follows:

:''For his continuing contributions to the theory of algorithms including the development of efficient algorithms for network flow and other combinatorial optimization problems, the identification of polynomial-time computability with the intuitive notion of algorithmic efficiency, and, most notably, contributions to the theory of [[NP-complete]]ness. Karp introduced the now standard methodology for proving problems to be NP-complete which has led to the identification of many theoretical and practical problems as being computationally difficult.''
