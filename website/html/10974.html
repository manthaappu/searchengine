The '''Donut Peering Model''' is used to describe the interconnection of non-[[Tier 1 network]]s which make up much of the Internet. Any networks which interconnect directly and therefore "peer around" the former core [[Tier 1 network]]s avoid those networks.  The traffic between those networks therefore can be modeled in a toroidal shape, which then provides the reference to a donut.<ref name=DgoldDonut>{{cite web|url=http://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog27/presentations/golding.pdf|title=Dan Golding's Donut Peering Presentation}}</ref>

Inherent to being a Tier 2 Internet provider, is having to pay for IP transit with Tier 1 providers.  A way to keep costs down and increase the speed of internet traffic is for Tier 2 networks to peer directly with each other, creating a faster, more-direct path for traffic between the networks to travel.  An example of this is to consider the traditional flow of traffic, via Tier 1 providers where there are generally at least 2 networks that the data must traverse in order to get to the final end-user.  In the Tier 2 example, based on the Donut Peering model,  the Broadband providerâ€™s end-user would access the network Provider by initiating an internet query ([[hop (networking)|hop]] 1), directly peering with the [[content provider]], bypassing the Tier 1 network hand-off and sends the data query directly to the Content provider (hop 2) which delivers it to the end- user. In this example the network connection does not touch the Tier 1 provider network.  The data takes a more direct path, with less chance for increased [[packet loss]] or [[latency (engineering)|latency]].
