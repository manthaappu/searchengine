The '''NetWare Core Protocol''' ('''NCP''') is a network protocol used in some products from [[Novell, Inc.]] It is usually associated with the [[Novell NetWare|NetWare]] operating system, but parts of it have been implemented on other platforms such as [[Linux]], [[Windows NT]] and various flavors of [[Unix]]. 

It is used to access [[File server|file]], [[Print server|print]], [[Directory service|directory]], [[clock synchronization]], messaging, remote command execution and other network service functions. [[TCP/IP]] and [[IPX/SPX]] (obsoleted, [[technical support]] is provided only for [[Novell NetWare|NetWare]] platform) are the supported underlying protocols. [[TCP/IP]] implementations use [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]/[[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] port 524 and rely on [[Service Location Protocol|SLP]] for name resolution.

[[Novell eDirectory]] uses NCP for synchronizing data changes between the servers in a [[directory service]] tree.
