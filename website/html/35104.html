'''Sophia Bekele''' ([[Amharic]]: ሶፕህአ በቀለ; [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]]) is a business and corporate [[Senior management|executive]] and writer.  She is the founder and [[CEO]] of CBS International, a private California-based firm engaged in [[technology transfer]] to [[emerging economies]], and SbCommunications Network, an Ethiopian IT company. In 2002 SbCNet was known for being successfully awarded a highly controversial bid for a government contract to build an integrated information network infrastructure for the [[Ethiopian Parliament]].  Bekele was also an elected member of the [[ICANN]] Council of the GNSO (Generic Names Supporting Organization), which advises on global internet policy.  She has served on [[United Nations]]-sponsored committees, such as the [[UNECA]]-sponsored African Information Society Initiative (AISI), where she represents the private sector in discussions about the economic development of Africa. She is also involved with the creation of policies towards bridging the economic gap between Africa and other economies, through the use of [[Information and communication technologies]] (ICT).

== Early life and work ==
Bekele is the daughter of Ato Bekele Eshete Wolde Michael, a businessman who was engaged in various sectors of the Ethiopian economy, also a founder and Board Director of United Bank,S.C and United Insurance,S.C one of the first and largest Banks and Insurance institutions in Ethiopia <ref>{{cite news|work=[[Capital Ethiopia]]|author=Staff|title= Exclusive Interview|pages=1, 22|url=http://www.old.capitalethiopia.com/archive/2009/august/week4/interview.htm|date=2009-11-17|accessdate=2010-05-19}}</ref> and Sister Mulualem Beyene Engida, a medical nurse. She attended a private Catholic high school, then traveled to America to acquire her [[Bachelor's Degree]] in Business Analysis and Information Systems at [[San Francisco State University]]. Recruited out of college by [[Bank of America]], she began working in [[information security]].<ref name=kaufman>{{cite web|url=http://cbsintl.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/prodigal-prodigy-cbs-international-sophia-bekele.pdf|publisher=Golden Gate University|date=June 2002 |format=editorial|author=Kaufman, K|title=CBS International|accessdate=2008-04-30}}</ref> She earned her [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) in management [[Information Systems]] from [[Golden Gate University]], also in San Francisco, California, which led to managerial positions with [[UnionBanCal Corporation]] and then [[PriceWaterhouseCoopers]].

== International work ==
In 1998, Bekele left the corporate world and spent time traveling around the globe, visiting [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Latin America]] and [[Africa]], before launching a new career as an [[entrepreneur]].<ref name=kaufman/> She started CBS International, a company based in California, with a mission to transfer technology to [[emerging economies]]. As an affiliate of CBS International, Bekele also set up a local company in her home country of Ethiopia, SbCommunications Network, plc, specializing in systems integration and dedicated to serving emerging economies. 

Concurrently, Bekele was appointed as an advisor to the United Nations African Information Society Initiative (AISI), an institutional framework by [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa]] (UNECA), to build the first African Information and Communications Infrastructure.

During her first two years in Africa, Bekele built business alliances with local and international firms, where she became known for her efforts to adapt Western business methods and practices into the traditional Ethiopian business model.<ref name=kaufman/>  Her efforts paid off when Bekele brought and won her first multi-million international contract to her local company, CBS with United Nations Agency for Project Services, to deploy a turnkey fiberoptic-based information technology infrastruture, for the [[African Union]] General Secretariat.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS wins OAU's largest IT project|author= Capital Ethiopia|work=Capital Ethiopia|date=1999-02-07|accessdate=2008-11-10|url=http://cbsintl.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/cbs-wins-oaus-largest-it-project-2-pages.pdf}}</ref>  In 2002, SbCnet was awarded a multi million dollar international contract for the implementation of an integrated data networking infrastructure project at the [[Ethiopian Parliament]]. The Ethiopian business weekly, ''[[Addis Fortune]]'', referred to it as the most controversial contract that the government had.  Originally awarded to Bekele's competitor GCS in 2001, Bekele's company, which had been second on the list, issued immediate complaints.  Reportedly with aggressive lobbying by Bekele, the bid was audited,<ref>{{cite news|title=Auditor says Parliament's IT Project award improper|author=Dejene, Mary|work=Addis Fortune |date=2001-08-05|accessdate=2008-05-02|url=http://cbsintl.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/auditor-says-parliament-award-improper.pdf}}</ref> and it was determined that the awarding of the contract had been improper, and the Parliament reversed the decision and awarded the bid to Bekele's company in 2002.<ref name=justice-served>{{cite news|work=[[Addis Fortune]]|date=2002-01-06 |author=Giorgis, Tamrat G.|title=Is Justice Served?|pages=5|url=http://cbsintl.files.wordpress.com/2007/12/is-justice-served-by-sophia-bekele.pdf}}</ref> 

{{quote|It is almost possible to assume that the private press has, for all practical intentions narrowed down on the '[[sensationalist]]' value of the story without considering the core values of the process at stake and the precedent setting process at work in this matter. Precedence is being set, because this is the first time since the renaissance of our democracy that an illegally awarded contract on a national scale project has been successfully suspended, cancelled and reversed in the interest of higher ideals.|Sophia Bekele, writing a May 2002 opinion column in the ''[[Addis Fortune]]'',<ref>{{cite news|title=yes, justice has been served|author=Sophia Bekele|work=Addis Fortune|date=2001-08-05|accessdate=2008-05-02|url=http://cbsintl.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/yes-justice-has-been-done-by-sophia-bekele-for-fortune.pdf}}</ref>}}

After the contracting controversy, Bekele's next encounter was the issue of the elite private sector business in Ethiopia, specifically what she regarded as the illegitimate formation of a [[stock exchange]].  She wrote an editorial claiming that this entity was planned without the proper rules, regulations, infrastructure and controls: 

{{quote|...it is better for us to have a proper open stock market where market forces determine the price of a share and security instruments...and should not be left to the machinations of a Share Dealing Group...the truth of the matter is that Addis Ababa [[Chamber of commerce]] cannot be both the sponsor and the regulator (oversight) according to the by-laws of the group... Government is the only agency that could put the regulatory frameworks and principles under which a proper stock exchange or [[commodities exchange]] can exist.|Sophia Bekele, writing a June 2002 opinion column in the "[[Addis Fortune]]",<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Addis Fortune]]|date=2002-06-10|author=Sophia Bekele|title=View Point:Share Dealing Group vs. Stock Exchange Preventing a Travesty|pages=11, 16|accessdate=2008-04-30|url=http://cbsintl.files.wordpress.com/2007/12/share-dealing-group-comment-on-proposal-for-ethiopian-stock-market-sophia-bekele.pdf}}</ref>}}  
 
To her vindication, the government eventually rejected the proposal for the share dealing group in November 2002.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Addis Fortune]]|author=Giorgis, Tamrat G.|title=Sufian Rejects Share Dealing Launch|pages=1, 2|url=http://cbsintl.files.wordpress.com/2007/12/is-justice-served-by-sophia-bekele.pdf|date=2002-11-17|accessdate=2008-05-02}}</ref> As a followup, though there was no direct link with Bekele, in April 2008 the Ethiopian government launched a commodities exchange market, aimed at boosting fair trade and stabilizing its food market.<ref>{{cite news|work=News Blaze|date=2008-01-11|author=Phillip Kurata|title=Ethiopia Launches Commodities Exchange to develop Agriculture|url=

Focusing on the US market since 2003, Bekele and her company consult for clients in public/private markets, primarily in corporate governance and risk management areas, including the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002. She also advises in corporate relations/communications programs within public companies.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[ICANN]]|author=ICANN Press Release|title=Biographical Information on the Nominees|url=http://nomcom.icann.org/candidate-bios-2005.htm|date=2005-11-04}}</ref>
