<html> <head> <title>Arc pair grammar</title></head><body>In linguistics, '''Arc Pair grammar''' is a [[syntactic]] theory developed by [[David E. Johnson]] and [[Paul Postal]] which is a formalized continuation of [[relational grammar]] developed by [[David M. Perlmutter]] and Postal.

Like relational grammar, arc pair grammar is greatly concerned with [[grammatical relation]]s (as opposed to the [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] structure focus of other [[generative grammar|generative]] theories like versions of Chomskyan [[transformational grammar]]).  In contrast to the generative-enumerative (proof-theoretic) approach to syntax assumed by transformational grammar, arc pair grammar takes a model-theoretic approach. In arc pair grammar, linguistic laws and language-specific rules of grammar are formalized in the same manner, namely, as logical statements in an axiomatic theory. Further, sentences of a language, understood as structures of a certain type, are the models of the set of linguistic laws and language-specific statements, thereby reducing the notion of grammaticality to the logical notion of model-theoretic satisfaction.

For a brief history of early work on relational grammar and arc pair grammar, see Newmeyer, 1980. For a more detailed history of model-theoretic approaches in linguistics, see Pullum and Scholtz, 2005 and Pullum, 2007.
