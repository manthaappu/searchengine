In [[geometry]], two [[diameter]]s of a [[conic section]] are said to be '''conjugate''' if each [[chord (geometry)|chord]] [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to one diameter is [[bisection|bisected]] by the other.  For example, two diameters of a [[circle]] are conjugate if and only if they are [[perpendicular]].

For an [[ellipse]], two diameters are conjugate if and only if the [[tangent line]] to the ellipse at the endpoint of one diameter is parallel to the other. Each pair of conjugate diameters of an ellipse has a corresponding tangent [[parallelogram]], sometimes called a '''bounding parallelogram'''.  In his manuscript [[De motu corporum in gyrum]], and in the '[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica‎|Principia]]', [[Isaac Newton]] cites as a [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] proved by previous authors that all (bounding) parallelograms for a given ellipse have the same [[area]].

It is possible to [[Compass and straightedge constructions|reconstruct]] an ellipse from any pair of conjugate diameters, or from any bounding parallelogram.  For example, in [[proposition]] 14 of Book VIII of his ''Collection'', [[Pappus of Alexandria]] gives a method for constructing the axes of an ellipse from a given pair of conjugate diameters.

Two [[hyperbola]]s are conjugate if they are images of each other in a [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] across an [[asymptote]]. A diameter of one hyperbola is conjugate to its reflection in the asymptote, which is a diameter of the other hyperbola. They are [[hyperbolic-orthogonal]] to each other. In a [[spacetime]] plane, one hyperbola corresponds to events a constant [[distance]] from the origin event, the other hyperbola corresponds to events a constant [[proper time]] from it. The [[principle of relativity]] can be formulated as "Any pair of conjugate diameters of conjugate hyperbolas can be taken for the axes of space and time", as indicated by [[E. T. Whittaker]] in 1910.
