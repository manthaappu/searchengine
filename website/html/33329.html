'''SciPlore MindMapping''' is a [[mind mapping]] application written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. It is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] and based on the open source software [[FreeMind]]. The focus of SciPlore MindMapping is on combining mind maps with PDF and reference management. It is especially suited for the needs of researchers and scientists as it offers four unique features.<ref name=heise>{{Citation | contribution=SciPlore MindMapping auf Heise| contribution-url=http://www.heise.de/software/download/sciplore_mindmapping_ehemals_freemind_scholar/65482 | title=SciPlore MindMapping (ehemals FreeMind Scholar) Beta 11 | year=2010, September}}</ref>:

* Adding Reference Keys Manually: With this feature, researchers can assign a reference key to the node of a mind map. This way researchers can reference their sources from within the mind map.

* Adding Reference Keys (BibTeX) Automatically: If a file (e.g. PDF) is linked from a mind map and the same file is linked in the bibliographic database (BibTeX), SciPlore MindMapping extracts the BibTeX key and assigns it to the corresponding node in the mind map.

* PDF Bookmark Import: When a user drag&drops a PDF to a mind map, all bookmarks of the PDF are imported as separate nodes and each of the nodes is linked to the PDF file. 

* PDF Monitoring: When new PDFs are stored in a folder on the user's hard drive, these PDFs are listed in the mind map.

SciPlore MindMapping is supposed to be the first mind mapping tool that integrates mind mapping with reference management and enables the import of PDF bookmarks.<ref name=boukobza09>{{Citation | first=Philippe | last=Boukubza | contribution=SciPlore MindMapping | contribution-url=http://www.visual-mapping.com/2009/11/based-on-freemind-and-free-sciplore.html | title=Visual Mapping: Mind Mapping, Design and Social Media | year=2009, November}}</ref> The software maintains a compatible file format to [[FreeMind]] 0.9.
