'''Design By Numbers''' (or DBN) was an influential experiment in teaching programming initiated at the [[MIT Media Lab]] during the 1990s. Led by [[John Maeda]] and his students they created software aimed at allowing designers, artists and other non-programmers to easily start [[computer programming]]. The software itself could be run in a browser and published alongside the software was a book and [[courseware]].

Design By Numbers is no longer an active project but has gone on to influence many other projects aimed at making [[computer programming]] more accessible to non-technical people. Its most public result is [[Processing (programming language)|Processing]], created by Maeda's students [[Casey Reas]] and [[Ben Fry]], who built on the work of DBN and has gone on to international success.
