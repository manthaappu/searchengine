'''Clarksfield''' is the code name for an [[Intel]] processor, initially sold as mobile [[Intel Core i7]].<ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/article/152473/intel_mobile_nehalem.html Mobile Nehalem Chips May Come in Late 2009]. PCWorld (2008-10-19). Retrieved on 2011-01-14.</ref> It is closely related to the desktop [[Lynnfield (microprocessor)|Lynnfield]] processor, both use quad-core dies based on the [[45 nm]]
[[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem microarchitecture]] and have integrated [[PCI Express]] and [[Direct Media Interface|DMI]] links.

The predecessor of Clarksfield, [[Penryn (microprocessor)#Penryn-QC|Penryn-QC]] was a [[multi-chip module]] with two dual-core Penryn dies based on [[Penryn (microarchitecture)|Penryn microarchitecture]], a shrink of [[Core (microarchitecture)|Core microarchitecture]]. The name of the direct successor of Clarksfield has not been announced. [[Arrandale (microprocessor)|Arrandale]] is a later mobile processor but opens a new line of mid-range dual-core processors with integrated graphics.

At the time of its release at the [[Intel Developer Forum]] on September 23, 2009, Clarksfield processors were significantly faster than any other laptop processor,<ref>[http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=3647 Mobile Core i7 920XM, Clarksfield: Nehalem on-the-go – AnandTech :: Your Source for Hardware Analysis and News]. AnandTech. Retrieved on 2011-01-14.</ref> including the Core 2 Extreme QX9300. The initial laptop manufacturers shipping products based on Clarksfield processors include MSI, Dell/Alienware, Hewlett-Packard, Toshiba and Asustek.<ref>[http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2353228,00.asp Intel Execs Introduce Clarksfield, Tout Mobility | News & Opinion].

== Brand names ==
As of September 2009, all Clarksfield processors are marketed as Core i7, in three product lines differing in thermal design power and the amount of third-level cache that is enabled.
See the respective lists for details about each model.
