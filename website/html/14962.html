<html> <head> <title>Generalized additive model</title></head><body>In [[statistics]], the '''generalized additive model (GAM)''' is a [[statistical model]] developed by [[Trevor Hastie]] and [[Rob Tibshirani]] for blending properties of [[generalized linear model]]s with [[additive model]]s.

The model specifies a distribution (such as a [[normal distribution]], or a [[binomial distribution]]) and a link function ''g'' relating the expected value of the distribution to the predictors, and attempts to fit functions ''f''<sub>''i''</sub>(''x''<sub>''i''</sub>) to satisfy:

: <math>g(\operatorname{E}(Y))=\beta_0 + f_1(x_1) + f_2(x_2)+ \cdots + f_m(x_m).\,\!</math>

The functions ''f''<sub>''i''</sub>(''x''<sub>''i''</sub>) may be fit using parametric or [[Nonparametric regression |non-parametric means]], thus providing the potential for better fits to data than other methods. The method hence is very general &ndash; a typical GAM might use a scatterplot smoothing function such as a locally weighted mean for ''f''<sub>1</sub>(''x''<sub>1</sub>), and then use a factor model for ''f''<sub>2</sub>(''x''<sub>2</sub>). By allowing nonparametric fits, well designed GAMs allow good fits to the training data with relaxed assumptions on the actual relationship, perhaps at the expense of interpretability of results.

[[Overfitting]] can be a problem with GAMs.  The number of smoothing parameters can be specified, and this number should be reasonably small, certainly well under the [[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] offered by the data. [[Cross-validation (statistics)|Cross-validation]] can be used to detect and/or reduce overfitting problems with GAMs (or other statistical methods). Other models such as [[Generalized linear model|GLMs]]  may be preferable to GAMs unless GAMs improve predictive ability substantially for the application in question.
