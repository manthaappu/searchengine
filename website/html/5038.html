'''CG''' is a term most commonly known in the West for its use in [[Japan]]ese webpages to denote digital artwork. In traditional Japanese, it is an abbreviation of the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[gairaigo]] {{nihongo|'''[[computer graphics]]'''|コンピュータグラフィックス}}, used to refer to any form of digital artwork, from digitally shaded [[dōjinshi]] to legitimate [[film|cinematic]] art (like ''[[Toy Story]]''). In the West, however, the term has come to refer exclusively to 2D digital art, as the term [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) is used to describe art forms that CG otherwise describes. In recent years, the [[hentai]] industry has begun to incorporate this into their market schemes.
