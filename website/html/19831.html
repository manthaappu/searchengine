'''''Jed the Humanoid''''' is a song on the 2000 album ''[[The Sophtware Slump]]'' released by the [[Modesto, California]] [[indie-rock]] band [[Grandaddy]]. The song is an elegy for an [[Android (robot)|android]] who [[alcoholism|drinks himself to death]],<ref name=Telegraph>{{cite web

Songwriter [[Jason Lytle]] explained that much like Modesto's famous former resident, [[George Lucas]], growing up "he had nothing better to do than dream up robots."<ref name=Telegraph/>

In the song, the inventors of the bona fide thinking, feeling robot lament leaving town and returning to find that Jed has raided the liquor cabinet and [[suicide|killed himself]].<ref>{{cite web
