'''OpenSolaris''' ({{pron-en|ˈoʊpən sɵˈlɑrɨs}}) was an [[open source]] computer [[operating system]] based on [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] created by [[Sun Microsystems]], now a part of [[Oracle Corporation]]. It was also the name of the project initiated by Sun to build a developer and user community around the software. After the acquisition of Sun Microsystems, Oracle decided to discontinue open development of the core software, and replaced the OpenSolaris distribution model with the commercial [[Solaris_(operating_system)#Development_release|Solaris Express]].<ref name="mail.opensolaris.org"/>

Prior to Oracle's moving of core development behind closed doors, a group of former OpenSolaris developers decided to "[[Fork (software development)|fork]]" the core software, and development of an OpenSolaris-based core OS continues under a community project called [[Illumos]]. The [[OpenIndiana]] project, a part of the Illumos Foundation, aims to continue OpenSolaris development and distribution, using Illumos as its core.<ref name="OpenIndianaSite">{{cite web |url=http://openindiana.org/ |title=Welcome to Project OpenIndiana! |date=10 September 2010 |publisher=Project OpenIndiana |accessdate=28 September 2010}}</ref>

OpenSolaris is a descendant of the [[UNIX System V]] [[UNIX System V#SVR4|Release 4]] (SVR4) codebase developed by Sun and [[AT&T]] in the late 1980s. It is the only version of the System V variant of UNIX available as open source.<ref>The [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] variant of UNIX, on which versions of [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] prior to Solaris 2 (= [[SunOS]] 5) were based, has been open-source since June 1994.</ref> OpenSolaris is  developed as a combination of several software ''consolidations'' which were open sourced subsequent to [[Solaris 10]]. It includes a variety of [[free software]], including popular [[desktop]] and [[Server (computing)|server]] software.<ref>

</ref> Sun has announced that future versions of its commercial Solaris operating system will be based on the OpenSolaris project.

On Friday, August 13, 2010, details started to emerge relating to the restructuring of the OpenSolaris project, the pending release of the new future commercial version of Solaris, Solaris 11, and how open source community interactions are being adjusted.<ref>

==History==
{{further|[[Solaris (operating system)#History|Solaris: History]]}}
OpenSolaris was based on Solaris, which was originally released by [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] in 1991. Solaris is a version of [[UNIX System V]] [[UNIX System V#SVR4|Release 4]] (SVR4), jointly developed by Sun and [[AT&T]] to merge features from several existing [[Unix]] systems. It was licensed by Sun from [[Novell]] to replace [[SunOS]].<ref>

Planning for OpenSolaris started in early 2004. A pilot program was formed in September 2004 with 18 non-Sun community members and ran for 9 months growing to 145 external participants.<ref>

The first part of the Solaris code base to be open sourced was the Solaris Dynamic Tracing facility (commonly known as [[DTrace]]), a tool that aids in the analysis, debugging, and tuning of applications and systems. DTrace was released under the CDDL on January 25, 2005 on the newly launched ''opensolaris.org'' website.<ref>

To direct the newly-fledged project, a Community Advisory Board was announced on April 4, 2005: two were elected by the pilot community, two were employees appointed by Sun, and one was appointed from the broader [[free software community]] by Sun. The members were [[Roy Fielding]], Al Hopper, Rich Teer, Casper Dik, and [[Simon Phipps (programmer)|Simon Phipps]]. On February 10, 2006 Sun approved ''The OpenSolaris Charter'', which reestablished this body as the independent OpenSolaris Governing Board.<ref>

On August 13, 2010, Oracle was rumored to have discontinued the OpenSolaris binary distribution to focus on the Solaris Express binary distribution program.

Internal email was released by an OpenSolaris kernel developer but was unconfirmed by Oracle.<ref>

There was a post confirming the leak posted to the OpenSolaris Forums on August 13, 2010. Upstream contributions will continue through a new Oracle web site, downstream source code publishing will continue, binary distribution will continue under the old Solaris Express model, but release of source code will occur after binary cuts, and binary cuts will become less frequent.<ref>

On September 14, 2010, [[OpenIndiana]] was formally launched at the [[Joint Information Systems Committee|JISC]] Centre in [[London]].  While OpenIndiana is a fork in the technical sense, it is a continuation of OpenSolaris in spirit: the project intends to deliver a System V family operating system which is binary-compatible with the Oracle products Solaris 11 and Solaris 11 Express. However, rather than being based around the [[OS/Net|OS/Net consolidation]] like OpenSolaris was, OpenIndiana will become a distribution built up around [[Illumos]] [[kernel (computing)|kernel]] (the first release is still based around OS/Net). The project does use the same IPS package management system as OpenSolaris.<ref name="OIWikiFAQ"/>

On November 12, 2010, a final build of OpenSolaris (134b) was published by Oracle to the /release repository to serve as an upgrade path to Solaris 11 Express.

Oracle Solaris 11 Express 2010.11, a preview of Solaris 11 and the first release of the post-OpenSolaris distribution from Oracle, was released on November 15, 2010.<ref>

==Release model==
[[File:OpenSolaris-screenshot-2009-06.png|thumb|OpenSolaris 2009.06 x86 LiveCD GNOME with terminal.]]
OpenSolaris is offered as both '''development''' (unstable) and '''production''' (stable) releases. 
* '''Development''' releases are built from the latest OpenSolaris codebase (consolidations) and include newer technologies, security updates and bug fixes, and more applications, but may not have undergone extensive testing.
* '''Production''' releases are branched from a snapshot of the development codebase (following a [[code freeze]]) and undergo a [[Quality assurance|QA]] process that includes [[backport]]ing security updates and bug fixes.

OpenSolaris can be installed from [[CD-ROM]], [[USB]] drives, or over a network with the Automated Installer.<ref>[http://dlc.sun.com/osol/docs/content/dev/AIinstall/ OpenSolaris 2010.03 Automated Installer Guide]</ref> CD, USB, and network install images are made available for both types of releases.<ref>[http://www.genunix.org/ OpenSolaris distributions and development releases]</ref>

===Repositories===
OpenSolaris uses a network-aware [[package management system]] called the ''[[Image Packaging System]]'' (also known as pkg(5)) to add, remove, and manage installed software and to update to newer releases.

Packages for development releases of OpenSolaris are published by Oracle typically every two weeks to the ''/dev'' repository.<ref>[http://pkg.opensolaris.org/dev/ OpenSolaris Development Release Packaging Repository]</ref><ref>

==Documentation==
A [[hardware compatibility list]] (HCL) for OpenSolaris can be consulted when choosing hardware for OpenSolaris deployment.<ref>[http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/hcl/data/os/ OpenSolaris Hardware Compatibility List (HCL)]</ref>

Extensive OpenSolaris administration, usage, and development documentation is available online,<ref>[http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Main/documentation OpenSolaris documentation page]</ref> including community-contributed information.<ref>[http://wikis.sun.com/display/OpenSolarisInfo/Home OpenSolaris information resources home wiki]</ref>

Sun has released most of the Solaris source code under the ''Common Development and Distribution License'' (CDDL), which is based on the [[Mozilla Public License]] (MPL) version 1.1.
