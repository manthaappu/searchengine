'''Oberon''' is an [[operating system]] developed in the late 1980s at [[ETH Zürich]] using the [[Oberon (programming language)|Oberon programming language]]. It has an innovative visual text-based [[user interface]] for activating commands.

== History ==

The Oberon operating system was originally developed as part of the [[NS320xx|NS32032]]-based [[Ceres (workstation)|Ceres]] workstation project. It is written almost entirely in the [[Oberon (programming language)|Oberon]] [[programming language]]. The basic system was designed and implemented by a team of two part-time programmers at [[ETH Zürich]] (ETHZ), [[Niklaus Wirth]] and Jürg Gutknecht. It was later extended and ported to other hardware by a team at ETHZ.

== User interface ==

Oberon has a [[text user interface]] (TUI). It combines the point-and-click convenience of a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) with the linguistic strength of a [[command line interface]] (CLI) and is closely tied to naming conventions of the Oberon language. Any text appearing on the screen can be edited and used as command input.  Nothing like a [[prompt (computing)|prompt]] is required.  Although radical, the TUI is efficient and powerful.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}  It has yet to appear in more commonplace operating systems, although it strongly inspired [[Rob Pike]]'s [[Acme (text editor)|Acme]] system under [[Plan 9 From Bell Labs|Plan 9]]. Whether it inspired the worksheet interface of the
[[Macintosh Programmer's Workshop]] or vice versa is difficult to decide since the Oberon  System and its TUI was based on Wirth's previous computer design the [[Lilith (computer)|Lilith]] and both, the Apple [[Macintosh (computer)|Macintosh]] and the [[Lilith (computer)|Lilith]] were inspired by the [[Alto (computer)|Alto]].

== Versions and availability ==

The Oberon OS is available for several other hardware platforms, generally in no cost versions. It is typically extremely compact. Even with an Oberon [[compiler]], assorted utilities including a [[web browser]], [[TCP/IP]] networking, and a GUI, the entire package fits on a single 3.5" [[floppy disk]]. The version which runs on bare PC hardware is called [[Native Oberon]].

There is also a version called Oberon V4 that is closer to the original operating system developed by N. Wirth.  It was also developed at ETHZ, but the most recent version is at [http://www.ssw.uni-linz.ac.at/Oberon.html Linz university]. Oberon V4 appears to be orphaned, there are almost no changes since 2000.

The computer science department at ETHZ has in recent years begun exploring [[active objects]] and [[concurrency]] for operating systems, and has released an early version of a new language [[Active Oberon|Active Object Oberon]] and a new operating system for it, first called AOS and now called A2 and/or [[Bluebottle OS|Bluebottle]]. It is available from ETHZ with most source via the [[Internet]]. Versions are currently available for Intel [[IA-32]] single and multi-processor systems and for the [[StrongARM]] CPU family.
