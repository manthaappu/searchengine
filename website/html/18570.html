==Founding==
The inaugural meeting of the Institution of Engineers in Scotland was held on 1 May 1857. Office bearers were appointed and the principal objective of the new institution was set down as "the encouragement and advancement of Engineering Science and Practice". It was to have a broad basis for membership, and engineers from the mining, foundry, railway, iron, shipbuilding and other industries were to be eligible. The prime movers behind the founding of the Institution were [[William John Macquorn Rankine]], Regius Professor of Civil Engineering and Mechanics at the [[University of Glasgow]], and [[Walter Montgomerie Neilson]], one of the major figures in establishing [[Glasgow]]'s locomotive-building industry. Rankine was the first President of the Institution and Neilson succeeded him in 1859. The engineer [[James Howden]], who died in 1913, was the last surviving founding member of the Institution.<ref>Day, Lance and McNeil, Ian, ''Biographical Dictionary of the History of Technology'', Vol. 39, London, Routledge, 1988, p. 358, at [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nqAOAAAAQAAJ&lpg=PA358&ots=8bddAYEPjg&dq=%22james%20howden%22%20forced%20draught%20system&pg=PA358#v=onepage&q=%22james%20howden%22%20forced%20draught%20system&f=false Biographical Dictionary], books.google.com, accessed 27 September 2009</ref> 

The Institution was an early promoter of consciousness of industrial effects on the environment. In those early years there was a pervading atmosphere of enquiry into the applications of steam power. In 1858 the Institution was responsible for a public meeting, held in the [[Glasgow City Chambers]], to establish "An Association for Promoting Safety, Economy and Absence of Smoke in the raising and use of Steam".

The [[Scottish Shipbuilders Association]] had been formed in 1860 and amalgamated with the IES on 25 October 1865. The current name of the Institution was adopted in 1870. The current President, Gordon Masterton, took office on 28th September 2010.
