An '''equatorium''' (plural, '''equatoria''') is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[calculator|calculating instrument]]. It can be used for finding the positions of the [[Moon]], [[Sun]], and [[planet]]s without calculation, using a geometrical model to represent the position of a given [[celestial body]].

The earliest extant record of a solar equatorium, that is, one to find the position of the sun, is found in [[Proclus]]'s fifth century work ''Hypostasis'',<ref>{{Cite book

Although planetary equatoria were also probably made by the ancient Greeks,<ref name="Evans"/> the first surviving description of one is from the ''[[Libros del saber de astronomia]]'' (''Books of the knowledge of astronomy''), a [[Spanish language|Castilian]] compilation of astronomical works collected under the patronage of [[Alfonso X of Castile]] in the thirteenth century, which includes translations of two eleventh century [[Arabic]] texts on equatoria by [[Ibn al‐Samḥ]] and [[al-Zarqali|al-Zarqālī]].<ref name="Evans"/>

[[Richard of Wallingford]] (1292–1336) is known to have built a sophisticated equatorium named ''[[Albion (Astronomy)|Albion]]'' that could calculate [[moon|lunar]], [[sun|solar]] and [[planetary]]
[[longitudes]]. Unlike most equatoria, the ''Albion'' could also predict [[eclipse]]s.<ref>{{Cite web
