'''Sergey Mikhaylovich Brin''' ({{lang-ru|Серге́й Миха́йлович Брин}}) born August 21, 1973 is a Soviet-American [[computer scientist]], software developer and [[entrepreneur]] who, with [[Larry Page]], is best known as the co-founder of [[Google]], Inc., the world’s largest [[Internet]] company{{cite}}, based on its [[search engine]] and online advertising technology.<ref>Jung Yeon-Je [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-140030803.html Getty Images article], May 30, 2007</ref>  

Brin immigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union at the age of six. Earning his undergraduate degree at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], he followed in his father's and grandfather's footsteps by studying mathematics, double-majoring in [[computer science]]. After graduation, he moved to [[Stanford]] to acquire a Ph.D in computer science.  There he met [[Larry Page]], whom he later became friends with. They crammed their dormitory room with inexpensive computers and applied Brin’s [[data mining]] system to build a superior [[search engine]].  The program became popular at Stanford and they suspended their Ph.D studies to start up Google in a rented garage.

''The Economist'' magazine referred to Brin as an "[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment Man]]", and someone who believes that "knowledge is always good, and certainly always better than ignorance", a philosophy that is summed up by Google’s motto of making all the world’s information "universally accessible and useful"<ref name=Economist/> and "[[Don't be evil]]".

==Early life and education==
Sergey Brin was born in [[Moscow]], in the [[Soviet Union]], to [[Jew]]ish parents, the son of Michael Brin and Eugenia Brin, both graduates of [[Moscow State University]]. His father is a mathematics professor at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], and his mother is a research scientist at [[NASA]]'s [[Goddard Space Flight Center]].<ref>Smale, Will (April 30, 2004). "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3666241.stm Profile: The Google founders]". BBC News. Retrieved 2010-01-07.</ref><ref>"[http://www.nndb.com/people/826/000044694/ Sergey Brin]". [[NNDB]]. Retrieved 2010-01-07.</ref>

===Childhood in the Soviet Union===
In 1979, when Brin was six, his family felt compelled to emigrate to the United States. In an interview with [[Mark Malseed]], author of ''The Google Story'',<ref name=Vise>Vise, David, and Malseed, Mark. ''The Google Story'', Delta Publ. (2006)</ref> Sergey's father explains how he was "forced to abandon his dream of becoming an [[astronomy|astronomer]] even before he reached college". Although an official policy of [[anti-Semitism]] didn't exist in the Soviet Union, Brin claims [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] heads barred Jews from upper professional ranks by denying them entry to universities; "Jews were excluded from the [[physics]] departments, in particular..." Michael Brin therefore changed his major to [[mathematics]] where he received nearly straight A's. He said, "Nobody would even consider me for [[graduate school]] because I was Jewish."<ref name=Moment>Malseed, Mark (February 2007). "[http://www.momentmag.com/Exclusive/2007/2007-02/200702-BrinFeature.html The Story of Sergey Brin]". ''Moment Magazine''. Retrieved 2010-01-07.</ref>
The Brin family lived in a three-room, 30 square meter (350 square foot) apartment in central Moscow, which they also shared with Sergey's paternal grandmother.<ref name=Moment/> Sergey told Malseed, "I've known for a long time that my father wasn't able to pursue the career he wanted", but Sergey only picked up the details years later after they had settled in America. He learned how, in 1977, after his father returned from a mathematics conference in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], he announced that it was time for the family to emigrate. "We cannot stay here any more", he told his wife and mother. At the conference, he was able to "mingle freely with colleagues from the [[United States]], [[France]], [[England]] and [[Germany]], and discovered that his intellectual brethren in the West were 'not monsters.'" He added, "I was the only one in the family who decided it was really important to leave..."<ref name=Moment/>

Sergey's mother was less willing to leave their home in Moscow, where they had spent their entire lives. Malseed writes, "For Genia, the decision ultimately came down to Sergey. While her husband admits he was thinking as much about his own future as his son's, for her, 'it was 80/20' about Sergey." They formally applied for their [[exit visa]] in September 1978, and as a result his father "was promptly fired". For related reasons, his mother also had to leave her job.  For the next eight months, without any steady income, they were forced to take on temporary jobs as they waited, afraid their request would be denied as it was for many [[refuseniks]].  During this time his parents shared responsibility for looking after him and his father taught himself [[computer programming]].  In May 1979, they were granted their official exit visas and were allowed to leave the country.<ref name=Moment/>

At an interview in October, 2000, Brin said, "I know the hard times that my parents went through there, and am very thankful that I was brought to the States."<ref name=Scott>Scott, Virginia. ''Google: Corporations That Changed the World'', Greenwood Publishing Group (2008)</ref> A decade earlier, in the summer of 1990, a few weeks before his 17th birthday, his father led a group of gifted high school math students, including Sergey, on a two-week [[exchange program]] to the Soviet Union. "As Sergey recalls, the trip awakened his childhood fear of authority" and he remembers that his first "impulse on confronting Soviet [[oppression]] had been to throw pebbles at a police car." Malseed adds, "On the second day of the trip, while the group toured a [[sanatorium|sanitarium]] in the countryside near Moscow, Sergey took his father aside, looked him in the eye and said, 'Thank you for taking us all out of Russia.'"<ref name=Moment/>

===Education in America===
Brin attended [[grade school]] at Paint Branch [[Montessori School]] in [[Adelphi, Maryland]], but he received further education at home; his father, a professor in the department of mathematics at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], nurtured his interest in mathematics and his family helped him retain his Russian-language skills. In September 1990, after having attended [[Eleanor Roosevelt High School (Greenbelt, Maryland)|Eleanor Roosevelt High School]] in [[Greenbelt, Maryland]], Brin enrolled in the University of Maryland, College Park to study [[computer science]] and [[mathematics]], where he received his [[Bachelor of Science]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in May 1993 with honors.<ref name=resume>{{cite web |url=http://infolab.stanford.edu/~sergey/resume.html |title=Resume |accessdate=2008-03-09 |last=Brin |first=Sergey |date=January 7, 1997 |quote= }}</ref>

Brin began his graduate study in [[Computer Science]] at [[Stanford University]] on a [[NSF-GRF|graduate fellowship]] from the [[National Science Foundation]]. In 1993, he interned at [[Wolfram Research]], makers of [[Mathematica]].<ref name=resume/> He is on leave from his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] studies at Stanford.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=534604&symbol=GOOG |title=Sergey Brin: Executive Profile & Biography – BusinessWeek |accessdate=2008-03-09|work=[[Business Week]] |publisher= |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote=He is currently on leave from the PhD program in computer science at Stanford university...}}</ref>

==Search engine development==
During an orientation for new students at [[Stanford]], he met [[Larry Page]]. In a recent interview for ''The Economist'', Brin jokingly said "We're both kind of obnoxious." They seemed to disagree on most subjects. But after spending time together, they "became intellectual soul-mates and close friends". Brin's focus was on developing data mining systems while Page's was in extending "the concept of inferring the importance of a research paper from its [[citations]] in other papers."<ref name=Economist/>  Together, the pair authored what is widely considered their seminal contribution, a paper entitled "The Anatomy of a Large-Scale [[Hypertext]]ual Web Search Engine."<ref>"[http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine]"</ref>

Combining their ideas, they "crammed their dormitory room with cheap computers" and tested their new search engine designs on the web. Their project grew quickly enough "to cause problems for Stanford's computing infrastructure." But they realized they had succeeded in creating a superior engine for searching the web and suspended their PhD studies to work more on their system.<ref name=Economist/>

As Mark Malseed wrote, "Soliciting funds from faculty members, family and friends, Sergey and Larry scraped together enough to buy some [[Server (computing)|server]]s and rent that famous garage in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]]. ... [soon after], [[Sun Microsystems]] co-founder [[Andy Bechtolsheim]] wrote a $100,000 check to “Google, Inc.” The only problem was, “Google, Inc.” did not yet exist—the company hadn’t yet been incorporated. For two weeks, as they handled the paperwork, the young men had nowhere to deposit the money."<ref name=Moment/>

''The Economist'' magazine describes Brin's approach to life, like Page's, as based on a vision summed up by Google's motto, "of making all the world's information 'universally accessible and useful.'" Others have compared their vision to that of [[Johannes Gutenberg]], the inventor of modern printing: 
:"In 1440, Johannes Gutenberg introduced Europe to the mechanical printing press, printing Bibles for mass consumption. The technology allowed for books and manuscripts – originally replicated by hand – to be printed at a much faster rate, thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the [[European Renaissance]]. . . Google has done a similar job."<ref>[http://www.librarystuff.net/2009/10/01/google-the-gutenberg/ ''Information Technology], Oct. 1, 2009</ref>

The comparison was likewise noted by the authors of ''The Google Story'': "Not since Gutenberg . . .  has any new invention empowered individuals, and transformed access to information, as profoundly as Google."<ref name=Vise/>{{rp|1}}

Not long after the two "cooked up their new engine for web searches, they began thinking about information that is today beyond the web", such as digitizing books, and expanding health information.<ref name=Economist/>

==Personal life==

In May 2007, Brin married [[Anne Wojcicki]] in [[The Bahamas]]. Wojcicki is a [[biotech]] analyst and a 1996 graduate of [[Yale University]] with a [[B.S.]] in [[biology]].<ref name="Washington Post">{{cite news | first = Amy | last = Argetsinger | coauthors = Roberts, Roxanne | title = The Reliable Source | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = May 13, 2007 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/12/AR2007051201168.html | accessdate = 2007-10-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Anne Wojcicki Marries the Richest Bachelor | publisher = Cosmetic Makovers | url = http://cosmetic-makeovers.com/2007/05/18/anne-wojcicki-marries-the-richest-bachelor | accessdate = 2007-10-20}}</ref>  
She has an active interest in [[health information]], and together she and Brin are developing new ways to improve access to it. As part of their efforts, they have brainstormed with leading researchers about the [[human genome project]].  "Brin instinctively regards [[genetics]] as a [[database]] and computing problem. So does his wife, who co-founded the firm, [[23andMe]]", which lets people analyze and compare their own genetic makeup (consisting of 23 pairs of [[chromosomes]]).<ref name=Economist/>  In a recent announcement at Google’s Zeitgeist conference, he said he hoped that some day everyone would learn their genetic code in order to help doctors, patients, and researchers analyze the data and try to repair bugs.<ref name=Economist/>

Brin's mother, Eugenia, has been diagnosed with [[Parkinson's Disease]].  In 2008, he decided to  make a donation to the [[University of Maryland School of Medicine]], where his mother is being treated.<ref>{{cite news | title = Google Co-Founder Has Genetic Code Linked to Parkinson's | url= http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/19/technology/19google.html?_r=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&oref=slogin | accessdate = 2008-09-18 | work=The New York Times | first=Miguel | last=Helft | date=September 19, 2008}}</ref>  Brin used the services of 23AndMe and discovered that although Parkinson's is generally not [[hereditary]], both he and his mother possess a [[mutation]] of the [[LRRK2]] gene that puts the likelihood of his developing Parkinson's in later years between 20 and 80%.<ref name=Economist>"Enlightenment Man", ''[[The Economist]]'', Dec. 6, 2008 [http://www.economist.com/science/tq/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12673407]</ref> When asked whether ignorance was not bliss in such matters, he stated that his knowledge means that he can now take measures to ward off the disease. An editorial in ''The Economist'' magazine states that "Mr Brin regards his mutation of LRRK2 as a bug in his personal code, and thus as no different from the bugs in computer code that Google’s engineers fix every day. By helping himself, he can therefore help others as well. He considers himself lucky. ... But Mr. Brin was making a much bigger point. Isn’t knowledge always good, and certainly always better than ignorance?"<ref name=Economist/>

==Censorship of Google in China==
{{details|Censorship in the People's Republic of China}}
Remembering his youth and his family's reasons for leaving the Soviet Union, he "agonized over Google’s decision to appease the communist government of [[China]] by allowing it to censor search engine results", but decided that the Chinese would still be better off than without having Google available.<ref name=Economist/> He explained his reasoning to ''Fortune'' magazine:

:"We felt that by participating there, and making our services more available, even if not to the 100 percent that we ideally would like, that it will be better for Chinese web users, because ultimately they would get more information, though not quite all of it."<ref name=Martin>Martin, Dick. ''Rebuilding Brand America: hat We Must Do to Restore Our Reputation and Safeguard the Future of American Business Abroad'', AMACOM Div. American Mgmt. Assn. (2007)</ref>

On January 12, 2010, Google reported a large cyber attack on its computers and corporate infrastructure that began a month earlier, which included accessing numerous Gmail accounts and the theft of Google's intellectual property. After the attack was determined to have originated in China, the company stated that it would no longer agree to censor its search engine in China and may exit the country altogether.  The ''New York Times'' reported that "a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists, but that the attack also targeted 20 other large companies in the finance, technology, media and chemical sectors."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/13/world/asia/13beijing.html "Google, Citing Cyber Attack, Threatens to Exit China"], ''New York Times'', January 12, 2010</ref><ref>[http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html A new approach to China]</ref> It was later reported that the attack included "one of Google’s crown jewels, a password system that controls access by millions of users worldwide."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/20/technology/20google.html?nl=technology&emc=techupdateema1 "Cyberattack on Google Said to Hit Password System"] ''New York Times'', April 19, 2010</ref>

In late March, 2010, it officially discontinued its China-based search engine while keeping its uncensored [[Hong Kong]] site in operation. In a similar move, domain registrar [[Go Daddy]] Inc. also told Congress it will be cutting back due to new Chinese requirements for confidential information about their registrants.<ref name=WSJ/> Speaking for Google, Brin stated during an interview, "One of the reasons I am glad we are making this move in China is that the China situation was really emboldening other countries to try and implement their own firewalls."<ref name=WSJ>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704266504575141064259998090.html "Brin Drove Google to Pull Back in China"] ''Wall Street Journal'', March 24, 2010</ref> During another interview with ''Spiegel'', he added, "For us it has always been a discussion about how we can best fight for openness on the Internet. We believe that this is the best thing that we can do for preserving the principles of the openness and freedom of information on the Internet."<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,686269,00.html "Google Co-Founder on Pulling out of China"] ''Spiegel Online'', March 30, 2010</ref>

While only a few large companies so far pledged their support for the move, many Internet "freedom proponents are cheering the move," and it is "winning it praise in the U.S." from lawmakers.<ref name=WSJ/><ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2010/03/24/technology/china_google_hearing/index.htm "Congress slams China and Microsoft, praises Google"] ''CNN Money'', March 24, 2010</ref> Senator [[Byron Dorgan]] stated that "Google's decision is a strong step in favor of freedom of expression and information."<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100325/ap_on_hi_te/as_china_google "Google's deals in doubt amid spat with Beijing"] Yahoo News, March 25, 2010</ref> And Congressman [[Bob Goodlatte]] said, "I applaud Google for its courageous step to stop censoring search results on Google.cn.

[[image:Sergey Brin cropped.jpg|thumb|Sergey Brin]]
==Awards and recognition==
In November 2009, ''[[Forbes magazine]]'' decided Brin and Larry Page were the fifth most powerful people in the world.<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/20/power-09_Sergey-Brin-and-Larry-Page_D664.html "The World's Most Powerful People: #5 Sergey Brin and Larry Page"] ''Forbes'' magazine, Nov. 11, 2009</ref> Earlier that same year, in February, Brin was inducted into the [[National Academy of Engineering]], which is "among the highest professional distinctions accorded to an engineer ... [and] honors those who have made outstanding contributions to engineering research, practice...".  He was selected specifically, "for leadership in development of rapid indexing and retrieval of relevant information from the World Wide Web."<ref>[http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=02062009 National Academy of Engineering], Press Release, Feb. 6, 2009</ref>

In 2003, both Brin and Page received an [[Honorary degree|honorary]] [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from [[IE Business School]] "for embodying the entrepreneurial spirit and lending momentum to the creation of new businesses...".<ref>[http://www.ie.edu/IE/php/en/noticia.php?id=225 Brin and Page Awarded MBAs], Press Release, Sept. 9, 2003</ref> And in 2004, they received the [[Marconi Foundation]] Prize, the "Highest Award in Engineering", and were elected [[Fellow]]s of the Marconi Foundation at [[Columbia University]]. "In announcing their selection, John Jay Iselin, the Foundation's president, congratulated the two men for their invention that has fundamentally changed the way information is retrieved today." They joined a "select cadre of 32 of the world's most influential communications technology pioneers..."<ref>"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2004_Sept_23/ai_n6208748 Brin and Page Receive Marconi Foundation's Highest Honor]". Press Release, September 23, 2004.</ref>

In their "Profiles" of Fellows, the [[National Science Foundation]] included a number of earlier awards:
:"he has been a featured speaker at the [[World Economic Forum]] and the Technology, Entertainment and Design Conference. ... ''[[PC Magazine]]'' has praised Google [of] the Top 100 Web Sites and Search Engines (1998) and awarded Google the Technical Excellence Award, for Innovation in Web Application Development in 1999. In 2000, Google earned a [[Webby Award]], a People's Voice Award for technical achievement, and in 2001, was awarded Outstanding Search Service, Best Image Search Engine, Best Design, Most Webmaster Friendly Search Engine, and Best Search Feature at the Search Engine Watch Awards."<ref>[http://www.nsfgrfp.org/why_apply/fellow_profiles/sergey_brin National Science Foundation], Fellow Profiles</ref>

According to ''[[Forbes]]'' he and [[Larry Page]] are currently tied as the 24th richest person in the world with a personal wealth of US$17.5 billion in 2010.<ref name="Topic page on Sergey Brin">{{cite web | title = Topic page on Sergey Brin | publisher = Forbes | url = http://billionaires.forbes.com/topic/Sergey_Brin | accessdate = 2010-04-05}}</ref>

==Other interests==
Brin is working on other, more personal projects that reach beyond Google. For example, he and Page are trying to help solve the world’s energy and climate problems at Google’s [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] arm [[Google.org]], which invests in the [[alternative energy]] industry to find wider sources of [[renewable energy]]. The company acknowledges that its founders want "to solve really big problems using technology."<ref name=windpower>[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/posttech/2010/10/google_a_vanguard_of_the.html "Cars and Wind: What's next for Google as it pushes beyond the Web?"] ''Washington Post'', Oct. 12, 2010</ref> 

In October 2010, for example, they invested in a major offshore windpower development to assist the East coast power grid,<ref>[http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/10/wind-cries-transmission.html "The wind cries transmission"] Official Google Blog, Oct. 11, 2010</ref> which may eventually become the first "offshore wind farm" in the United States.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE69B4NU20101012?pageNumber=2 "Google joins $5 billion U.S. offshore wind grid project"] ''Reuters'' Oct. 12, 2010</ref> A week earlier they introduced a car that, with "artificial intelligence," can drive itself using video cameras and radar sensors.<ref name=windpower/> In the future, drivers of cars with similar sensors would have fewer accidents. These safer vehicles could therefore be built lighter and require less fuel consumption.<ref>Markoff, John.

Brin has appeared on television shows and many documentaries, including ''[[Charlie Rose (talk show)|Charlie Rose]]'', [[CNBC]], and [[CNN]]. In 2004, he and Larry Page were named "Persons of the Week" by ''[[World News with Charles Gibson|ABC World News Tonight]]''. In January 2005 he was nominated to be one of the [[World Economic Forum|World Economic Forum's]] "Young Global Leaders". He and Page are also the executive producers of the 2009 film ''[[Broken Arrows]]''.

In June 2008, Brin invested $4.5 million in [[Space Adventures]], the [[Virginia]]-based [[space tourism]] company. His investment will serve as a deposit for a reservation on one of Space Adventures' proposed flights in 2011. So far, Space Adventures has sent seven tourists into space.<ref>{{cite news | first = John| last = Schwartz|   title = Google Co-Founder Books a Space Flight | publisher = [[The New York Times]] Online | date = June 11, 2008 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/technology/11soyuz.html?hp | accessdate = 2008-06-11}}</ref>
