<html> <head> <title>Synchronous context-free grammar</title></head><body>'''Synchronous context-free grammars''' ('''SynCFG''' or '''SCFG'''; not to be confused with [[Stochastic context-free grammar|stochastic CFGs]] constitute a formal model of [[natural language]] [[syntax]], developed in the area of [[statistical machine translation]] (MT).

The theory of SynCFGs borrows from [[syntax-directed transduction]] and [[syntax-based machine translation]], modeling the reordering of clauses that occurs when translating a sentence by correspondences between phrase-structure rules in the source and target languages. Performance of SCFG-based MT systems has been found comparable with, or even better than, state-of-the-art [[phrase-based machine translation]] systems.<ref name="Chiang">{{cite journal

==Formalism==
Rules in a SynCFG are superficially similar to CFG rules, except that they specify the structure of two phrases at the same time; one in the source language (the language being translated) and one in the target language. Numeric indices indicate correspondences between non-terminals in both constituent trees. Chiang<ref name="Chiang"/> gives the Chinese/English example:

: <math>X \to</math> (yu <math>X_1</math> you <math>X_2</math>, have <math>X_2</math> with <math>X_1</math>)
