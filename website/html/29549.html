'''Polychotomous key''' refers the number of alternatives which a decision point may have in a non-temporal hierarchy of independent variables. The number of alternatives are equivalent to the root or [[nth root]] of a mathematical or logical variable. Decision points or independent variables with two states have a binary root that is referred to as a [[wiktionary:dichotomy|dichotomous]] key whereas the term polychotomous key refers to roots which are greater than one or unitary and usually greater than two or binary. Polychotomous keys are used in [[troubleshooting]] to build troubleshooting charts and in classification/identification schemes with characteristics that have more than one attribute and the order of characteristics is not inherently based on the progression of time.
