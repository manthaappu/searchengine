}}</ref> Header-only libraries do not need to be separately [[compiler|compiled]], packaged and installed in order to be used. All that is required is to point the compiler at the location of the headers (the -I switch in [[GNU Compiler Collection| gcc/g++]]), and then <tt>[[C preprocessor|#include]]</tt> the header files into the application source.

The disadvantages include:
* brittleness – most changes to the library will require recompilation of all [[compilation unit]]s using that library
* longer compilation times – the compilation unit must see the implementation of all components in the included files, rather than just their interfaces
* [[code bloat|code-bloat]] (this may be disputed) – the necessary use of [[inline function|inline]] statements in non-class functions can lead to code bloat by over-inlining.

Nonetheless, the header-only form is popular because it avoids the (often much more serious) problem of packaging.
