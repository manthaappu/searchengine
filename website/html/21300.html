"'''Lazy'''" is a song by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[hard rock]] band [[Deep Purple]] from their 1972 album ''[[Machine Head (album)|Machine Head]]''. A live performance of the song can be found on the album ''[[Made in Japan (album)|Made in Japan]]'', released later the same year. 

The song starts out as an instrumental, [[keyboardist]] [[Jon Lord]] plays an overdriven [[Hammond organ]] intro, followed by the main riff and with the solo swapping between him and [[guitarist]] [[Ritchie Blackmore]]. [[Vocalist]] [[Ian Gillan]] comes in with the vocals later in the song. He also uses [[harmonica]] both on the studio version and live. At over 7 minutes long, it is the longest track on the album, and live versions were often extended past 10 minutes.

The live version on ''[[Made in Japan (album)|Made in Japan]]'' features a theme from [[Hugo Alfv√©n]]'s "Swedish Rhapsody #1", played by Ritchie Blackmore as a part of his solo. 
Ritchie Blackmore would sometimes include the main riff from "Lazy" in live performances of the song "Man on the Silver Mountain" by [[Rainbow (band)|Rainbow]]. Gillan defined the song as [[rhythm and blues]].

Later live performances after the band's reunion in 1984 tended to be much shorter, cutting out the intro and one of the verses. However, more recent performances with [[Steve Morse]] have gone back to  the original arrangement.

Readers of Guitar World voted "Lazy" the 74th greatest guitar solo of all time.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://guitar.about.com/library/bl100greatestg.htm |title=Guitar World 100 Greatest Guitar Solos |work=about.com |accessdate=2010-03-25}}</ref>
