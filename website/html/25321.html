<html> <head> <title>Multilayered architecture</title></head><body>A multilayered software architecture is using different [[Layer (object-oriented design)|layers]] for allocating the responsibilities of an application.

There is also an architectural pattern that is named Layers and has been described in different publications, including the book Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture
A System of Patterns. <ref>http://hillside.net/patterns/books/Siemens/abstracts.html Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture
A System of Patterns</ref>

The concepts of layer and tier are often used interchangeably.
However, one fairly common point of view is that there is indeed a difference, and that a layer is a logical structuring mechanism for the elements that make up your software solution, while a tier is a physical structuring mechanism for the system infrastructure.
