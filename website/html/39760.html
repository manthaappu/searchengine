'''WYMeditor''' is an [[open source]] [[WYSIWYM]] [[text editor]] written in the [[JavaScript]] programming language for editing content on web pages. It is based on the [[jQuery]] [[JavaScript library|JavaScript framework]]. It differs from other embeddable text editors such as [[FCKeditor]] and [[TinyMCE]] in that it concentrates on the semantics and meaning of content leaving out visual details. Unlike [[WYSIWYG]] editors, it explicitly shows the [[XHTML]] structure of content to the user.

Presentation and visual coherence is added using [[CSS]] which is either provided prepackaged, or can be customized.

WYMeditor is web server agnostic meaning it can be integrated into web pages built with any server side language.

Amongst other features, although lacking in some areas, WYMeditor statedly has more readable and cleaner source code, the opposite of which is often said about its competitors.
