An '''oblique case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''obl'''}}; {{lang-la|casus generalis}}) in [[linguistics]] is a [[noun case]] of [[synthetic language]]s that is used generally when a [[noun]] is the [[object (grammar)|object]] of a [[verb]] or a [[preposition]].  An oblique case can appear in any case relationship except the [[nominative case]] of a sentence subject or the [[vocative case]] of direct address.

Languages with a nominative or an oblique case system also contrast with those that have an [[absolutive case|absolutive]] or [[ergative case]] system.  In [[ergative-absolutive language]]s, the absolutive case is used for a direct object (the subject will then be in the ergative case); but the absolutive case is also used for the subject of an [[intransitive verb]], where the subject is being passively described, rather than performing an action. Nevertheless, there are ergative-absolutive languages that demonstrate oblique cases;
in the [[Northwest Caucasian languages]] [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]], [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] and [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]], the oblique case marker serves to mark the ergative case, the [[dative case]], and the object of a verbal [[verb applicative|applicative]].

[[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], an analytic [[Slavic language]], also has an oblique case—or, rather, two of them for [[pronoun]]s:

Accusative:
* "Kiss me!": целувай ме! (''tseluvay me!'')
* "Kiss ''me''! (not him)" целувай мен! (''tseluvay men!'')
Dative:
* "Give me that ball": дай ми тaзи топка (''day mi tazi topka'')
* "Give that ball to ''me''"  дай тaзи топка на мен (''day tazi topka na men'')

There is also one for [[grammatical gender|masculine]] nouns with the [[article (grammar)|article]]:
* "The wind is blowing":  Вятърът вее (''vyatǎrǎt vee'')
* "I despise the wind": Mразя вятъра (''mrazya vyatǎra'')

In analytic [[Indo-European languages]], the oblique case is a relic of the original, more complex system of noun cases from the common [[Proto-Indo-European language]].  Oblique cases appear in the [[English language|English]] pronoun set; these pronouns are often called [[objective pronoun]]s. One can observe how the first person pronoun ''me'' serves a variety of grammatical functions:

*as an [[accusative case]] for a direct object:
::''She bit me!''

*as a [[dative case]] for an indirect object:
::''Give me the rubber hose!''

*as the [[prepositional pronoun|object of a preposition]]:
::''Stop spitting on me!''

*and as a [[disjunctive pronoun|disjunctive]] topic marker:
::''Me, I like French.''

The pronoun ''me'' is not [[inflection|inflected]] differently in any of these uses; it is used for all grammatical relationships except the [[genitive case]] of possession and a non-disjunctive [[nominative case]] as the subject.
