<html> <head> <title>GE-200 series</title></head><body>The '''GE-200 series''' was a family of small [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] [[computer]]s of the 1960s, built by [[General Electric]].

The main machine in the line was the '''GE-225'''. It used a 20-bit word, of which 13 bits could be used for an address. Along with the basic [[Central processing unit|CPU]] the system could also include a [[floating point|floating-point]] unit, or interestingly, a [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] decimal option with three 6-bit decimals per word. It had 11 [[input/output|I/O]] [[channel controller]]s, and GE sold a variety of add-ons including disks, printers and other devices. The machines were built using discrete transistors, with a typical machine including about 10,000 transistors and 20,000 diodes. They used [[core memory]], and a standard 8k-word system held 186,000 magnetic cores.

The '''GE-215''' was a scaled-down version of the GE-225, including only 6 I/O channels and only 4K or 8K of core.

The '''GE-235''' was a re-implementation of the GE-225 with three times faster memory than the original.

* Central processor
* 400 CPM or 1000 CPM card reader
* 100 CPM card punch or 300 CPM card punch
* Perforated tape subsystem
* Magnetic tape subsystem
* 12 Pocket high-speed document handler
* On-line high speed printer or Off/on-line speed printer
* Disc storage unit
* Auxiliary Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
* DATANET data communications equipment

Through the early 1960s GE worked with [[Dartmouth College]] on the development of a [[time-sharing]] [[operating system]], which would later go on to become [[Dartmouth Time Sharing System]] (DTSS). The system was constructed by attaching a number of [[teletypewriter]]s to a smaller GE machine called the '''Datanet-30''', which was a small computer that had evolved from an earlier process-control machine.

DTSS was an odd system; it didn't run on the GE-235, but the DN-30 instead. The DN-30 accepted commands one at a time from the terminals connected to it, and then ran their requested programs on the GE-235. The GE-235 had no idea it was not running in [[batch mode]], and the illusion of [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] was being maintained externally.

In 1965 GE started packaging the DN-30 and GE-235 systems together as the '''GE-265'''. The GE-265 achieved fame not only for being the first commercially successful time-sharing system, but it was also the machine on which the [[BASIC programming language]] was first created.
