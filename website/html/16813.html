This article discusses the major developments in the history of '''[[programming language]]s'''. For a detailed timeline of events, see the [[timeline of programming languages]].

==  Before 1940 ==

The first programming languages predate the modern computer. At first, the languages were [[code]]s.

The [[Jacquard loom]], invented in 1801, used holes in punched cards to represent sewing loom arm movements in order to generate decorative patterns automatically.

During a nine-month period in 1842-1843, [[Ada Lovelace]] translated the memoir of Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea about [[Charles Babbage]]'s newest proposed machine, the [[Analytical engine|Analytical Engine]]. With the article, she appended a set of notes which specified in complete detail a method for calculating [[Bernoulli number|Bernoulli numbers]] with the Engine, recognized by some historians as the world's first computer program.<ref>{{citation

[[Herman Hollerith]] realized that he could encode information on [[punched card|punch card]]s when he observed that [[train]] [[conductor (transportation)|conductors]] encode the appearance of the ticket holders on the train tickets using the position of punched holes on the tickets. Hollerith then encoded the 1890 census data on punch cards.

The first computer codes were specialized for their applications. In the first decades of the 20th century, numerical calculations were based on decimal numbers. Eventually it was realized that logic could be represented with numbers, not only with words. For example, [[Alonzo Church]] was able to express the [[lambda calculus]] in a formulaic way. The [[Turing machine]] was an abstraction of the operation of a tape-marking machine, for example, in use at the telephone companies.  Turing machines set the basis for storage of programs as data in the [[Von_Neumann_architecture#Development_of_the_stored-program_concept|von Neumann architecture]] of computers by representing a machine through a finite number. However, unlike the lambda calculus, Turing's code does not serve well as a basis for higher-level languages—its principal use is in rigorous analyses of [[Computational complexity theory|algorithmic complexity]].

Like many "firsts" in history, the first modern programming language is hard to identify. From the start, the restrictions of the hardware defined the language. Punch cards allowed 80 columns, but some of the columns had to be used for a sorting number on each card. FORTRAN included some keywords which were the same as English words, such as "IF", "GOTO" (go to) and "CONTINUE". The use of a magnetic drum for memory meant that computer programs also had to be interleaved with the rotations of the drum. Thus the programs were more hardware-dependent.

To some people, what was the first modern programming language depends on how much power and human-readability is required before the status of "programming language" is granted.  Jacquard looms and Charles Babbage's [[Difference engine|Difference Engine]] both had simple, extremely limited languages for describing the actions that these machines should perform.  One can even regard the punch holes on a [[player piano]] scroll as a limited [[domain-specific language]], albeit not designed for human consumption.

== The 1940s ==

In the 1940s, the first recognizably modern, electrically powered computers were created.  The limited speed and memory capacity forced programmers to write hand tuned [[assembly language]] programs.  It was soon discovered that programming in assembly language required a great deal of intellectual effort and was error-prone.

In 1948, [[Konrad Zuse]] published a paper about his programming language [[Plankalkül]].[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Zuse.html]  However, it was not implemented in his lifetime and his original contributions were isolated from other developments.

Some important languages that were developed in this period include:
* 1943 - [[Plankalkül]] (Konrad Zuse), designed, but unimplemented for a half-century
* 1943 - [[ENIAC coding system]], machine-specific codeset appearing in 1948<ref>[http://ftp.arl.mil/mike/comphist/48eniac-coding/ R. F. Clippinger (1948) A Logical Coding System Applied to the ENIAC]</ref>
* 1949 - 1954 — a series of machine-specific mnemonic instruction sets, like ENIAC's, beginning in 1949 with C-10 for BINAC (which later evolved into UNIVAC).<ref>http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/showlanguage2.prx?exp=5442 C-10</ref> Each codeset, or instruction set, was tailored to a specific manufacturer.

== The 1950s and 1960s ==

In the 1950s, the first three modern programming languages whose descendants are still in widespread use today were designed:
* [[Fortran|FORTRAN]] (1955), the "'''FOR'''mula '''TRAN'''slator", invented by [[John Backus]] et al.;
* [[Lisp (programming language)|LISP]] [1958], the "'''LIS'''t '''P'''rocessor", invented by [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] et al.;
* [[COBOL]], the '''CO'''mmon '''B'''usiness '''O'''riented '''L'''anguage, created by the Short Range Committee, heavily influenced by [[Grace Hopper]].

Another milestone in the late 1950s was the publication, by a committee of American and European computer scientists, of "a new language for algorithms";  the ''[[ALGOL|ALGOL 60]] Report'' (the "'''ALGO'''rithmic '''L'''anguage").  This report consolidated many ideas circulating at the time and featured two key language innovations:
* nested block structure: code sequences and associated declarations could be grouped into [[block (programming)|block]]s without having to be turned into separate, explicitly named procedures;
* [[Scope (programming)|lexical scoping]]: a block could have its own private variables, procedures and functions, invisible to code outside that block, i.e. [[information hiding]].
Another innovation, related to this, was in how the language was described:
* a mathematically exact notation, [[Backus-Naur Form]] (BNF), was used to describe the language's syntax.  Nearly all subsequent programming languages have used a variant of BNF to describe the [[context-free grammar|context-free]] portion of their syntax.

Algol 60 was particularly influential in the design of later languages, some of which soon became more popular.  The [[Burroughs large systems]] were designed to be programmed in an extended subset of Algol.

Algol's key ideas were continued, producing [[ALGOL 68]]:
* syntax and semantics became even more orthogonal, with anonymous routines, a recursive typing system with higher-order functions, etc.;
* not only the context-free part, but the full language syntax and semantics were defined formally, in terms of [[Van Wijngaarden grammar]], a formalism designed specifically for this purpose.
Algol 68's many little-used language features (e.g. concurrent and parallel blocks) and its complex system of syntactic shortcuts and automatic type coercions made it unpopular with implementers and gained it a reputation of being ''difficult''.  [[Niklaus Wirth]] actually walked out of the design committee to create the simpler [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] language.

Some important languages that were developed in this period include:

* 1951 - [[Regional Assembly Language]]
* 1952 - [[Autocode]]
* 1954 - [[Fortran|FORTRAN]]
* 1954 - [[Information Processing Language|IPL]] (forerunner to LISP)
* 1955 - [[FLOW-MATIC]] (forerunner to COBOL)
* 1957 - [[COMTRAN]] (forerunner to COBOL)
* 1958 - [[Lisp (programming language)|LISP]]
* 1958 - [[ALGOL 58]]
* 1959 - [[FACT computer language|FACT]] (forerunner to COBOL)
* 1959 - [[COBOL]]
* 1962 - [[APL (programming language)|APL]]
* 1962 - [[Simula]]
* 1962 - [[SNOBOL]]
* 1963 - [[Combined Programming Language|CPL]] (forerunner to C)
* 1964 - [[BASIC]]
* 1964 - [[PL/I]]
* 1967 - [[BCPL]] (forerunner to C)

== 1967-1978: establishing fundamental paradigms ==

The period from the late 1960s to the late 1970s brought a major flowering of programming languages.  Most of the major language paradigms now in use were invented in this period:
* '''[[Simula]]''', invented in the late 1960s by [[Kristen Nygaard|Nygaard]] and [[Ole-Johan Dahl|Dahl]] as a superset of Algol 60, was the first language designed to support [[object-oriented programming]].  
* '''[[C (programming language)|C]]''', an early [[system programming|systems programming]] language, was developed by [[Dennis Ritchie]] and [[Ken Thompson]] at [[Bell Labs]] between 1969 and 1973.
* '''[[Smalltalk]]''' (mid 1970s) provided a complete ground-up design of an object-oriented language.
* '''[[Prolog]]''', designed in 1972 by [[Alain Colmerauer|Colmerauer]], [[Phillipe Roussel|Roussel]], and [[Robert Kowalski|Kowalski]], was the first [[logic programming]] language.
* '''[[ML (programming language)|ML]]''' built a polymorphic type system (invented by [[Robin Milner]] in 1973) on top of Lisp, pioneering [[Type system|statically typed]] [[functional programming]] languages.
Each of these languages spawned an entire family of descendants, and most modern languages count at least one of them in their ancestry.

The 1960s and 1970s also saw considerable debate over the merits of "[[structured programming]]", which essentially meant programming without the use of [[Goto]].  This debate was closely related to language design: some languages did not include GOTO, which forced structured programming on the programmer.  Although the debate raged hotly at the time, nearly all programmers now agree that, even in languages that provide GOTO, it is bad [[programming style]] to use it except in rare circumstances.  As a result, later generations of language designers have found the structured programming debate tedious and even bewildering.

Some important languages that were developed in this period include:
* 1968 - [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]]
* 1970 - [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]
* 1970 - [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]]
* 1972 - [[C (programming language)|C]]
* 1972 - [[Smalltalk]]
* 1972 - [[Prolog]]
* 1973 - [[ML (programming language)|ML]]
* 1975 - [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]
* 1978 - [[SQL]] (initially only a query language, later extended with programming constructs)

== The 1980s: consolidation, modules, performance ==

The 1980s were years of relative consolidation in [[imperative language]]s. Rather than inventing new paradigms, all of these movements elaborated upon the ideas invented in the previous decade.  [[C++]] combined object-oriented and systems programming.  The United States government standardized [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], a systems programming language intended for use by defense contractors.  In Japan and elsewhere, vast sums were spent investigating so-called [[fifth-generation programming language]]s that incorporated logic programming constructs.  The functional languages community moved to standardize ML and Lisp.   Research in [[Miranda (programming language)|Miranda]], a functional language with [[lazy evaluation]], began to take hold in this decade.

One important new trend in language design was an increased focus on programming for large-scale systems through the use of ''modules'', or large-scale organizational units of code.  [[Modula]], Ada, and ML all developed notable module systems in the 1980s.  Module systems were often wedded to [[generic programming]] constructs---generics being, in essence, parameterized modules (see also [[polymorphism in object-oriented programming]]).

Although major new paradigms for imperative programming languages did not appear, many researchers expanded on the ideas of prior languages and adapted them to new contexts.  For example, the languages of the [[Argus (computer system)|Argus]] and [[Emerald (computer system)|Emerald]] systems adapted object-oriented programming to [[distributed computing|distributed systems]].

The 1980s also brought advances in programming language implementation.  The [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] movement in [[computer architecture]] postulated that hardware should be designed for [[compiler]]s rather than for human assembly programmers.  Aided by [[Central processing unit|processor]] speed improvements that enabled increasingly aggressive compilation techniques, the RISC movement sparked greater interest in compilation technology for high-level languages.

Language technology continued along these lines well into the 1990s. <!-- However, the adoption of languages has always been driven by the adoption of new computer systems, and in the mid-1990s one of the most important new systems in computer history suddenly exploded in popularity. -->

Some important languages that were developed in this period include:
* 1980 - [[C++]] (as [[C with classes]], name changed in July 1983)
* 1983 - [[Objective-C]]
* 1983 - [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]]
* 1984 - [[Common Lisp]]
* 1985 - [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]]
* 1986 - [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]]
* 1987 - [[Perl]]
* 1988 - [[Tcl]]
* 1989 - [[FL (programming language)|FL]]  (Backus)

== The 1990s: the Internet age ==

The 1990s saw no fundamental novelty  in [[imperative language]]s, but much recombination and maturation of old ideas. This era  began the spread of [[functional language]]s.  A big driving philosophy was programmer productivity.  Many "rapid application development" (RAD) languages emerged, which usually came with an [[Integrated development environment|IDE]], [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], and were descendants of older languages.  All such languages were [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented]].  These included [[Object Pascal]], [[Visual Basic]], and [[Java (programming language)|Java]].  Java in particular received much attention.  More radical and innovative than the RAD languages were the new [[scripting language]]s.  These did not directly descend from other languages and featured new syntaxes and more liberal incorporation of features.  Many consider these scripting languages to be more productive than even the RAD languages, but often because of choices that make small programs simpler but large programs more difficult to write and maintain.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}  Nevertheless, scripting languages came to be the most prominent ones used in connection with the Web.

Some important languages that were developed in this period include:
* 1990 - [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]
* 1991 - [[Python (programming language)|Python]]
* 1991 - [[Visual Basic]]
* 1993 - [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]
* 1993 - [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]]
* 1994 - [[CLOS]] (part of ANSI [[Common Lisp]])
* 1995 - [[Java (programming language)|Java]]
* 1995 - [[Embarcadero Delphi|Delphi (Object Pascal)]]
* 1995 - [[JavaScript]]
* 1995 - [[PHP]]
* 1997 - [[REBOL|Rebol]]
* 1999 - [[D (programming language)|D]]

== Current trends ==

Programming language evolution continues, in both industry and research.  Some of the current trends include:
* Mechanisms for adding security and reliability verification to the language: extended static checking, information flow control, static [[thread safety]].
* Alternative mechanisms for modularity: [[mixin]]s, [[Delegation (programming)|delegates]], [[aspect-oriented programming|aspects]].
* Component-oriented software development.
* Constructs to support [[Concurrent computing|concurrent]] and [[Distributed computing|distributed]] programming.
* [[Metaprogramming]], [[Reflection (computer science)|reflection]] or access to the [[abstract syntax tree]]
* Increased emphasis on distribution and mobility.
* Integration with databases, including [[XML]] and [[relational database]]s.
* Support for [[Unicode]] so that [[source code]] (program text) is not restricted to those characters contained in the [[ASCII]] character set; allowing, for example, use of non-[[Latin]]-based scripts or extended punctuation.
* XML for graphical interface ([[XUL]], [[Extensible Application Markup Language|XAML]]).

Some important languages developed during this period include:
