In [[quantum chemistry]], a '''configuration state function''' ('''CSF'''), is a symmetry-adapted linear combination of [[Slater determinant]]s. It is an eigenstate of the square of the [[Angular_momentum#Angular_momentum_in_quantum_mechanics|angular momentum]] operator <math> \hat{L}^2 </math> and of the square of [[Spin (physics)|spin operator]] <math> \hat{S}^2 </math>. A CSF must not be confused with a [[Electron configuration|configuration]]. CSFs rather than just Slater determinants can be used as a basis in [[configuration interaction]] and [[Multi-configurational self-consistent field]] computations.

==From Configurations to Configuration State Functions==
CSFs are however derived from configurations. 
A configuration is just an assignment of electrons to orbitals.
For example <math>1s^2</math> and <math>1\pi^2</math> are example of two configurations, one from atomic structure and one from 
molecular structure.

From any given configuration we can, in general, create several CSFs.  
CSFs are therefore sometimes also called N-particle symmetry adapted basis functions.
It is important to realize
that for a configuration the number of electrons is fixed; let's call this <math>N</math>. When we are creating CSFs from a
configuration we have to work with the spin-orbitals associated with the configuration.
  
For example given the <math>1s</math> orbital in an atom we know that there are two spin-orbitals associated with
this, 

:<math>1s\alpha \;\;\; 1s\beta</math> 

where 

:<math>\alpha, \;\;\; \beta</math> 

are the one electron spin-eigenfunctions for spin-up and spin-down respectively. Similarly, for the 
<math>1\pi</math> orbital in a linear molecule (<math>C_{\infty v}</math> point group) we have four spin orbitals:   

:<math>1\pi(+)\alpha, \; 1\pi(+)\beta, \; 1\pi(-)\alpha, \; 1\pi(-)\beta</math>. 

This is because the <math>\pi</math> designation
corresponds to z-projection of angular momentum of both <math>+1</math> and <math>-1</math>.

We can think of the set of spin orbitals as a set of boxes each of size one; let's call this <math>M</math> boxes.
We distribute the <math>N</math> electrons among the <math>M</math> boxes in all possible ways. Each assignment
corresponds to one Slater determinant, <math>D_i</math>. There can be great number of these, particularly 
when <math>N < M</math>. Another way to look at this is to say we have <math>M</math> entities and we wish to
select <math>N</math> of them, known as a [[combination]]. We need to find all possible combinations.
Order of the selection is not significant because we are working with determinants and can interchange
rows as required.

If we then specify the overall coupling that we wish to achieve for the configuration, we can now select only those Slater determinants that have the required quantum numbers. In order to achieve the required total spin angular momentum (and in the
case of atoms the total orbital angular momentum as well), each Slater determinant has to be premultiplied by a 
coupling coefficient <math>c_i</math>, derived ultimately from [[Clebsch-Gordan coefficients]]. Thus the CSF is a linear combination

:<math>\sum_i c_i \; D_i</math>.

The Lowdin projection operator formalism<ref>Richard J. S. Crossley,

Volume 11 Issue 6, Pages 917 - 929
</ref> may be used to find the coefficients.
For any given set of determinants <math>D_i</math> it may be possible to find several different
sets of coefficients. <ref>R K Nesbet, Variational principles and methods in theoretical physics and chemistry

Each set corresponds to one CSF. In fact this simply reflects the different
internal couplings of total spin and spatial angular momentum.
