'''DiBOL''' or '''Digital's Business Oriented Language''' is a [[General-purpose programming language|general-purpose]], [[Procedural programming languages|procedural]], [[Imperative programming language|imperative]] [[programming language]], which is well-suited for [[Management Information Systems]] (MIS) software development. It has a syntax similar to [[FORTRAN]] and [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], along with [[Binary-coded decimal|BCD]] arithmetic. It shares the [[COBOL]] program structure of data and procedure divisions.

==History==
DIBOL was originally marketed by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) in 1970.

The original version, DIBOL-8, was produced for [[PDP-8]], [[PDP-11]] and DIBOL-32 [[VAX/VMS]] systems, though it can also be run on other systems through [[emulator]]s.

[[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] Standards were released in 1983, 1988 and 1992. The 1992 standard was revised in 2002.
