<html> <head> <title>Performance-based logistics</title></head><body>'''Performance-based Logistics''' (PBL) is a strategy for system support. Instead of contracting for goods and services, a product support provider (PSP) or product support integrator (PSI) is contracted to meet [[performance metric]](s) for a system or product.  The provider often commits to this performance level at a lower cost, or increased performance at costs similar to those previously achieved under a non-PBL contract.

Many times the results in employing a PBL strategy have resulted in both increased system performance and cost reductions.  Ideally, the provider has more control over constituent elements that are used to generate the performance results.  The acronym “PBL” also can be applied synonymously to the term “Performance Based Lifecycle Product Support.”{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} For expensive U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition programs, the PBL approach is mandated as a first-choice strategy and is encouraged for less expensive programs as well.

== History ==
By the early 1990s, increases in the costs to support fielded systems, decreases in the reliability in general, and an overall decrease in readiness of those systems were being recognized as issues that could continue if unabated.  As a result, PBL was advocated by the U.S. DoD in its annual [[Quadrennial Defense Review]] in 2001.  Since then, not only the U.S. DoD, but other countries as well have adopted this system sustainment strategy as many programs that have employed it have yielded increased system availability, shorter maintenance cycles, and/or reduced costs. 

Since inception of the PBL concept, there have been numerous examples of DoD systems that have yielded the anticipated results, and many that have exceeded – some extremely so – the performance expectations.  Annual PBL awards  highlight three notable achievements; one for component-level PBL arrangements; one for sub-systems; and one for system-level or platform-level PBLs. 

Partially in response to some who believed that PBL concepts were still not adequate, and to assess the current state of DoD systems sustainment, DoD’s Office of the Assistant Deputy Secretary of Defense for Materiel Readiness (OADUSD(MR) initiated a Weapon System Acquisition Reform Product Support Assessment in 2009.    Its final report was signed by Ashton B. Carter, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics.   The report affirms the essence of the PBL concept by stating, “there remains a strong consensus that an outcome-based, performance-oriented product support strategy is a worthy objective…”   It further identified eight areas that would make product support even more effective, if developed and improved:

# Product Support Business Model
# Industrial Integration Strategy
# Supply Chain Operational Strategy
# Governance
# Metrics
# Operating and Support Costs
# Analytical Tools
# Human Capital
