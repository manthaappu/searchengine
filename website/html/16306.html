<html> <head> <title>Harmonic analysis</title></head><body>'''Harmonic analysis''' is the branch of [[mathematics]] that studies the representation of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] or signals as the [[Superposition principle|superposition]] of basic [[wave]]s. It investigates and generalizes the notions of [[Fourier series]] and [[Fourier transform]]s. The basic waves are called "[[harmonic]]s" (in physics), hence the name "harmonic analysis," but the name "harmonic" in this context is generalized beyond its original meaning of integer frequency multiples. In the past two centuries, it has become a vast subject with applications in areas as diverse as [[signal processing]], [[quantum mechanics]], and [[neuroscience]].  
The classical Fourier transform on '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> is still an area of ongoing research, particularly concerning Fourier transformation on more general objects such as [[tempered distribution]]s. For instance, if we impose some requirements on a distribution f, we can attempt to translate these requirements in terms of the Fourier transform of f. The [[Paley-Wiener theorem]] is an example of this. The Paley-Wiener theorem immediately implies that if f is a nonzero [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] of [[compact support]] (these include functions of compact support), then its Fourier transform is never compactly supported. This is a very elementary form of an [[uncertainty principle]] in a harmonic analysis setting. See also [[Convergence of Fourier series]].

Fourier series can be conveniently studied in the context of [[Hilbert space]]s, which provides a connection between harmonic analysis and [[functional analysis]].

==Abstract harmonic analysis==

One of the more modern branches of harmonic analysis, having its roots in the mid-twentieth century, is [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] on [[topological group]]s. The core motivating idea are the various [[Fourier transform]]s, which can be generalized to a transform of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s defined on Hausdorff [[local compactness|locally compact topological groups]]. 

The theory for [[abelian group|abelian]] locally [[compact group]]s is called [[Pontryagin duality]]; it is considered to be in a satisfactory state,{{Fact|date=September 2008}} as far as explaining the main features of harmonic analysis goes. 

Harmonic analysis studies the properties of that duality and Fourier transform; and attempts to extend those features to different settings, for instance to the case of non-abelian [[Lie group]]s. 

For general nonabelian locally compact groups, harmonic analysis is closely related to the theory of unitary group representations. For compact groups,
the [[Peter-Weyl theorem]] explains how one may get harmonics by choosing one irreducible representation out of each equivalence class of representations. This choice of harmonics enjoys some of the useful properties of the classical Fourier transform in terms of carrying convolutions to pointwise products, or otherwise showing a certain understanding of the underlying [[Group (mathematics)|group]] structure. See also: [[Non-commutative harmonic analysis]].

If the group is neither abelian nor compact, no general satisfactory theory is currently known. By "satisfactory" one would mean ''at least'' the equivalent of [[Plancherel theorem]]. However, many specific cases have been analyzed, for example [[Special linear group|SL<sub>''n''</sub>]]. In this case, it turns out that [[Group representation|representations]] in infinite dimension play a crucial role.

==Other branches==

*Study of the [[eigenvalue]]s and [[eigenvector]]s of the [[Laplacian]] on [[domain (mathematics)|domain]]s, [[manifold]]s, and (to a lesser extent) [[Graph (mathematics)|graph]]s is also considered a branch of harmonic analysis. See e.g., [[hearing the shape of a drum]].
* Harmonic analysis on Euclidean spaces deals with properties of the [[Fourier transform]] on '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> that have no analog on general groups. For example, the fact that the Fourier transform is invariant to rotations. Decomposing the Fourier transform to its radial and spherical components leads to topics such as [[Bessel function]]s and [[spherical harmonic]]s. See the book reference.
* Harmonic analysis on tube domains is concerned with generalizing properties of [[Hardy space]]s to higher dimensions.
