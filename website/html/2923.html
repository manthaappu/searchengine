__NOTOC__
'''Automaticity''' ({{pron-en|ˌɔːtəməˈtɪsɨti}}) is the ability to do things without occupying the [[mind]] with the low-level details required, allowing it to become an automatic response pattern or [[habit (psychology)|habit]]. It is usually the result of [[learning]], [[repetition (learning)|repetition]], and practice.

Examples of automaticity are common activities such as speaking, bicycle-riding, assembly-line work, and driving a car (see [[Highway hypnosis]]). After an activity is sufficiently practiced, it is possible to focus the mind on other activities or thoughts while undertaking an automaticized activity (for example, holding a conversation or planning a speech while driving a car). Walking is not an example of automaticity as it is not a cortical function. It is a medullary function, with specific medullary circuits, which can be learnt to be inhibited or altered by higher-order ones.

In ''Influence'', [[Robert Cialdini]]'s book about [[social psychology]] and influence tactics, Cialdini explains how common [[automatic response patterns]] are in [[human behavior]], and how easily they can be triggered, even with erroneous cues.<ref>Cialdini, R.B. (2001). ''Influence: Science and practice'' (4th ed.). Boston: Allyn & Bacon. Chapter 1.</ref> He describes an experiment conducted by social psychologists [[Langer]], Chanowitz, and Blank  which illustrates how compliant people will be with a request if they hear words that sound like they are being given a reason, even if no actual reason is provided. The experimenters approached people standing in line to use a photocopier with one of three requests:
* "Excuse me. I have 5 pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I'm in a rush?"
* "Excuse me. I have 5 pages. May I use the Xerox machine?" or
* "Excuse me. I have 5 pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make some copies?"

When given the request + reason, 94% of people asked complied with the request. When given the request without a reason, only 60% complied. But when given the request with what sounds like a reason but isn't, compliance jumped back to 93%. Langer, Chanowitz, and Blank are convinced that most human behavior falls into automatic response patterns.<ref>Cialdini, R.B. (2001). Influence: Science and practice (4th ed.). Boston: Allyn & Bacon. p. 4</ref><ref>Langer, E.J., (1989). Minding matters. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), ''Advances in experimental social psychology'' (Vol. 22). New York, Academic Press.</ref>  

LaBerge and Samuels (1974) helped explain how reading fluency develops.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.readingrockets.org/articles/68 |title=Comprehension Instruction: What Works |author=Michael Pressley |accessdate=2008-03-15 |publisher=ReadingRockets}}</ref> Automaticity refers to knowing how to perform some arbitrary task at a competent level without requiring conscious effort—i.e. it is a form of [[unconscious competence]].

Some educational software, like [[QuickSmart]], incorporates the concept of automaticity. By measuring the consistency of processing speed and accuracy of students' responses, foundation skills can become automatic. As a result, students can devote cognitive effort to higher-order comprehension skills.
