'''Gowalla''' is a location-based [[social networking]] service created by [[Alamofire]]. Users '[[Check-in#Social check-in|check in]]' at ''Spots'' in their local vicinity, either through a dedicated mobile application or through the mobile website. As a reward users will sometimes receive items from check-ins. Items have developed to become a promotional tool for the game's partners, e.g. [[Incase Designs|Incase]]. As of November 2010 there were approximately 600,000 active users.<ref>{{cite news | first=Jon | last=Swartz | title=The latest from Gowalla is worth checking out | url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/technologylive/post/2010/12/the-latest-from-gowalla-is-worth-checking-out/1 | work=[[USAToday]] | accessdate=2 December 2010}}</ref>

At the start of December 2009 it was reported that Gowalla had raised $8.4 million in a round of [[venture capital]] funding led by [[Greylock Partners]] and angel investors [[Chris Sacca]], [[Kevin Rose]] and [[Jason Calacanis]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Caroline | last=McCarthy | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Geolocation wars heat up: Gowalla raises $8.4 million | date=2009-12-09 | publisher= | url =http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-10412262-36.html | work =[[CNET]] | pages = | accessdate = 2009-12-26 | language = }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Lori | last=Hawkins | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Gowalla raises $8.4 million to expand in Austin | date=2009-12-10 | publisher= | url =http://www.statesman.com/business/content/business/stories/technology/2009/12/10/1210gowalla.html | work =[[Statesman.com]] | pages = | accessdate = 2009-12-26 | language = }}</ref>

Gowalla won the Mobile category in the 2010 [[South By Southwest]] Interactive awards.<ref>{{cite news | first=Shane | last=Richmond | title=SXSW 2010: The changing face of the web | date=2010-03-18 | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/sxsw/7465438/SXSW-2010-The-changing-face-of-the-web.html | work = [[Daily Telegraph|The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate= 18 March 2010}}</ref>

==Overview==
Gowalla is a primarily mobile web application that allows users to check-in to locations that they visit using their mobile device. This is achieved either through the use of dedicated applications available on Google [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iPhone]], Palm [[WebOS]] and [[BlackBerry]], or via ''m.gowalla.com''. There is currently no way of checking-in through the standard website. Check-ins can be pushed via Notifications to iPhones, and by linking accounts, to [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]]. 

Trips, which as of January 2010 <ref name="GWBLOG-10-01-28">{{cite web |url=http://gowalla.com/blog/2010/01/trips-and-bookmarks |title=New Features: Trips and Bookmarks |author= |date=2010-01-28 |work=Gowalla Blog |publisher= |accessdate=18 March 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> can be made by any user, link up to 20 related spots, falling into categories such as Nature Hikes or Pub Crawls.

Spots and Trips can be ''featured'' by Gowalla, and with this comes a special status and icon, along with being highlighted on the website. Featured spots tend to be local landmarks such as [[Buckingham Palace]] in London, whilst featured Trips are chosen for being 'unique and exciting'.<ref name="GWBLOG-10-01-28" />

Upon checking-in, users may receive items as a bonus and these can be swapped or dropped at Spots. Users become ''Founders'' of a spot by dropping an item there. Items form a key feature within the game and each user has a vault into which they can place items they want to keep forever. Special items have been created for specific events of importance such as the [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Winter Olympic Games]], and also as promotional items linked to real-world prizes.

On December 2, 2010, Gowalla released version 3.0 for the iPhone 4, allowing Gowalla users to check-in using Foursquare, Facebook Places, Twitter and Tumblr, or view friends's check-ins from other services.<ref>{{cite news | first=David | last=Chartier | title=Gowalla 3.0 Unites Facebook, Foursquare Check-ins | url=http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/212251/gowalla_30_unites_facebook_foursquare_checkins.html | accessdate=2 December 2010}}</ref>

==Street Team Elite==
Within the Gowalla community, certain users have an elevated status above that of normal users. Whereas every user can create a Spot and add a small amount of data therein, members of the STE are able to edit and move any spot, merge two identical spots, and add extra information such as websites (up to three sites with only a main one) and a twitter account.
