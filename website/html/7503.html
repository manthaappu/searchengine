The '''Computer Misuse Act 1990''' is an Act of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]], introduced partly in response the decision in ''R v Gold & Schifreen'' (1988) 1 AC 1063 (see below). Critics of the bill complained that it was introduced hastily and was poorly thought out. [[Intention (criminal)|Intention]], they said, was often difficult to prove, and that the bill inadequately differentiated "joyriding" crackers like Gold and Schifreen from serious computer criminals. The Act has nonetheless become a model from which several other countries, including Canada and the [[Republic of Ireland]], have drawn inspiration when subsequently drafting their own information security laws.

==''R v Gold & Schifreen''==
[[Robert Schifreen]] and Stephen Gold, using conventional [[home computer]]s and [[modem]]s in late 1984 and early 1985, gained unauthorised access to [[BT Group plc|British Telecom]]'s [[Prestel]] interactive [[viewdata]] service. While at a trade show, Schifreen by doing what latterly became known as [[Shoulder surfing (computer security)|shoulder surfing]], had observed the password of a Prestel engineer: the username was 22222222 and the password was 1234. This later gave rise to subsequent accusations that BT had not taken security seriously. Armed with this information, the pair explored the system, even gaining access to the personal message box of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]].

Unknown to Schifreen and Gold, the Prestel computer network operated on a distributed basis and was intended to act as a hot standby in the event of the UK going to war - in the event that the primary UK military computers were down, the Prestel network could be used to control and launch the UK's nuclear missiles.

Following discussions with GCHQ and MI6, it was decided to investigate Schifreen and Gold's activities, notwithstanding that, as freelancers for Micronet, a joint venture between BT and a major publishing house, the pair had informed their superiors of their discovery.

Following interventions from GCHQ, Prestel installed monitors on both of the pair's modem connections and, acting on the information obtained, decided it was in the best interests of national security to arrest them.

After some months of deliberation, it was decided to charge the pair under section 1 of the [[Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981]], with defrauding BT by manufacturing a "false instrument", namely the internal condition of BT's equipment after it had processed Gold's eavesdropped password. Tried at [[Southwark]] [[Crown Court]], they were convicted on specimen charges (five against Schifreen, four against Gold) and fined, respectively, £750 and £600.

Although the fines imposed were modest, they elected to appeal to the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal. Their counsel cited the lack of  evidence showing the two had attempted to obtain material gain from their exploits, and claimed the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act had been misapplied to their conduct.

They were acquitted by the Lord Justice Lane, but the prosecution appealed to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]. In 1988, the Lords upheld the acquittal<ref>HL 21 April 1988, [1988] AC 1063 summary at [http://www.swarb.co.uk/lawb/cpucmaRvGold.shtml]</ref>. Lord David Brennan said:

:We have accordingly come to the conclusion that the language of the Act was not intended to apply to the situation which was shown to exist in this case. The submissions at the close of the prosecution case should have succeeded. It is a conclusion which we reach without regret. The Procrustean attempt<ref>Here Lord Brandon alludes to the classical myth of [[Procrustes]], who would stretch his victims to fit a bed for which they were ill suited.</ref> to force these facts into the language of an Act not designed to fit them produced grave difficulties for both judge and jury which we would not wish to see repeated. The appellants' conduct amounted in essence, as already stated, to dishonestly gaining access to the relevant Prestel data bank by a trick. That is not a criminal offence. If it is thought desirable to make it so, that is a matter for the legislature rather than the courts.

The Law Lords' ruling led many legal scholars to believe that hacking was not unlawful as the law then stood. The [[English Law Commission]] (ELC) and its counterpart in Scotland both considered the matter. The [[Scottish Law Commission]] concluded that intrusion was adequately covered in Scotland under the [[Scots law|common law]] related to deception, but the ELC believed a new law was necessary.

Since the case, both defendants have gone to write about IT matters extensively and, in the case of Gold, who detailed the entire case at some length in the Hacker's Handbook, actually presents at conferences alongside the arresting officers in the case.

==The Computer Misuse Act==
Based on the ELC's recommendations, a [[Private Member's Bill]] was introduced by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[Michael Colvin]]. The bill, supported by the government, came into effect in 1990. Sections 1-3 of the Act introduced three criminal offences:<ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1990/UKpga_19900018_en_1.htm Computer Misuse Act 1990], s1 - s3</ref>

# [[Hacking|unauthorised access]] to computer material, punishable by 6 months' imprisonment or a fine "not exceeding level 5 on the [[standard scale]]" (currently £5000);
# unauthorised access with intent to commit or facilitate commission of further offences, punishable by 6 months/maximum fine on [[summary conviction]] or 5 years/fine on [[indictment]];
# unauthorised modification of computer material, subject to the same sentences as section 2 offences.

§§2–3 are intended to deter the more serious criminals from using a computer to assist in the commission of a criminal offence or from impairing or hindering access to data stored in a computer. The basic offence is to attempt or achieve access to a computer or the data it stores, by inducing a computer to perform any function with intent to secure access. [[Hacker (computer security)|Hackers]] that program their computers to search through password permutations are therefore liable, even though all their attempts to log on are rejected by the target computer. The only precondition to liability is that the hacker should be aware that the access attempted is unauthorized. Thus, using another person's [[username]] or [[identifier]] (ID) and [[password]] without proper authority to access data or a program, or to alter, delete, copy or move a program or data, or simply to output a program or data to a screen or printer, or to impersonate that other person using [[e-mail]], [[online chat]], web or other services, constitute the offence. Even if the initial access is authorized, subsequent exploration, if there is a hierarchy of privileges in the system, may lead to entry to parts of the system for which the requisite privileges are lacking and the offence will be committed. But looking over a user's shoulder or using sophisticated electronic equipment to monitor the [[electromagnetic radiation]] emitted by [[VDU]]s ("electronic eavesdropping") is outside the scope of this offence.

The §§2–3 offences are aggravated offences, requiring a specific intent to commit another offence (for these purposes, the other offences are to be [[arrest]]able, and so include all the major [[common law]] and [[statutory]] offences of [[fraud]] and [[dishonesty]]). So a hacker who obtains access to a system intending to transfer money or shares, intends to commit [[theft]], or to obtain confidential information for [[blackmail]] or [[extortion]]. Thus, the §1 offence is committed as soon as the unauthorized access is attempted, and the §2 offence overtakes liability as soon as specific access is made for the criminal purpose. The §3 offence is specifically aimed at those who write and circulate a [[computer virus]] (see [[Simon Vallor]]) or [[computer worm|worm]], whether on a [[Local area network|LAN]] or across [[computer network|networks]]. Similarly, using [[phishing]] techniques or a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]] to obtain identity data or to acquire any other data from an unauthorized source, or modifying the operating system files or some aspect of the computer's functions to interfere with its operation or prevent access to any data, including the destruction of files, or deliberately generating code to cause a complete system malfunction, are all criminal "modifications". In 2004 John Thornley pleaded guilty to four offences under §3, having mounted an attack on a rival site, and introduced a Trojan horse to bring it down on several occasions, but it is recognized that the wording of the offence should be clarified to confirm that all forms of [[denial of service]] attack are included.{{Fact|date=January 2009}}

==Latest situation==
<!-- need a paragraph here about notable convictions under the act -->

In 2004, the All-Party Internet Group published its review of the law and highlighted areas for development. Their recommendations led to the drafting of the ''Computer Misuse Act 1990 (Amendment) Bill'' which sought to amend the CMA to comply with the European Convention on Cyber Crime[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/185.htm]. Under its terms, the maximum sentence of imprisonment for breaching the Act changed from six months to two years. It also sought to explicitly criminalise [[denial-of-service attack]]s and other crimes facilitated by denial-of-service. The Bill did not receive [[Royal Assent]] because Parliament was [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogued]].

Sections 35 to 38 of the [[Police and Justice Act 2006]] contains amendments to the Computer Misuse Act 1990. 

Section 37 (''Making, supplying or obtaining articles for use in computer misuse offences'') inserts a new section 3A into the 1990 Act and has drawn considerable criticism from IT professionals, as many of their tools can be used by the forces of evil in addition to their legitimate purposes, and thus fall under section 3A.
