In [[image processing]], '''elongatedness''' for a region is the ratio between the length and width of the [[minimum bounding rectangle]] of the region. It is considered a [[Feature_(computer_vision) | feature]] of the region. It can be evaluated as the ratio between the area of the region to its thickness squared:<br />
<br />
<math>elongatedness = \frac{length}{width} = \frac{area}{2 d^2}</math>.<br />
<br />
where the maximum thickness, <math>d</math>, of a holeless region is given by the number of times the region can be [[Erosion (morphology)|eroded]] before disappearing.<ref>[http://www.icaen.uiowa.edu/~dip/LECTURE/Shape3.html Shape representation and description: Region-based shape representation and description]</ref>
