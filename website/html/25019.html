'''Monochromatic colors''' are all the colors (tints, tones, and shades) of a single [[hue]]. [[Image:Monocolour.jpg|frame|Example of Monochromatic color]]
Monochromatic color schemes are derived from a single base hue, and extended using its shades, tones and tints (that is, a hue modified by the addition of black, gray (black + white) and white. As a result, the energy is more subtle and peaceful due to a lack of contrast of hue. Monochromatic color schemes may be considered boring unless there is diversity within the design.
