<html> <head> <title>Henry O. Pollak</title></head><body>'''Henry Otto Pollak''' (December 13, 1927) is an [[Austria|Austrian]]-[[United States|American]] mathematician, known for his contributions
to [[information theory]].

Born in [[Vienna, Austria]], he since moved to [[USA]].  While at [[Yale University]] for his [[B.Sc.]] in [[mathematics]] (1947)
he  participated on silver-award winning teams with celebrated mathematicians as [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Murray Gerstenhaber]].
He earned an [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] and [[Ph.D.]] (1951) degree in [[mathematics]] from
[[Harvard University]], the latter on the thesis ''Some Estimates for Extremal Distance'' 
advised by [[Lars Ahlfors]].

Pollak then joined [[Bell Labs]] (1951), where he in the early 1960s became
director of the Mathematics and Statistics Research Center.
He authored near forty papers, many of these with [[David Slepian]] and [[Henry Landau]] on 
analysis, function theory, probability theory, and mathematics education.
He has applied mathematics to  solve problems in  physics and
networks, communication theory, discrete systems, statistics and data analysis, and
economic analysis. 
Pollak also holds patents in the area of signalling.<ref>{{US Patent|3710026}}</ref>
He has held teaching positions in the mathematics department at [[Columbia University]].
