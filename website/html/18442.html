'''Inpainting''' is the process of reconstructing lost or deteriorated parts of [[Digital image|images]] and [[Digital video|videos]]. For instance, in the case of a valuable painting, this task would be carried out by a skilled [[art conservation and restoration|image restoration]] artist. In the digital world, inpainting (also known as ''image interpolation'' or ''video interpolation'') refers to the application of sophisticated algorithms to recover lost or corrupted parts of the image data (mainly small regions or to remove little defects).

== Applications ==
There are many objectives and applications of this technique.
Restoring an image to remove noise, improve brightness, color and details.

In photography and cinema, is used for [[film restoration]]; to reverse the deterioration (e.g., cracks in photographs or scratches and dust spots in film; see [[infrared cleaning]]). It is also used for removing red-eye, the stamped date from photographs and removing objects to creative effect.

This technique can be used to recover the lost blocks in the coding and transmission of images, for example, in a [[streaming video]]. It can also be used to remove logos in videos.

== Methods ==
A common method is to use [[differential equation]]s (such as [[Laplace's equation]]) with Dirichlet boundary conditions for continuity (a seamless fit).<ref>{{cite journal

Other methods follow [[Contour line|isophote]] directions (in an image, a contour of equal luminance), to do the inpainting.<ref>M. Bertalmío, G. Sapiro, V. Caselles and C. Ballester., "Image Inpainting", Proceedings of SIGGRAPH 2000, New Orleans, USA, July 2000.</ref>

Manual computer methods include using a [[clone tool]] or healing tool, to copy existing parts of the image to restore a damaged texture. [[Texture synthesis]] may also be used.<ref>[http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/texture_replace/ Image Replacement through Texture Synthesis], Homan Igehy and Lucas Pereira, Stanford University, Appears in the Proceedings of the 1997 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing</ref>
