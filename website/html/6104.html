'''ChinesePython''' (中蟒) is an implementation of the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] [[programming language]] using the Chinese language [[lexicon]]. Besides reserved words and variable names, most data type operations can be coded in Chinese as well. 

== Example ==

The following is derived from an example found on the official website. It prompts the user a question, then responds based on whether the user typed "yes", "no", or anything else.

<source lang="python">
#!/usr/local/bin/cpython
# answer = raw_input('Do you think the Chinese language has value? (Yes / no)')
回答 = 读入('你认为中文程式语言有存在价值吗 ? (有/没有)')

# if answer == 'yes':
如 回答 == '有':
        # print 'Well, let's work together!'
	写 '好吧, 让我们一起努力!'
# elif answer == 'no':
不然 回答 == '没有':
        # print 'Well, not as a programming language'
	写 '好吧,中文并没有作为程式语言的价值.'
# else:
否则:
        # print 'Please give serious consideration before answering.'
	写 '请认真考虑后再回答.'
