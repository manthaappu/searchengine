'''graph-tool''' is an efficient [[Python (programming language)|Python]] module for manipulation and statistical analysis of [[Graph (mathematics)|graphs]] (a.k.a.  [[Network_theory|networks]]). Contrary to most other python modules with similar functionality, the core data structures and algorithms of graph-tool are implemented in [[C++]], making extensive use of [[metaprogramming]], based heavily on the [[Boost Graph Library]]. This confers a level of performance which is comparable (both in memory usage and computation time) to that of a pure [[C++]] library.


== Features ==
* Creation and manipulation of [[Directed graph|directed]] or [[Graph (mathematics)|undirected graphs]].
* Association of arbitrary information to the vertices, edges or even the graph itself, by means of property maps.
* Filter vertices and/or edges "on the fly", such that they appear to have been removed.
* Support for [[DOT_language|dot]] and [[GraphML]] formats.
* Convenient and powerful [[graph drawing]] based on [[Graphviz]].
* Support for typical statistical measurements: degree/property histogram, combined degree/property histogram, vertex-vertex correlations, [[assortativity]], average vertex-vertex [[shortest path]], etc. 
* Support for several graph-theoretical algorithms: such as [[graph isomorphism]], [[Subgraph isomorphism problem|subgraph isomormism]], [[minimum spanning tree]], [[connected components]], [[dominator]] tree, [[maximum flow]], etc.
* Support for several [[centrality]] measures.
* Support for [[clustering coefficient|clustering coefficients]], as well as [[network motif]] statistics and [[community structure]] detection.
* Generation of [[random graphs]], with arbitrary degree distribution and correlations.
* Support for well-established network models: [[preferential attachment|Price]], [[Barabási–Albert model|Barabási-Albert]], Geometric Networks, Multidimensional [[lattice graph]], etc.
