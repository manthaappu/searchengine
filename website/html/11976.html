In [[number theory]], the '''Elkies trinomial curves''' are certain [[hyperelliptic curve]]s constructed by [[Noam Elkies]] which have the property that rational points on them correspond to trinomial polynomials giving an extension of '''Q''' with particular [[Galois group]]s. 

One curve, C<sub>168</sub>, gives Galois group [[PSL(2,7)]] from a polynomial of degree seven, and the other, C<sub>1344</sub>, gives Galois group AL(8), the [[semidirect product]] of a [[2-elementary group]] of order eight acted on by PSL(2, 7), giving a transitive permutation subgroup of the symmetric group on eight roots of order 1344.

The equation of the curve C<sub>168</sub> is

:<math>y^2 = x(81x^5+396x^4+738x^3+660x^2+269x+48)</math>

The curve is a [[algebraic curve|plane algebraic curve]] model for a [[Galois resolvent]] for the trinomial polynomial equation x<sup>7</sup> + bx + c = 0. If there exists a point (x, y) on the (projectivized) curve, there is a corresponding pair (b, c) of rational numbers, such that the trinomial polynomial either factors or has Galois group PSL(2,7), the finite simple group of order 168. The curve has [[geometric genus|genus]] two, and so by [[Faltings theorem]] there are only a finite number of rational points on it. These rational points were proven by Nils Bruin using the computer program [[Kash]] to be the only ones on C<sub>168</sub>, and they give only four distinct trinomial polynomials with Galois group PSL(2,7): x<sup>7</sup>-7x+3 (the Trinks polynomial), (1/11)x<sup>7</sup>-14x+3<sup>2</sup> (the Erbach-Fisher-McKay polynomial) and two new polynomials with Galois group PSL(2,7),

:<math>37^2x^7-28x+3^2</math> 

and

:<math>(499^2/113)x^7-212x+3^4</math>.

On the other hand, the equation of curve C<sub>1344</sub> is

:<math>y^2 = 2 x^6 + 4 x^5 + 36 x^4 + 16 x^3 - 45 x^2 + 190 x + 1241</math>

Once again the genus is two, and by [[Faltings theorem]] the list of rational points is finite. It is thought the only rational points on it correspond to polynomials x<sup>8</sup>+16x+28, x<sup>8</sup>+576x+1008, 19<sup>4</sup>53x<sup>8</sup>+19x+2 which have Galois group AL(8), and x<sup>8</sup>+324x+567, which comes from two different rational points and has Galois group PSL(2, 7) again, this time as the Galois group of a polynomial of degree eight.
