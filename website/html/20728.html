<html> <head> <title>Kleene fixed-point theorem</title></head><body>In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] areas of [[order theory|order]] and [[lattice theory]], the '''Kleene fixed-point theorem''', named after American mathematician [[Stephen Cole Kleene]], states the following:
:''Let L be a [[complete partial order]], and let f : L → L be a [[Scott continuity|continuous]] (and therefore [[monotone function|monotone]]) [[function (mathematics)|function]]. Then the [[least fixed point]] of f is the [[supremum]] of the ascending Kleene chain of f.

It is often attributed to [[Alfred Tarski]], but the original statement of [[Tarski's fixed point theorem]] is about monotone functions on complete lattices.

The '''ascending Kleene chain''' of ''f'' is the [[chain (order theory)|chain]]

:<math>\bot \; \le \; f(\bot) \; \le \; f\left(f(\bot)\right) \; \le \; \dots \; \le \; f^n(\bot) \; \le \; \dots</math>

obtained by [[iterated function|iterating]] ''f'' on the [[least element]] ⊥ of ''L''. Expressed in a formula, the theorem states that

:<math>\textrm{lfp}(f) = \sup \left(\left\{f^n(\bot) \mid n\in\mathbb{N}\right\}\right)</math>

where <math>\textrm{lfp}</math> denotes the least fixed point.
