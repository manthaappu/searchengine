Professor Dr. '''Azriel Rosenfeld''' (February 19, 1931 - February 22, 2004) was an American Research Professor, a Distinguished University Professor, and Director of the Center for Automation Research at the University of Maryland in [[College Park, Maryland]], where he also held affiliate professorships in the Departments of [[computer science|Computer Science]], [[electrical engineering|Electrical Engineering]], and [[Psychology]].  He held a Ph.D. in [[mathematics]] from [[Columbia University]] (1957), rabbinic ordination (1952) and a Doctor of [[Hebrew literature|Hebrew Literature]] degree (1955) from [[Yeshiva University]], and honorary Doctor of Technology degrees from [[Linkoping University]], Sweden (1980) and [[Oulu University]], Finland (1994), an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Yeshiva University (2000), and an honorary degree from the [[Technion]] (posthumously in 2004). He was a [[Fellow]] of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (1994).

Professor Rosenfeld was widely regarded as a leading researcher in the world in the field of [[computer image analysis]].  Over a period of nearly 40 years he made many fundamental and pioneering contributions to nearly every area of that field.  He wrote the first textbook in the field (1969); was founding editor of its first journal (1972); and was co-chairman of its first international conference (1987).  He published over 30 books and over 600 book chapters and journal articles, and directed nearly 60 Ph.D. dissertations.

Professor Rosenfeld’s research on digital image analysis (specifically on [[digital geometry]] and [[digital topology]], and on the accurate measurement of statistical features of [[digital images]]) in the 1960’s and 1970’s formed the foundation for a generation of industrial vision inspection systems that have found widespread applications from the automotive to the electronics industry.

Professor Rosenfeld was a ''ba'al koreh'' ([[Torah reading|Torah Reader]]) at [http://www.yise.org Young Israel Shomrai Emunah of Greater Washington] for many years until he moved to [[Baltimore]] in 2001.

In honor of the memory of Professor Rosenfeld, ICCV gives the biennial [[Azriel Rosenfeld Award]] to a living person in the recognition of an outstanding life-time contribution to the field of image
understanding or computer vision.
