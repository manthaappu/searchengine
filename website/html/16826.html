The core advantage of wireless [[mesh network]]s is their inherent ability to form a network on power up.  Watch what happens in Fig 1, when the mesh nodes power up (green LED on box turns on). The nodes hear each other's broadcast and form a network. Also watch what happens when a node fails and how the nodes discover an alternate routing path. This healing is fully automatic.

Over the years, wireless mesh networking has seen three unique deployments based on radio technology, each incorporating iterative improvements allowing for greater [[scalability]] and higher network performance - both [[throughput]] and [[latency (engineering)|latency]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} This early stage of pre IEEE standard technological development is known as first Generation of Wireless Mesh.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  The following deployments are briefly described of various configurations of first generation Wireless Mesh Networking:

Dr. Winrich Hoseit of [[Cologne, Germany]] first described the "DIRC technology" (digital inter relay communication) with PCT patent No. DE 197 37 897 and DE 197 33 586.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Because transmitted radio waves always interfere, the ratio of carrier to interference first had to be worked out. Dr.Hoseit also discovered how to prevent latency by transmitting single symbols rather than digital packages. (symbol stream switching). Each node collaborates with its neighbor-nodes via a control channel (CCH) to choose the frequency, time and energy with which to transmit each symbol. Only the final destination "understands" the application with the lowest possible latency.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Configurations==
===1-Radio Mesh===
As shown in Figure 2, this configuration uses one [[radio]] channel both to service clients and to provide the mesh routing path back to a wired or satellite link ([[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul]]). The single mesh radio, provides both services - client access and backhaul. Comparative performance analysis indicates this architecture provides the worst performance of all configurations, because backhaul and service compete for bandwidth. Also all single radio mesh architectures suffer from the send-receive-wait cycle shown in Figure 3. Since there is only radio, the mesh node has to listen, then send, then listen again. This intermittent stop-and-go behavior adversely affects network performance especially if the destination is far away and the traffic has to be re-transmitted ("hop") across many intermediate nodes first.

===Dual-Radio with 1-Radio backhaul mesh===
This configuration can also be referred to as a "1+1" network, since each node contains two radios, one to provide service to the clients, and one for backhaul.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The "1+1" appellation indicates that these radios are separate - the radio providing service does not participate in the backhaul, and the radio participating in the backhaul does not service clients. These two radios can operate in different bands. For example, a 2.4 GHz [[IEEE 802.11|802.11]] b/g radio can be used for service and an 802.11a (5 [[GHz]]) radio can be used for backhaul.

Most mesh products available today fall into this category.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Separating service from backhaul improves performance when compared with single-radio ad hoc mesh networks. But since a single-radio mesh is still servicing the backhaul, packets traveling toward the Internet share bandwidth at each hop along the backhaul path with other interfering mesh backhaul nodes - all-operating on the same channel. This degrades throughput as shown in Figure 3, which are not as severe as for the single-radio mesh, but which are sizeable nevertheless. Second generation mesh products are best employed in 1 or 2 hop configurations.

===2 radio backhauls===
The last configuration shown (Figure 2) is one that provides separate backhaul and service functionality and dynamically manages channels of all of the radios so that all radios are on non-interfering channels. Performance analysis indicates that this provides the better performance than the other two methods considered here.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Note that the two backhaul radios for the 3-radio configuration shown in Figure 2 are of the same type - not to be confused with 1+1 so-called dual radio meshes where one radio is typically of type 802.11 a (backhaul) and the other of type 802.11 b/g (service). In the 3-radio configuration, 2 radios provide up link and down link backhaul functionality, and the other radio services clients. Figure 4 shows how the two backhaul radios transmit traffic, with both radios operating independently and on separate channels.

===Border security===
The [[Naval Postgraduate School]], Monterey CA, demonstrated a third configuration multi-radio wireless mesh network for border security.<ref>{{

===Laptop computers===
A [[MIT Media Lab]] project developed the [[XO-1 (laptop)|XO-1]] single-radio laptop or "OLPC" for under-privileged schools in developing nations and uses mesh networking (based on the [[IEEE 802.11s]] standard) to create a robust and inexpensive infrastructure.<ref>{{
citeweb|title=XO-1 Mesh Network Details|url=http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Mesh_Network_Details|publisher=laptop.org|accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref> The instantaneous connections made by the laptops are claimed by the project to reduce the need for an external infrastructure such as the Internet to reach all areas, because a connected node could share the connection with nodes nearby. Greenpacket has implemented a similar concept with its application called SONbuddy.<ref>{{

===VoIP===
SMesh is an [[802.11]] multi-hop single-radio wireless mesh network developed by the Distributed System and Networks Lab at [[Johns Hopkins University]].<ref>{{
citeweb|title=SMesh|url=http://smesh.org|publisher=smesh.org|accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref> A fast [[handoff]] scheme allows mobile clients to roam in the network without interruption in connectivity, a feature suitable for real-time applications, such as [[VOIP|VoIP]].

===Software defined radio===
Many mesh networks operate across multiple radio bands. For example [[Firetide]] and Wave Relay second configuration dual radio mesh networks have the option to communicate node to node on 5.2 GHz or 5.8 GHz, but communicate node to client on 2.4 GHz (802.11).  This is accomplished using [[Software Defined Radio]] (SDR).
