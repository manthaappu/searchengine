The planning and '''tracking questionnaire''' is a tool that gathers more insight about the process and gives a qualitative perspective that cannot be achieved from the data alone.

These questions are framed in a way that if a team is not able to answer these questions and justify their decisions, it can be assumed that the process the team had followed for planning and tracking is considerably different [[Earned value management|Earned Value Analysis]]/[[Burn down chart]] or Burn up charts.<ref>[http://www.controlchaos.com/about/burndown.php]</ref>

==Quantitative Questions==

#Can you define where your project is right now and where it should have been?
#Was it at the right level of granularity?
##Was the reporting consistent with the level of planning?
##Was it consisitent with the length of the tasks in the iterations? (How frequently do you report the effort? For example, for a task that spans across two days, you might be reporting once instead of two times)
##How was the variance between the planned and earned value? How was it distributed? Consistently above or below?
#Can you distinguish between changes requested by the user and changes requested by the team?
#Can you distinguish between what was originally planned and what was achieved earned?
#Did you use buffers? how did you handle it? did you plan using ideal hours or real hours?
#Did you report ideal or did you report real hours?
#How do you represent the existence of buffers in your planned value or burn down chart?
#How did you accrue value at the end level of the effort?
#What did you do with the tasks not completed during the planned iteration?
#What did you do with unplanned activities and tasks?
#How many times did you change the performance baseline based on the earned value?
#Did each iteration start from zero or cumulative hours left or planned?
#Who imposed the process in the team? Was it voluntary or monitored and directed by a planning member or team leader?
#Comments.

==Qualitative questions==

#How did you use the information provided by the technique?
#Analyse the qualitative results and prepare a proposal

==Observations==

##School of thoughts - Some support sharing and others don't
##Analyse how people finish work? Based on which, reallocation is done.
#The patterns how employees (on whom the estimates are imposed)  try to spend time (more or less).
