{{Lowercase|dtlogin}}

'''dtlogin''' is a [[X display manager (program type)|display manager]] for the [[X Window System]]. It is typically found on [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] [[computer system]]s running The Open Group's [[Common Desktop Environment]] (CDE) [[desktop environment]]. It allows users to log in to a local system; it can also handle remote [[XDMCP]] requests.

This is still the default display manager for [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris 10]] even though CDE is no longer the default desktop environment, having been replaced by the [[Java Desktop System]], a modification of [[GNOME]]. It can also start other environments like [[KDE]], [[XFCE]] or [[Window Maker]].
