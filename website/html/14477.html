<html> <head> <title>GADGET</title></head><body>'''GADGET''' is a freely available code for cosmological [[n-body simulation|N-body/SPH simulations]] written by Volker Springel at the [[Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics]]. The name is an acronym of "GAlaxies with Dark matter and Gas intEracT".

==Description==
GADGET computes gravitational forces with a hierarchical tree algorithm (optionally in combination with a [[ewald summation|particle-mesh]] scheme for long-range gravitational forces) and represents fluids by means of [[smoothed particle hydrodynamics]] (SPH). The code can be used for studies of isolated systems, or for simulations that include the cosmological [[expansion of space]], both with or without periodic boundary conditions. In all these types of simulations, GADGET follows the evolution of a self-gravitating collisionless [[N-body problem|N-body]] system, and allows [[gas dynamics]] to be optionally included. Both the force computation and the time stepping of GADGET are fully adaptive, with a dynamic range which is, in principle, unlimited. 

GADGET can therefore be used to address a wide array of astrophysically interesting problems, ranging from colliding and [[galaxy merger|merging galaxies]], to the formation of [[large-scale structure]] in the universe. With the inclusion of additional physical processes such as radiative cooling and heating, GADGET can also be used to study the dynamics of the gaseous [[intergalactic medium]], or to address [[star formation]] and its regulation by feedback processes.

==History==
The first public version (GADGET-1, released in March 2000<ref>{{cite journal |author=Springel V., Yoshida N., White S. D. M. |year=2001 |title=GADGET: a code for collisionless and gasdynamical cosmological simulations |journal=New Astronomy |volume=6 |issue=51 |pages=79â€“117 |url=http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget/gadget1-paper.pdf |accessdate=2009-05-12 |doi=10.1016/S1384-1076(01)00042-2}}</ref>) was created as part of Volker's PhD project under the supervision of [[Simon White]]. Later, the code was continuously improved during postdocs of Volker Springel at the [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] and the Max Planck Institute, in collaboration with Simon White and [[Lars Hernquist]].

The second public version (GADGET-2, released in May 2005<ref>{{cite journal |author=Springel V. |year=2005 |title=The cosmological simulation code GADGET-2 |journal=MNRAS |url=http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget/gadget2-paper.pdf |accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref>) contains most of these improvements, except for the numerous physics modules developed for the code that go beyond gravity and ordinary gas-dynamics. The most important changes lie in a new time integration model, a new tree-code module, a new communication scheme for gravitational and SPH forces, a new [[domain decomposition]] strategy, a novel SPH formulation based on [[entropy]] as independent variable, and finally, in the addition of the TreePM functionality.
