<html> <head> <title>New York Institute of Technology Computer Graphics Lab</title></head><body>The '''Computer Graphics Lab''' was a [[computer]] [[laboratory|lab]] located at the [[New York Institute of Technology]] (NYIT) back in the late 1970s. It was originally located at the "pink building" on the NYIT campus. 

The lab was initially founded to produce a short high-quality feature film with the project name of ''[[The Works (film)|The Works]]''. The feature, which was never completed, was a 90-minute feature that was to be the first entirely computer-generated [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] movie. Production mainly focused around [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] and [[VAX]] machines.

It was linked to Computer Graphics Laboratory Inc.<!--Huh?-->

Many of the original CGL team now forms the elite of the CG and computer world with members going on to [[Silicon Graphics]], [[Microsoft]], [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]], [[NVIDIA]] and others, including [[Pixar]] President [[Ed Catmull]], [[Pixar]] co-founder and [[Microsoft]] Graphics Fellow [[Alvy Ray Smith]], Pixar co-founder [[Ralph Guggenheim]], [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] Chief Scientist [[Lance Williams]], [[Dreamworks]] Animator [[Hank Grebe]], [[Netscape]] and [[Silicon Graphics]] founder Jim Clark ([[James H. Clark]]), [[Microsoft]] Graphics Fellow [[Jim Blinn]], [[Thad Beier]], [[Andrew Glassner]] and [[Tom Brigham]]. Systems programmer [[Bruce Perens]] went on to co-found the Open Source initiative.
