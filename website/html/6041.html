The '''Chemistry Development Kit''' is an [[open source]] Java library for [[Chemoinformatics]] and [[Bioinformatics]] <ref>Steinbeck, C.; Han, Y. Q.; Kuhn, S.; Horlacher, O.; Luttmann, E.; Willighagen, E.L. ''The Chemistry Development Kit (CDK): An open-source Java library for chemo- and bioinformatics''. Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences 2003, 43, 493-500. {{DOI|10.1021/ci025584y}} {{Entrez Pubmed|12653513}}</ref>. It is available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Unix]], and [[Mac OS]]. It is distributed under the [[GNU LGPL]].

== History ==
The CDK was created by Christoph Steinbeck, Egon Willighagen and Dan Gezelter, the developers of [[Jmol]] and [[JChemPaint]] at the time, to provide a common code base, on 27â€“29 September 2000 at the [[University of Notre Dame]]. Since then many people have contributed to the project, leading to a rich set of functionality, as given below.

== Library ==

The CDK itself is a library, instead of a user program. However, it has been integrated into various environments to make its functionality available. CDK is currently used in several applications, among which the [[R (programming language)]]<ref>Guha, R. Journal of Statistical Software 2007, 18, 1-16</ref>, CDK-Taverna (a [[Taverna workbench]] plugin)<ref>Kuhn, T.;  Willighagen, E. L.;  Zielesny, A.;  Steinbeck, C. BMC bioinformatics 2010, 11, 159+</ref>, [[Bioclipse]], and Cinfony<ref>O'Boyle, N. M.;  Hutchison, G. R. Chemistry Central journal 2008, 2</ref>. Additionally, a CDK extension for [[KNIME]] exists.

In 2008 bits of GPL-licensed code was removed from the library. While those code bits were independent from the main CDK library, and no copylefting was involved, to reduce confusions among users, the [http://code.google.com/p/chemojava/ ChemoJava] project was instantiated.

== Major features ==
=== Chemoinformatics ===

* 2D [[Molecule editor|diagram editing]] and generation
* 3D geometry generation

== CDK News ==

[http://www.cdknews.org/ CDK News] is the project's newsletter and published articles between 2004 and 2007<ref>https://sourceforge.net/projects/cdk/files/CDK%20News/</ref>. Due to lack of a steady stream of contributions, this newsletter was put on hold.
