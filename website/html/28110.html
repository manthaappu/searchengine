PL/Perl, as an [[imperative programming language]], allows more control than the [[relational algebra]] of [[SQL]].
Programs created in the PL/Perl language are called functions and can use most of the features that the [[Perl language]] provides, including common flow control structures and syntax that has incorporated [[regular expressions]] directly.
These functions can be evaluated as part of a SQL statement, or in response to a [[Event-driven programming|trigger]] or [[wiktionary:rule|rule]].

The design goals of PL/Perl were to create a loadable procedural language that:

* can be used to create functions and trigger procedures,
* adds control structures to the SQL language,
* can perform complex computations,
* can be defined to be either [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/plperl-trusted.html trusted or untrusted] by the server,
* is easy to use.

PL/Perl is one of many "PL" languages available for PostgreSQL
