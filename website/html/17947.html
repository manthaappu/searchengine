In [[electrical engineering]] and [[computer science]], '''image processing''' is any form of [[signal processing]] for which the input is an image, such as a [[photograph]] or [[video frame]]; the [[output]] of image processing may be either an image or, a set of characteristics or [[parameter]]s related to the image.  Most image-processing techniques involve treating the image as a [[two-dimensional]] [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] and applying standard signal-processing techniques to it. 

Image processing usually refers to [[digital image processing]], but [[Optical engineering|optical]] and [[analog image processing]] also are possible. This article is about general techniques that apply to all of them. The ''acquisition'' of images (producing the input image in the first place) is referred to as [[imaging]].

==Typical operations==

* [[Affine_transformations|Euclidean geometry transformations]] such as [[Scaling_(geometry)|enlargement]], reduction, and [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]
* Color corrections such as [[brightness]] and [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]] adjustments, [[color mapping]], [[Color balance|color balancing]], [[quantization (signal processing)|quantization]], or [[color translation]] to a different [[color space]]
* [[Digital compositing]] or optical [[compositing]] (combination of two or more images), which is used in film-making to make a "[[matte (filmmaking)|matte]]"
* Interpolation, [[demosaicing]], and recovery of a full image from a [[raw image format]] using a [[Bayer filter]] pattern
* [[Image registration]], the alignment of two or more images
* [[Image differencing]] and [[morphing]]
* [[Image recognition]], for example, may extract the text from the image using [[optical character recognition]] or checkbox and bubble values using [[optical mark recognition]]
* [[Segmentation (image processing)|Image segmentation]]
* [[High dynamic range imaging]] by combining multiple images
* [[Geometric hashing]] for 2-D object recognition with affine invariance
