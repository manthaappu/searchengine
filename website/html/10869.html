''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' instruction manual, p. 31</ref> is a video game character and main [[antagonist]] of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series created by ''[[Sega]]''. Dr. Eggman is a rotund, mad scientist with an [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] of 300 who plans to conquer the world in order to build his Eggman Empire and is the  evil [[archenemy]] of [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]].  His character designer is [[Naoto Ōshima]], and while he has gone through several large appearance changes throughout the series, his design retains several basic characteristics, such as his egg-shaped body and his large mustache. Beside his scientific skilled mind, he is very immature and often tends to throw a temper tantrum mostly whenever his plans fail. He has appeared in almost every ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' game since his first appeareance and has appeared in all other Sonic media, including comics, TV series, and a feature film.

==Concept and inspiration==
[[Image:Oldrobotnik.jpg|120px|left|thumb|Doctor Eggman's original design.]]
In April 1990, Sega commissioned its [[Sonic Team|AM8]] [[research and development|R&D]] department to create a character who would replace [[Alex Kidd]] as the company's [[mascot]], as well as compete against Nintendo's flagship character, [[Mario]]. A [[caricature]] of [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was among the proposed designs, and combined with the idea of an egg-shaped  character, it eventually became the basis of the visual design for Dr. Robotnik/Eggman.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite journal |url=http://info.sonicretro.org/Yuji_Naka_interview_by_Sega_Visions |title=Sega Visions Interview with Yuji Naka |year=1992 |month=August/September |journal= [[Sega Visions]] |accessdate=2008-08-30}}</ref> In creating the "bad guy" for the ''Sonic'' series, the development team wanted a character who was "the opposite of Sonic;" a character who represented "machinery" and "development" to play on the then-growing debate between developers and environmentalists.<ref name="Naka interview 96">{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/19970605172353/www.sega.com/features/allsonic/creator/naka04.html |title=Sonic's Creator - Yuji Naka|accessdate=2008-08-28 }}</ref> The character was also designed to be easy for children to draw.<ref name="Naka interview 96"/>

===Voice Actor portrayal===
A great number of [[voice acting|voice actors]] have portrayed Dr. Eggman in his game appearances, as well as in other media. The first voice actor for Eggman was [[Masaharu Satō]], who portrayed him in the arcade game, ''[[SegaSonic the Hedgehog]]''. In the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] game releases from 1998 onwards, Eggman is voiced by [[Chikao Ōtsuka]], who also voices him in the Japanese version of ''[[Sonic X]]''. From 1998-2004, Deem Bristow provided the English [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] for Eggman;<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0109941/ Deem Bristow] at the [[Internet Movie Database]].</ref> 4Kids employee Mike Pollock assumed the role shortly before Bristow's death from a [[Cardiac arrest|heart attack]] in 2005. The first video game to star [[Mike Pollock]] was ''[[Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)|Shadow the Hedgehog]]'', in which all of the regular voice actors were replaced with the 4Kids cast. While it was announced that the rest of the cast would be replaced from ''[[Sonic Colors]]'' onwards in 2010, Pollock retains his role as Doctor Eggman.<ref>http://blogs.sega.com/sonic/2010/07/15/out-of-the-mouths-of-hedgehogs/</ref>

The only person besides Ōtsuka to portray Eggman in a Japanese production is [[Junpei Takiguchi]], who provided Eggman's voice for the [[original video animation]], ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie]]''.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0847664/ Junpei Takiguchi] at the Internet Movie Database.</ref> [[Edwin Neal]] later provided the English dub.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0623605/ Edwin Neal] at the Internet Movie Database.</ref>

The early television incarnations of Doctor Robotnik (as he was known as exclusively in) have been voiced by three different actors. In ''[[Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', Robotnik is voiced by British blues singer [[Long John Baldry]],<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0049827/ Long John Baldry] at the Internet Movie Database.</ref> who coincidentally died the same year as Deem Bristow from a severe chest infection. Robotnik was voiced by [[Jim Cummings]] in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Saturday morning ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (TV series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' cartoon,<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0191906/ Jim Cummings] at the Internet Movie Database.</ref> and by [[Gary Chalk (actor)|Gary Chalk]] (who also voiced [[Scratch and Grounder|Grounder]] in ''Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog'') in ''[[Sonic Underground]]''.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0149942/ Gary Chalk] at the Internet Movie Database.</ref> Eggman is also voiced by [[Mike Pollock]] in the English dub of ''[[Sonic X]]''.

==In video games==
{{cleanup|section|date=September 2008}}
[[Image:Robotnik-boss.png|200px|thumb|In many Sonic video games, Dr. Eggman will oppose the player directly as an end-level [[boss (video game)|boss]] (Seen here piloting his ''Big Arm'' [[Mecha]] in Launch Base Zone Act 2, the final boss of ''Sonic 3'')]]
In the majority of video games set in the Sonic the Hedgehog universe, Eggman has served as the main antagonist.  Most of the Sonic video games that were released before 1998, the year in which [[Sonic Adventure]] was released in Japan, featured Eggman as the final [[Boss (video games)|boss]] the player fights at the end of the game. Eggman also appears as the [[Boss (video games)|boss]] who the player must confront at the end of almost every [[Level (video gaming)|level]] in most of the 2D Sonic games, and in [[Sonic 3D]]. In each game in which he makes multiple appearances as a boss, Eggman fights the player using a different machine each time he appears. In most of the 2D Sonic games, the player had to hit Eggman eight times when he appeared as a boss in order to defeat him and move on to the next level or next boss. In most three-dimensional ''Sonic'' games since the release of ''Sonic Adventure'' in 1998, Eggman may serve as a boss at one or more points in the game, although he usually does not serve as the final boss. Many of the final bosses in these more recent ''Sonic'' games were former allies of Eggman who then betrayed him, while others were a third party that had no connection with Eggman whatsoever. Eggman has often formed temporary alliances with Sonic and others to help them defeat these foes.

Dr. Eggman debuted in the 1991 [[Mega Drive|Genesis/Mega Drive]] platform game ''Sonic the Hedgehog'', where he attempted to collect the six [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Chaos Emeralds|Chaos Emeralds]] and hoped to turn all of the helpless animals inhabiting South Island into robots. He returned in the immediate sequel, ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (16-bit)|Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'', where he once again sought the Chaos Emeralds, of which there were now seven.  In this game, Eggman sought to collect the emeralds to fuel his ultimate weapon, a space station known as the Death Egg (an obvious homage to the [[Death Star]]), which has reappeared in several other titles in the series. In [[1993 in video gaming|1993]]'s ''[[Sonic CD]]'', Eggman, along with his latest creation, [[Metal Sonic]], travels to Little Planet in search of magical stones that have the power to control the passage of time. In ''[[Sonic 3]]'' and ''[[Sonic & Knuckles]]'', following the events in ''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'', Eggman's Death Egg crash-lands onto Angel Island. While repairing the space station, Eggman meets [[Knuckles the Echidna]], whom he tricks into believing that Sonic is trying to steal the Chaos Emeralds; in truth, Eggman intends to use the emeralds to repair the Death Egg.

Other two-dimensional games released before 1998 that Eggman appears in include ''Sonic Chaos'', ''Sonic Triple Trouble'', ''Sonic Blast'', and ''Sonic the Hedgehog Pocket Adventure'', as well as the 8-bit renditions of ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' and ''Sonic the Hedgehog 2''.

In ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'', Eggman learns of the legendary beast, [[Chaos (Sonic the Hedgehog)|Chaos]], and seeks out the Master Emerald. Upon finding it, he shatters it, freeing Chaos in the process. Eggman's goal is to control Chaos and obtain the Chaos Emeralds, which he can feed to Chaos so that it transforms into its most powerful form, using its destructive powers to conquer the world.<ref>'''Doctor Robotnik''': Oh, yes. It's just as the stone tablets predicted. Ha ha ha ha ha! His strength increases every time I give him a Chaos Emerald. With all seven Emeralds, he will be invincible and work for me! Together we'll destroy Station Square. And on its ruins I'll build Robotnikland. The ultimate city where I will rule it all. Come on, Chaos!  Let's find another Emerald, shall we? [[Sega]] ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' ''(in English)'' 1999-[[September 9|9-9]] ''(US)''</ref>

''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'' marks Eggman's first appearance as a [[player character|playable character]] in a main series game. Eggman revives the [[antihero]] [[Shadow the Hedgehog]] from dormancy. Shadow, knowing Eggman's desire to rule the world, agrees to help him by using the Eclipse Cannon aboard Space Colony ARK. In the last story, Eggman aids Sonic in trying to stop a [[fail-safe]] put in place by his grandfather, [[List of recurring characters from Sonic the Hedgehog (games)#Professor Gerald Robotnik|Gerald Robotnik]], which would set the colony on a crash course with Earth.<ref>'''Doctor Eggman:''' The core of the Eclipse Cannon is now highly reactive and explosive. This is because of the energy of the Chaos Emeralds if overpowering it. If the colony collides with Earth, it will shatter into pieces like my grandfather predicted! [...] There still may be time left. If we pull together, we might be able to get to the shortcut that leads to the core! [[Sega]] ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'' ''(in English)'' 2001-[[June 19|6-19]] ''(US)''</ref> In ''[[Sonic Heroes]]'', Eggman is captured by his own creation, [[List of recurring characters from Sonic the Hedgehog (games)#Metal Sonic|Metal Sonic]], who disguises himself as Eggman as part of a larger evil plan.

In ''[[Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)|Shadow the Hedgehog]]'', Eggman is an opportunist who tries to gather the Chaos Emeralds in the middle of the alien invasion. He ends up sending his robots to help stop the alien menace in the end. As Shadow interrogates Eggman for information regarding his past, he is met with taunts from Eggman, who claims that Shadow is one of his [[Shadow the Hedgehog#Shadow Androids|android]]s.<ref>'''Shadow the Hedgehog:''' Yes, doctor, you will regret ever having created me. You're going straight to Hell! '''Eggman:''' Why you little... You're nothing but pieces of scrap metal! Once I'm done with you, you'll be thrown in the junkyard! [[Sega]] ''[[Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)|Shadow the Hedgehog]]'' ''(in English'' 2005-11-15 ''(US)''</ref> During Shadow's fight with [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog characters|Black Doom]], Eggman admits that he was lying.<ref>'''Eggman:''' Shadow... can you hear me...? This might be the last chance I have to speak to you, so... What I said, about having created you... it was all a lie. Everyone thought you died during that horrible incident... but I rescued you, with one of my robots... You lost your memory, that's all... You really are the Ultimate Life Form my grandfather created! [[Sega]] ''[[Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)|Shadow the Hedgehog]]'' ''(in English'' 2005-11-15 ''(US)''</ref>

In the 2006 ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (2006 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' game, Dr. Eggman (who had a realistic human appearance) kidnaps the princess of Soleanna, who harbors the Flames of Disaster within her, in order to control time. Once again, he is forced to assist the heroes during the last act, much like previous games. Eggman also appears in ''[[Sonic and the Secret Rings]]'' as [[List of One Thousand and One Nights characters#Shahryār|Shahryār]] of [[Persia]]. Here, his physical appearance has been changed back to his ''Adventure'' look.<ref>{{cite web |title=''Secret Rings'' character concept art |url=http://www.sonicstadium.org/imagebin/articles/previews/satsr1_02.jpg |accessdate=2007-08-07}}</ref> Eggman appeared in [[Sonic Rush]] and [[Sonic Rush Adventure]], where he is once again a main villain, alongside a parallel version of himself called [[Eggman Nega]]. He is also a playable character in the Sonic RPG, [[Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood]].

In ''[[Sonic Unleashed]]'', Dr. Eggman is one of the two main villains in the game, along with Dark Gaia. Eggman tricks Super Sonic into a trap and uses his energy to power a giant laser cannon, which fires into the Earth and shatters it into pieces, freeing the beast contained within; Dark Gaia. He spends most of the game collecting Dark Gaia's power as well as fighting Sonic with various machines, and much like the original games, flies off in his Egg Mobile when defeated. Unlike many previous games, Eggman actually assumes control of his plans at the end of ''Sonic Unleashed'' by creating Eggmanland and makes no effort to join forces with Sonic to stop his own plans once they have spiraled out of control. Still, Eggman suffers a defeat when he gives Dark Gaia a single order and is shot into the atmosphere by the creature.

In ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 4]]'', Sonic goes traveling on his own, not knowing Eggman survived their last encounter in ''[[Sonic and Knuckles]]''. The doctor revisits his old badniks, and improves them to destroy his old rival once and for all. He has also made an appearance as a boss.

In [[Sonic Colors]], Eggman claims to be seeking forgiveness for his past transgressions, and attempts to make amends by opening up a theme park within the Earth's orbit. However, it becomes clear that the park is merely a front for Eggman's true intentions, which involve harnessing the energies of the alien Wisps for his own use.

In ''[[Sonic Spinball]]'', a [[pinball]]-themed game, Dr. Robotnik seizes Mount Mobius and turns it into a mechanical base, setting up an elaborate pinball mechanism to keep the Chaos Emeralds safe. Robotnik has also appeared in "2.5D" isometric platformers; in ''[[Sonic Labyrinth]]'', he secretly replaces Sonic's famous red shoes with the new "Slow-Down Boots," which take away his ability to jump or run fast, and in ''[[Sonic 3D Blast]]'', he turns innocent Flickies into robots in yet another search for the Chaos Emeralds. Dr. Eggman is also a playable character in such games as ''[[Sonic Drift]]'', ''[[Sonic R]]'', ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'',  ''[[Sonic Riders]]'' and its sequel ''[[Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity]]'', ''[[Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood]]'', ''[[Sega Superstars Tennis]]'', and [[Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing]]. Eggman appears as a playable character in the crossover game ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games]]''. Dr. Eggman made a cameo appearance in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' as a trophy. He appeared as a playable character in ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games]]'', also as one of the two main villains (alongside [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]) in the game's Adventure Mode ([[Nintendo DS|DS]] version only). Eggman and Bowser plan to make their own Olympic Winter Games by kidnapping the Star Spirits. In the game's climax, the two villains act as the final bosses.

The only game as of yet to feature Dr. Robotnik as the central character is the 1993 game ''[[Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine]]'', a ''[[Puyo Puyo]]'' clone in which Robotnik, along with numerous bounty hunters seen in the first episode of ''Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog'', attempts to rid all the fun and music on the planet Mobius by kidnapping the citizens of one insignificant town and turning them into robots. Despite the fact that he is the title character, he is still the villain.

''[[Sonic and the Black Knight]]'' is the only game in the entire ''Sonic'' franchise in which Dr. Eggman does not make an appearance.

{{Summarize section}}
[[Image:Robotnik AoStH.PNG|left|thumb|140px|Robotnik as portrayed in the animated series (As seen in the episode "Robotnik Jr.") ''[[Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog]]'']]
There have been four animated television series featuring Robotnik. ''[[Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' was the first, and featured [[Long John Baldry]] as the voice of Robotnik.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0222518/ ''Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog'' at the Internet Movie Database</ref> The cartoon had little history for Robotnik, whom, while still the series' main antagonist, was merely portrayed as a villain who sought to rule Mobius for no reason other than the fact that he appeared to be motivated by the act of "being evil." While the threat he posed to the Mobians seemed to vary from episode to episode, he was nonetheless portrayed as incompetent and Immature, with a tendency to mistreat his Badniks. His foremost of several catchphrases was "''I hate that hedgehog!'' (usually shouted out loud when Sonic cruelly got the better of him in each episode). Broadcast alongside ''Adventures'' was ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (TV series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', which featured Robotnik as a fierce (and far more competent) dictator who has already conquered most of the planet Mobius. This incarnation was voiced by [[Jim Cummings]] (who, coincidentally, auditioned for the role of Robotnik in ''The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog'' and did record some lines in the unaired pilot episode).<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106140/ ''Sonic the Hedghog''] at the Internet Movie Database</ref> ''[[Sonic Underground]]'' also featured Robotnik in this same light, this time voiced by [[Gary Chalk (actor)|Gary Chalk]], who previously voiced Grounder in the ''Adventures'' series.

In the two-episode [[original video animation|OVA]] film ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie]]'', Eggman tells Sonic that he has been banished from Robotropolis by a metallic [[doppelgänger]] of himself. It is later revealed that the mecha was piloted by Eggman himself, in a scheme to lure Sonic into his base and copy his DNA for his new [[List of recurring characters from Sonic the Hedgehog (games)#Metal Sonic|Hyper Metal Sonic]] robot. Eggman was voiced by [[Junpei Takiguchi]] in the Japanese version, and by [[Edwin Neal]] in the English dub.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0237765/ ''Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie''] at the Internet Movie Database</ref>

In ''[[Sonic X]]''  Doctor Eggman, along with other ''Sonic'' characters, are accidentally transported from their own world, to [[Earth]]. This incarnation is voiced by [[Chikao Ōtsuka]] in the Japanese version, and by [[Mike Pollock]] in the English [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367413/ ''Sonic X''] at the Internet Movie Database</ref>

When the first ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' title was released in [[1991]], Sega published a comic book designed to promote the game. The 14-page story, written by Francis Mao, included a non-[[Canon (fiction)|canon]] [[origin story|origin]] for both Sonic the Hedgehog and Eggman. Originally a benevolent scientist named Dr. Ovi Kintobor ("Ivo Robotnik" with the names spelt backwards), he starts out as a friend to Sonic, even helping to develop the hedgehog's super-speed. Kintobor later tries to eliminate all the evil in the world by absorbing it into the [[Chaos Emeralds]], but the experiment goes awry, instead shocking the Doctor with "10,000 [[volt]]s of pure evil energy."<ref>Sonic HQ Comics Info - [http://archive.sonic-hq.net/newsite/comics/images/first.php Sega Promo Comic]. Retrieved on [[2008]]-[[February 23|2-23]].</ref> Though inaccurate in regards to the games, a similar origin story later found its way into the now-defunct [[UK]]-based ''[[Sonic the Comic]]'', which was published from [[1993]] through [[2002]], as well as many UK-published books such as ''Stay Sonic''. Kintobor appears in ''Sonic the Comic'' as a computer program designed to assist Sonic and the Freedom Fighters. Whilst Robotnik's initial appearance was from that of his appearance in the [[Mega Drive]] games, he later 'transformed himself' and took the appearance of his design from the ''Adventures'' series, which took effect from issue 22 onwards.

That same year, [[Archie Comics]] began publishing its ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' comic book. The series is faithful to (and in a sense, a continuation of) [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (TV series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[animated cartoon]]; As well as a mad scientist, Robotnik is a portrayed as a [[dictator]] who took control of Sonic's hometown during a [[coup d'etat]]. After his uncle is taken prisoner by Robotnik's henchmen, Sonic the Hedgehog joins forces with a band of [[Freedom Fighters (Sonic the Hedgehog)|Freedom Fighters]] who oppose Robotnik's reign. In recent years, the plot of the comic has changed to incorporate elements from the video games, with Robotnik being replaced by his more traditional video game counterpart. Originally a one-off villain, "Eggman" [[first appearance|first appeared]] as a separate version of Robotnik from a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]]. After defeating the Freedom Fighters of his universe, Robotnik "roboticized" them into half-organic, half-metal [[cyborg]]s. However, the Freedom Fighters retained their free will and used their newfound strength to demolish Robotnik's army. Realizing he was ruined, Robotnik went insane and roboticized himself, becoming Robo-Robotnik.<ref>''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (comic book)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] #19'' [[Archie Comics]]</ref> This incarnation later switched from his old body for the new one identical to his ''Sonic Adventure'' design and changed his name to "Eggman", replacing Robotnik as the main antagonist of the books.<ref>''Sonic the Hedgehog #75'' [[Archie Comics]]</ref> Later, Eggman was turned back into flesh and blood by aliens called the Bem.

==Cultural impact==
===In science===
A potential macrocycle inhibitor of [[Sonic hedgehog]] discovered by a Harvard University research team was named "Robotnikinin" after the Dr. Robotnik character. The researchers felt that after Sonic hedgehog was named after the Sega video game character, they should "adhere to the convention" in naming the inhibiting compound after the character's archenemy.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.biotechnews.com.au/article/273516/robotnikinin_takes_sonic_hedgehog?fp=4&fpid=1013|title= Robotnikinin takes on Sonic hedgehog|accessdate=2009-02-22 |work= |publisher= www.biotechnews.com|date= 19 January 2009}}</ref>

===In music===
The band Intercontinental Music Lab included a song about Dr. Robotnik on their 2008 album, ''Superheroes of Science.''<ref>{{cite web|url= http://superheroesofscience.blogspot.com/|title= "Dr. Robotnik" from Superheroes of Science by Intercontinental Music Lab|accessdate=2009-05-14 |work= |publisher= http://www.intercontinentalmusiclab.com/|year= 2008}}</ref>

The [[power metal]] band [[Powerglove (band)|Powerglove]] wrote a song called "So Sexy Robotnik" based on the boss theme from [[Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (16-bit)|Sonic the Hedgehog 2]] and features snips from various other level tunes from the same game. It appears as the first track on their 2007 album "Metal Kombat for the Mortal Man".

===Merchandising===
{{Expand section|date=September 2008}}
Over the years, Dr. Robotnik has had a variety of merchandise, going from collectible pins and [[plush]] toys to specialized notebooks and clocks.

===Critical reception===
{{Expand section|date=September 2008}}
The character has been well-received, going on to become one of the most well-known villains in gaming.
