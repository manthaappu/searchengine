'''Sirius''' is a molecular modeling and analysis system developed at [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]]. Sirius is designed to support advanced user requirements that go beyond simple display of small [[molecule]]s and [[protein]]s. In addition to high quality interactive [[3D graphics]], Sirius supports structure building, displaying [[protein]] or [[DNA]] [[primary sequence]]s, access to remote data sources and visualization of [[molecular dynamics]] trajectories. Sirius can be used for [[scientific visualization]] and analysis, as well as for [[chemistry]] and [[biology]] instruction.

== The key features ==

Sirius supports a variety of applications with a set of features that include
* Building and editing chemical structures using a library of fragments
* Protein structure and [[sequence alignment]]
* Command line interpreter and scripting support fully compatible with existing [[RasMol]] scripts
* Full support for [[molecular dynamics]] trajectory visualization
* [[BLAST]] search directly in [[Protein Data Bank]] and [[Uniprot]] databases
* Ability to move parts of the loaded data while freezing the rest
* Interactive calculation of [[hydrogen bond]]ing, steric clashes, [[Ramachandran plot]]s
* Support for all major structure and sequence formats
* Bundled [[POV-Ray]] for creating photorealistic images
* Integrated selection and coloring across individual visualization components

Sirius is based on molecular graphics code and data structures developed as a part of [http://mbt.sdsc.edu Molecular Biology Toolkit].

== RasMol-compatible scripting ==

<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Sirius_rasmol_import.png|right|thumb|275px|Image of a molecular scene encoded by a RasMol script. Created using Sirius.]] -->
Sirius features a command line interpreter that can be used to quickly manipulate structure appearance and orientation. The set of commands has been patterned after [[RasMol]], so it's fully compatible with existing scripts. Additional commands introduced in Sirius have been added to provide support for manipulation of multiple structures loaded at the same time, and to enable more flexible selection. 

Existing RasMol scripts can be imported and run within Sirius to produce high quality representations of encoded molecular scenes. Since RasMol uses a coordinate system that differs from that Sirius, internal conversion is performed when RasMol scripts are imported, so that any orientation changes are shown correctly. Any manually entered commands, however, are executed according to the Sirius coordinate system. For details, refer to [http://sirius.sdsc.edu/help Sirius help].

Sirius supports a number of predefined atom/residue sets and color schemes, as well as allows for editing of scripts using the Command Panel interface. In addition, logical operators and parentheses can be used to create complex selection commands.

== Visualization of molecular dynamics trajectories ==

Sirius contains a full-featured molecular dynamics (MD) visualization component. It can read output files from [[AMBER]] and [[CHARMM]] simulations, including compressed and AMBER out files. [[RMSD]] changes along the trajectory can be calculated using user-defined atom subsets and displayed in an interactively updated graph. In order to reduce memory requirements, large multifile simulations may be loaded in a buffered mode. If a simulation involves changes in [[protein]] fold, Sirius can be set to track and recompute displayed [[secondary structure]] features in real time, which provides a convenient way to observe transformations of the structure. The full trajectory or selected frames can be exported as [[QuickTime]] video or a set of [[POV-Ray]] scene snapshots that can later be converted to a high quality movie.

== Sirius access and download ==

Sirius is distributed freely from the project [http://sirius.sdsc.edu/downloads.php website] to individuals affiliated with academic and non-profit organizations. Native desktop application installers are available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]]. In addition to providing the downloads, the project site contains Sirius [http://sirius.sdsc.edu/help help system], [http://sirius.sdsc.edu/tutorial/tutorials.html tutorials] and [http://sirius.sdsc.edu/screenshots.php screenshots].
