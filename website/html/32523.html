<html> <head> <title>Royal Meteorological Society</title></head><body>The '''Royal Meteorological Society''' traces its origins back to 3 April 1850 when the British Meteorological Society was formed as ''a society the objects of which should be the advancement and extension of meteorological science by determining the laws of climate and of meteorological phenomena in general''. Along with nine others, including [[James Glaisher]], John Drew, [[Edward Joseph Lowe]], [[Joseph Bancroft Reade|The Revd Joseph Bancroft Reade]], and Samuel Charles Whitbread, [[John Lee (astronomer)|Dr John Lee]], an astronomer, of [[Hartwell House, Buckinghamshire|Hartwell House]], near [[Aylesbury]], [[Buckinghamshire]] founded in the library of his house the British Meteorological Society, which became the Royal Meteorological Society.<ref>[http://www.rmets.org/pdf/metsocearlymembers.pdf Early members of the society]</ref> It became The Meteorological Society in 1866, when it was incorporated by [[Royal Charter]], and the Royal Meteorological Society in 1883, when Her Majesty [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] granted the privilege of adding 'Royal' to the title. Along with 74 others, the famous meteorologist [[Luke Howard]] joined the original 15 members of the Society at its first ordinary meeting on 7 May 1850. As of 2008 it has more than 3,000 members worldwide. The Chief Executive of the Society is Professor Paul Hardaker<ref>[http://www.rmets.org/faq.php RMetS website FAQ]</ref>.

==Mission==
Advancing the understanding of weather and climate, the science and its applications, for the benefit of all.

==Membership==
Membership is open to anyone with an interest in meteorology or related sciences. Associate Fellows may be any age and do not require any specific expertise in meteorology. Fellows normally require a formal qualification in a subject related to meteorology plus five years experience and must be nominated by two other fellows.

===Benefits of membership===
Both Fellows and Associate Fellows receive the monthly magazine ''Weather''. They may also attend, free of charge, meetings arranged by the Society and are eligible for travel and conference bursaries and to be proposed for awards and prizes. Fellowship of the Society is a formal statement of professional competence and those elected to it are entitled to use the title Fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society (FRMetS). Both Associate Fellows and Fellows can vote at the Annual General Meeting and Special General Meetings.  Members of the Society also have the opportunity to become involved in the many varied and interesting areas of work of the Society.

==Programmes of work==
The Society has a very broad programme of work including:
* developing education resources for primary and secondary schools and for teacher [[Continuing professional development|CPD]]
* promoting public engagement and dialogue on weather and climate science
* providing evidence-based policy support to Government
* encouraging continuing professional development (through [[National Vocational Qualification|NVQ]]/[[Scottish Vocational Qualification|SVQ]]) and offering professional accreditation as a Chartered Meteorologist (CMet)
* awarding grants and bursaries to young scientists working in meteorology
* recognising excellence through the programme of international awards and prizes
* developing quality standards for meteorological service providers
* publishing five international science journals
* a comprehensive national meetings and conference programme

==The society's journals==
The society has a number of regular publications:
* [http://www.rmets.org/activities/publications/index.php Weather]: a monthly magazine with many full colour illustrations and photos for specialists and general readers with an interest in meteorology. It uses a minimum of mathematics and technical language.
* [http://www.rmets.org/activities/publications/index.php The Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society]: as one of the world's leading journals for meteorology publishes original research in the atmopheric sciences. There are eight issues per year.
* [http://www.rmets.org/activities/publications/index.php Meteorological Applications]: this is a journal for applied meteorologists, forecasters and users of meteorological services and has been published since 1994. It is aimed at a general readership and authors are asked to take this into account when preparing papers.
* [http://www.rmets.org/activities/publications/index.php International Journal of Climatology]: has 15 issues a year and covers a broad spectrum of research in climatology.
* [http://www.rmets.org/activities/publications/index.php Atmospheric Science Letters]: an electronic only publication for short communication.

All publications are available online but a subscription is required. However certain "classic" papers are freely available at [http://www.rmets.org/activities/publications/index.php Classic papers].

==Local Centres and Special Interest Groups==
The society has several Local Centres across the UK<ref>[http://www.rmets.org/activities/groups/centres/index.php Local Centres]</ref>.

There are also a number of Special Interest Groups which organise meetings and other activities to facilitate exchange of information and views within specific areas of meteorology.<ref>[http://www.rmets.org/groups/SIG/index.php Special Interest Groups]</ref> These are informal groups of professionals interested in specific technical areas of the profession of meteorology. The groups are primarily a way of communicating at a specialist level.

The current special interest groups are:
*Association of British [[Climatology|Climatologists]]
*[[Atmospheric chemistry|Atmospheric Chemistry]]
*[[Data assimilation|Data Assimilation]]
*Dynamical Problems
*History of Meteorology and [[Physical oceanography|Physical Oceanography]]
*Meterorological Observing Systems
*Physical Processes
*[[Satellite]] Meteorology and Oceanography
*[[Weather forecasting|Weather Forecasting]]
*Weather Service Providers

==Endorsement of IPCC==
In February 2007, after the release of the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), the Royal Meteorological Society issued an endorsement of the report.  In addition to referring to the IPCC as “the world’s best climate scientists”, they stated that climate change is happening as “the result of emissions since industrialisation and we have already set in motion the next 50 years of global warming – what we do from now on will determine how worse it will get.”<ref>[http://www.rmets.org/news/detail.php?ID=332 Royal Meteorological Society’s statement on the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report.]</ref>
