<html> <head> <title>Ciphertext-only attack</title></head><body>In [[cryptography]], a '''ciphertext-only attack (COA)''' or '''known ciphertext attack''' is an [[attack model]] for [[cryptanalysis]] where the attacker is assumed to have access only to a set of [[ciphertext]]s. 

The attack is completely successful if the corresponding [[plaintext]]s can be deduced, or even better, the [[cryptographic key|key]].  The ability to obtain any information at all about the underlying plaintext is still considered a success. For example, if an adversary is sending ciphertext continuously to maintain [[traffic-flow security]], it would be very useful to be able to distinguish real messages from nulls. Even making an informed guess of the existence of real messages would facilitate [[traffic analysis]].  

In the [[history of cryptography]], early ciphers, implemented using pen-and-paper, were routinely broken using ciphertexts alone. Cryptographers developed statistical techniques for attacking ciphertext, such as [[Frequency analysis (cryptanalysis)|frequency analysis]]. Mechanical encryption devices such as [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] made these attacks much more difficult (although, historically, Polish cryptographers were able to mount a successful ciphertext-only [[cryptanalysis of the Enigma]] by exploiting an insecure protocol for indicating the message settings). 

Every modern [[cipher]] attempts to provide protection against ciphertext-only attacks. The vetting process for a new cipher design standard usually takes many years and includes exhaustive testing of large quantities of ciphertext for any statistical departure from random noise. ''See:'' [[Advanced Encryption Standard process]]. Also, the field of [[steganography]] evolved, in part, to develop methods like [[mimic function]]s that allow one piece of data to adopt the statistical profile of another. Nonetheless poor cipher usage or reliance on home-grown proprietary algorithms that have not been subject to thorough scrutiny has resulted in many computer-age encryption systems that are still subject to ciphertext-only attack. Examples include:

*Early versions of [[Microsoft]]'s [[Point-to-point tunneling protocol|PPTP]] [[virtual private network]] software used the same [[RC4]] key for the sender and the receiver (later versions had other problems). In any case where a stream cipher like RC4 is used twice with the same key it is open to ciphertext-only attack. ''See:'' [[stream cipher attack]]
* [[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP), the first security protocol for [[Wi-Fi]], proved vulnerable to several attacks, most of them ciphertext-only.
* Some modern cipher designs have later been shown to be vulnerable to ciphertext-only attacks. For example, [[Akelarre (cipher)|Akelarre]].
* A cipher whose key space is too small is subject to [[brute force attack]] with access to nothing but ciphertext by simply trying all possible keys. All that is needed is some way to distinguish valid plaintext from random noise, which is easily done for natural languages when the ciphertext is longer than the [[unicity distance]]. One example is [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]], which only has 56-bit keys. All too common current examples are commercial security products that derive keys for otherwise impregnable ciphers like [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] from a user-selected [[password]]. Since users rarely employ passwords with anything close to the [[Information entropy | entropy]] of the cipher's key space, such systems are often quite easy to break in practice using only ciphertext.
