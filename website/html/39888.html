After the measurement the measuring device pointer is shifted by what is  called the "weak value". So that a pointer initially pointing at zero before the measurement would point at the weak value after the measurement.  The system is not disturbed by the measurement.  Although this may seem to contradict some basic aspects of quantum theory, the formalism lies within the boundaries of the theory and does not contradict any fundamental concept.

The idea of weak measurements and weak values, first developed by [[Yakir Aharonov]], [[David Albert]] and [[Lev Vaidman]]
<ref>Y. Aharonov, D.Z. Albert, L. Vaidman, "How the result of a measurement of a component of the spin of a spin-1/2 particle can turn out to be 100," Physical Review Letters, 1988. [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v60/i14/p1351_1]</ref>
is especially useful for gaining information about pre- and post-selected systems described by the [[Quantum state|two state vector formalism]].<ref>Y. Aharonov and    L. Vaidman
in Time in Quantum Mechanics, J.G. Muga et al. eds., (Springer)  369-412 (2002) [http://il.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0105101 quant-ph/0105101]</ref>
Since a "strong" perturbative measurement can both upset the outcome of the post-selection and tamper with all subsequent measurement, weak nonperturbative measurements may be used to learn about such systems during their evolution.

If <math>|\phi_1\rangle</math> and <math>|\phi_2\rangle</math> are the pre- and post-selected quantum mechanical states, the ''weak value'' of the observable <math>\hat{\mathbf{A}}</math> is defined as
:<math> A_w = \frac{\langle\phi_1|\hat{\mathbf{A}}|\phi_2\rangle}{\langle\phi_1|\phi_2\rangle}.</math>

The weak value of the observable becomes large when the post-selected state, <math>|\phi_2\rangle</math>, approaches being orthogonal to the pre-selected state, <math>|\phi_1\rangle</math>. In this way, by properly choosing the two states, the weak value of the operator can be made arbitrarily large, and otherwise small effects can be amplified.<ref>O. Hosten and P.

Note that the theory of weak measurement allows [[Hardy's paradox]] to be explained.
In Hardy's paradox a positron and an electron go down both arms of each of their interferometers.  If they meet in the overlapping arms, they should annihilate each other.  But, strangely, they are
still registered as arriving at the detectors.<ref>

Related to this, a team of physicists from Japan reported in December, 2008, and published in March, 2009, that they were able to use joint weak measurement to observe a photonic version of Hardy's paradox. In this version, two photons were used instead of a positron and an electron and relied not upon non-annihilation but on polarization degrees of freedom values measured.<ref>
