== Referral Sites ==
Many schools across the UK have set up "Referral Sites" whereby students can access CyberMentors services from anywhere. Two of the most successful examples of this are [http://cybermentors.horbury.wakefield.sch.uk Horbury School's CyberMentors] and [http://samwhitcybermentors.org.uk SWCC CyberMentors]<ref name ="RefSites">{{cite web | title = Referral sites spring up all over the UK | url = http://www.beatbullying.org/dox/media-centre/news-archive/April%202010/cybermentors-referral-sites.html | accessdate = 2010-25-04 }}</ref>.
