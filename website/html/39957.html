'''Web archiving''' is the process of collecting portions of the [[World Wide Web]] and ensuring the collection is [[digital preservation|preserved]] in an [[archive]], such as an [[archive site]], for future researchers, historians, and the public.  Due to the massive size of the Web, web archivists typically employ [[web crawler]]s for automated collection.  The largest web archiving organization based on a crawling approach is the [[Internet Archive]] which strives to maintain an archive of the entire Web.  [[National library|National libraries]], [[national archive]]s and various consortia of organizations are also involved in archiving culturally important Web content. Commercial web archiving software and services are also available to organizations who need to archive their own web content for corporate heritage, regulatory, or legal purposes.

==Collecting the web==
Web archivists generally archive all types of web content including [[HTML]] web pages, [[style sheet (web development)|style sheets]], [[JavaScript]], [[digital image|images]], and [[digital video|video]]. They also archive [[metadata]] about the collected resources such as access time, [[MIME type]], and content length.  This metadata is useful in establishing [[Authentication|authenticity]] and [[provenance]] of the archived collection.

==Methods of collection==
===Remote harvesting===
The most common web archiving technique uses [[web crawler]]s to automate the process of collecting [[web page]]s.  Web crawlers typically view web pages in the same manner that users with a browser see the Web, and therefore provide a comparatively simple method of remotely harvesting web content. Examples of web crawlers frequently used for web archiving include:

* [http://www.biterscripting.com/helppages_automatedinternet.html Automated Internet Sessions] in [http://www.biterscripting.com/ biterScripting]
* [[Heritrix]]
* [[HTTrack]]
* [[Wget]]

Archives can be used as legal evidence.

===Database archiving===
Database archiving refers to methods for archiving the underlying content of database-driven websites. It typically requires the extraction of the [[database]] content into a standard [[logical schema|schema]], often using [[XML]]. Once stored in that standard format, the archived content of multiple databases can then be made available using a single access system. This approach is exemplified by the [http://deeparc.sourceforge.net/ DeepArc] and [http://www.nla.gov.au/xinq/ Xinq] tools developed by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] and the [[National Library of Australia]] respectively. DeepArc enables the structure of a [[relational database]] to be mapped to an [[XML schema]], and the content exported into an XML document. Xinq then allows that content to be delivered online. Although the original layout and behavior of the website cannot be preserved exactly, Xinq does allow the basic querying and retrieval functionality to be replicated.

===Transactional archiving===
Transactional archiving is an event-driven approach, which collects the actual transactions which take place between a [[web server]] and a [[web browser]]. It is primarily used as a means of preserving evidence of the content which was actually viewed on a particular [[website]], on a given date. This may be particularly important for organizations which need to comply with legal or regulatory requirements for disclosing and retaining information.

A transactional archiving system typically operates by intercepting every [[HTTP]] request to, and response from, the web server, filtering each response to eliminate duplicate content, and permanently storing the responses as bitstreams. A transactional archiving system requires the installation of software on the web server, and cannot therefore be used to collect content from a remote website.

Examples of commercial transactional archiving software include:

==Difficulties and limitations==
===Crawlers===
Web archives which rely on web crawling as their primary means of collecting the Web are influenced by the difficulties of web crawling:
* The [[robots exclusion protocol]] may request crawlers not access portions of a website.  Some web archivists may ignore the request and crawl those portions anyway.
* Large portions of a web site may be hidden in the [[deep Web]].  For example, the results page behind a web form lies in the deep Web because a crawler cannot follow a link to the results page.
* [[Crawler trap]]s (e.g., calendars) may cause a crawler to download an infinite number of pages, so crawlers are usually configured to limit the number of dynamic pages they crawl.

However, it is important to note that a native format web archive, i.e. a fully browsable web archive, with working links, media, etc., is only really possible using crawler technology. 

The Web is so large that crawling a significant portion of it takes a large amount of technical resources.  The Web is changing so fast that portions of a website may change before a crawler has even finished crawling it.

===General limitations===
* Some web servers are configured to return different pages to web archiver requests than they would in response to regular browser requests.  This is typically done to fool search engines into directing more user traffic to a website, and is often done to avoid accountability, or to provide enhanced content only to those browsers that can display it.
 
Not only must web archivists deal with the technical challenges of web archiving, they must also contend with intellectual property laws.  Peter Lyman<ref>Lyman (2002)</ref> states that "although the Web is popularly regarded as a [[public domain]] resource, it is [[copyright]]ed; thus, archivists have no legal right to copy the Web". However [[national library|national libraries]] in many countries do have a legal right to copy portions of the web under an extension of a [[legal deposit]].

Some private non-profit web archives that are made publicly accessible like [[WebCite]] or the [[Internet Archive]] allow content owners to hide or remove archived content that they do not want the public to have access to. Other web archives are only accessible from certain locations or have regulated usage. WebCite cites  a recent lawsuit against Google's caching, which [[Google]] won.<ref>[http://www.webcitation.org/faq FAQ] Webcitation.org</ref>

==Aspects of web curation==
Web curation, like any digital curation, entails:
*Collecting verifiable Web assets
*Providing Web asset search and retrieval
*Certification of the trustworthiness and integrity of the collection content
*Semantic and ontological continuity and comparability of the collection content

Thus, besides the discussion on methods of collecting the Web, those of providing access, certification, and organizing must be included. There are a set of popular tools that addresses these curation steps:

A suite of tools for Web Curation by [[International Internet Preservation Consortium]]:
* [http://crawler.archive.org/ Heritrix - official website] - collecting Web asset
* [http://archive-access.sourceforge.net/projects/nutch/ NutchWAX] - search Web archive collections
* [http://archive-access.sourceforge.net/projects/wayback/ Wayback (Open source Wayback Machine)] - search and navigate Web archive collections using NutchWax
* [http://webcurator.sourceforge.net/manuals.shtml Web Curator Tool] - Selection and Management of Web Collection

Other open source tools for manipulating web archives:
* [http://code.google.com/p/warc-tools/ WARC Tools] - for creating, reading, parsing and manipulating, web archives programmatically
* [http://code.google.com/p/search-tools/ Search Tools] - for indexing and searching full-text and metadata within web archives
