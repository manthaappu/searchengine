The [[Mercury program]] included several pad abort tests for the [[launch escape system]] with a [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] crew module. 
* 1959 July 22 - First successful pad abort flight test with a functional escape tower attached to a Mercury [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|Boilerplate]].
* 1959 July 28 - A Mercury Boilerplate with instruments to measure sound pressure levels and vibrations from the [[Little Joe]] test [[rocket]] and Grand Central abort rocket/escape tower.

The [[Apollo program]] included several pad abort tests for the launch escape system with a boilerplate crew module. 

* [[Pad Abort Test-1 (Apollo)|Pad Abort Test-1]] was conducted on November 7, 1963, and 

* [[Pad Abort Test-2 (Apollo)|Pad Abort Test-2]] was conducted on June 29, 1965. 

Both tests were conducted at the [[White Sands Missile Range]].

The Orion Pad Abort Test will start with the construction of the first Orion Boilerplate. It will be a basic mockup [[prototype]] to test the assembling sequences and launch procedures at NASA’s [[Langley Research Center]] while Lockheed aerospace engineers assemble the first rocket motors for the spacecraft’s escape tower.  The first Pad Abort Tests trials of the escape tower system will be at New Mexico’s [[White Sands Missile Range]] in 2008. [[Lockheed Martin]] Corp. was awarded the contract to build Orion on Aug. 31, 2006.
