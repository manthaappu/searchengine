'''Aboutness''' is a term used in library and information science (LIS), linguistics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind. In LIS, it is often considered synonymous with [[subject (discourse)]]. In philosophy it has been often considered synonymous with [[intentionality]], perhaps since [[John Searle]] (1983). 

R. A. Fairthorne (1969) is credited with coining the exact term "aboutness," which became popular in LIS since the late 1970s, perhaps due to arguments put forward by [[William John Hutchins]] (1975, 1977, 1978). Hutchins argued that "aboutness" was to be preferred to "subject" because it removed some epistemological problems. Hjørland (1992, 1997) argued, however, that the same epistemological problems also were present in Hutchins's proposal, why "aboutness" and "subject" should be considered synonymous. 

While information scientists may well be concerned with the literary aboutness (John Hutchins, 1975, 1977, 1978), philosophers of mind and psychologists with the psychological or [[intentionality|intentional]] aboutness (John Searle, 1983) and [[language of thought]] (Jerry Fodor, 1975), and [[semantic externalism|semantic externalists]] with the external state of affairs (Hilary Putnam, 1975). These seminal perspectives are respectively analogous to [[C. K. Ogden|Ogden]] and [[I. A. Richards|Richards]]' ''literary, psychological, and external contexts'' (1923), as well as [[Karl Popper]]'s ''World 1, 2, and 3 (1977). 

In linguistics, aboutness is simply meaning, the end of language. In psychology, it is [[intentionality]]. In [[psycholinguistics]] or [[cognitive linguistics]], it is [[language of thought]] in vogue, or something like that.
