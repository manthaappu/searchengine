'''Ron Kimmel''' ({{lang-he|רון קימל}}, b. 1963) is a professor of [[Computer Science]] at 
the [[Technion]] Israel Institute of Technology. 
He holds a D.Sc. degree in electrical engineering (1995) from the [[Technion]],
and spent a post-doctoral position at [[UC Berkeley]] and Berkeley Labs, and a visiting 
professorship at [[Stanford]] University. 
He has worked in various areas of image and shape analysis in computer vision, image 
processing, and computer graphics. 
Kimmel's interest in recent years has been non-rigid shape processing and analysis, medical imaging, computational biometry, numerical optimization of problems with a geometric flavor, 
and applications of metric geometry and differential geometry. 
Kimmel is an author of two books, an editor of one, and an author of numerous articles. 
He is the founder of the Geometric Image Processing Lab [http://gip.cs.technion.ac.il/],
and a founder and advisor of several successful image processing and analysis companies.

Kimmel's contributions include the development of [[fast marching]] methods for 
triangulated manifolds (together with [[James Sethian]]), the geodesic [[active contour]]s algorithm for image segmentation, a geometric framework for image filtering 
(named ''Beltrami flow'' after the Italian mathematician [[Eugenio Beltrami]]), and the Generalized Multidimensional Scaling 
(together with his students the Bronstein brothers) with
which he was able to compute the [[Gromov-Hausdorff]] distance 
between surfaces.

In 2003, he appeared in an interview to WNBC on the use of geometric approaches in 
three-dimensional [[face recognition system|face recognition]].
