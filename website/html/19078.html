The '''Internet''' is a global system of interconnected [[computer network]]s that use the standard [[Internet Protocol Suite]] (TCP/IP) to serve billions of users worldwide. It is a ''network of networks'' that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks, of local to global scope, that are linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of [[information]] resources and services, such as the inter-linked [[hypertext]] documents of the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW) and the infrastructure to support [[e-mail|electronic mail]].

Most traditional communications media including telephone, music, film, and television are reshaped or redefined by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) and [[IPTV]]. Newspaper, book and other print publishing are adapting to [[Web site]] technology, or are reshaped into [[blogging]] and [[web feed]]s. The Internet has enabled or accelerated new forms of human interactions through [[instant messaging]], [[Internet forum]]s, and [[social network service|social networking]]. [[Online shopping]] has boomed both for major retail outlets and small [[artisan]]s and traders. [[Business-to-business]] and [[financial services]] on the Internet affect [[supply chain]]s across entire industries.

The origins of the Internet reach back to research of the 1960s, commissioned by the United States government in collaboration with private commercial interests to build robust, fault-tolerant, and distributed computer networks. The funding of a new U.S. [[network backbone|backbone]] by the [[National Science Foundation]] in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial backbones, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks. The [[commercialization]] of what was by the 1990s an international network resulted in its popularization and incorporation into virtually every aspect of modern human life. As of 2009, an estimated quarter of Earth's population used the services of the Internet.

The Internet has no centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own standards. Only the overreaching definitions of the two principal [[name space]]s in the Internet, the [[IP address|Internet Protocol address]] space and the [[Domain Name System]], are directed by a maintainer organization, the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN). The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols ([[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]]) is an activity of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise.

==Terminology==
{{See also|Internet capitalization conventions}}
''Internet'' is a short form of the technical term [[internetwork]],<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |title=Internet, n. |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00304286 |accessdate=2010-10-26 |edition=Draft |date=March 2009 |quote=Shortened < INTERNETWORK n., perhaps influenced by similar words in -net}}</ref> the result of interconnecting computer networks with special gateways or routers.  The Internet is also often referred to as ''the Net''.

The term ''the Internet'', when referring to the entire global system of IP networks, has been treated as a [[proper noun]] and written with an initial [[capital letter]].  In the media and popular culture a trend has also developed to regard it as a generic term or common noun and thus write it as "the internet", without capitalization. Some guides specify that the word should be capitalized as a noun but not capitalized as an adjective.

[[File:Handbuch Webdesign-InternetDatenaustausch.jpg|thumb|right|Depiction of the Internet as a ''cloud'' in network diagrams]]

The terms ''Internet'' and ''World Wide Web'' are often used in everyday speech without much distinction. However, the Internet and the [[World Wide Web]] are not one and the same. The Internet is a global data communications system. It is a hardware and software [[infrastructure]] that provides connectivity between computers. In contrast, the Web is one of the services communicated via the Internet. It is a collection of interconnected documents and other [[Resource (Web)|resources]], linked by [[hyperlink]]s and [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#h-12.1|title= Links |accessdate=2008-08-13 |work=HTML 4.01 Specification |publisher=World Wide Web Consortium |date=HTML 4.01 Specification | quote = [T]he link (or hyperlink, or Web link) [is] the basic hypertext construct. A link is a connection from one Web resource to another. Although a simple concept, the link has been one of the primary forces driving the success of the Web. }}</ref>

In many technical illustrations when the precise location or interrelation of Internet resources is not important, extended networks such as the Internet are often depicted as a cloud.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cloud — Computer Dictionary Definition|url=http://computer.yourdictionary.com/cloud|work=YourDictionary.com|publisher=LoveToKnow|accessdate=26 October 2010}}</ref> The verbal image has been formalized in the newer concept of [[cloud computing]].

==History==
{{Main|History of the Internet}}
The [[Soviet Union|USSR]]'s launch of [[Sputnik]] spurred the United States to create the [[DARPA|Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (ARPA or DARPA) in February [[1958 in science|1958]] to regain a technological lead.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.darpa.mil/body/arpa_darpa.html | title=ARPA/DARPA | accessdate=2007-05-21 | publisher=Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070407064829/http://www.darpa.mil/body/arpa_darpa.html |archivedate = April 7, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.darpa.mil/history.html | title=DARPA: History | accessdate=2009-12-07 | publisher=Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency}}</ref> {{quotation|
:1957 - October 4th - the USSR launches Sputnik, the first artificial earth satellite.
:1958 - February 7th - In response to the launch of Sputnik, the US Department of Defense issues directive 5105.15 establishing the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).
The organization united some of America's most brilliant people, who developed the United States' first successful satellite in 18 months. Several years later ARPA began to focus on computer networking and communications technology.<ref name="NetValley">[http://www.netvalley.com/intval.html "Roads and Crossroads of Internet History"] by Gregory Gromov</ref> }}


ARPA created the [[Information Processing Technology Office]] (IPTO) to further the research of the [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment]] (SAGE) program, which had networked country-wide [[radar]] systems together for the first time. The IPTO's purpose was to find ways to address the US military's concern about survivability of their communications networks, and as a first step interconnect their computers at the [[Pentagon]], [[Cheyenne Mountain]], and [[Strategic Air Command|Strategic Air Command headquarters (SAC)]].  [[J. C. R. Licklider]], a promoter of universal networking, was selected to head the IPTO. Licklider moved from the Psycho-Acoustic Laboratory at [[Harvard University]] to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in [[1950 in science|1950]], after becoming interested in [[information technology]]. At MIT, he served on a committee that established [[Lincoln Laboratory]] and worked on the SAGE project. In [[1957 in science|1957]] he became a Vice President at [[BBN Technologies|BBN]], where he bought the first production [[PDP-1]] computer and conducted the first public demonstration of [[time-sharing]].

[[File:Leonard-Kleinrock-and-IMP1.png|thumb|upright|Professor [[Leonard Kleinrock]] with one of the first ARPANET [[Interface Message Processor]]s at UCLA]]
At the IPTO, Licklider's successor [[Ivan Sutherland]] in 1965 got [[Lawrence Roberts (scientist)|Lawrence Roberts]] to start a project to make a network, and Roberts based the technology on the work of [[Paul Baran]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Baran|first=Paul|title=On Distributed Communications|year=1964|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_memoranda/RM3767|accessdate=2010-07-05}}</ref> who had written an exhaustive study for the [[United States Air Force]] that recommended [[packet switching]] (opposed to [[circuit switching]]) to achieve better network robustness and disaster survivability. Roberts had worked at the [[MIT Lincoln Laboratory]] originally established to work on the design of the SAGE system.  UCLA professor [[Leonard Kleinrock]] had provided the theoretical foundations for packet networks in 1962, and later, in the 1970s, for [[hierarchical routing]], concepts which have been the underpinning of the development towards today's Internet.

Sutherland's successor [[Robert Taylor (computer scientist)|Robert Taylor]] convinced Roberts to build on his early packet switching successes and come and be the IPTO Chief Scientist.  Once there, Roberts prepared a report called Resource Sharing Computer Networks which was approved by Taylor in June 1968 and laid the foundation for the launch of the working ARPANET the following year.

After much work, the first two nodes of what would become the [[ARPANET]] were interconnected between Kleinrock's Network Measurement Center at the [[Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science|UCLA's School of Engineering and Applied Science]] and [[Douglas Engelbart|Douglas Engelbart's]] NLS system at [[SRI International]] (SRI) in [[Menlo Park, California]], on 29 October 1969. The third site on the ARPANET was the Culler-Fried Interactive Mathematics center at the University of California at Santa Barbara, and the fourth was the [[University of Utah]] Graphics Department. In an early sign of future growth, there were already fifteen sites connected to the young ARPANET by the end of 1971.

The ARPANET was one of the ''eve'' networks of today's Internet. In an independent development, [[Donald Davies]] at the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|UK National Physical Laboratory]] also discovered the concept of packet switching in the early 1960s, first giving a talk on the subject in 1965, after which the teams in the new field from two sides of the Atlantic ocean first became acquainted.  It was actually Davies' coinage of the wording "packet" and "packet switching" that was adopted as the standard terminology. Davies also built a packet switched network in the UK called the Mark I in 1970.

Timothy Johnson. New Scientist. May 13, 1976</ref> The network they established was called [[Telenet]] and began operation in 1975, installing free public [[dial-up access]] in cities throughout the U.S. Telenet was the first packet-switching network open to the general public.<ref>Stephen Segaller, ''NERDS 2.0.1:115 (TV Books Publisher 1998)</ref>

Following the demonstration that packet switching worked on the ARPANET, the [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|British Post Office]], [[Telenet]], [[DATAPAC]] and TRANSPAC collaborated to create the first international packet-switched network service. In the UK, this was referred to as the [[International Packet Switched Service]] (IPSS), in [[1978 in science|1978]]. The collection of [[X.25]]-based networks grew from Europe and the US to cover Canada, Hong Kong and Australia by 1981. The X.25 packet switching standard was developed in the CCITT (now called [[ITU-T]]) around 1976.  [[File:Birth of the Internet.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A plaque commemorating the birth of the Internet at [[Stanford University]]]]
X.25 was independent of the TCP/IP protocols that arose from the experimental work of DARPA on the ARPANET, Packet Radio Net and Packet Satellite Net during the same time period.

The early ARPANET ran on the [[Network Control Program]] (NCP), implementing the host-to-host connectivity and switching layers of the protocol stack, designed and first implemented in December 1970 by a team called the Network Working Group (NWG) led by [[Steve Crocker]]. To respond to the network's rapid growth as more and more locations connected, [[Vinton Cerf]] and [[Bob Kahn|Robert Kahn]] developed the first description of the now widely used TCP protocols during 1973 and published a paper on the subject in May 1974. Use of the term "Internet" to describe a single global [[TCP/IP network]] originated in December 1974 with the publication of RFC 675, the first full specification of TCP that was written by Vinton Cerf, Yogen Dalal and Carl Sunshine, then at [[Stanford University]]. During the next nine years, work proceeded to refine the protocols and to implement them on a wide range of operating systems. The first [[Internet Protocol Suite|TCP/IP]]-based wide-area network was operational by 1 January 1983 when all hosts on the ARPANET were switched over from the older NCP protocols. In 1985, the United States' [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) commissioned the construction of the [[NSFNET]], a university 56 [[kilobit]]/second network backbone using computers called "[[Fuzzball router|fuzzballs]]" by their inventor, [[David L. Mills]]. The following year, NSF sponsored the conversion to a higher-speed 1.5 [[Mbps|megabit/second]] network. A key decision to use the DARPA [[TCP/IP]] protocols was made by Dennis Jennings, then in charge of the Supercomputer program at NSF.

The opening of the NSFNET to other networks began in 1988.<ref>{{cite web |author2=Bernard Aboba |author=Vinton Cerf |title=How the Internet Came to Be |url=http://www.netvalley.com/archives/mirrors/cerf-how-inet.html |year=1993 |accessdate=2010-11-23}}</ref> The US Federal Networking Council approved the interconnection of the NSFNET to the commercial [[MCI Mail]] system in that year and the link was made in the summer of 1989. Other commercial electronic mail services were soon connected, including OnTyme, Telemail and Compuserve. In that same year, three commercial Internet service providers (ISPs) began operations: [[UUNET]], [[PSINet]], and CERFNET. Important, separate networks that offered gateways into, then later merged with, the Internet include [[Usenet]] and [[BITNET]]. Various other commercial and educational networks, such as [[Telenet]] (by that time renamed to Sprintnet), [[Tymnet]], [[Compuserve]] and [[JANET]] were interconnected with the growing Internet in the 1980s as the TCP/IP protocol became increasingly popular. The adaptability of TCP/IP to existing communication networks allowed for rapid growth. The open availability of the specifications and reference code permitted commercial vendors to build interoperable network components, such as routers, making standardized network gear available from many companies. This aided in the rapid growth of the Internet and the proliferation of local-area networking. It seeded the widespread implementation and rigorous standardization of TCP/IP on [[UNIX]] and virtually every other common operating system.

[[File:First Web Server.jpg|thumb|left|This [[NeXT Computer]] was used by [[Sir Tim Berners-Lee]] at [[CERN]] and became the world's first [[Web server]].]]

Although the basic applications and guidelines that make the Internet possible had existed for almost two decades, the network did not gain a public face until the 1990s. On 6 August 1991, [[CERN]], a pan-European organization for particle research, publicized the new [[World Wide Web]] project. The Web was invented by British scientist [[Tim Berners-Lee]] in 1989. An early popular [[web browser]] was [[ViolaWWW]], patterned after [[HyperCard]] and built using the [[X Window System]]. It was eventually replaced in popularity by the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]] web browser. In 1993, the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] released version 1.0 of Mosaic, and by late 1994 there was growing public interest in the previously academic, technical Internet. By 1996 usage of the word ''Internet'' had become commonplace, and consequently, so had its use as a [[synecdoche]] in reference to the World Wide Web.

Meanwhile, over the course of the decade, the Internet successfully accommodated the majority of previously existing public computer networks (although some networks, such as [[FidoNet]], have remained separate). During the late 1990s, it was estimated that traffic on the public Internet grew by 100 percent per year, while the mean annual growth in the number of Internet users was thought to be between 20% and 50%.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/internet.size.pdf |format=PDF| title=The size and growth rate of the Internet | accessdate=2007-05-21 | author=Coffman, K. G; [[Odlyzko]], A. M. | publisher=AT&T Labs | date=1998-10-02}}</ref> This growth is often attributed to the lack of central administration, which allows organic growth of the network, as well as the non-proprietary open nature of the Internet protocols, which encourages vendor interoperability and prevents any one company from exerting too much control over the network.<ref>{{cite book | last = Comer | first = Douglas | title = The Internet book | publisher=Prentice Hall | page = 64 | isbn = 0132335530 | year = 2006}}</ref> The estimated population of [[Internet users]] is 1.97 billion<!-- full figure 1,966,514,816 - rounded --> as of 30 June 2010.<ref name="stats1">{{cite web |url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm |title=World Internet Users and Population Stats |work=Internet World Stats |publisher=Miniwatts Marketing Group |date=2010-06-30 |accessdate=2010-08-04}}<!-- previous cite {{cite web|url=http://www.50x15.com/en-us/internet_usage.aspx |title=AMD 50x15 - World Internet Usage |publisher=50x15.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-06}} --></ref>

From 2009 onward, the Internet is expected to grow significantly in [[Brazil]], [[Russia]], [[India]], [[China]], and [[Indonesia]] (BRICI countries). These countries have large [[population]]s and moderate to high economic growth, but still low Internet penetration rates. In 2009, the BRICI countries represented about 45 percent of the world's population and had approximately 610 million Internet users, but by 2015, Internet users in BRICI countries will double to 1.2 billion, and will triple in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/art/services/print.php?articleid=48062 |title=Internet users in BRICI countries set to double by 2015|publisher=International Business Times — IBTIMES.com |date=2010-09-01 |accessdate=2010-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/business/internet-users-in-indonesia-to-triple-by-2015-report/394066 |title=Internet Users in Indonesia to Triple by 2015: Report |publisher=The Jakarta Globe |date= |accessdate=2010-10-31}}</ref>

==Technology==
===Protocols===
{{Main|Internet Protocol Suite}}
The complex communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of its hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture. While the hardware can often be used to support other software systems, it is the design and the rigorous standardization process of the software architecture that characterizes the Internet and provides the foundation for its scalability and success. The responsibility for the architectural design of the Internet software systems has been delegated to the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/ |title=IETF Home Page |publisher=Ietf.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-20}}</ref> The IETF conducts standard-setting work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of Internet architecture. Resulting discussions and final standards are published in a series of publications, each called a [[Request for Comments]] (RFC), freely available on the IETF web site. The principal methods of networking that enable the Internet are contained in specially designated RFCs that constitute the [[Internet Standard]]s.  Other less rigorous documents are simply informative,  experimental, or historical, or document the best current practices (BCP) when implementing Internet technologies.

The Internet Standards describe a framework known as the [[Internet Protocol Suite]]. This is a model architecture that divides methods into a layered system of protocols (RFC 1122, RFC 1123). The layers correspond to the environment or scope in which their services operate. At the top is the [[Application Layer]], the space for the application-specific networking methods used in software applications, e.g., a web browser program.  Below this top layer, the [[Transport Layer]] connects applications on ''different hosts'' via the network (e.g., [[client–server model]]) with appropriate data exchange methods. Underlying these layers are the core networking technologies, consisting of two layers. The [[Internet Layer]] enables computers to identify and locate each other via [[IP address|Internet Protocol (IP) addresses]], and allows them to connect to one-another via intermediate (transit) networks. Lastly, at the bottom of the architecture, is a software layer, the [[Link Layer]], that provides connectivity between hosts on the same local network link, such as a local area network ([[LAN]]) or a [[Dial-up Internet access|dial-up connection]]. The model, also known as [[TCP/IP]], is designed to be independent of the underlying hardware which the model therefore does not concern itself with in any detail.  Other models have been developed, such as the [[Open Systems Interconnection]] (OSI) model, but they are not compatible in the details of description, nor implementation, but many similarities exist and the TCP/IP protocols are usually included in the discussion of OSI networking.

The most prominent component of the Internet model is the [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) which provides addressing systems ([[IP address]]es) for computers on the Internet. IP enables [[internetworking]] and essentially establishes the Internet itself.  IP Version 4 ([[IPv4]]) is the initial version used on the first generation of the today's Internet and is still in dominant use. It was designed to address up to ~4.3 billion (10<sup>9</sup>) Internet hosts. However, the explosive growth of the Internet has led to [[IPv4 address exhaustion]] which is estimated to enter its final stage in approximately 2011.<ref>{{cite web | last=Huston | first=Geoff | title=IPv4 Address Report, daily generated | url=http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/index.html | accessdate=2009-05-20}}</ref> A new protocol version, [[IPv6]], was developed in the mid 1990s which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of Internet traffic. [[IPv6]] is currently in commercial [[IPv6 deployment|deployment]] phase around the world and Internet address registries ([[Regional Internet registry|RIRs]]) have begun to urge all resource managers to plan rapid adoption and conversion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arin.net/knowledge/about_resources/ceo_letter.pdf |title=Notice of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) Address Depletion |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-08-07}}</ref>

IPv6 is not interoperable with IPv4. It essentially establishes a "parallel" version of the Internet not directly accessible with IPv4 software. This means software upgrades or translator facilities are necessary for every networking device that needs to communicate on the IPv6 Internet. Most modern computer operating systems are already converted to operate with both versions of the Internet Protocol. Network infrastructures, however, are still lagging in this development. Aside from the complex physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the Internet is facilitated by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts (e.g., [[peering agreement]]s), and by technical specifications or [[communications protocol|protocol]]s that describe how to exchange [[data]] over the network. Indeed, the Internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies.

===Structure===
The Internet structure and its usage characteristics have been studied extensively. It has been determined that both the Internet IP routing structure and hypertext links of the World Wide Web are examples of [[scale-free network]]s. Similar to the way the commercial Internet providers connect via [[Internet exchange point]]s, research networks tend to interconnect into large subnetworks such as [[GEANT]], [[GLORIAD]], [[Internet2]] (successor of the [[Abilene Network]]), and the UK's [[national research and education network]] [[JANET]]. These in turn are built around smaller networks (see also the list of [[:Category:Academic computer network organizations|academic computer network organizations]]).

Many computer scientists describe the Internet as a "prime example of a large-scale, highly engineered, yet highly complex system".<ref>Walter Willinger, Ramesh Govindan, Sugih Jamin, Vern Paxson, and Scott Shenker (2002). [http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/99/suppl_1/2573 Scaling phenomena in the Internet], in ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 99'', suppl. 1, 2573–2580</ref> The Internet is extremely heterogeneous; for instance, [[data transfer rate]]s and physical characteristics of connections vary widely. The Internet exhibits "[[Emergence|emergent phenomena]]" that depend on its large-scale organization. For example, data transfer rates exhibit temporal [[self-similarity]]. The principles of the routing and addressing methods for traffic in the Internet reach back to their origins the 1960s when the eventual scale and popularity of the network could not be anticipated. Thus, the possibility of developing alternative structures is investigated.<ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003667811_btrebuildnet16.html "Internet Makeover? Some argue it's time"]. The Seattle Times, 2007-04-16.</ref>

==Governance==
{{Main|Internet governance}}
[[File:Icannheadquarters.jpg|thumb|ICANN headquarters in [[Marina Del Rey]], California, United States]]

The Internet is a [[global network|globally distributed network]] comprising many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks. It operates without a central governing body. However, to maintain interoperability, all technical and policy aspects of the underlying core infrastructure and the principal [[name space]]s are administered by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN), headquartered in [[Marina del Rey, California]]. ICANN is the authority that coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the Internet, including [[domain name]]s, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, application port numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters. Globally unified name spaces, in which names and numbers are uniquely assigned, are essential for the global reach of the Internet. ICANN is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities. The government of the United States continues to have the primary role in approving changes to the [[DNS root zone]] that lies at the heart of the domain name system.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}  ICANN's role in coordinating the assignment of unique identifiers distinguishes it as perhaps the only central coordinating body on the global Internet. On 16 November 2005, the [[World Summit on the Information Society]], held in [[Tunis]], established the [[Internet Governance Forum]] (IGF) to discuss Internet-related issues.

==Modern uses==
The Internet is allowing greater flexibility in working hours and location, especially with the spread of unmetered high-speed connections and [[web application]]s.

The Internet can now be accessed almost anywhere by numerous means, especially through [[mobile Internet device]]s. Mobile phones, [[datacard]]s, [[handheld game console]]s and [[cellular router]]s allow users to connect to the Internet from anywhere there is a wireless network supporting that device's technology. Within the limitations imposed by small screens and other limited facilities of such pocket-sized devices, services of the Internet, including email and the web, may be available. Service providers may restrict the services offered and wireless data transmission charges may be significantly higher than other access methods.

Educational material at all levels from pre-school to post-doctoral is available from [[website]]s. Examples range from [[CBeebies]], through school and high-school revision guides, [[Virtual university|virtual universities]], to access to top-end scholarly literature through the likes of [[Google Scholar]]. In [[distance education]], help with [[homework]] and other assignments, self-guided learning, whiling away spare time, or just looking up more detail on an interesting fact, it has never been easier for people to access educational information at any level from anywhere. The Internet in general and the [[World Wide Web]] in particular are important enablers of both [[Education|formal]] and [[informal education]].

The low cost and nearly instantaneous sharing of ideas, knowledge, and skills has made [[collaboration|collaborative]] work dramatically easier, with the help of [[collaborative software]]. Not only can a group cheaply communicate and share ideas, but the wide reach of the Internet allows such groups to easily form in the first place. An example of this is the [[free software movement]], which has produced, among other programs, [[Linux]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], and [[OpenOffice.org]]. Internet "chat", whether in the form of [[IRC]] chat rooms or channels, or via [[instant messaging]] systems, allow colleagues to stay in touch in a very convenient way when working at their computers during the day.  Messages can be exchanged even more quickly and conveniently than via e-mail. Extensions to these systems may allow files to be exchanged, "whiteboard" drawings to be shared or voice and video contact between team members.

[[Version control]] systems allow collaborating teams to work on shared sets of documents without either accidentally overwriting each other's work or having members wait until they get "sent" documents to be able to make their contributions. Business and project teams can share calendars as well as documents and other information. Such collaboration occurs in a wide variety of areas including scientific research, software development, conference planning, political activism and creative writing. Social and political collaboration is also becoming more widespread as both Internet access and [[computer literacy]] grow. From the [[flash mob]] 'events' of the early 2000s to the [[Role of the Internet during 2009 Iranian election protests#Use of social networking|use of social networking in the 2009 Iranian election protests]], the Internet allows people to work together more effectively and in many more ways than was possible without it.

The Internet allows computer users to [[Remote access|remotely access]] other computers and information stores easily, wherever they may be across the world. They may do this with or without the use of [[Computer security|security]], authentication and encryption technologies, depending on the requirements. This is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An [[accountancy|accountant]] sitting at home can [[audit]] the books of a company based in another country, on a [[server (computing)|server]] situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information e-mailed to them from offices all over the world. Some of these things were possible before the widespread use of the Internet, but the cost of private [[leased line]]s would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps on the other side of the world on a business trip or a holiday, can open a [[Remote Desktop Protocol|remote desktop]] session into his normal office PC using a secure [[Virtual Private Network]] (VPN) connection via the Internet. This gives the worker complete access to all of his or her normal files and data, including e-mail and other applications, while away from the office. This concept has been referred to among [[system administrator]]s as the Virtual Private Nightmare,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Virtual Private Nightmare: VPN|url=http://librenix.com/?inode=5013|publisher=Librenix|accessdate=2010-07-21|date=2004-08-04}}</ref> because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into its employees' homes.

===Information===
Many people use the terms ''Internet'' and ''World Wide Web'', or just the ''Web'', interchangeably, but the two terms are not [[synonymous]]. The [[World Wide Web]] is a global set of [[documents]], [[Computer graphics|images]] and other resources, logically interrelated by [[hyperlink]]s and referenced with [[Uniform Resource Identifier]]s (URIs). URIs allow providers to symbolically identify services and clients to locate and address [[web servers]], file servers, and other databases that store documents and provide resources and access them using the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), the primary carrier protocol of the Web. HTTP is only one of the hundreds of communication protocols used on the Internet. [[Web service]]s may also use HTTP to allow software systems to communicate in order to share and exchange business logic and data.

World Wide Web browser software, such as [[Microsoft]]'s [[Internet Explorer]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], and [[Google Chrome]], let users navigate from one web page to another via hyperlinks embedded in the documents. These documents may also contain any combination of [[computer data]], including graphics, sounds, [[Plain text|text]], [[web video|video]], [[multimedia]] and interactive content including [[web game|games]], [[office applications]] and scientific demonstrations. Through [[keyword (Internet search)|keyword]]-driven [[Internet research]] using [[Web search engine|search engine]]s like [[Yahoo! Search|Yahoo!]] and [[Google (search engine)|Google]], users worldwide have easy, instant access to a vast and diverse amount of online information. Compared to printed [[encyclopedia]]s and traditional [[libraries]], the World Wide Web has enabled the decentralization of information.

The Web has also enabled individuals and organizations to [[publish]] ideas and information to a potentially large [[audience]] online at greatly reduced expense and time delay. Publishing a web page, a blog, or building a website involves little initial [[cost]] and many cost-free services are available. Publishing and maintaining large, professional web sites with attractive, diverse and up-to-date information is still a difficult and expensive proposition, however. Many individuals and some companies and groups use ''web logs'' or blogs, which are largely used as easily updatable online diaries. Some commercial organizations encourage [[employees|staff]] to communicate advice in their areas of specialization in the hope that visitors will be impressed by the expert knowledge and free information, and be attracted to the corporation as a result. One example of this practice is [[Microsoft]], whose [[software developer|product developers]] publish their personal blogs in order to pique the public's interest in their work. Collections of personal web pages published by large service providers remain popular, and have become increasingly sophisticated. Whereas operations such as [[Angelfire]] and [[GeoCities]] have existed since the early days of the Web, newer offerings from, for example, Facebook and MySpace currently have large followings. These operations often brand themselves as [[social network service]]s rather than simply as web page hosts.

[[Online advertising|Advertising]] on popular web pages can be lucrative, and [[e-commerce]] or the sale of products and services directly via the Web continues to grow.

When the Web began in the 1990s, a typical web page was stored in completed form on a web server, formatted with [[HTML]], ready to be sent to a user's browser in response to a request. Over time, the process of creating and serving web pages has become more automated and more dynamic. Websites are often created using [[content management]] or [[wiki]] software with, initially, very little content. Contributors to these systems, who may be paid staff, members of a club or other organization or members of the public, fill underlying databases with content using editing pages designed for that purpose, while casual visitors view and read this content in its final HTML form.  There may or may not be editorial, approval and security systems built into the process of taking newly entered content and making it available to the target visitors.

===Communication===
[[E-mail]] is an important communications service available on the Internet. The concept of sending electronic text messages between parties in a way analogous to mailing letters or memos predates the creation of the Internet. Today it can be important to distinguish between internet and internal e-mail systems. Internet e-mail may travel and be stored unencrypted on many other networks and machines out of both the sender's and the recipient's control. During this time it is quite possible for the content to be read and even tampered with by third parties, if anyone considers it important enough. Purely internal or intranet mail systems, where the information never leaves the corporate or organization's network, are much more secure, although in any organization there will be [[information technology|IT]] and other personnel whose job may involve monitoring, and occasionally accessing, the e-mail of other employees not addressed to them. Pictures, documents and other files can be sent as [[e-mail attachment]]s. E-mails can be [[Carbon copy|cc-ed]] to multiple [[e-mail addresses]].

[[Internet telephony]] is another common communications service made possible by the creation of the Internet. [[VoIP]] stands for Voice-over-[[Internet Protocol]], referring to the protocol that underlies all Internet communication. The idea began in the early 1990s with [[walkie-talkie]]-like voice applications for personal computers. In recent years many VoIP systems have become as easy to use and as convenient as a normal telephone. The benefit is that, as the Internet carries the voice traffic, VoIP can be free or cost much less than a traditional telephone call, especially over long distances and especially for those with always-on Internet connections such as [[Cable modem|cable]] or [[ADSL]]. VoIP is maturing into a competitive alternative to traditional telephone service. Interoperability between different providers has improved and the ability to call or receive a call from a traditional telephone is available. Simple, inexpensive VoIP network adapters are available that eliminate the need for a personal computer.

Voice quality can still vary from call to call but is often equal to and can even exceed that of traditional calls. Remaining problems for VoIP include [[emergency telephone number]] dialing and reliability. Currently, a few VoIP providers provide an emergency service, but it is not universally available. Traditional phones are line-powered and operate during a power failure; VoIP does not do so without a [[uninterruptible power supply|backup power source]] for the phone equipment and the Internet access devices. VoIP has also become increasingly popular for gaming applications, as a form of communication between players. Popular VoIP clients for gaming include [[Ventrilo]] and [[Teamspeak]]. [[Wii]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]] also offer VoIP chat features.

===Data transfer===
[[File sharing]] is an example of transferring large amounts of data across the Internet. A [[computer file]] can be [[Electronic mail|e-mailed]] to customers, colleagues and friends as an [[E-mail attachment|attachment]]. It can be uploaded to a website or [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] server for easy download by others. It can be put into a "shared location" or onto a [[file server]] for instant use by colleagues. The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of "[[mirror (computing)|mirror]]" servers or [[peer-to-peer]] networks. In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user [[authentication]], the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by [[encryption]], and money may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed—usually fully encrypted—across the Internet. The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by [[digital signature]]s or by [[MD5]] or other message digests. These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission. This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts. This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.

[[Streaming media]] refers to the act that many existing radio and television broadcasters promote Internet "feeds" of their live audio and video streams (for example, the [[Bbc.co.uk/cbbc/games/|BBC]]). They may also allow time-shift viewing or listening such as Preview, Classic Clips and Listen Again features. These providers have been joined by a range of pure Internet "broadcasters" who never had on-air licenses. This means that an Internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, can be used to access on-line media in much the same way as was previously possible only with a television or radio receiver. The range of available types of content is much wider, from specialized technical [[webcast]]s to on-demand popular multimedia services. [[Podcast]]ing is a variation on this theme, where—usually audio—material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a [[portable media player]] to be listened to on the move. These techniques using simple equipment allow anybody, with little censorship or licensing control, to broadcast audio-visual material worldwide.

'Connected' TV needs good internet connection. The image quality is depends on internet speed. As example for standard image quality needs 1 Mbps internet speed for SD 480p, requires 2.5 Mbps for HD 720p quality and the top-of-the-line HDX quality needs 4.5 Mbps for 1080p.<ref>What to know before buying a 'connected' TV http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40241749/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets</ref>

[[Webcam]]s can be seen as an even lower-budget extension of this phenomenon. While some webcams can give full-frame-rate video, the picture is usually either small or updates slowly. Internet users can watch animals around an African waterhole, ships in the [[Panama Canal]], traffic at a local roundabout or monitor their own premises, live and in real time. Video [[chat rooms]] and [[video conferencing]] are also popular with many uses being found for personal webcams, with and without two-way sound. YouTube was founded on 15 February 2005 and is now the leading website for free streaming video with a vast number of users. It uses a [[Adobe Flash|flash]]-based web player to stream and show video files. Registered users may upload an unlimited amount of video and build their own personal profile. YouTube claims that its users watch hundreds of millions, and upload hundreds of thousands of videos daily.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/t/fact_sheet|title=YouTube Fact Sheet|publisher=YouTube, LLC |accessdate=2009-01-20}}</ref>

==Access==

The prevalent language for communication on the Internet is English. This may be a result of the origin of the Internet, as well as English's role as a [[lingua franca]]. It may also be related to the poor capability of early computers, largely originating in the United States, to handle characters other than those in the English variant of the [[Latin alphabet]]. After English (28% of Web visitors) the most requested languages on the [[World Wide Web]] are Chinese (23%), Spanish (8%), Japanese (5%), Portuguese and German (4% each), Arabic, French and Russian (3% each), and Korean (2%).<ref>[http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm Internet World Stats], updated for 2009-12-31.

The Internet's technologies have developed enough in recent years, especially in the use of [[Unicode]], that good facilities are available for development and communication in the world's widely used languages. However, some glitches such as ''[[mojibake]]'' (incorrect display of some languages' characters) still remain.

Common methods of [[Internet access]] in homes include [[dial-up Internet access|dial-up]], landline [[Broadband Internet access|broadband]] (over [[coaxial cable]], [[fiber optic]] or [[copper]] wires), [[Wi-Fi]], [[Satellite Internet|satellite]] and [[3G]]/[[4G]] technology [[mobile phone|cell phones]]. Public places to use the Internet include libraries and [[Internet cafe]]s, where computers with Internet connections are available. There are also [[Internet kiosk|Internet access points]] in many public places such as airport halls and coffee shops, in some cases just for brief use while standing. Various terms are used, such as "public Internet kiosk", "public access terminal", and "Web [[payphone]]". Many hotels now also have public terminals, though these are usually fee-based.
These terminals are widely accessed for various usage like ticket booking, bank deposit, online payment etc. Wi-Fi provides wireless access to computer networks, and therefore can do so to the Internet itself. [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|Hotspots]] providing such access include [[Wi-Fi#Internet access|Wi-Fi cafes]], where would-be users need to bring their own wireless-enabled devices such as a laptop or [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDA]]. These services may be free to all, free to customers only, or fee-based. A hotspot need not be limited to a confined location. A whole campus or park, or even an entire city can be enabled. [[Grassroots]] efforts have led to [[wireless community network]]s. Commercial Wi-Fi services covering large city areas are in place in London, [[Vienna]], [[Toronto]], San Francisco, [[Philadelphia]], Chicago and [[Pittsburgh]]. The Internet can then be accessed from such places as a park bench.<ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000082&sid=aQ0ZfhMa4XGQ&refer=canada "Toronto Hydro to Install Wireless Network in Downtown Toronto"]. Bloomberg.com. Retrieved 19-Mar-2006.</ref> Apart from Wi-Fi, there have been experiments with proprietary mobile wireless networks like [[Ricochet (Internet service)|Ricochet]], various high-speed data services over cellular phone networks, and fixed wireless services. High-end mobile phones such as [[smartphone]]s generally come with Internet access through the phone network. Web browsers such as [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] are available on these advanced handsets, which can also run a wide variety of other Internet software. More mobile phones have Internet access than PCs, though this is not as widely used.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} An Internet access provider and protocol matrix differentiates the methods used to get online.

==Social impact==
{{Main|Sociology of the Internet}}

The Internet has enabled entirely new forms of social interaction, activities, and organizing, thanks to its basic features such as widespread usability and access. [[Social network service|Social networking]] websites such as Facebook, Twitter and MySpace have created new ways to socialize and interact. Users of these sites are able to add a wide variety of information to pages, to pursue common interests, and to connect with others. It is also possible to find existing acquaintances, to allow communication among existing groups of people. Sites like [[LinkedIn]] foster commercial and business connections. YouTube and [[Flickr]] specialize in users' videos and photographs.

In the first decade of the 21st century the first generation is raised with widespread availability of Internet connectivity, bringing consequences and concerns in areas such as personal privacy and identity, and distribution of copyrighted materials.  These "[[digital natives]]" face a variety of challenges that were not present for prior generations.

The Internet has achieved new relevance as a political tool, leading to [[Internet censorship]] by some states. The presidential campaign of [[Howard Dean]] in 2004 in the United States was notable for its success in soliciting donation via the Internet. Many political groups use the Internet to achieve a new method of organizing in order to carry out their mission, having given rise to [[Internet activism]]. Some governments, such as those of [[Iran]], [[North Korea]], [[Myanmar]], the People's Republic of China, and [[Saudi Arabia]], restrict what people in their countries can access on the Internet, especially political and religious content.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} This is accomplished through software that filters domains and content so that they may not be easily accessed or obtained without elaborate circumvention.{{Or|date=December 2009}}

In Norway, Denmark, Finland<ref name="The Register">{{cite web | title=Finland censors anti-censorship site | work=[[The Register]] | url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/18/finnish_policy_censor_activist/ | date=2008-02-18 | accessdate=2008-02-19}}</ref> and Sweden, major Internet service providers have voluntarily, possibly to avoid such an arrangement being turned into law, agreed to restrict access to sites listed by authorities. While this list of forbidden URLs is only supposed to contain addresses of known child pornography sites, the content of the list is secret.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Many countries, including the United States, have enacted laws against the possession or distribution of certain material, such as [[child pornography]], via the Internet, but do not mandate filtering software. There are many free and commercially available software programs, called [[content-control software]], with which a user can choose to block offensive websites on individual computers or networks, in order to limit a child's access to pornographic materials or depiction of violence.

The Internet has been a major outlet for leisure activity since its inception, with entertaining social experiments such as [[MUD]]s and [[MOO]]s being conducted on university servers, and humor-related [[Usenet]] groups receiving much traffic. Today, many [[Internet forum]]s have sections devoted to games and funny videos; short cartoons in the form of [[Flash animation|Flash movies]] are also popular. Over 6 million people use blogs or message boards as a means of communication and for the sharing of ideas. The pornography and [[gambling]] industries have taken advantage of the World Wide Web, and often provide a significant source of advertising revenue for other websites.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Although many governments have attempted to restrict both industries' use of the Internet, this has generally failed to stop their widespread popularity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

One main area of leisure activity on the Internet is [[multiplayer gaming]]. This form of recreation creates communities, where people of all ages and origins enjoy the fast-paced world of multiplayer games. These range from [[MMORPG]] to [[first-person shooter]]s, from [[computer role-playing game|role-playing games]] to [[online gambling]]. This has revolutionized the way many people interact{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} while spending their free time on the Internet. While online gaming has been around since the 1970s,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} modern modes of online gaming began with subscription services such as [[GameSpy Arcade|GameSpy]] and [[MPlayer.com|MPlayer]]. Non-subscribers were limited to certain types of game play or certain games. Many people use the Internet to access and download music, movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation. Free and fee-based services exist for all of these activities, using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer technologies. Some of these sources exercise more care with respect to the original artists' copyrights than others.

Many people use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book vacations and to find out more about their interests. People use [[online chat|chat]], [[instant messaging|messaging]] and e-mail to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had [[pen pal]]s. The Internet has seen a growing number of [[Web desktop]]s, where users can access their files and settings via the Internet.

[[Cyberslacking]] can become a drain on corporate resources; the average UK employee spent 57 minutes a day surfing the Web while at work, according to a 2003 study by Peninsula Business Services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=914&id=1001802003 |title=Net abuse hits small city firms |publisher=News.scotsman.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-07}}</ref> [[Internet addiction disorder]] is excessive computer use that interferes with daily life. Some psychologists believe that Internet use has other [[How internet use affects humans|effects on individuals]] for instance interfering with the deep thinking that leads to true creativity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Internet usage has also shown a strong connection to loneliness.<ref>{{cite web|author=Carole Hughes, Boston College |url=http://escholarship.bc.edu/dissertations/AAI9923427/ |title=The relationship of use of the Internet and loneliness among college students |publisher=Escholarship.bc.edu |date=1999-01-01 |accessdate=2010-10-31}}</ref>  Lonely people tend to use the internet for an outlet for their feelings and to share their stories with other lonely people, such as in the "[[I am lonely will anyone speak to me]]" thread.
