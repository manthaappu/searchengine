The '''European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection''' ('''EPCIP''') refers to the doctrine and programmes created to identify and protect [[critical infrastructure]] that, in case of fault, incident or attack, could seriously impact both the country where it is hosted and at least one other [[Member State of the European Union|European Member State]]. 

== History ==
The EPCIP came about as a result of a consultation in 2004 by the [[European Council]], seeking a programme to protect critical infrastructure through its 'Communication on Critical Infrastructure Protection in the Fight against Terrorism'. In December 2004 it endorsed the intention of the [[European Commission]] to propose a European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP) and agreed to the creation of a European Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network (CIWIN). 
In December the European Commission issued its finalised design as a directive EU COM(2006) 786; this obliged all member states to adopt the components of the EPCIP into their national statutes. Not only did it apply to main area of the [[European Union]] but also to the wider [[European Economic Area]].

EPCIP also identified National Critical Infrastructure (NCI) where its disruption would only affect a single Member State. It set the responsibility for protecting items of NCI on its owner/operators and on the relevant Member State, and encouraged each Member State to establish its own National CIP programme.
