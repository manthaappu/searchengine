'''BigDog''' is a dynamically stable  [[quadruped]] [[robot]] created in 2005 by [[Boston Dynamics]] with [[Foster-Miller]], the NASA [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], and the [[Harvard University Concord Field Station]].<ref name="BD">{{cite web |url=http://www.bostondynamics.com/robot_bigdog.html |title=BigDog - The Most Advanced Rough-Terrain Robot on Earth
|publisher=Boston Dynamics |accessdate=2009-06-22}}</ref> BigDog is {{convert|3|ft|m}} long, stands {{convert|2.5|ft|m}} tall, and weighs {{convert|240|lb|kg}}, about the size of a small mule. It is capable of traversing difficult terrain at {{convert|4|mph|km/h}}, carrying {{convert|340|lb|kg}}, and climbing a 35 degree incline.<ref name="BD" /> Locomotion is controlled by an onboard computer that receives input from the robot's various sensors. Navigation and balance are also managed by the control system.

== History ==
BigDog is funded by the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) in the hopes that it will be able to serve as a robotic [[mule|pack mule]] to accompany soldiers in terrain too rough for conventional vehicles. Instead of wheels or treads, BigDog uses four legs for movement, allowing it to move across surfaces that would defeat wheels. The legs contain a variety of sensors, including joint position and ground contact. BigDog also features a [[laser gyroscope]] and a [[stereo vision]] system.

BigDog was featured in episodes of ''[[Web Junk 20]]'' and ''[[Hungry Beast]]'', and in articles in ''[[New Scientist]]'', ''[[Popular Science]]'', ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.

On March 18, 2008, Boston Dynamics released video footage of a new generation of BigDog. The footage shows BigDog's ability to walk on icy terrain and recover its balance when kicked from the side.<ref>[http://www.bostondynamics.com/dist/BigDog.wmv Video of BigDog in action] from [[Boston Dynamics]]</ref>

== Hardware ==
Big Dog is powered by a [[two-stroke]], [[single cylinder engine|one-cylinder]], 15-HP go-kart engine operating at over 9,000 RPM. The engine drives a [[hydraulic]] pump, which in turn drives the hydraulic leg [[actuator]]s.  Each leg has four actuators (two for the hip joint, and one each for the knee and ankle joints), for a total of 16. Each actuator unit consists of a hydraulic cylinder, servovalve, position sensor, and force sensor.  

Onboard computing power is a ruggedized [[PC/104]] board stack with a [[Pentium 4]] class computer running [[QNX]].<ref name="BigDogSlides2008">{{cite web | url=http://www.bostondynamics.com/img/BigDog_Overview.pdf | title=BigDog Overview |
