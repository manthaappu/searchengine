<html> <head> <title>X704</title></head><body>The '''x704''' is a [[microprocessor]] that implements the 32-bit version of the [[PowerPC]] [[instruction set architecture]] (ISA) developed by [[Exponential Technology]]. The microprocessor was notable for its high clock frequency (for the time, circa 1997) in the range of 400 to 533 MHz, its use of [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar transistor]]s for logic and [[CMOS]] circuits for memory, and its failure to see use in an [[Apple, Inc|Apple]] [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]], the opposite of what industry observers such as ''[[Microprocessor Report]]'' expected. Exponential Technology eventually failed as a result of the x704's lack of success, but its former employees founded [[Intrinsity]], a start-up that developed a high clock frequency [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] implementation, FastMath. The company has now left the microprocessor business and licenses Fast14 [[Dynamic logic (digital logic)|dynamic logic]] to third-parties such as [[ATI]] for their [[GPU]]s.

The x704 was a [[superscalar]] microprocessor that issued up to three instructions per cycle to an [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU), [[floating-point unit]] (FPU) and branch unit. To realize the short cycle times, the caches were kept small, limiting its performance. There are three levels of cache. The first consisted of separate 2 KB instruction and data caches. These were direct-mapped. The L2 cache was on-die and was 32 KB large. It is eight-way set set-associative. The L3 cache was larger, supporting capacities of 512 KB to 2 MB, and was located externally. The x704 contained 2.7 million transistors, of which 0.7 million were [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar transistors]] and 2.0 million were [[metal oxide semiconductor]] (MOS), and measured 15 mm by 10 mm (150 mm<sup>2</sup>). It was fabricated in a 0.5 Âµm [[BiCMOS]] process with six levels of interconnect. It used 3.6 and 2.1 V power supplies and dissipated less than 85 W at 533 MHz. The x704 was packaged in a 356-ball [[ball grid array]] (BGA).
