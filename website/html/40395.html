==Technology==
WHDI 1.0 provides a high-quality, uncompressed wireless link  which supports data rates of up to 3Gbit/s  (allowing [[1080p]]) in a 40 MHz channel, and data rates of up to 1.5Gbit/s (allowing 1080i and 720p) in a single 20 MHz channel of the 5 GHz unlicensed band, conforming to FCC regulations and worldwide 5 GHz spectrum regulations. Range is beyond {{convert|100|ft|m}}, through walls, and latency is less than one millisecond.<ref>http://www.whdi.org/Technology/</ref>

WHDI 3D update due in Q4 2010 will allow support for 3D formats defined in HDMI 1.4a specification

WHDI 2.0 will increase available bandwidth even further, allowing additional 3D formats such as "dual 1080p60", and support for 4K x 2K resolutions.
