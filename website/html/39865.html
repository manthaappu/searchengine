<html> <head> <title>Wavelet Scalar Quantization</title></head><body>The '''Wavelet Scalar Quantization''' algorithm ('''WSQ''') is a compression algorithm used for gray-scale [[fingerprint]] images. It is based on [[wavelet]] theory and has become a standard for the exchange and storage of fingerprint images. WSQ was developed by the [[FBI]], the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST). 

This compression method is preferred over standard compression algorithms like [[JPEG]] because at the same compression ratios WSQ doesn't present the "blocking artifacts" and loss of fine-scale features that are not acceptable for identification in financial environments and criminal justice.
