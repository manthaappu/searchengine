To compress a data sequence<math>x = x_1 \cdots x_n</math>, a grammar-based code first transforms <math>x</math> into a context-free grammar <math>G</math>, and then uses an [[arithmetic coding]] algorithm to compress the grammar <math>G</math>.

== Examples and characteristics ==
The class of grammar-based codes is very broad. It includes block codes, variations of the incremental parsing [[LZ77 and LZ78|Lempel-Ziv code]] <ref> {{Citation | last = Kieffer | first = J. C. | last2 = Yang | first2 = E.-H.  | last3 = Nelson | first3 = G. | last4 = Cosman | first4 = P. | title = Universal lossless compression via multilevel pattern matching | journal = IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory | volume = 46 | pages = 1227 –1245 | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1109/18.850665 }}</ref>, the multilevel pattern matching (MPM) algorithm<ref>{{Citation | last = Ziv | first = J. | last2 = Lempel | first2 = A. | title = Compression of individual sequences via variable rate coding | journal = IEEE Trans.

Grammar-based codes are universal in the sense that they can achieve asymptotically the [[entropy rate]] of any stationary, [[ergodic]] source with a finite alphabet.
