Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), also known as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, is a non-invasive analytical technique that has been used to study metabolic changes in brain tumors, strokes, seizure disorders, Alzheimer's disease, depression and other diseases affecting the brain. It has also been used to study the metabolism of other organs such as [[muscles]]. In the case of muscles, NMR is used to measure the intramyocellular lipid content (IMCL).

{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
MRS allows [[Physician|doctors]] and researchers to obtain [[Biochemistry|biochemical]] information about the [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] of the [[human body]] in a non-invasive way (without the need for a [[biopsy]]), whereas MRI only gives them information about the structure of the body (the distribution of water and fat).

For example, whereas MRI can tell doctors where a [[tumour]] ([[cancer]]) is located within a patient's body, MRS can, in theory, tell them how aggressive (malignant) the tumour is.

MRS equipment can be tuned (just like a [[radio]] receiver) to pick up signals from different [[NMR#Isotopes|chemical nuclei]] within the body. The most common nuclei to be studied are [[proton]]s ([[hydrogen]]), [[phosphorus]], [[carbon]], [[sodium]] and [[fluorine]].

The types of biochemicals ([[Metabolomics|metabolites]]) which can be studied include [[choline]]-containing compounds (which are used to make [[Cell (biology)|cell]] membranes), [[creatine]] (a chemical involved in energy [[metabolism]]), [[inositol]] and [[glucose]] (both [[sugar]]s), [[N-Acetylaspartate|N-acetyl aspartate]] (a chemical associated with the [[myelin]] sheaths of [[axon|nerve cell]] fibres), and [[alanine]] and [[lactic acid|lactate]] which are elevated in some [[tumor]]s.

At present MRS is mainly used as a tool by [[scientist]]s (e.g. [[Medical physics|medical physicists]] and [[Biochemistry|biochemists]]) for [[medical research]] projects, but it is becoming clear that it also has the ability to give [[Physician|doctors]] useful [[clinic]]al information which can be helpful in diagnosis and treatment of disease.

MRS is currently used to investigate a number of [[disease]]s in the [[human body]], most notably [[cancer]] (in [[brain]], [[breast]] and [[prostate]]), [[epilepsy]], [[Alzheimer's Disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[Huntington's Chorea]].

==Example==

Shown below is an MRI brain scan (in the [[Anatomical_terms_of_location#Planes|axial]] plane, that is slicing from front-to-back and side-to-side through the [[head]]) showing a brain tumour ([[meningioma]]) at the bottom right. The red box shows the volume of interest from which chemical information was obtained by MRS (a cube with 2 cm sides which produces a square when intersecting the 5 mm thick slice of the MRI scan).

The [[proton]] MRS [[spectrum]] from this tumour is also shown (as acquired with a 1.5 [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] whole-body [[MRI|MRI scanner]]). The horizontal [[Cartesian Coordinate System|axis]] is NMR [[frequency]] (or [[chemical shift]] in parts per million, p.p.m., relative to a [[Chemical shift|reference chemical]] at 0 p.p.m. rather than in the absolute units of [[hertz]]) and the vertical axis is signal strength (in arbitrary units).

Each biochemical, or metabolite, has a different peak in the spectrum which appears at a known frequency.  The peaks corresponding to the amino acid [[alanine]], are highlighted in red (at 1.4 p.p.m). This is an example of the kind of biochemical information which can help doctors to make their [[diagnosis]]. Other metabolites of note are [[choline]] (3.2 p.p.m.) and [[creatine]] (3.0 p.p.m.).
