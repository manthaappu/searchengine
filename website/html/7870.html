<html> <head> <title>Constructible function</title></head><body>In [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]], a '''time-constructible function''' is a function ''f'' from [[natural numbers]] to natural numbers with the property that ''f''(''n'') can be constructed from ''n'' by a [[Turing machine]] in the time of order ''f''(''n'').

==Time Constructible Definitions==
There are two different definitions of a time-constructible function. In the first definition, a function ''f'' is called '''time-constructible''' if there exists a positive integer ''n''<sub>0</sub> and Turing machine ''M'' which, given a string 1<sup>''n''</sup> consisting of ''n'' ones, stops after exactly ''f''(''n'') steps for all ''n'' ≥ ''n''<sub>0</sub>. In the second definition, a function ''f'' is called '''time-constructible''' if there exists a Turing machine ''M'' which, given a string 1<sup>''n''</sup>, outputs the binary representation of ''f''(''n'') in ''[[big-O notation|O]]''(''f''(''n'')) time (a unary representation may be used instead, since the two can be interconverted in ''O''(''f''(''n'')) time).

There is also a notion of a fully time-constructable function. A function ''f'' is called '''fully time-constructible''' if there exists a Turing machine ''M'' which, given a string 1<sup>''n''</sup> consisting of ''n'' ones, stops after exactly ''f''(''n'') steps. This definition is slightly less general then the first two but, for most applications, either any definition can be used.

==Space Constructible Definitions==
Similarly, a function ''f'' is '''space-constructible''' if there exists a positive integer ''n''<sub>0</sub> and a Turing machine ''M'' which, given a string 1<sup>''n''</sup> consisting of ''n'' ones, halts after using exactly ''f''(''n'') cells for all ''n'' ≥ ''n''<sub>0</sub>. Equivalently, a function ''f'' is '''space-constructible''' if there exists a Turing machine ''M'' which, given a string 1<sup>''n''</sup> consisting of ''n'' ones, outputs the binary (or unary) representation of ''f''(''n''), while using only ''[[big-O notation|O]]''(''f''(''n'')) space.

Also, a function ''f'' is '''fully space-constructible''' if there exists a Turing machine ''M'' which, given a string 1<sup>''n''</sup> consisting of ''n'' ones, halts after using exactly ''f''(''n'') cells.

==Examples==
All the commonly used functions ''f''(''n'') (such as ''n'', ''n<sup>k</sup>'', 2<sup>''n''</sup>) are time- and space-constructible, as long as ''f''(''n'') is at least ''cn'' for a constant ''c'' > 0. No function which is ''[[little-o notation|o]]''(''n'') can be time-constructible unless it is eventually constant, since there is insufficient time to read the entire input. However, ''log''(''n'') is a space-constructible function.

==Applications==
Time-constructible functions are used in complexity theory results such as the [[time hierarchy theorem]]. They are important because the time hierarchy theorem relies on Turing machines that must determine in ''[[big-O notation|O]]''(''f''(''n'')) time whether an algorithm has taken more than ''f''(''n'') steps.  This is, of course, impossible without being able to calculate ''f''(''n'') in that time.  Such results are typically true for all natural functions ''f'' but not necessarily true for artificially constructed ''f''. To formulate them precisely, it is necessary to have a precise definition for ''a natural function f'' for which the theorem is true. Time-constructible functions are often used to provide such definition.

Space-constructible functions are used similarly, for example in the [[space hierarchy theorem]].
