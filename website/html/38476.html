'''Two way ranging''' is a concept with [[time of arrival]] measurement for [[wireless]] signals. When synchronisation of the [[oscillator]]s of the involved [[transmitter]]s is not viable, hence the clocks differ, then applying the measurement as a two ways travel to the receiver and mirrored back to the transmitter compensates for some of the phase differences between the oscillators involved. This concept is applied with the RTLS concept as defined in the [[international standard]] ISO/IEC FCD 24730-5 <ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=46534 Information technology -- Real Time Locating Systems (RTLS) -- Part 5: Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) at 2,4 GHz air interface]</ref>.

A first description of the concept is given with <ref>[http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047039868X.html RTLS For Dummies by Ajay Malik, Wiley New York 2009]</ref>. In contrast to some faulty explanations, the concept may be applied as well with IEEE 802.15.4aCSS as with IEEE 802.15.4aUWB modulation <ref>[http://www.channelpartner.de/archivsuche/643120/ Funknetzwerke daheim]</ref>.
