The absolute debugger is a legacy UNIX debugger found on Solaris 1 and 2, HP-UX and SCO.

A version of ADB was integrated into the [[BSD]] kernel as a kernel debugger.  Today, the kernel debugger in *BSD is the only derivative of ADB still in regular use.

Use of ADB was largely replaced by the symbolic debugger [[dbx debugger|DBX]].
