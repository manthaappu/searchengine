<html> <head> <title>VTune</title></head><body>Intel '''VTune''' Performance analyzer is a commercial application for [[software performance analysis]] for [[Intel]]-manufactured x86 and x64 based machines, and has both [[GUI]] and [[command line]] interfaces. It is available for both [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems.
__NOTOC__
== Code Optimization ==

Intel VTune Performance analyzer assists in various kinds of code profiling including time-based profiling, event-based profiling, etc. The profiler result consists of details such as time spent in each sub routine which can be drilled down to the instruction level. The time taken by the instructions are indicative of any stalls in the [[pipeline (computing)|pipeline]] during instruction execution. The tool can be also used to analyze [[thread (computer science)|thread]] performance.

== Features of VTune performance analyzer ==

; [[Call graph]]: Provides a graphical view of the flow of an application, and helps to identify critical functions and timing details in the applications. Call graph profiling offers a graphical high-level, algorithmic view of program execution, based on [[instrumenting]] the binary executable files which is used to produce function calling sequence data
; Time-based and Event based [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]]: Sampling is a low overhead statistical method for locating performance bottlenecks.  Time-based sampling finds program “hot spots” that consume a lot of CPU time.  Event based sampling finds places where cache misses, branch mis-predictions and other performance issues occur.
; Source view: Sampling results are displayed line by line on the source / assembly code.
; [[Hardware performance counter|Counter]] monitor: Provides system level performance information, such as resource consumption during the execution of an application  
; Intel Thread Profiler: A timeline view shows what threads are doing and how they interact.  It shows the distribution of work to threads and locates load imbalances.
; Performance Tuning Utility (PTU): [http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-performance-tuning-utility/ PTU] is a separate download that gives VTune analyzer users access to experimental tuning technology.  This includes things like Data Access Analysis that identifies memory hotspots and relates them to code hotspots.
; Intel Parallel Amplifier: Parallel Amplifier is the performance profiler component of [[Intel Parallel Studio]].  If you purchase VTune analyzer, you can also download and use Parallel Amplifier.  It adds a statistical call graph (hotspot analysis) which is lower overhead than VTune's exact call graph, plus concurrency analysis and locks & waits analysis.
