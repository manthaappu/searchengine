'''BATON''' is a [[Type 1 encryption|Type 1]] [[block cipher]] in use since at least 1995 by the [[United States government]] to secure [[Classified information in the United States|classified information]].

While the BATON algorithm itself is secret, the public PKCS#11 standard includes some general information about how it is used.   It has a 320-bit key and uses a 128-bit block in most modes, and also supports a 96-bit [[Electronic codebook#Electronic codebook (ECB)|electronic codebook mode]]. 160 bits of the key are [[checksum]] material. It supports a "shuffle" mode of operation, like the NSA cipher [[JUNIPER]].  It may use up to 192 bits as an initialization vector, regardless of the block size.<ref>[ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-11/201final/spec/v201.pdf PKCS #11 spec]</ref>  

In response to a Senate question about encrypted video links, NSA said that BATON could be used for encryption at speeds higher than those possible with [[Skipjack (cipher)|Skipjack]].<ref>[http://csrc.nist.gov/keyrecovery/ees_q-a.txt]</ref>

==Usage==
BATON is used in a variety of products and standards:
*[[APCO Project 25]] (Public standard for land mobile radio) (Algorithm IDs 01 and 41)
*[[PKCS11|PKCS#11]] (Public standard for encryption tokens)
*[[CDSA/CSSM]] (Another public standard)
*[[HAIPE-IS]] ([[NSA]]'s version of [[IPsec]])
*[[FNBDT]] (Advanced flexible voice security protocol)

*[[Thales Group|Thales]] [[Datacryptor 2000]] (a British network-encryption box)
*[[SecNet-11]] (a crypto-secure [[802.11b]] [[PC Card]], based on the [[Sierra (microchip)|Sierra chip]])
*[[KOV-14|Fortezza Plus]] (a [[PC Card]] product, used in the [[Secure Terminal Equipment|STE]])
*[[SafeXcel-3340]] (a HAIPIS network-encryption box)
*Numerous embeddable encryption modules: [[Advanced INFOSEC Machine|AIM]], [[CYPRIS (microchip)|CYPRIS]], [[MYK-85]], [[Sierra (microchip)]], etc.
