<html> <head> <title>Loebner Prize</title></head><body>The '''Loebner Prize''' is an annual competition in [[artificial intelligence]] that awards prizes to the [[chatterbot]] considered by the judges to be the most human-like. The format of the competition is that of a standard [[Turing test]]. A human judge poses text questions to a computer program and a human being via computer. Based upon the answers, the judge must decide which is which. In 2008 a variety of judges, including experts and non-experts, adults and children, native and non-native English speakers participated in the [[University of Reading]] hosted contest.<ref>[http://www.rdg.ac.uk/cirg/loebner/cirg-loebner-main.asp Loebner Prize 2008]</ref>

The contest began in 1990 by [[Hugh Loebner]] in conjunction with the [[Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies]], [[Massachusetts]], [[United States]]. It has since been associated with [[Flinders University]], [[Dartmouth College]], the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in [[London]], and most recently the University of Reading. In 2004 and 2005, it was held in Loebner's apartment in [[New York City]]. 

Within the field of artificial intelligence, the Loebner Prize is somewhat controversial; the most prominent critic, [[Marvin Minsky]], has called it a publicity stunt that does not help the field along.<ref name=salon>[http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2003/02/26/loebner_part_one/ Artificial stupidity], ''Salon.com'', 16 February 2003</ref>

In addition, the time limit of 5 minutes and the use of untrained/unsophisticated interrogator/judges has resulted in some wins that may be due to trickery rather than to plausible intelligence, as one can judge from transcripts of winning conversations (linked below).{{Fact|date=January 2009}}

==Prizes==
Originally, $2,000 was awarded for the most human-seeming chatterbot in the competition. The prize was $3,000 in 2005 and $2,250 in 2006. In 2008, $3,000 was awarded.

In addition, there are two one-time-only prizes that have never been awarded. $25,000 is offered for the first chatterbot that judges cannot distinguish from a real human and which can convince judges that the human is the  computer program. $100,000 is the reward for the first chatterbot that judges cannot distinguish from a real human in a Turing test that includes deciphering and understanding text, visual, and auditory input. Once this is achieved, the annual competition will end.

==Competition rules and restrictions==
The rules have varied over the years and early competitions featured restricted conversation Turing tests but since 1995 the discussion has been unrestricted.<ref>[http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/2007_Contest/Rules.html 2007 rules], [http://www.rdg.ac.uk/cirg/loebner/cirg-loebner-main.asp 2008 rules] and [http://loebner.net/Prizef/2009_Contest/LP_2009.html 2009 rules]</ref>

For the three entries in 2007, Robert Medeksza, Noah Duncan and Rollo Carpenter,<ref>[http://loebner.net/Prizef/2007_Contest/loebner-prize-2007.html 17th Annual Loebner Prize for Artificial Intelligence 21 October 2007 New York City]</ref> some basic "screening questions" were used by the sponsor to evaluate the state of the technology. These included simple questions about the time, what round of the contest it is, etc.; general knowledge ("What is a hammer for?"); comparisons ("Which is faster, a train or a plane?"); and questions demonstrating memory for preceding parts of the same conversation. "All nouns, adjectives and verbs will come from a dictionary suitable for children or adolescents under the age of 12." Entries did not need to respond "intelligently" to the questions to be accepted.

For the first time in 2008 the sponsor allowed introduction of a preliminary phase to the contest opening up the competition to previously disallowed web-based entries judged by a variety of invited interrogators. The available rules do not state how interrogators are selected or instructed. Interrogators (who judge the systems) have limited time: 5 minutes per entity in the 2003 prize; 20+ per pair in 2004-2007 prizes, and 5 minutes to conduct ''simultaneous'' conversations with a human and the program in 2008.

==Contests==
===2006===
In 2006, the contest was organised by [[Tim Child]] (CEO of Televirtual) and Huma Shah.<ref>[http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/2006_Contest/loebner-prize-2006.html Loebner Prize 2006 Information]</ref><ref>[http://humashah.blogspot.com/2006_09_01_archive.html Lobner 2006]</ref> On August 30, the four finalists were announced:
* [[Rollo Carpenter]]
* Richard Churchill and Marie-Claire Jenkins
* Noah Duncan
* Robert Medeksza

The contest was held on 17 September in the VR theatre, Torrington Place campus of [[University College London]]. The judges included the University of Reading's [[cybernetics]] professor, [[Kevin Warwick]], a professor of artificial intelligence, John Barnden (specialist in metaphor research at the [[University of Birmingham]]), a barrister, Victoria Butler-Cole and a journalist, Graham Duncan-Rowe. The latter's experience of the event can be found in an article in ''[[Technology Review]]''.<ref>[http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17518&ch=in How To Be Human], ''Technology Review'', 20 September 2006</ref><ref>[http://loebner.net/Prizef/2006_Contest/loebner-prize-2006.html Loebner prize 2006], loebner.net</ref> The winner was 'Joan', based on [[Jabberwacky]], both created by Rollo Carpenter.

===2007===
The 2007 competition was held on 21 October in New York City. The judges were: Computer Science Professor [[Russ Abbott]], Philosophy Professor [[Hartry Field]], Psychology Assistant Professor Clayton Curtis and English lecturer Scott Hutchins.<ref>[http://loebner.net/Prizef/2007_Contest/loebner-prize-2007.html 17th Annual Loebner Prize for Artificial Intelligence], loebner.net</ref>

No bot passed the Turing Test, but the judges ranked the three contestants as follows:
* 1st: Robert Medeksza from Zabaware, creator of [[Ultra Hal Assistant]]
* 2nd: Noah Duncan, a private entry, creator of Cletus
* 3rd: Rollo Carpenter from Icogno, creator of Jabberwacky

The winner received $2,250 and the annual medal. The runners-up received $250 each.

===2008===
The 2008 competition was organised by Professor Kevin Warwick, coordinated by Huma Shah and held on 12 October at the University of Reading, [[United Kingdom|UK]].<ref>[http://loebner.net/Prizef/2008_Contest/loebner-prize-2008.html 18th Annual Loebner Prize for Artificial Intelligence 12 October 2008 University of Reading, Reading, UK]</ref> After testing by over one hundred judges during the preliminary phase, in June and July 2008, six finalists were selected from thirteen original entrants - [[artificial conversational entity]] (ACE). Five of those invited competed in the finals:
*Brother Jerome, Peter Cole and Benji Adams
*[[Elbot]], Fred Roberts / Artificial Solutions
*[[Eugene Goostman]], Vladimir Veselov, Eugene Demchenko and Sergey Ulasen
*Jabberwacky, Rollo Carpenter
*Ultra Hal, Robert Medeksza

In the finals, each of the judges was given five minutes to conduct simultaneous, split-screen conversations with two hidden entities. Elbot<ref>[http://www.elbot.com/ Elbot]</ref> of Artificial Solutions<ref>[http://www.artificial-solutions.com/ Artificial Solutions]</ref> won the 2008 Loebner Prize bronze award, for ''most human-like'' artificial conversational entity, through fooling three of the twelve judges who interrogated it (in the human-parallel comparisons) into believing it was human. This is coming very close to the 30% traditionally required to consider that a program has actually passed the Turing test. Eugene Goostman<ref>[http://www.princetonai.com/bot/botProcess.jsp Eugene Goostman]</ref> and Ultra Hal<ref>[http://zabaware.com/assistant/ Ultra Hal]</ref> both deceived one judge each that it was the human.

Will Pavia, a journalist for [[The Times]], has written about his experience; a Loebner finals' judge, he was deceived by Elbot and Eugene <ref>[http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article4934858.ece Machine takes on man at mass Turing Test]</ref>.

=== 2009 ===

The 2009 Loebner Prize Competition was held 6 September 2009 at the Brighton Centre, Brighton UK in conjunction with Interspeech 2009 conference.  The prize amount for 2009 was USD 3000.  

Entrants were David Levy, Rollo Carpenter, and Mohan Embar, who finished in that order.

=== 2010 ===

The 2010 Loebner Prize Competition was held on October 23rd at California State University, Los Angeles. The 2010 competition was the 20th running of the contest.
