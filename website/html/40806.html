'''Xpadder''' is a program that has the ability to emulate a [[mouse (computing)|mouse]] and/or [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] using a controller or [[joystick]]. This is primarily used for playing games with poor or no controller support, but Xpadder can be used in a web browser, media player, or almost any other application. Xpadder supports the use of up to 16 controllers simultaneously and if a controller supports it, Xpadder can assign a button to make the controller [[Haptic technology|rumble/vibrate]].

== Features ==
*Keyboard and mouse emulation. 
*Profile management. 
*Support for any controller recognized by [[Microsoft Windows]]
*Support rumble on capable controllers.
*Sets for using keys as a switch and emulating more keys than a controller physically has.

== Limitations ==
Xpadder does not work on some online multiplayer games which make use of Anti-Hacking software. Games using [[GameGuard]], such as [[MapleStory]], sometimes block Xpadder. Servers running [[PunkBuster]], however, do not have this problem, allowing Xpadder to be used with PunkBuster-enabled games.

== Development Status ==
*Versions of the program after 5.3 are available as payware and are officially supported on the website, while 5.3 and all previous versions are freeware.
