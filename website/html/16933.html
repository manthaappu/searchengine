The '''Honeywell 316''' was a popular [[16-bit]] [[minicomputer]] built by [[Honeywell]] starting in 1969. It is part of the Series 16 which includes the Models 116, 316, 416, 516 and 716. They were commonly used for data acquisition and control, remote message concentration, clinical laboratory systems and time-sharing. The Series 16 computers are all based on the DDP-116 designed by Gardner Hendrie at Computer Control Corporation (3C) in 1964.

The H-316 was used by [[Charles H. Moore]] to develop the first complete, stand-alone implementation of [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] at [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory|NRAO]]. <ref>[http://www.forth.com/resources/evolution/evolve_2.html#2.1 The Evolution of Forth]</ref> They were used as [[ARPANET]] [[Interface Message Processor]]s (IMP) but could also be configured as a Terminal IMP (TIP) which added support for up to 63 Teletypes through a multi-line controller.<ref>{{Citation

The original [[Prime computer]]s were designed to be compatible with the Series 16 minicomputers. <ref>[http://www.malch.com/prime/primefaq.htm#L2_18 Comp.Sys.Prime FAQ]</ref>

A Honeywell 316 was used at [[Bradwell nuclear power station]] in [[Essex]] as the primary reactor temperature monitoring computer until summer 2000, when the internal 160k disk failed. Two [[PDP-11/70]]s, which had previously been secondary monitors, were moved to primary.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

[[Image:Kitchen computer ad.jpg|thumb|An ad for the Kitchen Computer. The tagline is "If she can only cook as well as Honeywell can compute"]]

The '''Honeywell Kitchen Computer''' or H316 pedestal model of 1969 was a short-lived product made by [[Honeywell]] and offered by [[Neiman Marcus]]. It sold for $10,000, weighed over 100 pounds, and was used for storing recipes (but reading or entering these recipes would have been very difficult for the average cook, since the [[user interface]] required the person to take a two-week course to learn to program the device, using only toggle-switch input and binary light output). It had a built in cutting board and had a few recipes built in. No evidence has been found that any Honeywell Kitchen Computers were ever sold. <ref>[http://www.drdobbs.com/184404040 Three Chapters in the History of Home Automation]</ref>

The full text of the Neiman-Marcus Advertisement seems to read: 

'''"If she can only cook as well as Honeywell can compute."'''

"Her souffles are supreme, her meal planning a challenge?  She's what the Honeywell people had in mind when they devised our Kitchen Computer.  She'll learn to program it with a cross-reference to her favorite recipes by N-M's own [[Helen Corbitt]].  Then by simply pushing a few buttons obtain a complete menu organized around the entree. And if she pales at reckoning her lunch tabs, she can program it to balance the family checkbook.  '''84A''' 10,600.00 complete with two week programming course.  '''84B''' '''Fed with Corbitt data:''' the original Helen Corbitt cookbook with over 1,000 recipes $100 (.75) '''84C''' Her Potluck, 375 of our famed Zodiac restaurant's best kept secret recipes 3.95 (.75) Corbitt Epicure '''84D Her Labaird Apron''', one-size, ours alone by Clairdon House, multi-pastel provencial cotton 26.00 (.90) Trophy Room"

In December of 2008 <ref>[http://www.linuxtoday.com/developer/2008120100535OPHW# Val Henson meets the Honeywell H316 Kitchen Computer]</ref>, artist Valerie Aurora (formerly known as Valerie Henson) created a work named "Valerie Aurora meets the Honeywell H316 Kitchen Computer", a photo gallery blog which consisted of photographs satirizing the use of the Honeywell 316. Staged at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA, Aurora acts as a stereotypical, isolated, and unintelligent 1969 housewife believes that Honeywell 316 has practical value. Aurora comments on the impracticality and absurdity of the object -- the idea that this product was geared toward women is meant to be ridiculous, which is one of her central arguments. <ref>http://valerieaurora.org/kitchen.html</ref>
