<html> <head> <title>Web Coverage Service</title></head><body>The [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] '''Web Coverage Service''' Interface Standard ('''WCS''') provides an [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] allowing requests for  [[Geography|geographical]] [[coverage data|coverages]] across the [[World Wide Web|web]] using platform-independent calls.  The coverages are objects (or images) in a geographical area, whereas the [[Web Map Service | WMS]] interface or online mapping portals like [[Google Maps]] return only an image, which end-users cannot edit or [[Geographic information system#Spatial analysis with GIS | spatially analyze]].

The OGC membership defined and maintains the WCS specification. [[GeoServer]] serves as the [[Reference implementation (computing)|reference implementation]] of the standard.

== Overview ==

The basic Web Coverage Service allows querying and retrieval of coverages.

A WCS describes discovery, query, or data transformation operations. The client generates the request and posts it to a web feature server using HTTP. The web feature server then executes the request. The WCS specification uses HTTP as the distributed computing platform, although this is not a hard requirement. 

There are two encodings defined for WCS operations:
*[[XML]] (amenable to HTTP POST/[[SOAP]])
*Keyword-Value pairs (amenable to HTTP GET/[[Remote procedure call]])

In the taxonomy of [[Web Services]], WCS is best categorized as a non-RESTful RPC type service.

===Data ===

Data may be available in several formats, such as [[DTED]], [[GeoTIFF]], [[HDF-EOS]], or [[National Imagery Transmission Format|NITF]].

Several types of data layers are supported:
* series of points, such as locations of samples
* regular grid of pixels or points, which might represent a photo
* set of segmented curves, often used for road paths
* set of [[Thiessen polygon]]s, used to analyse spatially distributed data such as rainfall measurements
* triangulated irregular network (TIN), often used for terrain models

Ranges of information may be attached to locations, such as average wind speed or yield by crop type.

===Software support for WCS ===
The [http://sourceforge.net/projects/teamengine Compliance and Interoperability Test Engine (CITE)] is used to test reference implementations for OGC specs, including WCS. List of software that supports WCS as a client and/or server:

* [[GeoServer]] - reference implementation server (serve WCS)
* [[ERDAS Apollo|APOLLO]] - server and client<ref>{{ cite web|url=http://www.erdas.com/tabid/84/currentid/1850/default.aspx|title=ERDAS APOLLO }}</ref>
* [[GDAL]] - client (read)<ref>{{ cite web|url=http://gdal.org/frmt_wcs.html|title=WCS -- OGC Web Coverage Service }}</ref>
* [[Geomatica Web Server Suite]] - client and server<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcigeomatics.com/pressnews/2008_PCI_webtest.html|title=PCI Geomaticsâ€™ Web Coverage Server successfully passes compliancy testing }}</ref>
* [[GeoMedia]] - client (read WCS) and server ([[GeoMedia WebMap]])
* [[gvSIG]] - client (read WCS)
