In [[computing]] [[software]], '''''POJO''''' is an acronym for '''Plain Old Java Object'''. The name is used to emphasize that a given [[Object (computer science)|object]] is an ordinary Java Object, not a special object, and in particular not an [[Enterprise JavaBean]]. The term was coined by [[Martin Fowler]], Rebecca Parsons and Josh MacKenzie in September 2000:
<blockquote>
"We wondered why people were so against using regular objects in their systems and concluded that it was because simple objects lacked a fancy name. So we gave them one, and it's caught on very nicely."<ref>[http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/POJO.html MF Bliki: POJO] from MartinFowler.com</ref>
</blockquote>

The term "POJO" is mainly used to denote a Java object which does not follow any of the major Java object models, conventions, or frameworks such as EJB. The term continues the pattern of older terms for technologies that do not use fancy new features, such as POTS ([[Plain Old Telephone Service]]) in [[telephony]], and PODS ([[Plain Old Data Structures]]) that are defined in [[C++]] but use only [[C (programming language)|C]] language features, and POD (Plain Old Documentation) in [[Perl]]. The equivalent to POJO on the [[.NET framework]] is [[Plain Old CLR Object]].

==Contextual variations==

The POJO phenomenon has most likely gained widespread acceptance because of the need for a common and easily understood term that contrasts with complicated object frameworks. A [[JavaBean]] is a POJO that is [[Serialization#Java|serializable]], has a no-argument [[Constructor (computer science)|constructor]], and allows access to properties using [[Mutator method|getter and setter methods]].  An [[Enterprise JavaBean]] is not a single class but an entire component model (though [[Enterprise JavaBean|EJB 3]] reduces the complexity of Enterprise JavaBeans). As designs using POJOs have become more commonly used, systems have arisen that give POJOs some of the functionality used in frameworks and more choice about which areas of functionality are actually needed.  [[Hibernate (Java)|Hibernate]] and [[Spring Framework|Spring]] are examples.

Ideally speaking, a POJO is a Java object not bound by any restriction other than those forced by the Java Language Specification. I.e., a POJO '''should not''' have to
#Extend prespecified classes, as in<source lang="java">public class Foo extends javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet { ...</source>
#Implement prespecified interfaces, as in<source lang="java">public class Bar implements javax.ejb.EntityBean { ...</source>
#Contain prespecified annotations, as in<source lang="java">@javax.ejb.Entity public class Baz{ ...</source></li>
However, due to technical difficulties and other reasons, many software products or frameworks described as POJO-compliant actually still require the use of prespecified annotations for features such as persistence to work properly.

==POJO generation projects==
; [http://prevayler.org Prevayler] : an open source [[System Prevalence|system prevalence]] layer that transparently persists POJOs.
; [https://sourceforge.net/projects/beanexaminer BeanExaminer] : framework to present any java objects in an interactive surface to browse and edit them. A generator is included to create the desired POJOs through a given db connection.
; [http://www.romaframework.org Roma Meta Framework] : DDD centric framework. The innovative holistic approach lets the designer/developer to view anything as a POJO: GUI, I18N, Persistence, etc.
; [http://sourceforge.net/projects/openxava OpenXava] : Framework to develop J2EE business applications rapidly and easily. It's based in business components defined with XML. Feature rich and flexible since it's used for years to create business applications. Generates POJO Hibernate EJB2 and EJB3 JPA ...
; [http://sourceforge.net/projects/plainxml PlainXML] : Generating POJO by DTD; XML-POJO mapping via Java5 annotations or DTD; XML manipulations using POJO without SAX/DOM; Preprocessing of XML documents using expression language; Binary XML; RMI friendly XML; Exporting to JSON; XML marshall/unmarshall ...
; [http://sourceforge.net/projects/patsystem PAT] : AOP (JBossAOP) persistence library (aspect library). Provides persistence layer with underlying Prevayler (1.02). Allows users to write their code without worrying about persistence code (POJO). Uses annotations.
; [http://sourceforge.net/projects/jor Java O/RM] : This is a Java Object Relational mapping tool that is very simple to use. It works with all major databases and requires only minimal coding effort. JOR strictly follows the POJO / POJI (Plain Old Java Objects / Plain Old Java Interfaces) model.
; [http://sourceforge.net/projects/auto-persist-j AutoPersistJ] : This project aims to assist developers in developing java EE persistence layer for existing database tables. It gets metadata of selected database tables and generates classes for them. it uses and extends the ideas of DbGen project to EJB 3.0 POJO.
; [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pojogen PojoGen]: It is a small tool to generate Java Code (a POJO) for an APPFUSE-based project from a DDL file, which is created from an ER diagram by Microsoft VISIO. It makes an APPFUSE-based project more easy to use.
; [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pojodbc Pojodbc]: An easy-to-use Java Object Relation mapping library without configurations file or annotations. Built on top of [[JDBC]], you still use your optimized [[native SQL]] and get POJOs.
; [http://cwiki.apache.org/FELIX/ipojo.html Apache Felix iPOJO] : A new type of dynamic [[Service-oriented architecture|service-oriented]] [[Component-based software engineering|component]] runtime that runs pure POJO applications on the top of [[OSGi]] platforms. Non-functional (''extra-functional'') services can be added and removed at runtime.
; [http://labs.jboss.com/jbossmc/ JBoss Microcontainer]: The [[JBoss]] [[Microcontainer]] is a refactoring of [[JBoss]]'s [[JMX]] [[Microkernel]] to support direct POJO deployment and standalone use outside the [[JBoss]] application server.
;[http://www.nakedobjects.org/home/index.shtml Naked Objects]: An open source framework that auto-creates an object-oriented user interface from POJOs using the [[naked objects]] pattern.
;[http://www.metawidget.org Metawidget]: A 'smart User Interface widget' that populates itself, at runtime, with UI components to match the properties of POJOs.
;[http://code.google.com/p/fbdaogenerator fbDaoGenerator]: Fbdaogenerator connects to a [[Firebird (database server)|Firebird]] Database, reads the [[metadata]] of the Database by querying the system-tables, and generates POJOs and [[Data Access Object]]s.

==POJO translation projects==
;[http://code.google.com/p/pojo-injector pojo-injector]: pojo-injector allows to populate POJOs from Java data models and back (from POJOs to data models, ie interfaces or concrete classes). The translation is based on annotating just only the POJOs classes (Java data models are untouched)

== POJO testing projects ==
;[http://code.google.com/p/openpojo  OpenPojo]: a pluggable testing framework
