The '''Alive Chimpanzee''' is produced by WowWee Alive, a division of [[Wow Wee|WowWee Ltd.]] The [[animatronic]] Chimpanzee is the first in WowWee Alive's product line. Unlike WowWee's other robots, the Chimpanzee only consists of the head of a [[chimpanzee]]. It houses eight [[Electric motor|motors]] to [[mimic]] the facial expressions of a real chimp. It also contains 9 sensors, including [[Infrared|IR]] [[sensors]] in the eyes, touch sensors on the chin, top and rear of the head and sound and [[vibration]] sensors in the ear. There is also an Alive [[Elvis]] manufactured.

In attempting to make the Chimpanzee as [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] as possible, each strand of hair is rooted individually into the [[skin]] of the robot and the skin moves and is colored to match realistic skin tones, including [[vein]]ing. As with other WowWee robots, the Chimpanzee can be operated in different modes; in its case, the modes are Alive, Guard, Program, Demo and Sleep.

Also, as revealed in a magazine of Popular Science in one of the articles, you can rip the face off the Alive Chimpanzee to reveal a Terminator-like robot face which follows your movement with two red eyes. The fact was revealed in a How2.0 article which demonstrates what you need to scare your friends. It was revealed as one of the tips to make the scare even scarier.
