'''Panda Security SL''', formerly '''Panda Software''', is a [[computer security]] company founded in 1990 by Panda's former CEO, [[Mikel Urizarbarrena]], in the city of [[Bilbao]], Spain.  Initially centered on the production of [[antivirus software]], the company has expanded its line of applications to include [[firewall (networking)|firewall]] applications, [[spam (e-mail)|spam]] and spyware detection applications, cybercrime prevention technology, and other system management and security tools for businesses and home users.

Panda's products include security tools for home users and enterprises, including protection against cybercrime and kinds of malware that can damage IT systems, such as spam, hackers, spyware, dialers and undesirable web content, as well as detection of WiFi intrusions. Its trademark technology, branded [[TruPrevent Technologies|TruPrevent]], is a set of proactive capabilities aimed at blocking unknown viruses and intruders. In 2007 Panda introduced a new [[collective intelligence]] security model, which utilizes [[grid computing]] for malware collection and detection.

== About the company ==
=== Overview ===
In 2005, Panda Security was the 4th largest [[antivirus]] vendor worldwide, with 3.2% of the marketplace.<ref>[http://www.gartner.com/press_releases/asset_154006_11.html Gartner Says Worldwide Antivirus Software Market Increased 13.6 Percent in 2005]</ref> The company, whose shares were previously 100% held by Urizarbarrena, announced on 24 April 2007 the sale of 75% of its shares to Southern European investment group [[Investindustrial]] and private equity firm [[Gala Capital]].<ref>[http://www.pandasoftware.com/about_panda/press_room/ Investindustrial and Gala Capital invest in Panda Software to undertake an important expansion plan and launch new IT security solutions globally]</ref> On 30 July 2007 the company changed its name from Panda Software to Panda Security and Urizarbarrena was replaced by [[Jorge Dinares]]. Almost one year later, on 3 June 2008, amidst flagging sales,  the board of directors voted to remove Dinares and replace him with Juan Santana, the CFO.<ref>[http://www.pandasecurity.com Panda Security]</ref><ref>[http://www.pandasecurity.com/homeusers/media/press-releases/viewnews?noticia=8592&entorno=&ver=2007,3&pagina=&producto= Jorge Dinares: new CEO of the Panda Software Group]</ref>

Panda Security is rated by Gartner analysts as a technology innovator.<ref>[http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/media/press-releases/viewnews?noticia=9239&entorno=&ver=&pagina=&producto=,]</ref> Technological milestones include its pioneering launch of security systems, such as the SaaS concept (Security as a Service) or antivirus solutions that provide protection from the cloud (cloud computing) and are based on what Panda calls Collective Intelligence, a security model Panda introduced on the market in 2007[8]<ref>[http://www.pandasecurity.com/homeusers/solutions/collective-intelligence/]</ref>

According to its CEO, the main benefit this security model provides is that it allows automatic scanning of threats instead of the manual scans carried out by other companies,<ref>[http://www.pandainsight.com/en/security-against-increasing-malware-in-recession-times=Security against increasing malware in recession times]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref>], making it quicker and more efficient in malware detection.

Panda Security has subsidiaries in the USA, Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, UK, Sweden, Finland, Spain and Japan.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Additionally, it has franchises in another 44 countries.

The USA subidiary has had five management turnovers since 2007<ref>http://www.crunchbase.com/company/panda-security-3</ref> before moving its headquarters to [[Orlando, Florida]] in 2009,<ref> http://blogs.channelinsider.com/secure_channel/content/malware_worms_viruses/panda_security_new_leader_same_message.html Panda Security: New Leader, Same Message]</ref>

Despite a renewed channel effort, as of January 2010, Panda is currently embroiled in a USD$50 million lawsuit with one of its channel partners.<ref>[http://dockets.justia.com/docket/court-txedce/case_no-4:2010cv00025/case_id-120615/ External Technologies, Inc. v. Panda Distribution, Inc. d/b/a Panda Security USA et al]</ref> On 3 August, 2010, a new office location in [[Menlo Park, California]] was publicly announced by Panda's CEO via his [[Twitter]] account.<ref>[http://twitter.com/juansantana/status/20236102649]</ref>

Panda Security competes in the antivirus industry against [[Symantec]] Corp, [[Kaspersky]], [[McAfee]] Inc and [[Trend Micro]] Inc, among others.

In late 2009 Panda Security created a partnership with Web of Trust to help fight against the war of viruses. [http://www.mywot.com/en/press/panda-security-and-against-intuition-partner-to-offer-wot-the-community-based-safe-surfing-tool]

==TruPrevent Technologies==
{{Refimprove|date=January 2009|section}}
TruPrevent, which was introduced in 2003, is a set of technologies developed by Panda Security for proactive protection in home and corporate computers, as opposed to traditional antivirus products, which provide reactive protection.

Truprevent Technologies offers generic protection against many of the techniques most commonly used by new malware, and policies and rules are developed based on the new vulnerabilities that appear every day.

Due to the vast amount of new malware that appears every day in 2007 PandaLabs detected an average of 3,000 new samples a day,<ref>[http://www.pandasecurity.com/homeusers/media/press-releases/viewnews?noticia=9077=The number of new strains of malware that appeared in 2007 increased tenfold with respect to the previous year]</ref> which has risen to 35,000 in 2009, Panda Security decided to develop a protection system that would automatically detect, scan and classify malware in real time. This security model presented in 2007 was called “Collective Intelligence” and is the basis of the new solutions that offer security from the cloud.

This technology is implemented in its 2009 and 2010 antivirus products for home users and in the new Panda Cloud Antivirus, which the company has classified as the first antivirus in History that provides protection from the cloud <ref>[http://www.pandasecurity.com/homeusers/media/press-releases/viewnews?noticia=9336=Panda Security launches its 2009 products, the first antivirus in history to use Collective Intelligence and protect from the cloud]</ref>

These antivirus products only include the information about malware samples that cause most infections at any given moment, while the rest of the information is stored in Panda’s knowledge base. The antivirus connects to this knowledge base whenever necessary. This system is designed to offer real-time protection against thousands of new malware samples, use the community knowledge base to offer further protection and not to consume computer resources.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-JfW4Ut8kg How Collective Intelligence works and security from the cloud works]</ref>

== Tests ==

In the February 2010 tests conducted by AV Comparatives, Panda's detection rate  ranked 3rd of the 20 vendors tested, its [[false positive]] rate ranked 16th.<ref>[http://www.av-comparatives.org/images/stories/test/ondret/avc_report25.pdf Anti-Virus Comparative No. 25, February 2010]</ref>  

Panda has not been tested by [[Virus Bulletin]] since 2002<ref>http://www.virusbtn.com/vb100/archive/results?vendor=VE13</ref>.

Panda has been tested by Checkvir for years. Over the past five years<ref>http://www.checkvir.com/pdf/certif.pdf</ref> they have received a "Standard" rating at every test. They have achieved the "Advanced" rating twice.

In March 2010, Panda Security became the first vendor to receive an [[International Computer Security Association|ICSA]] certification for a 100% cloud based offering <ref>http://www.icsalabs.com/product/panda-cloud-antivirus</ref><ref>http://www.pandasecurity.com/homeusers/media/press-releases/viewnews?noticia=10105</ref>.
