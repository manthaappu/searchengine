<html> <head> <title>Macaulay2</title></head><body>'''Macaulay2''' is a [[Free software|free]] [[computer algebra system]] developed by Daniel Grayson (UIUC) and Michael Stillman (Cornell) for computation in [[commutative algebra]] and [[algebraic geometry]]. Stillman, along with [[Dave Bayer]] had authored the predecessor, [[Macaulay computer algebra system|Macaulay]]. Macaulay2 uses its own [[high level programming language]], intended to closely match the syntax used by [[mathematician]]s in the field. Both are published under the [[GNU General Public License]] version 2.

In a 2006 interview, [[Andrei Okounkov]] cited Macaulay2 along with [[TeX]] as a successful [[open source]] project used in [[mathematics]] and suggested that funding agencies look into and learn from these examples.<ref>Mu√±oz, Vicente; Persson, Ulf (2006), [http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2006-12-62.pdf "Interviews with three Fields medallists"], ''[[European Mathematical Society]] Newsletter'' (62):32-36</ref>
