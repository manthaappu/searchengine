'''Microsoft Network Monitor''' is a [[packet analyzer]]. It enables capturing, viewing, and analyzing network data and deciphering [[network protocol]]s. It can be used to troubleshoot [[computer network|network]] problems and applications on the network. Microsoft Network Monitor 1.0 (codenamed ''Bloodhound'') was originally designed and developed by Raymond Patch, a transport protocol and network adapter device driver engineer on the Microsoft LAN Manager development team.   

== History ==

The LAN Manager development team had one shared hardware-based analyzer at the time. Netmon was conceived when the hardware analyzer was taken during a test to reproduce a networking bug, and the first Windows prototype was coded over the Christmas holiday. The first 4 bytes of the Netmon capture file format were used to validate the file. The values were 'RTSS' for Ray, Tom, Steve, and Steve - the first four members of the team. The code was originally written for OS/2 and had no user interface; a symbol was placed in the device driver where the packet buffers were kept so received data could be dumped in hex from within the kernel debugger. 

Netmon caused a bit of a stir for Microsoft IT since networks and e-mail were not encrypted at the time. Only a few software engineers had access to hardware analyzers due to their cost, but with Netmon many engineers around the company had access to network traffic for free. At the request of Microsoft IT, two simple identification features were added - a non-cryptographic password and an identification protocol named the Bloodhound-Oriented Network Entity (BONE) (created and named by Raymond Patch as a play on the codename ''Bloodhound'').

Network Monitor 3 is a complete overhaul of the earlier Network Monitor 2.x version.  Originally versions of Network Monitor were only available through other Microsoft products, such as [[Systems Management Server]] (SMS).  But now the fully featured product with public parsers is available as a free [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=103158&clcid=0x409 download].
