<html> <head> <title>CNIL</title></head><body>The '''Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés''' or '''CNIL''' ({{IPA-fr|knil}}) is an independent [[France|French]] administrative authority whose mission is to ensure that [[data privacy]] law is applied to the collection, storage, and use of personal data. Its existence was established by French [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/texteconsolide/PPEAU.htm loi n° 78-17], concerning [[computer]]s, [[Computer file|files]] and [[liberty|liberties]] (data privacy) and enacted into law on 6 January 1978. Since 2004, the CNIL has been presided over by [[Alex Türk]], a right-wing senator and former member of the [[Rassemblement pour la République|Rally for the Republic]] (RPR).

==History==

[[SAFARI]] was an attempt by the [[France|French]] government to create a centralized [[Government database|database]] of personal data. On March 21 1974, an article in the newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'', "''SAFARI ou la chasse aux Français'' (SAFARI; or, Hunting Frenchmen) brought public attention to the project. The newly named Interior Minister [[Jacques Chirac]] had to face the public uproar. Nominated following the events of[[May'68]], Chirac succeeded [[Raymond Marcellin]], who had been forced to resign in the end of February 1974 after having attempted to place [[wiretap]]s in the offices of the ''[[Canard enchaîné]]'' weekly newspaper. The massive popular rejection of this project promoted the creation of the CNIL.

At the beginning of 1980, when the CNIL began its main activities, news anchorman [[Patrick Poivre d'Arvor]] announced that the CNIL had registered 125,000 files <ref name=History/>. By the end of 1980, Poivre d'Arvor counted 250,000 files (public and private) <ref name=History/>.

==Composition and independence==

The CNIL is composed of seventeen members from various government entities, four of whom are members of the parliament (''Assemblée nationale'' and ''Sénat''). Twelve of these members are elected by their representative organisations in the CNIL.

The CNIL's administrative authority status gives it total independence to select the actions that it will undertake. However, its power is limited and defined by law. The CNIL is financed by the budget of the French Republic.

==Power==
The CNIL registers the setup of information systems that process personal data on French territories. By September 2004, more than 800,000 declarations of such systems had been made. Additionally, CNIL checks the law to be applied in this domain as well as in about 50 annual 'control missions'. CNIL can warn organisations or people who are found to be noncompliant with the law, and also report them to the [[Parquet (legal)|Parquet]].

* 300 nominal information systems registered daily.
* 8000 phone calls handled each month.
* 4000 ''plaintes'' or requests for information received each year.

==Regulation==
The main principles for regulation of personal data processing are as follows (list not all-inclusive):
* all illegal means of data collection are forbidden;
* the aim of the data files must be explicitly stated;
* people registered in files must be informed of their rights, for example, for rectification and deletion of data on demand;
* finally, no decision about an individual can be decided by a computer.

The archival of ''sensitive'' information can result in a 5 year prison term and a €300,000 fine.

==European and International Contexts==
[[Germany]] in 1971, [[Sweden]] in 1973, and France in 1978 were the first three States to vote for a "Computers and Liberty" law; these work with an independent control authority. 

International, economic, and political structures have been created or assigned to apply CNIL directives. Amongst these are the [[Organisation pour la coopération et le développement économique]] (OCDE/[[EDCO]]) in 1980, the [[Council of Europe]] in 1981 and the [[United Nations]] (ONU) ([[UN|UNO]]) in 1990. In 1995, the [[European Commission]] voted through a directive in this manner. As of 2004, 25 countries have applied this directive.

== Criticisms ==

The CNIL is the target of various criticisms, alleging its lack of seriousness and tendency to support governmental legislation, forgetting its original aims of protecting data privacy and citizens' rights <ref name=History>Chloé Leprince, [http://www.rue89.com/2008/01/06/cnil-trente-ans-contre-la-tyrannie-de-lordinateur Cnil: trente ans contre la "tyrannie de l'ordinateur"], ''[[Rue 89]]'', 6 January 2008 {{fr icon}}</ref>. It was recently criticized, for instance, for having authorized "ethnic statistics", forbidden in [[demographics of France|official demographic statistics]] <ref> Chloé Leprince, [http://www.rue89.com/2007/09/17/les-statistiques-ethniques-au-detour-de-la-loi-sur-limmigration Les statistiques ethniques au détour de la loi sur l'immigration], ''[[Rue 89]]'', 17 September 2007 {{fr icon}}</ref>.
