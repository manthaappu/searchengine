'''ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest''' (abbreviated as '''ACM-ICPC''' or just '''ICPC''') is an annual multi-tiered computer programming competition among the universities of the world. The contest is sponsored by [[IBM]].  Headquartered at [[Baylor University]], with autonomous regions on six continents, the ICPC is directed by Baylor Professor William B. Poucher, Executive Director, and operates under the auspices of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM).

==History==
The ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest, [[ICPC]], traces its roots to a competition held at [[Texas A&M University]] in 1970 hosted by the Alpha Chapter of the [[Upsilon Pi Epsilon]] Computer Science Honor Society (UPE). The contest evolved into its present form as a multi-tier competition in 1977, with the first finals held in conjunction with the ACM Computer Science Conference.

From 1977 to 1989, the contest included mainly teams from [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Canada]].  Headquartered at [[Baylor University]] since 1989, with regionals established within the world's university community, operating under the auspices of ACM, and with substantial industry support, the ICPC has grown into a worldwide competition with teams from 84 countries in 2005.

Since the beginning of [[IBM]]'s sponsorship in 1997, contest participation has grown enormously. In 1997, 840 teams from 560 universities participated. In 2007, 6,700 teams from 1,821 universities participated. The number of teams keeps increasing by 10-20% every year and future competitions may be even larger.

The World Finals of the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest World Finals, ACM-ICPC World Finals, is the final round of competition.  Over its history it has become a 4-day event held in the finest venues worldwide.  [[Upsilon Pi Epsilon|UPE]] recognizes all of the regional champions at the event. Recent World Champion teams have been recognized by their country's head of state and at the annual ACM Awards Ceremony.

==Contest rules==
The ICPC is a team competition. Current rules stipulate that each team consist of three students. Participants must be university students, who have had less than five years of university education before the contest. Students who have previously competed in two World Finals or five regional competitions are ineligible to compete again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/info/default.htm|title=Information - ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/Regionals/EligibilityDecisionTree.pdf|title=2008 ICPC Regionals Eligibility Decision Diagram|accessdate=2008-06-10|format=PDF}}</ref>

During contest, the teams are given 5 hours to solve between 8 and 12 programming problems (with 8 typical for regionals and 10 for finals). They must submit solutions as programs in [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], or [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. Programs are then run on test data. If a program fails to give a correct answer, the team is notified about that and they can submit another program. 

The winner is the team which correctly solves most problems. If necessary to rank teams for medals or prizes among tying teams, the placement of teams is determined by the sum of the elapsed times at each point that they submitted correct solutions plus 20 minutes for each rejected submission of a problem ultimately solved.

For example, consider a situation when two teams, Red and Blue, tie by solving two problems each. The team Red submitted their solutions to A and B at 1:00 and 2:45 after the beginning of the contest. They had a rejected run on C, but it was ignored since they didn't solve C.  The team Blue submitted solutions to problems A and C at 1:20 and 2:00 after the beginning. They had one rejected run on C.  Then, the total time is 1:00+2:45=3:45 for team Red and 1:20+2:00+0:20=3:40 for team Blue.  The tie is broken in favor of Team Blue.

Compared to other programming contests (for example, [[International Olympiad in Informatics]]), the ICPC is characterized by a large number of problems (8 or more problems in just 5 hours). Another feature is that each team can use only one computer, although teams have three students. This makes the time pressure even greater. Good teamwork and ability to withstand pressure is needed to win.

==Regionals and World Finals==
The contest consists of several stages. Many universities hold local contests to determine participants at the regional level. Then, universities compete in Regional contests. Winners of Regional contests advance to the [[ACM-ICPC World Finals]]. More than one team from a university can compete in regionals, but only one may compete at the world finals.  From each region, at least one team goes to World Finals. Regions with large number of teams send multiple teams to finals (sometimes as many as 6 teams from one very large region).

* No participant can take part in more than two World Finals.
* Some large regions also hold Subregional competitions (also called Preliminaries) which are intermediate between local and regional contests.
* In ACM/ICPC, the result has seven different expressions (AC, WA, RTE, TLE, PE, MLE, CE).The result AC means the code is accepted by the system.

==2004 World Finals==
The 2004 ACM-ICPC World Finals were hosted at the Obecni Dum, [[Prague]], by [[Czech Technical University]] in Prague. 3,150 teams representing 1,411 universities from 75 countries competed in elimination rounds, with 73 of those teams proceeding to the world finals.
