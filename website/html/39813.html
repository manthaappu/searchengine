'''Howard G. "Ward" Cunningham''' (born May 26, 1949) is an [[United States|American]] [[Programmer|computer programmer]] who developed the first [[wiki]]. A pioneer in both [[Design pattern (computer science)|design patterns]] and [[Extreme Programming]], he started programming the software [[WikiWikiWeb]] in 1994 and installed it on the [[website]] of his software consultancy, [[Cunningham & Cunningham]] (commonly known by its domain name, '''c2.com'''), on March 25, 1995, as an add-on to the [[Portland Pattern Repository]]. He currently lives in [[Beaverton, Oregon]] and is the [[chief technology officer]] for [[AboutUs]].

He has co-authored a book about wikis, titled ''[[The Wiki Way]]'', and also invented [[Framework for Integrated Tests]]. He was a keynote speaker at the first three instances of the [[WikiSym]] conference series on [[wiki]] research and practice.

== Personal history ==
Cunningham received his [[Bachelor's degree]] in interdisciplinary engineering ([[electrical engineering]] and [[computer science]]) and his [[master's degree]] in computer science from [[Purdue University]]. He is a founder of Cunningham & Cunningham, Inc. He has also served as Director of R&D at [[Wyatt Software]] and as Principal Engineer in the [[Tektronix]] Computer Research Laboratory. He is founder of the [[Hillside Group]] and has served as program chair of the [[Pattern Languages of Programming]] conference which it sponsors. Cunningham was part of the [[Smalltalk]] community. From December 2003 until October 2005, he worked for [[Microsoft Corporation]] in the "patterns & practices" group. From October 2005 to May 2007, he held the position of Director of Committer Community Development at the [[Eclipse Foundation]]. In May 2007, he joined [[AboutUs]] as its [[chief technology officer]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Transition |url=http://eclipseprojects.blogspot.com/2007/05/transition.html |author=Ward Cunningham |accessdate=2007-05-19 |date=2007-05-17}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>Bishop, Todd.

== Ideas and inventions ==
Cunningham is well-known for a few widely disseminated ideas which he originated and developed. The most famous among these are the [[wiki]] (named after [[WikiWikiWeb]]) and many ideas in the field of software patterns. He owns the company Cunningham & Cunningham Inc., a small consultancy that has specialized in object-oriented programming.

In a 2006 interview with internetnews.com Cunningham described his thinking about [[patent]]ing the Wiki concept when he first created it.<ref>{{cite news |date=December 8, 2006 |title=Q&A with Ward Cunningham |publisher=internetnews.com |author=Kerner, Sean Michael |url=http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3648131 }}</ref>

He has a current interest in tracking the number and location of wiki page edits as a sociological experiment and may even consider the degradation of a wiki page as part of its process to stability. “There are those who give like Chalmers, and those who take, like Weir & Barlow. You can tell by reading what they write.”<ref>{{cite news |date=December 7, 2008 |title=Ward Cunningham, Lecture|publisher=CyborgCamp Live Stream - Mogulus Live Broadcast |author=CubeSpace, Portland Oregon |url=http://cyborgcamp.blip.tv/#1564923}}</ref>

=== Patterns and Extreme Programming ===
Cunningham is also well known for his contributions to the developing practice of [[object-oriented programming]], in particular the use of [[pattern language]]s and (with [[Kent Beck]]) [[Class-Responsibility-Collaboration card|CRC (Class-Responsibility Collaboration) card]]s. He is also a significant contributor to the [[Extreme Programming]] [[software development methodology]]. A great deal of this work was collaboratively carried out in the first wiki site itself.
