'''SoundEdit''' was the first popular GUI-based audio editor for digitized audio. It was not only one of the first important audio applications for Macintosh, but one of the first significant audio applications for personal computers in general.

SoundEdit was one of three audio applications created during a sabbatical by [[Steve Capps]] during 1986. The Macintosh had no built-in sound input, so the MacRecorder audio digitizer was invented for this purpose in 1985 by Michael Lamoureux, a mathematics student at the University of California, Berkeley. The MacRecorder hardware and software was publicly released through the [[Berkeley Macintosh Users Group]] as a kit in late 1985. SoundEdit first shipped in January 1988, as part of a hardware product called MacRecorder Sound System, by a company called [[Farallon Computing]] (which eventually became Netopia).

One of the major drivers for SoundEdit was Apple's [[HyperCard]]. With MacRecorder Sound System, stack makers could finally create alternatives to HyperCard's two built-in sounds.

SoundEdit was later bought by Macromind-Paracomp, which became [[Macromedia]] (now [[Adobe Systems]]). 

[[Macromedia]] rebranded the program as 'SoundEdit 16' and expanded its capabilities to support CD-quality audio and [[Quicktime]] soundtrack editing and an audio plug-in architecture.  A plug-in was included to convert sounds into '.SWA' format, an early form of mp3 file.  These streaming audio files could be delivered to viewers using by embedded [[Adobe Shockwave|Shockwave]] content in web pages ([[Adobe Shockwave|Shockwave]] created using [[Adobe Director|Director]]).

[[Macromedia]] discontinued sales of SoundEdit as of 1 December 2004, continuing its official support through 1 June 2005 and still offering some downloads for this application to this date.  
This final version only runs on Powermacs running Mac OS Classic.  It does not run under Mac OS-X.
