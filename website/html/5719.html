<html> <head> <title>Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences</title></head><body>The '''Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences''' is a multi-disciplinary research institute, internationally active in the fields of [[complexity science]] and [[neuroscience]]. The center is located in the [[Charles E. Schmidt College of Science]], Florida. This center was founded by [[J. A. Scott Kelso]] in 1985. 

== Organization ==
The mission of the Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences is to understand the principles and mechanisms underlying complex behavior on levels from [[molecules]] to people and their interactions. The Center is internationally active in the fields of [[complexity science]] and [[neuroscience]].

=== Ph.D. program ===
Since 1994 the Center has offered a [[Ph.D.]] program in Complex Systems and Brain Sciences as well as post-doctoral research opportunities. The program was established through a [[training grant]] from the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] of the [[National Institutes of Health]].

This research and training program blends emerging concepts from complex dynamical systems with experimental techniques at the molecular, cellular, behavioral, and cognitive levels in brain sciences.  Students learn to use cutting-edge experimental techniques ranging from molecular neuroscience to brain imaging technologies including [[EEG]], [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]], high-resolution structural [[MRI]], and [[functional MRI]].

Some of the Ph.D. Graduates are John Jeka, Tom Holroyd, Fred Carver and Walter B. Hoover.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}
