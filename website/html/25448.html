<html> <head> <title>Mushroom management</title></head><body>'''Mushroom Management''' is an allusion to a [[Company (law)|company]]'s staff being treated like mushrooms: kept in the dark, covered with [[Feces|dung]], and, when grown big enough, canned ([[Dismissal (employment)|fired]]). The connotation is that the management is making decisions without consulting the staff affected by those decisions, and possibly not even informing the staff until well after such decisions are made.

This phenomenon is an [[anti-pattern]] most commonly found in organizations which have a strict hierarchy and barriers to cross-organizational communication (especially those with a [[Stovepipe (organisation)|stovepipe organization]]) but can be found in any organization.
