<html> <head> <title>Web Server Gateway Interface</title></head><body>The '''Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI)''' defines a simple and universal [[interface (computer science)|interface]] between [[web server]]s and [[web application]]s or [[web application framework|framework]]s for the [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]].

==Idea==
Historically Python web application frameworks have been a problem for new Python users because, generally speaking, the choice of web framework would limit the choice of usable [[web server]]s, and vice versa. Python applications were often designed for either [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]], [[FastCGI]], [[mod_python]] or even custom API interfaces of specific web-servers.

WSGI<ref>[http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/ PEP 333], Python Web Server Gateway Interface v1.0</ref> (sometimes pronounced like 'whiskey' or 'wiz-gee') was created as a low-level [[interface (computer science)|interface]] between web servers and web applications or frameworks to promote common ground for portable web application development. WSGI is based on the existing [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]] standard.

==Specification overview==
The WSGI has two sides: the "[[server (computing)|server]]" or "gateway" side, and the "application" or "framework" side.  The server side calls the application side, providing environment information plus a callback function (for the application to use to convey headers to the server side), and receiving web content in return.

So-called ''WSGI [[middleware]]'' implements both sides of the API so that it can intermediate between a WSGI server and a WSGI application: the middleware acts as an application from some WSGI server's point of view and as a server from some WSGI application's point of view.  A "middleware" component can perform such functions as:
* Routing a request to different application objects based on the target [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]], after changing the [[environment variables]] accordingly.
* Allowing multiple applications or frameworks to run side-by-side in the same [[process (computing)|process]]
* [[Load balancing (computing)|Load balancing]] and remote processing, by forwarding requests and responses over a [[computer network|network]]
* Perform content postprocessing, such as applying [[XSLT]] stylesheets

==Example application==
A WSGI compatible "[[Hello World]]" application written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]:
<source lang="python">
def app(environ, start_response):
    start_response('200 OK', [('Content-Type', 'text/plain')])
    yield 'Hello World\n'
</source>

==Example of calling an application==
An example of calling an application and retrieving its response:
<source lang="python">
def call_application(app, environ):
    body = []
    status_headers = [None, None]
    def start_response(status, headers):
        status_headers[:] = [status, headers]
        return body.append
    app_iter = app(environ, start_response)
    try:
        for item in app_iter:
            body.append(item)
    finally:
        if hasattr(app_iter, 'close'):
            app_iter.close()
    return status_headers[0], status_headers[1], ''.join(body)

status, headers, body = call_application(app, {...environ...})
</source>

==WSGI-compatible applications and frameworks==
There are numerous [[web application framework]]s supporting WSGI:
* [[CherryPy]]
* [[Django (web framework)|Django]]<ref name="djangowsgi">[http://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2005/jul/18/local_server/] Django with WSGI support</ref>
* [[web2py]] 
* [[TurboGears]]
* [[Tornado (web server)|Tornado]] 
* [[Pylons (web framework)|Pylons]]
* [[BlueBream]]
* [[nginx]] 
* [[Google App Engine]]
* [[Trac]]
* [[Flask (programming)|Flask]]
* [[Pyramid (web framework) |Pyramid]]
* Bottle<ref name="bottle">[http://bottle.paws.de/] Bottle Micro-Framework</ref>
* weblayer<ref name="weblayer">[http://packages.python.org/weblayer] weblayer package for writing WSGI application</ref>

==Wrappers==
The server or gateway invokes the application callable once for each request it receives from an [[HTTP]] client, that is directed at the application.

Currently wrappers are available for [[FastCGI]], [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]], [[SCGI]], [[Apache JServ Protocol|AJP]] (using flup), Apache (using [[mod_wsgi]] or [[mod_python]]) and [[Internet Information Services|Microsoft IIS]] (using [http://code.google.com/p/isapi-wsgi/ isapi-wsgi], [http://pyisapie.sourceforge.net/ PyISAPIe], or an [[Active Server Pages|ASP]] gateway).

==WSGI and Python 3==
The separation of binary and text data in Python 3 poses a problem for WSGI, as it specifies that header data should be strings, while it sometimes needs to be binary and sometimes text. This works in Python 2 where text and binary data both are kept in "string" variables, but in Python 3 binary data is kept in "bytes" variables and "string" variables are for unicode text data.

The result has been a reworked standard called Web3, specified in PEP444. This standard is an incompatible derivative of WSGI designed to work on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.1+. <ref>{{cite web|title=PEP 444 -- Python Web3 Interface|url=http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0444/|author=Chris McDonough, Armin Ronacher|date=2010-09-16|accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref>
