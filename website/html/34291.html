To '''shutdown''' or '''power off''' a computer is to [[switch|remove power]] from a computer's main components in a controlled way. After a computer is shut down, main components such as [[Central processing unit|CPU]]s, [[Random-access memory|RAM]] modules and [[hard disk drive]]s are powered down, although some internal components, such as internal clock, may retain power.

==Implementations==
===Mac OS X===
In [[Mac OS X]] the computer can be shut down by choosing "Shut Down…" from the [[Apple Menu]] or by pressing the power key to bring up the power management dialog box. An administrator may also use the Unix <code>shutdown</code> [[command (computing)|command]] as well.

===Windows===
In [[Microsoft Windows]], a PC or server is shut down by selecting the <tt>Shutdown</tt> item from the [[Start menu]] on the desktop. Options include shutting down the system and powering off, automatically restarting the system after shutting down, or putting the system into [[standby mode|stand-by mode]]. There is also a <code>shutdown</code> command that can be executed within a [[command shell]] window. <tt>shutdown.exe</tt> is the command-line shut down application that can shut down the user's computer or another computer on the user's network.

Just like other operating systems, Windows allows to prohibit selected users to shutdown computer. On a Home PC, every user may have the shutdown option, but in network computers, an administrator can revoke the access rights of selected users to shutdown a windows computer. Nowadays there are many software utilities which can automate the task of shutting down a windows computer enabling automatic computer control. The Windows [http://www.shutdown.cc Shutdown] website lists various software utilities to automate the task of shutting down.

===Unix and Linux===
In [[Unix]] and [[Linux]], the <code>shutdown</code> command can be used to turn off or [[Booting|reboot]] a computer. Only the [[superuser]] can shut the system down.

One commonly issued form of this command is <code>shutdown -h now</code>, which will shut down a system immediately. Another one is <code>shutdown -r now</code> to reboot. Another form allows the user to specify an exact time or a delay before shutdown: <code>shutdown -h 20:00</code> will turn the computer off at 8:00 PM, and <code>shutdown -r -t 60</code> will automatically reboot the machine within 60 seconds (one minute) of issuing the command.
