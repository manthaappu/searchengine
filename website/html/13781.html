In a '''Flexible Rake Receiver''', [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] reception is performed with a single [[correlator]] engine and a [[stream (computing)|stream]] [[buffer (computer science)|buffer]] storing the entire delay spread of [[baseband]] [[input/output]] (I/O) [[sample (signal)|sample]]s. The primary advantage of the proposed approach is flexible [[Multipath propagation|multipath]] allocation supporting enhanced [[modularity (programming)|modularity]] of the receiver and resource sharing among multiple [[channel (communications)|channel]] [[decoder]]s.
