The '''TRS-80''' name was also used for a [[Tandy Pocket Computer|pocket computer]] manufactured by [[Sharp Corporation]] for [[Tandy]] besides being the name of the [[TRS-80]] personal computer. The handheld unit measured 175 &times; 70 &times; 15 mm and weighed 170 g, and had a one-line, 24-character alphanumeric [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]].

The TRS-80 Pocket Computer was programmable in [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], with a capacity of 1424 "program steps". This memory was shared with variable storage of up to 178 locations, in addition to the 26 fixed locations named A through Z.

Programs and data could be stored on a [[cassette tape]] through an optional external tape interface unit. A printer/cassette interface was available, which used an ink ribbon on plain paper.

Although not branded as such, this became known as the PC-1, as later models were labelled PC-2 through PC-8. Some were made by Sharp, and the rest were made by [[Casio]] (PC-4 through PC-7). The PC-2 had 4 colored [[ballpoint pen|ball point pens]] and could print or plot on plain paper. The others all used thermal paper, the PC-3 and PC-8 using the same printer, the PC-4, PC-5 and PC-6 using the same printer, and the PC-7 having no printer or cassette interface.
