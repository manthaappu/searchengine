'''HippoDraw''' is a powerful [[Object oriented programming|object oriented]]  statistical [[data analysis]] [[Software package (installation)|package]] written in [[C++]], with user interaction via a [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]]-based [[GUI]] and a [[Python (programming language)|Python]] scriptable interface. It is being developed by [[Paul Kunz]] at [[SLAC]], primarily for the analysis and presentation of [[particle physics]] and [[astrophysics]] data, but can be equally well used in other fields where data handling is important.  

HippoDraw can read and write files in an XML-based format, astrophysics [[FITS]] files, data objects produced by [[ROOT]] (optional), and via the python bindings, anything that can be read/write by python (hdf5, for instance, via pytables).

HippoDraw can be used as a Python extension module, allowing users to use HippoDraw data objects with the full power of the Python language. This includes other scientific Python extension modules such Numeric and numarray, whose use with HippoDraw can lead to a large increase in processing speed, even for ROOT objects.

<!--
is this still true?

Both HippoDraw and [[Java Analysis Studio|JAS]] implement the [[AIDA (computing)|AIDA]] interface specifications, and as such can interoperate well.
