<html> <head> <title>Speaker diarisation</title></head><body>Speaker Diarization is the process of partitioning an input audio stream into homogeneous segments according to the speaker identity. It can enhance the readability of an [[Speech_recognition|automatic speech transcription]] by structuring the audio stream into speaker turns and, when  used together with [[Speaker recognition]] systems, by providing the speakerâ€™s true identity <ref>http://www.limsi.fr/Rapports/RS2005/chm/tlp/tlp1/index.html Improved speaker diarization using speaker identification.</ref> . It is used to answer the question "who spoke when?".
<ref>http://poseidon.csd.auth.gr/papers/PUBLISHED/JOURNAL/pdf/Kotti08a.pdf Speaker Segmentation and Clustering.</ref>.
Speaker Diarization is a combination of Speaker Segmentation and Speaker Clustering. The first aims at finding speaker change points
in an audio stream. The second aims at grouping together speech segments on the basis of speaker characteristics.

With the increasing number of  broadcasts, meeting recordings and voice mail collected every year, Speaker Diarization has received much attention in recent times by the speech community, as is manifested by the specific evaluations devoted to it under the auspices of the  [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] for telephone speech, broadcast news and meetings <ref>http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/rt/ Rich Transcription Evaluation Project.</ref>. 


== Open Source Speaker Diarization Software ==
 
There are some open source initiatives for Speaker Diarization:

*[[LIUM_SpkDiarization]]: LIUM_SpkDiarization tool [http://www-lium.univ-lemans.fr/fr/content/liumspkdiarization].

*[[Audioseg]]: AudioSeg is a toolkit dedicated to audio segmentation and classification of audio streams [http://gforge.inria.fr/projects/audioseg].

*[[SHoUT]]: Shout is a software package  developed at the University of Twente to aid speech recognition research. SHOUT is a Dutch acronym for ''Speech Recognition Research at the University of Twente''  [http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~huijbreg/shout/]
