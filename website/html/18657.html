'''Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers''', also abbreviated to '''Isis''', is a specialized software package developed by the [[USGS]] to [[Image processing|process images]] and spectra collected by current and past NASA planetary missions sent to Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and other solar system bodies. It contains standard image processing capabilities (such as image algebra, filters, statistics) for both 2D images and 3D data cubes, as well as mission-specific data processing capabilities and cartographic rendering functions.<ref>[http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/ USGS Isis Homepage]</ref>
