'''VistA Imaging''' is an FDA-approved Image Management system used in the [[List of Veterans Affairs medical facilities|Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare facilities nationwide]]. It is one of the most widely used image management systems in routine healthcare use, and is used to manage many different varieties of images associated with a patient's medical record.

== Hardware requirements ==

The VistA Imaging System uses hardware components to provide short- and long-term storage. It takes advantage of network servers for storage. It uses a [[Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine|DICOM]] gateway system to communicate with commercial [[Picture archiving and communication system|Picture Archiving and Communication Systems]] [[Picture archiving and communication system|(PACS)]] and modalities such as CT, MR, and Computed Radiography (x-ray) devices for image capture. It utilizes a background processor for moving the images to the proper storage device and for managing storage space.

== Types of data managed ==

The system not only manages radiologic images, but also is able to capture and manage [[Electrocardiogram|EKGs]], [[pathology]] images, [[Endoscopy|gastroenterology (endoscopic)]] images, [[Laparoscopic surgery|laparoscopic]] images, scanned paperwork, or essentially any type of health care image.

== Integration with Electronic Health Record systems ==

VistA Imaging is currently integrated into the [[VistA EMR]] (electronic medical record) system used nationwide in Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals. This integration is able to provide increased efficiency of retrieval of images.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Imaging Economics, Skokie, IL (USA)|date=December 2002|url=http://www.imagingeconomics.com/issues/articles/2002-12_01.asp|title=PACS Lessons Learned at the Baltimore VA}}</ref> It has also been used as a separate software package and can be used with [[Electronic health record|EHRs]] other than VistA.

VistA Imaging now connects to a nationwide backbone that allows clinicians to access the 350 million images stored in the VA system via Remote Image View software.<ref name="HealthIT">{{cite journal|journal=Government Health IT (USA)|date=October 9, 2006|url=http://govhealthit.com/article96354-10-09-06-Print|title=VistA's horizons: The VA's VistA Imaging system had its beginnings in a government worker's basement home office.

The VA has developed interfaces for more than 250 medical devices in VistA Imaging, the images from which can be accessed through the desktop VistA Imaging Viewer. The Department of Defense will use the VistA Imaging Viewer to enhance its own EHR.<ref name="HealthIT"/>

== Usage in a National Network of Healthcare Records ==
As part of the US national mandate to co-ordinate care between Department of Defense and the VA, VistA Imaging is forming a cornerstone of the effort to exchange medical imagery between the two systems. “When soldiers come back from Iraq and Afghanistan and eventually enter the VA system, images will be able to move from DOD to VA seamlessly." Eventually, DOD and VA should be able to share all image file types from all sites. Additional enhancements to VistA Imaging include development of a central archive for all VA images (whether acquired through VistA or a commercial system) and new indexing and search capabilities.<ref>{{cite web|title=VistA Imaging upgrades will enhance exchanges with DOD|date=November 2008|url=http://govhealthit.com/articles/2008/11/vista-imaging-upgrades-will-enhance-exchanges-with-dod_633662645039172840.aspx}}</ref>

== Availability ==

The software for VistA Imaging has been made available through the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] so that it is in the public domain. Due to its designation as a medical device, however, it can not be designated as free open source software and therefore can not be altered or implemented without FDA approval. This was done intentionally to limit the distribution of VistA Imaging.

Although it can be used in healthcare facilities that are outside the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]], this is possible only if the proprietary modules that have been integrated into it are also licensed and implementation is registered with the FDA. This has effectively limited its use to government institutions who have licensed the proprietary modules.

It is nominally available through the [http://www1.va.gov/VHA_OI/page.cfm?pg=37 Department of Veterans Affairs software request] office for a fee of around $15.

== Proprietary modules required ==

VistA Imaging uses proprietary modules not in the public domain. This makes its public domain use limited.

These modules include ([http://www.accusoft.com Accusoft]) ImageGear OCX-32 Pro Gold Version 8.0.4, (Accusoft) Medical Extension/OCX-32 Version 1.1.40, Borland Delphi Professional Version 5.0 build 6.18, Borland Delphi Professional Version 7.0 build 8.1, (GE Marquette Medical) MUSE API Version 005A and Version 005B build 19990324, Matrox ActiveMIL 7.5, Dome Version 4.0.2.3, (Outrider Systems) SPIN32.OCX, (Kodak) Admin Control Version 5.0.2134.1, (Kodak) Edit Control Version 5.0.2195.6601, (Macromedia) RoboHelp HTML x5.0.2, (Intersystems) MSM Version 4.4.0, (Intersystems) Cachè Version 5.0.20, (Aware, Inc.) [http://www.aware.com/imaging/accuradj2k.htm AccuRad J2KSuite for Compression and Decompression] Version V3.8.0.0, ([http://www.laurelbridge.com Laurel Bridge Software]) [http://www.laurelbridge.com/dcf.php DICOM Toolkit] version 2.8.7a, (Sentillion) Vergence Locator version 3.3.1.8907.

== Open Source Alternative compatible with VistA ==

A multi-platform open source product [http://sourceforge.net/projects/o3-dpacs O3-DPACS] (“Open Three ( O3 ) - Data & Picture Archiving and Communication System”) is a Java-based alternative for the open-source VistA implementations that is likely to fulfill the same functions provided by VistA Imaging within the VA.<ref>{{cite web|title=VistA Monograph Wiki|url=http://wiki.laptop.org/go/VistA_Monograph_Wiki#VistA_Imaging_System|publisher=OLPC Health Project (June 2008)}}</ref>

== Information retrieval after a natural disaster ==

The VistA Imaging system was robust enough to be restored after Hurricane Katrina damaged the data facility at the New Orleans VA.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Orleans VA medical center restores data lost to Katrina|url=http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/pacsweb/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=180100058|publisher=Diagnostic Imaging:PACSWeb (Feb. 11, 2006)}}</ref>. This type of backup proved superior to a paper record system.
