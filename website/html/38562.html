'''uCoz''' is a [[free web hosting]] with built-in [[content management system]]. The modules of uCoz CMS can be used either in combination to build a full-featured [[website]], or separately, e.g. as a [[blog]] platform, [[webforum]] etc. uCoz is among the top sites for Russian-speaking users according to [[Alexa Internet]]<ref>http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/RU</ref>.

==History==
Initially the basis of the service development was formed by the combined experience of several developers, which consisted in previous work over such services as poll and free [[guestbooks]], as well as professional [[CMS]] script (WoCatalog Pro). After almost a year of development, on October 29, 2005, the world saw the Russian version of the system. In June 2007, the English version was officially presented, and in August — the German one. At present uCoz is also available in Spanish, French, Arabic, Hungarian, Swedish, and partially in Latvian, Ukrainian, Georgian.

==Modules==
uCoz CMS platform includes modules that can be used to create a fully customized site, alternatively, some modules can be used separately to create a blog, a forum etc.

==Peculiarities==
Being a [[SaaS]] system, uCoz has [[SaaS]] features — closed source code, unavailability of running of server-side scripts and databases (all this is possible within Web 3.0 [[PaaS]] concept), which is balanced out by a great number of [http://www.ucoz.com/main/?a=about built-in system capabilities]. Static [[HTML]] pages can be used but are not recommended – there are some [http://faq.ucoz.com/ limitations] on their usage and uploading>.
