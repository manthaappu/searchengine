The [[EUREKA]] Prometheus Project ('''''PRO'''gra'''M'''me for a '''E'''uropean '''T'''raffic of '''H'''ighest '''E'''fficiency and '''U'''nprecedented '''S'''afety'', 1987-1995) was the largest R&D project ever in the field of [[driverless car]]s. In today's money it received more than 1 billion dollars of funding from the [[European Commission]], and defined the state of the art of [[autonomous]] vehicles. Numerous universities and car manufacturers participated in this [[Pan-European]] project.

Prometheus profited from the participation of [[Ernst Dickmanns]], the 1980s pioneer of [[driverless car]]s, and his team at Bundeswehr Universität München, collaborating with [[Daimler-Benz]].  A first culmination point was achieved in 1994, when their twin robot vehicles [[VaMP]] and VITA-2 drove more than one thousand kilometers on a [[Paris]] multi-lane highway in standard heavy traffic at speeds up to 130 km/h. They demonstrated autonomous driving in free lanes, [[convoy]] driving, automatic [[tracking]] of other vehicles, and lane changes left and right with autonomous passing of other cars.

The next culmination point was achieved in 1995, when Dickmanns´ re-engineered autonomous [[S-Class]] Mercedes-Benz took a 1000 mile trip from [[Munich]] in [[Bavaria]] to [[Copenhagen]] in [[Denmark]] and back, using [[saccadic]] computer vision and [[transputer]]s to react in real time. The robot achieved speeds exceeding 175 km/h on the [[Germany|German]] [[Autobahn]], with a mean time between human interventions of 9 km. In traffic it executed manoeuvres to pass other cars. Despite being a research system without emphasis on long distance reliability, it drove up to 158 km without any human intervention.

The achievements of Prometheus were the basis for most subsequent work on [[driverless car]]s.
