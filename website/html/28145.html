In [[computing]], a '''POST card''' is a diagnostic tool that reports error codes produced by a [[Power-on self-test|POST]]. They are used by technicians to troubleshoot computers that refuse to boot. The cards relay POST codes generated by the system, and the system must therefore have a working CPU and BIOS, in addition to whatever I/O interface the POST card relies on. Thus, POST cards cannot be used to diagnose the cause of e.g. a dead motherboard. POST cards are desirable in situations where video is not available; either because connecting a monitor is impractical, or because the point of failure occurs before the video subsystem can be initialized.

POST cards are inserted into an expansion slot, and are available in [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]], [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] and other variants.
The card reports a number, consisting of two [[hexadecimal]] digits, that is output to an [[I/O port]] by the [[BIOS]] while running the [[Power-on self-test|POST]].
Reference tables covering different BIOSes are needed.

Some motherboards come with a built-in display to diagnose hardware problems. Most also report POST errors with audible beeps, if a PC speaker is attached.
