A '''smartbook''' is a class of [[mobile device]] that combines certain features of both a [[smartphone|'''smart'''phone]] and [[netbook|net'''book''']].<ref name="cnet_1">{{cite web |url=http://ces.cnet.com/8301-31045_1-10431884-269.html |title=CES: What, exactly, is a smartbook?

Smartbooks are generally powered by [[ARM architecture|ARM]] processors, which are more energy-efficient than traditional [[x86]] processors that are typically found in desktop and laptop computers.<ref name="cnet_1"/>  The first smartbooks expected to hit the market will use variants of the [[Linux]] [[operating system]], such as Google's [[Android (operating system)|Android]] or [[Chrome OS]]. The ARM processor commonly used in smartbooks allows them to achieve longer battery life than many larger devices using x86 processors.<ref name="eetimes">[http://www.eetimes.eu/design/217700855 Qualcomm touts the smartbook to rival netbooks, smartphones<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="wsj55">{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704234304574626541267909328.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | title='Smartbooks' Latest to Join Crowded Computer Market | first=Don | last=Clark | date=2009-12-29}}</ref>

The smartbook concept was first published by [[Qualcomm]] in early 2009,<ref name="eetimes"/> with devices expected to hit the market later that year. Difficulties in adapting key software (in particular, Adobe's proprietary [[Adobe Flash Player|Flash Player]]) to the ARM architecture<ref name="wsj55"/> delayed releases until the first quarter of 2010, during which about 20 devices are expected to be released.<ref>[http://www.liliputing.com/2009/12/ready-or-not-2010-could-be-the-year-of-the-smartbooks.html Ready or not, 2010 could be the year of the smartbooks<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://english.etnews.co.kr/news/detail.html?id=200912280010 대한민국 IT포털의 중심! 이티뉴스<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

A German company Smartbook AG sells [[laptops]] under the brand ''Smartbook''. The company holds a [[trademark]] for the word ''Smartbook'' in a number of countries (not including some big markets like [[United States]], [[China]], [[Japan]] or [[India]]) and is at the moment acting to preempt others from using the term ''smartbook'' to describe their products.<ref>David Adams, [http://www.osnews.com/story/22623 Publishers Caught in Smartbook Dispute] OSnews, 16th Dec 2009.</ref><ref>[http://smartbook.info/ Smartbook AG site dedicated to the trademark]</ref>
