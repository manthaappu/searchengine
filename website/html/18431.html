'''Inmos Limited''' (trademark '''INMOS''') was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[semiconductor device|semiconductor]] company, founded by [[Iann Barron]], based in [[Bristol]] and incorporated in November 1978.

Inmos's first products were [[static RAM]] devices, followed by [[dynamic RAM]]s and [[EEPROM]]s. Despite early production difficulties, Inmos eventually captured around 60% of the world SRAM market. However, Barron's long-term aim was to produce an innovative [[microprocessor]] architecture intended for [[parallel processing]], the ''[[transputer]]''. [[David May (computer scientist)|David May]] and [[Robert Milne (telecommunications consultant)|Robert Milne]] were recruited to design this processor, which eventually went into production in 1985 in the form of the T212 and T414 chips. 

The transputer achieved some success as the basis for several parallel [[supercomputer]]s from companies such as [[Meiko Scientific|Meiko]] (formed by ex-Inmos employees in 1985), [[Floating Point Systems]], [[Parsytec]] and [[Parsys]]. Being a relatively self-contained design, it was also used in some [[embedded systems]]. However, the unconventional nature of the transputer and its native [[occam programming language]] limited its appeal. During the late 1980s, the transputer (even in its later T800 form) also struggled to keep up with the ever-increasing performance of its competitors.

Other devices produced by Inmos included the A100, A110 and A121 [[digital signal processor]]s, [[G364 framebuffer]], and a line of video [[RAMDAC]]s, including the G171, which was adopted by [[IBM]] for the original [[VGA]] [[graphics adapter]] used in the [[IBM PS/2]].

== Business history ==

The company was founded by [[Iann Barron]], a British computer consultant, [[Richard Petritz]] and [[Paul Schroeder]], both American semiconductor industry veterans. Initial funding of £50M was provided by the UK government via the [[National Enterprise Board]]. A [[USA|US]] subsidiary, Inmos Corporation, was also established in [[Colorado]]. [[Semiconductor fabrication]] facilities were built in the US at [[Colorado Springs]], [[Colorado]] and in the UK at [[Newport]], [[South Wales]].

Under the [[privatization]] policy of [[Margaret Thatcher]] the National Enterprise Board was merged into the [[British Technology Group]] and had to sell its shares in Inmos. Offers for Inmos from [[AT&T]] and a Dutch consortium had been turned down.<ref name=wayne/> In 1982, construction of the [[Inmos microprocessor factory|microprocessor factory]] in [[Newport]], [[South Wales]] was completed. By July 1984 [[Thorn EMI]] had made a bid for £124.1 million for the state's 76 percent interest in the company (the remaining 24% had been held by Inmos founders and employees).<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40916FC3B5D0C708DDDAE0894DC484D81 Thorn-EMI Will Buy A 76% Stake in Inmos], ''[[The New York Times]],'' July 13, 1984.</ref> Later it was raised to £192 million, approved August 1984 and finalized in September.<ref name=wayne>Wayne Sandholtz (1992) "High-Tech Europe: The Politics of International Cooperation." Berkeley:  ''[[University of California Press]] [http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=ft609nb394&chunk.id=d0e10466 p. 155]</ref>

In total, Inmos had received £211 million from the government, but did not become profitable. <ref>Kevin Smith, "Inmos Forced to Get off the Dole." ''[[Electronics]]'' 22 September 1983, 56:106, as cited by Wayne Sandholtz</ref>

In April 1989, Inmos was sold to SGS-Thomson (now [[STMicroelectronics]]). Around the same time, work was started on an enhanced transputer, the T9000. Unfortunately, this encountered various technical problems and delays, and was eventually  abandoned, signalling the end of the development of the transputer as a parallel processing platform. However, transputer derivatives such as the ST20 were later incorporated into chipsets for embedded applications such as [[set-top box]]es.

In December 1994, Inmos was fully assimilated into STMicroelectronics, and the usage of the Inmos brand name was discontinued.
