<html> <head> <title>Harvest Automation</title></head><body>'''Harvest Automation, Inc.''' is a [[robotics]] startup founded by several former [[iRobot]] employees, including Joe Jones, the co-inventor of the [[Roomba]] robotic vacuum cleaner. The company's goal is to find new applications for robots. Their first planned robot will be used at container farms to space apart potted plants as they grow. This is a very labor-intensive job, and the robot to do it would be relatively simple, it would just need to pick up each potted plant and move it a little further from other plants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roboticstrends.com/article/print/roomba_co_inventors_shift_focus_to_cleaning_up_commercial_growing|title=Roomba co-Inventors Shift Focus to Cleaning Up Commercial Growing}}</ref>
