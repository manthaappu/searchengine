<html> <head> <title>Orchestration (computing)</title></head><body>'''Orchestration''' describes the automated arrangement, coordination, and management of complex computer systems, [[middleware]], and services.

It is often discussed as having an inherent [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] or even implicitly [[autonomic]] control, but those are largely [[aspirations]] or analogies rather than technical descriptions. In reality, ''orchestration'' is largely the effect of [[automation]] or systems deploying elements of [[control theory]].

This usage of ''orchestration'' is often discussed in the context of [[Service Oriented Architecture]], [[Platform virtualization|virtualization]], [[provisioning]], and '''dynamic datacenter''' topics.  It is often used as a [[buzzword]].

A somewhat different usage relates to the process of coordinating an exchange of information through [[web service]] interactions. (See also [[service-oriented architecture]], and [[Web Service Choreography|web service choreography]]). Applications which decouple the orchestration layer from the service layer are sometimes called [[agile application]]s.

Some texts make a [[Business_Process_Execution_Language#The_BPEL_language|distinction]] between orchestration and choreography.

With the popularity of ''Cloud computing'' it is now necessary to understand Service Orchestration in the context of this paradigm. Work flows and processes are used in different domains. At one level there are level inter-company business processes and at another level there are processes to get the wide area network operational. To keep matters simple, we will define an orchestrator as the entity that manages complex cross domain (system, enterprise, firewall) processes and handle exceptions. Since an orchestrator is valuable in the fulfillment, assurance as well as billing processes, in its most advanced service aware incarnation, should be capable of adjustments based on feedback from monitoring tools. At the most basic level an orchestrator is a human. The main difference between a work flow automation and orchestration is that work flows are processed which are completed a processes within a single domain.

Cloud Service orchestration therefore is the
* Composing of Architecture, Tools and Processes by humans to deliver a defined service
* Stitching of software and hardware components together to deliver a defined Service
* Connecting and automating of work flows when applicable to deliver a defined service

It is critical in the delivery of cloud services because
* Cloud is all about scale – automated work flows are essential
* Cloud Service delivery includes fulfillment assurance and billing
* Cloud Services delivery entails work flows in various technical and business domains

==Examples==
* [http://www.activevos.com/products-activevos.php ActiveVOS] is built on the [[BPEL]], [[BPEL4People]] and WS-Human Task open standards to allow developers the ability to orchestrate various systems and services. 
* [http://ode.apache.org/ Apache ODE] (Orchestration Director Engine) is a [[Business Process Execution Language|WS-BPEL]] 1.1 and 2.0 compliant [[business process management]] (BPM) engine that supports two communication layers: one based on [[Apache Axis2]] (Web Services HTTP transport) and another one based on the [[Java Business Integration]] standard (using [[Apache ServiceMix]]). It is capable of Hot-deployment, and features a management interface for processes, instances, and messages.
* [http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/ias/bpel/index.html Oracle BPEL Process Manager] provides a framework for easily designing, deploying, monitoring, and administering processes based on BPEL standards. BPEL Process Manager is the service orchestration solution on Oracle's SOA Suite.
* [http://www.intervoice.com/index.php/prod_media_exchange.html Intervoice Media Exchange] contains an orchestration engine that has been designed to initiate and manage media interactions.  It is the industry's first commercially available product that has implemented State Chart eXtensible Markup Language ([[SCXML]]) as the framework for building complex multi-modal interactions.
* [http://www.tibco.com/software/soa/activematrix-businessworks/default.jsp TIBCO BusinessWorks] is a very functional orchestration, integration and transformation tool that supports BPEL, Web Services, common integration activities and visual modeling of orchestration processes.
* [[Microsoft BizTalk Server]] contains an orchestration engine often used for business process management (BPM), allowing developers to quickly orchestrate complex business processes involving multiple disparate systems.
* [http://www.netbeans.org/products/enterprise/ NetBeans Enterprise Pack] is an open-source SOA tool that contains a [[Business Process Execution Language|BPEL]] visual designer and runtime that allows users to orchestrate Web Services.
* The [[Orc (programming language)|Orc language]] is an academic language for describing and implementing orchestrations.
* [[IBM WebSphere Process Server]] contains an orchestration engine, able to execute BPEL.
