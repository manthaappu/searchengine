The bootstrap was one of the first computer-intensive statistical techniques, replacing traditional [[algebra]]ic derivations with data-based computer simulations.

==Life and career==
Efron was born in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] in May 1938, the son of [[Russia]]n [[Jew]]ish immigrants Esther and Miles Efron.<ref>http://www.ams.org/meetings/national/jmm/2098_intro.html</ref> He attended the [[California Institute of Technology]], graduating in Mathematics in 1960. He arrived at [[Stanford]] in fall of 1960, earning his Ph.D., under the direction of Rupert Miller and Herb Solomon, in the Department of Statistics.  While at Stanford, he was suspended for a year for his involvement with the [[Stanford Chaparral]]'s parody of [[Playboy magazine]].<ref>{{cite web|

He is currently a Professor of Statistics at Stanford. At Stanford he has been the Chair of the Department of Statistics, Associate Dean of Science, Chairman of the University Advisory Board, Chair of the Faculty Senate and Chair of the Undergraduate Program in [[Applied Mathematics]].

Efron holds the Max H. Stein endowed chair as Professor of Humanities and Sciences at Stanford. 

He has made many important contributions to many areas of statistics. Efron's work has spanned both theoretical and applied topics, including empirical Bayes analysis (with [[Carl Morris (statistician)|Carl Morris]]), applications of [[differential geometry]] to [[statistical inference]], the analysis of survival data, and inference for microarray gene expression data. He is the author of a classic monograph, ''The Jackknife, the Bootstrap and Other Resampling Plans'' (1982) and has also co-authored (with R. Tibshirani) the text ''An Introduction to the Bootstrap'' (1994).

He created a set of [[nontransitive dice]] called [[Efron's dice]].

==Awards==
He has won many honors, including a [[MacArthur Prize Fellowship]], membership in the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], fellowship in the [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]] (IMS) and the [[American Statistical Association]] (ASA), the Wilks Medal, the Parzen Prize, and the Rao Prize, Fisher, Rietz and Wald lecturer.

In 2005, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]], the highest scientific honor by the United States, for his exceptional work in the field of Statistics (especially for his inventing of the bootstrapping methodology).<ref>[http://www.nsf.gov/od/nms/recip_details.cfm?recip_id=5300000000429 National Science Foundation - The President's National Medal of Science]</ref> He was presented with the award on May 29, 2007.<ref>http://www.nsf.gov/od/nms/2005nmslaureates_pressrelease.pdf</ref>
