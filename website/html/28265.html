<html> <head> <title>Packet crafting</title></head><body>'''Packet crafting''' is a technique that allows [[Network administrator|network administrators]] or [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] to probe [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] rule-sets and find entry points into a targeted system or network.  This is done by manually generating [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] to test network devices and behaviour, instead of using existing network traffic.<ref name=zereneh>{{cite web | last = Zereneh | first= William | url = http://www.scs.ryerson.ca/~zereneh/linux/PacketCrafting.pdf | title= Packet Crafting | accessdate = 2010-08-01 }}</ref> Testing may target the firewall, [[Intrusion detection system|IDS]], [[TCP/IP stack]], [[router]] or any other component of the network.<ref name=zereneh /><ref name=poor>{{cite web | last = Poor | first = Mike | url = http://www.inguardians.com/research/docs/packetfoo.pdf | title = Packet Craft for Defense-in-Depth | publisher = InGuardians | accessdate = 2010-08-01 }}</ref> Packets are usually created by using a [[packet generator]] or [[packet analyzer]] which allows for specific options and [[Flag (computing)|flags]] to be set on the created packets. The act of packet crafting can be broken into four stages: Packet Assembly, Packet Editing, Packet Play and Packet Decoding.<ref name=zereneh /><ref name=poor /> 
==Packet Assembly==
Packet Assembly is the creation of the packets to be sent. Some popular programs used for packet assembly are [[Hping]], [[Nemesis (software)|Nemesis]], [http://ostinato.googlecode.com/ Ostinato], [[Scapy]] and [[Yersinia (computing)|Yersinia]].<ref name=sectools>{{cite web | url = http://sectools.org/packet-crafters.html | title= Top 4 Packet Crafting Tools | publisher =  SecTools.org | accessdate = 2010-08-01}}</ref><ref name=poor /><ref name=zereneh />Packets may be of any [[Communications protocol|protocol]] and are designed to test specific rules or situations. For example, a [[TCP packet]] may be created with a set of erroneous flags to ensure that the target machine sends a RESET command or that the firewall blocks any response.<ref name=zereneh /><ref name=poor />

==Packet Editing==
Packet Editing is the modification of created or captured packets. This involves modifying packets in manners which are difficult or impossible to do in the Packet Assembly stage, such as modifying the payload of a packet.<ref name=poor /> Programs such as [[Netdude]] allow a user to modify recorded packets' fields, checksums and payloads quite easily.<ref name=zereneh /> These modified packets can be saved in packet streams which may be stored in [[pcap]] files to be replayed later.
==Packet Play==
Packet Play or Packet Replay is the act of sending a pre-generated or captured series of packets. Packets may come from Packet Assembly and Editing or from caputed network attacks. This allows for testing of a given usage or attack scenario for the targeted network. [[Tcpreplay]] is the most common program for this task since it is capable of taking a stored packet stream in the [[pcap]] format and sending those packets at the original rate or a user-defined rate. Some packet analyzers are also capable of packet replay.

==Packet Decoding==
Packet Decoding is the [[Packet capture|capture]] and analysis of the network traffic generated during Packet Play. In order to determine the targeted network's response to the scenario created by Packet Play, the response must be captured by a [[packet analyzer]] and decoded according to the appropriate specifications. Depending on the packets sent, a desired response may be no packets were returned or that a connection was successfully established, among others.
