'''zoo''' is a [[data compression]] program and format developed by Rahul Dhesi in the mid 1980s. The format is based on the [[LZW]] compression algorithm and compressed files are identified by the .zoo file extension. It is no longer widely used. Program source code was originally published on the comp.sources.misc [[Usenet]] newsgroup, and was compatible with a variety of [[Unix-like]] operating systems. Binaries were also published for the [[MS-DOS]] user community. A small companion program was also developed, entitled '''booz''', that provides only decompression functionality. {{Fact|date=January 2009}}

The .ZOO file format was mostly popular with [[Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital]] (now [[Hewlett Packard]]) [[VAX]] computers running the [[OpenVMS]] operating system, and for a time with the Commodore [[Amiga]] community. {{Fact|date=January 2009}}

== Zoo features ==
Zoo archives can store multiple "generations" of a file; if files are added to an archive with the same pathname yet more recent date, if generations are enabled for the archive the older version(s) will be retained (with a semicolon and version number, similar to version numbers in the VMS and RT-11 operating systems) as the new file is added. This allows files that are frequently modified to be backed up in such a way as to allow access to previous versions (up to the '''version limit''' chosen) from one archive.
