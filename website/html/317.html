The '''AD-AS''' or '''Aggregate Demand-Aggregate Supply model''' is a [[macroeconomic model]] that explains [[price level]] and [[output (economics)|output]] through the relationship of [[aggregate demand]] and [[aggregate supply]]. It is based on the theory of [[John Maynard Keynes]] presented in his work ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money]]''. One of the primary simplified representations in the modern field of [[macroeconomics]], and is used by a broad array of economists, from [[libertarian]], [[Monetarist]] supporters of [[laissez-faire]], such as [[Milton Friedman]] to [[Post-Keynesian economics|Post-Keynesian]] supporters of [[economic interventionism]], such as [[Joan Robinson]].

==Modeling==
The AD/AS model is used to illustrate the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] model of the [[business cycle]]. Movements of the two curves can be used to predict the effects that various [[exogeny|exogenous]] events will have on two variables:  real [[GDP]] and the [[price level]].  Furthermore, the model can be incorporated as a component in any of a variety of dynamic models (models of how variables like the price level and others evolve over time).  The AD-AS model can be related to the [[Phillips curve]] model of wage or price inflation and unemployment.

==Aggregate demand curve==
{{main|Aggregate Demand}}
The AD curve is defined by the IS-LM equilibrium income at different potential price levels. 
The equation for the AD curve in general terms is:

: <math>Y=Y^{d}(\tfrac{M}{P}, G, T, Z_1)</math>

where Y is real [[GDP]], M is the nominal [[money supply]], G is real [[government spending]], T is an exogenous component of real taxes levied, P is the [[price level]], and Z<sub>1</sub> is a vector of other exogenous variables that affect the location of the IS curve (exogenous influences on any component of spending) or the LM curve (exogenous influences on money demand).  The real money supply has a positive effect on aggregate demand, as does real government spending (meaning that when the independent variable changes in one direction, aggregate demand changes in the same direction); the exogenous component of taxes has a negative effect on it.

==Aggregate supply curve==
{{main|Aggregate supply}}
The aggregate supply curve may reflect either labor market disequilibrium or labor market equilibrium. In either case, it shows how much output is supplied by firms at various potential price levels.

The equation for the aggregate supply curve in general terms for the case of excess supply in the labor market, called the short-run aggregate supply curve, is  
:<math>Y=Y^{s}(W/P, \ \  P/P^{e}, \ \  Z_2)</math>

where W is the nominal wage rate (exogenous due to stickiness in the short run), P<sup>e</sup> is the anticipated (expected) price level, and Z<sub>2</sub> is a vector of exogenous variables that can affect the position of the labor demand curve (the capital stock or the current state of technological knowledge).  The real wage has a negative effect on firms' employment of labor and hence on aggregate supply.  The price level relative to its expected level has a positive effect on aggregate supply because of firms' mistakes in production plans due to mis-predictions of prices.

The long-run aggregate supply curve refers not to a time frame in which the capital stock is free to be set optimally (as would be the terminology in the micro-economic theory of the firm), but rather to a time frame in which wages are free to adjust in order to equilibrate the labor market and in which price anticipations are accurate.  In this case the nominal wage rate is endogenous and so does not appear as an independent variable in the aggregate supply equation.  The long-run aggregate supply equation is simply
:<math>Y=Y^{s}(Z_2)</math>

and is vertical at the full-employment level of output. In this long-run case, Z<sub>2</sub> also includes factors affecting the position of the labor supply curve (such as population), since in labor market equilibrium the location of labor supply affects the labor market outcome.

==Shifts of aggregate demand and aggregate supply==
The following summarizes the exogenous events that could shift the aggregate supply or aggregate demand curve to the right.  Of course, exogenous events happening in the opposite direction would shift the relevant curve in the opposite direction.

===Shifts of aggregate demand===
The following exogenous events would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right.  As a result, the price level would go up.  In addition if the time frame of analysis is the short run, so the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping rather than vertical, real output would go up; but in the long run with aggregate supply vertical at full employment, real output would remain unchanged.

Aggregate demand shifts emanating from the IS curve:
* An exogenous increase in consumer spending
* An exogenous increase in investment  spending on [[physical capital]]
* An exogenous increase in intended inventory investment 
* An exogenous increase in government spending on goods and services
* An exogenous increase in [[transfer payments]] from the government to the people
* An exogenous decrease in taxes levied
* An exogenous increase in purchases of the country's exports by people in other countries
* An exogenous decrease in imports from other countries

Aggregate demand shifts emanating from the LM curve:
* An exogenous increase in the nominal money supply
* An exogenous decrease in the demand for money (in liquidity preference)

===Shifts of aggregate supply===
The following exogenous events would shift the short-run aggregate supply curve to the right.  As a result, the price level would drop and real GDP would increase.
* An exogenous decrease in the wage rate
* An increase in the physical capital stock
* Technological progress &mdash; improvements in our knowledge of how to transform capital and labor into output

The following events would shift the long-run aggregate supply curve to the right:
* An increase in population
* An increase in the physical capital stock
* Technological progress
