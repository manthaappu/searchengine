'''Swarm robotics''' is a new approach to the coordination of [[multirobot system]]s which consist of large numbers of mostly simple physical [[robot]]s. It is supposed that a desired [[collective behavior]] emerges from the interactions between the robots and interactions of robots with [[Environment (biophysical)|the environment]]. This approach emerged on the field of artificial swarm intelligence, as well as the biological studies of insects, ants and other fields in nature, where [[swarm behaviour]] occurs.

== Definition ==

The research of swarm robotics is to study the design of robots, their physical body and their controlling [[behavior]]s. It is inspired but not limited by the [[emergent behavior]] observed in [[social insect]]s, called [[swarm intelligence]]. Relatively simple individual rules can produce a large set of complex [[swarm behavior]]s. A key-component is the communication between the members of the group that build a system of constant feedback. The swarm behavior involves constant change of individuals in cooperation with others, as well as the behavior of the whole group.

Unlike [[distributed robotic system]]s in general, swarm robotics emphasizes a ''large'' number of robots, and promotes [[scalability]], for instance by using only local communication. That local communication for example can be achieved by [[wireless]] transmission systems, like [[radio frequency]] or [[infrared]].

[[Video tracking]] is an essential tool for systematically studying swarm-behavior, even though other tracking methods are available. Recently [[Bristol robotics laboratory]] developed an ultrasonic position tracking system for swarm research purposes. Further research is needed to find methodologies that allow the design and reliable prediction of swarm behavior when only the features of the individual swarm members are given.

== Goals and applications ==
Both miniaturization and cost are key-factors in swarm robotics. These are the constraints in building large groups of robotics; therefore the simplicity of the individual team member should be emphasized. This should motivate a swarm-intelligent approach to achieve meaningful behavior at swarm-level, instead of the individual level.

Potential applications for swarm robotics include tasks that demand for [[miniaturization]] ([[nanorobotics]], [[microbotics]]), like distributed sensing tasks in [[micromachinery]] or the [[human body]]. On the other hand swarm robotics can be suited to tasks that demand cheap designs, for instance [[mining]] tasks or agricultural [[foraging]] tasks. Also some artists use swarm robotic techniques to realize new forms of [[interactive art]].
