'''Dreamwidth''' is an online journal service based on the [[LiveJournal]] code.  It is a [[code fork]] of the original service, set up by ex-LiveJournal staff<ref>[http://www.dreamwidth.org/site/staff Dreamwidth: Our People]</ref> Denise Paolucci and Mark Smith, born out of a desire for a new community based on open access, transparency, freedom and respect.<ref>[http://www.dreamwidth.org/legal/principles Dreamwidth Guiding Principles]</ref>  Their [http://www.dreamwidth.org/legal/diversity diversity statement] has been widely praised for its inclusivity.<ref>[http://sofiaviolet.dreamwidth.org/325660.html?format=light sofiaviolet: In which I extend a metaphor so far it squeaks.]</ref><ref>[http://zevinboots.livejournal.com/146212.html?format=light zevinboots: Dreamwidth.org (please feel free to repost)]</ref>

Dreamwidth was announced on 11 June 2008<ref>[http://synecdochic.livejournal.com/226141.html?format=light synecdochic: Announcing Dreamwidth Studios. Coming Summer 2008.]</ref> and went into open [[Beta_version#Beta|beta]] on 30 April 2009.<ref>[http://dw-news.dreamwidth.org/5035.html dw_news: Welcome to Dreamwidth Studios!]</ref>

== Features ==
For the most part, features are similar to those of [[LiveJournal]]: users have journals, where they may post entries, each of which has a webpage of its own, and on which other users may comment.  Dreamwidth also provides shared or group journals called "communities".

Areas in which Dreamwidth differs significantly from Livejournal include the following:

==== Accounts ====
Free accounts may only be created with an invite code, and have limited features.  Paid accounts exist on two levels, "Paid" and "Premium Paid", and have additional features.<ref>[http://www.dreamwidth.org/support/faqbrowse?faqid=4 FAQ: What are paid accounts?]</ref>  At the time of the open beta launch, a limited number of Seed Accounts were also available.

==== User relationships ====
In response to criticisms of LiveJournal's [[LiveJournal#The_word_.22friend.22|friending]] system, Dreamwidth has split user relationships into two parts: subscriptions and access control.  Users may subscribe to other users' journals, or grant access for other users to read locked entries, as separate actions.  Dreamwidth's terminology reflects this split: for instance the "friends page" has been renamed as "reading page", and "custom friends groups" has been split into "access filters" and "reading filters".

==== Interoperability ====
Dreamwidth provides greater interoperability with other Livejournal-based sites, including the ability to import a journal from another site, crosspost to multiple sites, and greater functionality for users who log in via [[OpenID]].

==== Search ====
In addition to the search facilities brought over from LiveJournal, paid account users can [http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/search search their journal].  This was introduced on 24 July 2009.<ref>[http://dw-news.dreamwidth.org/9221.html dw_news: mid-week surprise feature rollout]</ref>

=== Missing features ===
The following features, available on LiveJournal, are not available on Dreamwidth<ref>[http://www.dreamwidth.org/support/faqbrowse?faqid=131 If you're coming from LiveJournal to Dreamwidth: What's Missing?]</ref>:

* picture hosting
* voice posting
* S1 style system
* to-do lists

== Development ==
Dreamwidth is based upon the [[free software|free]] and [[open source software|open source]]<ref>[http://www.livejournal.com/code/ LiveJournal Code]</ref> [[Server (computing)|server]] [[software]] that was designed to run LiveJournal.  It is written primarily in [[Perl]]. The majority of the Dreamwidth code is available under the [[GNU Public License|GPL]] for other sites to use.<ref>[http://hg.dwscoalition.org/ Dreamwidth repositories]</ref>

Unlike many other social networking sites using the LiveJournal codebase, such as InsaneJournal and DeadJournal, Dreamwidth is a [[code fork]], removing unwanted features (such as advertising) and adding new ones as described above. Founders of the site rejected the advertising model as intrusive. Instead, they implemented a payment system, where users can purchase add-on or premium features.<ref>Renee Montagne, Laura Sydell, ''et al''.

Retrieved December 6, 2009.</ref>

A 2009 [[O'Reilly Open Source Convention|OSCON]] presentation saw Dreamwidth identified as highly unusual among open source projects, for the number of women on its development team. About 75% of its developers are female,<ref>Krill, Paul. "[http://www.infoworld.com/d/open-source/microsoft-maintains-openness-push-539?page=0,1 Microsoft maintains openness push]". ''[[InfoWorld]]''. July 23, 2009.

Dreamwidth was accepted as a [[Google Summer of Code|GSoC]] mentoring organization for the summer of 2010.<ref>[http://dw-dev.dreamwidth.org/42626.html Welcome, Google Summer of Code students!]</ref> They were allotted seven students, who worked on a variety of projects.<ref>[http://dw-dev.dreamwidth.org/56125.html GSoC Results]</ref>

== Staff ==
Athena, also known as Afuna or fu was introduced as the site's first paid employee on April 7, 2010.<ref>[http://dw-news.dreamwidth.org/19375.html Update, April 5, 2010]</ref>  On September 7, 2010, Mark Smith announced that he had stepped back from Dreamwidth's front line<ref>[http://mark.dreamwidth.org/21501.html The State of Mark: Dreamwidth]</ref> and moved to work for [[StumbleUpon]].<ref>[http://xb95.dreamwidth.org/711972.html The State of Mark: StumbleUpon]</ref>  He is still an owner of Dreamwidth along with Denise, however.<ref>[http://www.dreamwidth.org/site/staff Dreamwidth: Our People]</ref>

== Influence ==
Following the positive reactions to Dreamwidth's diversity statement and model of inclusiveness, various other projects have followed suit, including [http://wiki.python.org/moin/DiversityInPython Python's diversity list] and [http://www.dreamfish.com/pg/pages/url/humanifesto Dreamfish].
