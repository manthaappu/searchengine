'''PC Tools''' was a collection of [[utility software|software utilities]] developed by [[Central Point Software]]. 

== History of development ==

The original PC Tools package was first developed as a suite of utilities for [[DOS]], released for retail in 1986 for $39<ref name="sn">{{cite journal|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/technology/computer-software/118122-1.html|title=Anatomy of a price increase|work=Soft-Letter|date=August 20 1990}}</ref> 

With the introduction of version 4.0, the name was changed to '''PC Tools Deluxe''', and the primary interface became a colorful graphical DOS shell (previously the DOS shell resembled PC BOSS and was monochrome.) By version 7.0 of the package in 1991 several [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] programs had been added to it.  

Though the 7.0 version sold well, it was criticised in computer trade publications for being overly complicated and riddled with bugs.  It was widely considered to have been rushed to publication, despite the objections of many of Central Point Software's employees. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}  PC Tools Version 9.x for DOS was the last stable release.

In June 1994 Central Point was acquired by their top competitor [[Symantec]] who ultimately discontinued the product line. PC Tools was the main competitor to [[Norton Utilities]], which Symantec had acquired in 1990.  

Symantec now uses the PC Tools brand name&mdash;acquired from an Australian security vendor in 2008<ref>PC World, [http://www.pcworld.com/article/150227/symantec_buys_pc_tools.html Symantec buys PC Tools]</ref>&mdash;for low-cost antivirus and antispyware software<ref>[http://www.pctools.com/]</ref>
