The '''Government Accountability Office''' ('''GAO''') is the [[audit]], [[evaluation]], and investigative arm of the [[United States Congress]].  It is located in the legislative branch of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]].

The GAO was established as the '''General Accounting Office''' by the [[Budget and Accounting Act of 1921]]. This Act required the head of GAO to "investigate, at the seat of government or elsewhere, all matters relating to the receipt, disbursement, and application of public funds, and shall make to the President...and to Congress...reports (and) recommendations looking to greater economy or efficiency in public expenditures" (Sec. 312(a), {{USStat|42|25}}). According to GAO's current mission statement, the agency exists to support the Congress in meeting its [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] responsibilities and to help improve the [[performance]] and ensure the [[accountability]] of the federal government for the benefit of the American people. The name was changed in 2004 to better reflect the mission of the office.<ref>[http://www.gao.gov/about/rollcall07192004.pdf GAO.gov]</ref> While most other countries have government entities similar to the GAO, their focus is primarily on conducting financial audits. The GAO's auditors conduct not only financial audits, but also engage in a wide assortment of performance audits.

The GAO is headed by the [[Comptroller General of the United States]], a professional and non-partisan position in the U.S. government.  The Comptroller General is appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]], by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, for a 15-year, non-renewable term.  The President selects a nominee from a list of at least three individuals recommended by an eight member bipartisan, bicameral commission of congressional leaders.  The Comptroller General may not be removed by the President, but only by Congress through impeachment or joint resolution for specific reasons.<ref>''See [[Bowsher v. Synar]]'', 478 U.S. 714 (1986)</ref>  Since 1921, there have been only seven Comptrollers General, and no formal attempt has ever been made to remove a Comptroller General.  According to the GAO website, "the long tenure of the Comptroller General gives GAO a continuity of leadership that is rare within government."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/about/workforce/ |title=Our Workforce |date=December 17, 2007 |work=U.S. Government Accountability Office |publisher=U.S. GAO |accessdate=September 28, 2010}}</ref>

==Reports==
Each year the GAO issues an audit report on the financial statements of the United States Government. The '''2010 Financial Report of the United States Government''' was released on 21 December 2010.<ref name="GaO 2010">{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/press/financial_report_2010dec21.html |title=Press Release |publisher=US Government Accountability Office |accessdate=8 January 2011}}</ref> The accompanying press release states that the GAO 'cannot render an opinion on the 2010 consolidated financial statements of the federal government, because of widespread material internal control weaknesses, significant uncertainties, and other limitations'.<ref name="GaO 2010"/>
