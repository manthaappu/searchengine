The '''Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia''' (CAADRIA)<ref>[http://www.caadria.org Homepage of CAADRIA (Association for Computer Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia)]</ref> (founded in 1996) provides a platform for [[CAAD]]-related academics and professionals to share experiences, best practices, and results in education and research in Asia and beyond. 

== Objectives ==

The Association has been created with several objectives. It aims to facilitate dissemination of information about CAAD amongst Asian Schools of Architecture, Planning, Engineering, & Building Sciences in Asia, and encourage the exchange of software, courseware, experiences and staff/students amongst schools. It conducts several activities to identify research and development needs specific to CAAD education and initiate collaboration to satisfy them, and promote research and teaching in CAAD which enhances creativity rather than simply production technologies.

== Organisation ==
=== Membership ===

Membership to the association is open to individuals (teachers, researchers, students, and architects) and institutions (universities, libraries), either as active member (someone who attends the conference) or as sponsor member. Typically, one becomes an individual member through attending and registering at a CAADRIA conference, or by applying for membership to the secretariat. Institutions in Asia, Australia and New Zealand can apply for institutioanl membership and gain access to CumInCAD database.

Membership lasts for one year, and gives access to digital proceedings of CAADRIA, email announcements of forthcoming events of interest and one vote at the Annual General Meeting of CAADRIA.

=== Executive Committee ===

CAADRIA is governed by an Administrative Council elected by the membership. Responsibility for organisation, administration and guidance of the association is delegated to the Executive Committee by virtue of the election of the officers. Membership of the Council is restricted to members working in countries within the Asia Pacific region; term of office is two years. There is an annual general meeting (normally convened during the annual conference) at which the business of the association is agreed by the membership. This forum is considered the highest level of authority and shall be the only one with the power to amend the charter of CAADRIA.

=== Secretariat ===

The Secretariat is composed of volunteer staff, with a limited budget being made available through membership dues and supervised by the Executive Committee.

=== List of Conferences ===

The annual conference is the main event organised under the auspices of the association. It is organised by a member in good standing, who volunteers for the organisation. The organiser is supported by members of the administrative council, in particular the conference liaison. Over the years, the association has developed the policy to circulate the conference location in such a way that southern, eastern, western, and northern parts of Europe are reached regularly – although this principle can only be maintained on the basis of available organisers. In the past years, the following CAADRIA conferences have been organised:
