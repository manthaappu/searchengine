<html> <head> <title>One-key MAC</title></head><body>'''OMAC (One-key MAC)''' is a [[message authentication code]] constructed from a [[block cipher]] much like the [[PMAC (cryptography)|PMAC]] algorithm.  

Officially there are two OMAC algorithms (OMAC1 and OMAC2) which are both essentially the same except for a small tweak.  
OMAC1 is equivalent to [[CMAC]] which became an [[NIST]] recommendation in May 2005.

It is free for all uses (no patents).
