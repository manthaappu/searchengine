'''RDOS''' ('''''R'''eal-time '''D'''isk '''O'''perating '''S'''ystem'') was a [[Real-time operating system|real-time]] [[operating system]] released in 1972<ref name="OShist">[http://www.oshistory.net/metadot/index.pl?id=2325;isa=Category;op=show OS History - Data General]</ref> for the popular [[Data General]] [[Data General Nova|Nova]] and [[Data General Eclipse|Eclipse]] [[minicomputer]]s. RDOS was capable of [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]], with the ability to run up to 32 "tasks" (similar to [[Thread (computer science)|threads]] on modern computer CPUs) simultaneously on each of two [[Process (computing)|grounds]] (foreground and background) within a 64K memory space. Later versions of RDOS were compatible with Data General's [[16-bit]] Eclipse minicomputer line.

A cut-down version of RDOS, without real-time background and foreground capability, was called Data General Diskette Operating System (DG-DOS); another related operating system was RTOS, a Real-Time Operating System for diskless environments.  RDOS on [[Data General Nova#microNOVA|microNOVA]]-based "Micro Products" micro-minicomputers was sometimes called DG/RDOS.  

RDOS was superseded in the early 1980s by Data General's [[Data General AOS|AOS]] family of operating systems, including AOS/VS and MP/AOS (MP/OS on smaller systems).
