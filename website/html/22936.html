<html> <head> <title>MIC-1</title></head><body>The '''MIC-1''' is a [[Central Processing Unit|processor]] architecture invented by [[Andrew S. Tanenbaum]] to use as a simple but complete example in his teaching book ''Structured Computer Organization''.

It consists of a very simple [[control unit]] that runs [[microcode]] from a 512-words store.

The microcode language (MAL) is engineered to allow simple writing of an [[IJVM]] [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]], and the [[source code]] for such an interpreter can be found in the book.
