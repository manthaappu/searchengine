<html> <head> <title>Moral graph</title></head><body>A '''moral graph''' is a concept in [[graph theory]], used to find the equivalent undirected form of a [[directed acyclic graph]]. It is a key step of the [[junction tree algorithm]], used in [[belief propagation]] on [[graphical models]].

The '''moralized''' counterpart of a directed acyclic graph is formed by connecting nodes that have a common child, and then making all edges in the graph undirected. The name stems from the fact the two nodes that have a common child are said to be ''married''. Equivalently, a moral graph of a directed acyclic graph ''G'' is an undirected graph in which each node of the original ''G'' is now connected to its [[Markov blanket]].
