<html> <head> <title>Robert Bruce Findler</title></head><body>'''Robert Bruce Findler''', colloquially known as "Robby", is a computer scientist, currently teaching at the [[Northwestern University]]. He is also a member of [[PLT Scheme|PLT]] and, as such, responsible for the creation and maintenance of [[DrRacket]]. In addition to [[DrRacket]], Findler has contributed numerous components to [[Racket]] and supervises its Web-based software library, called PLaneT. Findler is also a leading team member of the [[TeachScheme!]] project. 

Findler received his PhD at [[Rice University]] under the direction of [[Matthias Felleisen]]. His dissertation is on the linguistics of software contracts, popularly known as [[design by contract]]. His main contribution to software contracts is a more careful accounting of blame, thereby helping quickly programmers home in on the faulty part of a software system.

In addition to DrRacket and software contracts, Findler focuses on the design and implementation of a workbench for semantics engineers. This workbench, called Redex, is a tool for specifying and executing the reduction semantics of a [[programming language]]. It is already widely used by programming language researchers in the US and Europe. Most recently, SUN's [[Fortress (programming language)|Fortress]] research team used Redex to specify and explore key parts of their language.

Findler served as the semantics editor of the Revised^6 Report on the [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] programming language. He and his PhD student Jacob Matthews have developed a Redex model of the core semantics, which is included as an appendix of the report.  The appendix plays the same role as [[ML (programming language)|ML]]'s formal specification (Milner, Tofte, Harper) but is executable and thus visualize individual examples.
