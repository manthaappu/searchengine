<html> <head> <title>Computational magnetohydrodynamics</title></head><body>'''Computational magnetohydrodynamics (CMHD)''' is a rapidly developing branch of [[magnetohydrodynamics]] that uses [[numerical method]]s and algorithms to solve and analyze problems that involve electrically conducting fluids. Most of the methods used in CMHD are borrowed from the well established techniques employed in [[Computational fluid dynamics]]. The complexity mainly arises due to the presence of a [[magnetic field]] and its coupling with the fluid. One of the important issues is to numerically maintain the <math> \nabla \cdot {\mathbf B} = 0</math> (conservation of magnetic flux) condition, from [[Maxwell's equations]], to avoid any unphysical effects.
