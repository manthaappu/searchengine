A '''measuring cup''' is a [[List of food preparation utensils|kitchen utensil]] used primarily to measure the [[volume]] of liquid or bulk solid [[cooking]] ingredients such as flour and sugar, especially for volumes from about 50 [[millilitre|mL]] (2 [[fluid ounce|fl oz]]) upwards. The cup will usually have a scale marked in cups and fractions of a cup, and often with fluid measure and weight of a selection of dry foodstuffs. Measuring cups are also used to measure washing powder, liquid detergents or bleach, usually with a measuring cup not also used for food. 

Measuring cups may be made of [[plastic]], glass, or metal. Maximum capacity usually ranges from 
0.2 to 1 litre, though larger sizes are also available (for commercial use). Smaller [[measuring spoon]]s lack a scale and are filled and leveled to maximum capacity. Its mostly used to measure things such as flour, water, or any type of liquid.

==Capacity and scale==
Measuring cups usually have capacities from 250 (approx. 1 [[cup (volume)|cup]]) to 1000 mL (approx. 4 cups = 2 pints = 1 quart), though larger sizes are also available (for commercial use). They usually have scale markings at different heights: the substance being measured is added to the cup until it reaches the wanted level. Dry measure cups without a scale are sometimes used, in sets typically of 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, and 1 cup. [[Transparent materials|Transparent or translucent]] cups can be read from an external scale; metal ones only from a scale marked on the inside. There are different types of measuring cups, such as glass or/and plastic

The units may be millilitres or fractions of a litre, or (especially in the United States and Australia{{Fact|date=December 2007}}) the [[cup (unit)|cup]] and its fractions (typically 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, and 3/4), [[pint]]s, and sometimes fluid ounces.  Sometimes multiples of [[teaspoon]]s and [[tablespoon]]s are included. There may also be scales for the approximate weight for particular substances, such as flour and sugar.
There are eight ounces in one cup (American measurement).

Many dry ingredients, such as granulated sugar, are not very [[compressibility|compressible]], so volume measures are consistent.  Others, notably flour, are more variable. For example, 1 cup of all-purpose flour sifted into a cup and levelled weighs about 100 grams, whereas 1 cup of all-purpose flour scooped from its container and levelled weighs about 140 grams.<ref>Julia Child and Simone Beck, [[Mastering the Art of French Cooking]], vol. 2, p. 544.</ref>

Using a measuring cup to measure bulk foods which can be compressed to a variable degree such as chopped vegetables or shredded cheese leads to large measurement uncertainties. It is easier to chop down the units for a better measure.
