<html> <head> <title>Institute of Marine Engineering, Science and Technology</title></head><body>The '''Institute of Marine Engineering Science and Technology''' (IMarEST) is the international membership body and learned society for all marine professionals, operating in spheres of [[marine engineering]], [[marine science|science]] or technology. It has registered charity status in the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] and is the first professional institution to bring together marine engineers, scientists and technologists into one international multi-disciplinary professional body. It is the largest marine organisation of its kind with a worldwide membership of over 15,000 individuals based in over 100 countries.

The institute is also a publisher of [[books]], [[periodicals]], [[magazines]], [[Academic journal|journals]] and [[Academic publishing|papers]] related to marine engineering, science and technology, and organizes meetings, events and [[Academic conference|conferences]] related to these themes.  The IMarEST is also the home of the Marine Information Centre, a dedicated collection of books and data related to marine science, engineering and technology.  The institute is also the home of the Guild of Benevolence of the IMarEST, which continues the work of the fund founded for the families of the engineers of the [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]], and which today provides help and funds for those sea-farers and others who find themselves in hard times.
