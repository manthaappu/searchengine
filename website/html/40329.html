'''Windows Product Activation''' is a license validation procedure used by [[Microsoft Corporation]] in all versions of its [[Windows]] [[proprietary software|proprietary]] [[software]] operating system from [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] onwards. It is used to enforce the Windows [[EULA|End User License Agreement]] by preventing or hampering the use of the operating system after a specific period of time until it is verified as genuine by Microsoft.<ref name="QSAA" /><ref name="XP" /><ref name="7A" /><ref name="VWS2008" /><ref name="WINSER2003" />

==Process==
===Before activation===

[[File:Vista Activation ProductKey.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Windows Vista]] activation wizard at the point where the product key must be entered]]

When installing Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows Server 2008]], or [[Windows 7]], the user inputs their license key given to them when the product was purchased, usually supplied on a [[Certificate of Authenticity]] enclosed with the product.<ref name="QSAA" /><ref name="XP" /><ref name="7A">{{cite web|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd979803.aspx#EDDAE |title=Windows Activation Technologies in Windows 7 |publisher=Technet.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref><ref name="VWS2008">{{cite web|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee355153.aspx |title=Volume Activation Technical Reference Guide |publisher=Technet.microsoft.com |date=2006-01-14 |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref><ref name="WINSER2003">{{cite web|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc756138%28WS.10%29.aspx |title=Windows Product Activation: Windows Product Activation (WPA) |publisher=Technet.microsoft.com |date=2005-01-21 |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref>

===During activation===
After installation, the user is notified of the requirement to activate their product within 30 days<ref name="XP">{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307890 |title=How to activate Windows XP |publisher=Support.microsoft.com |date=2007-05-07 |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref><ref name="WVAQ">{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/uk/windows/products/windowsvista/buyorupgrade/activationfaq.mspx |title=Windows Vista Activation FAQ |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref> (60 days for Windows Server 2008).<ref name="WS2008A" /> Users can also set Windows Vista to activate automatically after three days.<ref name="QSAA" />

Activation is performed with a utility supplied with Windows.<ref name="QSAA" /> It can be performed using one of three ways:
*Over the [[Internet]]<ref name="QSAA" /><ref name="XP" />
*Through a telephone call to a Microsoft agent<ref name="QSAA" /><ref name="XP" />
*Using a modem and creating a connection through the phone line<ref name="XP" />

For activation over the Internet, the utility transmits data using an Internet connection.<ref name="QSAA" /><ref name="XP" /> For activation via a telephone call, a longer telephone activation code must be read to the Microsoft agent who supplies a code to input into the utility to activate Windows.<ref name="QSAA" /><ref name="XP" /> For activation using a modem, the utility sends data to the activation center using a phone line accessed through the modem.<ref name="XP" />

[[File:Slui4.png|thumb|right|The [[Windows Server 2008]] activation wizard when the "over-the-phone" option is selected]]

In each of the three cases, the utility checks and records information on eight different categories of hardware:<ref name="aumha">{{cite web|url=http://www.aumha.org/win5/a/wpa.php |title=Windows Product Activation (WPA) on Windows XP |publisher=Aumha.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref><ref name="geekgirls">{{cite web |url=http://www.geekgirls.com/windowsxp_activate.htm |title=Windows Product Activation |author=Vines, Rose |publisher=Geekgirl |accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref>
* Display Adapter
* SCSI Adapter
* IDE Adapter
* Network Adapter (including the MAC Address)
* RAM Amount Range (e.g., 0&ndash;512 MB)
* Processor Type and Serial Number
* Hard Drive Device and Volume Serial Number
* Optical Drive (e.g., CD-ROM)

A code based on this information is calculated and stored on the computer's hard drive. This is then sent to Microsoft, together with the Product ID number derived from the 25-character unique Product Key used in the installation of Windows.<ref name="geekgirls" /> In Windows XP Service Pack 1 and onwards, the entire Product Key is also transmitted so that can then be checked against a list of known pirated keys.<ref name="Pirat" />

===After activation===

[[File:Vista Activation Reduced Funct.png|thumb|right|[[Windows Vista]] in reduced functionality mode]]

If activation is completed successfully, the user can continue to use the operating system without any impediments or other problems.<ref name="QSAA" />

If activation either is not performed within 30 days of the installation of the operating system (or if the system clock is changed after Windows is installed), or fails because of an invalid license key, then a number of different things can occur, depending on the operating system. Windows Server 2003, the system cannot be used whatsoever until it is activated.<ref name="XP" /> In Windows XP, the user will receive pop-up notices telling the user that they need to activate.<ref name="geekgirls" /> On Windows Vista (without a service pack) the system will boot only into a reduced functionality mode, allowing data to be retrieved from the system's hard disk but making it very difficult to run any other software or use operating system enhancements until Windows is properly activated.<ref name="QSAA">{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/quick-start/activation.aspx |title=Quick start: Activation |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref> From Windows Vista SP1 onwards and Windows 7, the system will add a text message stating that the copy of Windows in question is not valid, reset the desktop background to black every hour and give periodic notifications to activate the operating system.<ref name="QSAA" /><ref name="7A" /> In addition, Windows Server 2008 users can only download critical updates from [[Windows Update]].<ref name="WS2008A" /><ref name="WS2008B" />

When activation is performed, Windows saves a record of the hardware in the user's machine.  If the system is booted up with significant hardware changes (such as replacing the motherboard or the hard disk or memory at the same time<ref name="WVAQ" />), Windows will require immediate reactivation to prevent the possibility that the same copy of the operating system has been installed on two different systems.<ref name="WVAQ" /> However, from Windows XP Service Pack 1 onwards, the user is given a three day grace period to reactivate in this particular case.<ref name="Pirat">{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/norge/piracy/activation_xpsp1.mspx |title=Microsoft Product Activation: Windows XP SP1 Product Activation Details - Piratvirksomhet |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref> Windows XP allows you to modify six pieces of hardware or the [[Network Card]] and three other pieces of hardware.<ref name="geekgirls" />

==Windows versions with activation==

[[File:Windows Vista Activation Restriction.jpg|thumb|right|Copies of [[Windows Vista]] Home Premium and [[Windows 7]] Home Basic with geographical activation restrictions]]

All end users of the Windows operating system from [[Windows XP]] onwards (with the exception of Windows XP corporate or volume licensing users) must go through the activation process.<ref name="QSAA" /><ref name="XP" /><ref name="7A" /><ref name="VWS2008" /><ref name="WINSER2003" /><ref name="VOLL">{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/licensing/existing-customers/product-activation.aspx |title=Microsoft Volume Licensing - Product Activation |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref> In addition, corporations have the option of setting up their own activation servers, which will activate a certain number of installations without needing to connect to Microsoft.<ref name="WVAQ" />

Copies of [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]] sold in certain countries classified as [[emerging markets]] are imposed with geographical activation restrictions, which only allow the user to activate the product within the indicated region.<ref name="ECAR">{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/vista/LocationByRegion.aspx?displaylang=en&cCode=USA&sGuid=8f3c1d72-fbb0-47a2-9417-8690a21fd06a&PartnerID=4 |title=Eligible Countries for regionally restricted versions of Windows Vista |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref> For example, products sold in Indonesia may be activated only within Indonesian territory or South-East Asian territory, depending on the label.

If Windows XP, Vista or 7 is preinstalled on a computer that was made by an [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] vendor, it is not necessary to activate.<ref name="aumha"/> These installation images do not use the product key listed on the COA sticker on the machine. Rather, it uses a master product key called a [[System Locked Preinstallation]] (SLP) key which ties the activation to the machine's manufacturer name as defined in the motherboard's [[Desktop Management Interface|DMI]] pool.<ref name="aumha"/><ref name="XPV">{{cite web|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb457054.aspx |title=Technical Details on Microsoft Product Activation for Windows XP |publisher=Technet.microsoft.com |date=2001-08-13 |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref> This ensures that the activation will only remain valid on motherboards which were supplied by that OEM.

==Criticism==
Reports that Windows Product Activation has been cracked have surfaced. For example, [[Windows 7]] has a flaw that can allow a user to bypass product activation.<ref name="scmag">{{cite web|url=http://www.scmagazineuk.com/product-activation-system-flaw-found-in-windows-7-follows-earlier-server-message-block-problem/article/157881/ |title=Product activation system flaw found in Windows 7 follows earlier server message block problem |publisher=SC Magazine UK |date=2009-11-17 |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref> Windows Product activation has been cracked on [[Windows XP|XP]] in the summer of 2005, [[Windows Vista|Vista]] in January 2007, and Windows 7 in November 2009.<ref name="scmag" /> RemoveWAT and Chew-WGA are pieces of software that attempt to get around product activation.<ref name="tth">{{cite web |last1=Wray |first1=James |last2=Stabe |first2=Ulf |url=http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/200947/4805/Windows-7-activation-crack-comes-as-no-surprise |title=Windows 7 activation crack comes as no surprise - Security |publisher=Thetechherald.com |date=2009-11-17 |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref>  Back in 2001 with the Beta testing of Windows XP, [[Microsoft]] had a hard time getting users to support product activation.<ref name="register">{{cite web |author=Lettice, John |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/03/20/winxp_beta_testers_still/ |title=WinXP beta testers still in open revolt over product activation |date=2001-03-20 |accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref> Microsoft has also found a problem with releasing the activation codes to OEM businesses, because they are uploading it to the internet, and providing the key to other people, with the software to download.<ref name="betanews">{{cite web |url=http://www.betanews.com/article/print/Microsoft-No-Activation-Changes-Until-Longhorn/1049776744 |title=Microsoft: No Activation Changes Until Longhorn |publisher=Betanews |date= |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref> 95 percent of the illegal Windows XP installations were due to leaked keys.<ref name="betanews" />
