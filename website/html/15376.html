The '''Global Positioning System''' ('''GPS''') is a space-based [[global navigation satellite system]] (GNSS) that provides reliable [[Positioning system|location]] and time information in all weather and at all times and anywhere on or near the Earth when and where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites. It is maintained by the [[United States]] government and is freely accessible by anyone with a GPS receiver.

GPS was created and realized by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (USDOD) and was originally run with 24 satellites. It was established in 1973 to overcome the limitations of previous navigation systems.<ref>{{cite book

In addition to GPS other systems are in use or under development. The Russian GLObal NAvigation Satellite System ([[GLONASS]]) was for use by the Russian military only until 2007. There are also the planned Chinese [[Compass navigation system]] and [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo positioning system]] of the European Union (EU).

== History ==
{{double image|right|NAVSTAR GPS logo shield-official.jpg|90|50th Space Wing.png|90}}

The design of GPS is based partly on similar ground-based radio navigation systems, such as [[LORAN]] and the [[Decca Navigator System|Decca Navigator]] developed in the early 1940s, and used during [[World War II]]. In 1956 [[Friedwardt Winterberg]]<ref>''Astronautica Acta II,'' 25 (1956)</ref> proposed a test of [[general relativity]] using accurate [[atomic clock]]s placed in orbit in artificial satellites. To achieve accuracy requirements, GPS uses principles of general relativity to correct the satellites' atomic clocks. Additional inspiration for GPS came when the [[Soviet Union]] launched the first man-made satellite, [[Sputnik program|Sputnik]] in 1957. A team of U.S. scientists led by Dr. Richard B. Kershner were monitoring Sputnik's radio transmissions. They discovered that, because of the [[Doppler effect]], the frequency of the signal being transmitted by Sputnik was higher as the satellite approached, and lower as it continued away from them. They realized that because they knew their exact location on the globe, they could pinpoint where the satellite was along its orbit by measuring the Doppler distortion (see [[Transit (satellite)]]).<!-- The converse is also true: if the satellite's position were known, they could identify their own position on Earth. (commented because I am not sure of this.  At most, they would know the rate that the distance between themselves and the satellite was changing.  There would be at least two points (one each north and south of the equator) where that condition would be true.  As a practical matter, one would not get an exact position, especially with 1950s electronics, even if one knew the satellite's exact orbit, and the exact time -->

The first satellite navigation system, [[Transit (satellite)|Transit]], used by the [[United States Navy]], was first successfully tested in 1960. It used a constellation of five satellites and could provide a navigational fix approximately once per hour. In 1967, the U.S. Navy developed the [[Timation]] satellite that proved the ability to place accurate clocks in space, a technology required by GPS. In the 1970s, the ground-based [[Omega Navigation System]], based on phase comparison of signal transmission from pairs of stations,<ref>{{cite web|author=Jerry Proc |url=http://www.jproc.ca/hyperbolic/omega.html |title=Omega |publisher=Jproc.ca |date= |accessdate=2009-12-08}}</ref> became the first worldwide radio navigation system. Limitations of these systems drove the need for a more universal navigation solution with greater accuracy.

While there were wide needs for accurate navigation in military and civilian sectors, almost none of those were seen as justification for the billions of dollars it would cost in research, development, deployment, and operation for a constellation of navigation satellites. During the [[Cold War]] [[arms race]], the nuclear threat to the existence of the United States was the one need that did justify this cost in the view of the US Congress. This deterrent effect is why GPS was funded. The [[nuclear triad]] consisted of the US Navy's [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s (SLBMs) along with the US Air Force's strategic bombers and [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs). Considered vital to the [[nuclear deterrence]] posture, accurate determination of the SLBM launch position was a [[force multiplier]].

Precise navigation would enable US submarines to get an accurate fix of their positions prior to launching their SLBMs.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.trimble.com/gps/whygps.shtml#0|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071018151253/http://www.trimble.com/gps/whygps.shtml#0|archivedate= 2007-10-18 |title=Why Did the Department of Defense Develop GPS? |publisher=Trimble Navigation Ltd |date= |accessdate=2010-01-13}}</ref> The US Air Force with two-thirds of the nuclear triad also had requirements for a more accurate and reliable navigation system. The Navy and Air Force were developing their own technologies in parallel to solve what was essentially the same problem. To increase the survivability of ICBMs, there was a proposal to use mobile launch platforms so the need to fix the launch position had similarity to the SLBM situation.

In 1960, the Air Force proposed a radio-navigation system called MOSAIC (Mobile System for Accurate ICBM Control) that was essentially a 3-D [[LORAN]]. A follow-on study called Project 57 was worked in 1963 and it was "in this study that the GPS concept was born." That same year the concept was pursued as Project 621B, which had "many of the attributes that you now see in GPS"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2002/01.html |title=Charting a Course Toward Global Navigation |publisher=The Aerospace Corporation |date= |accessdate=2010-01-14}}</ref> and promised increased accuracy for Air Force bombers as well as ICBMs. Updates from the Navy Transit system were too slow for the high speeds of Air Force operation. The Navy Research Laboratory continued advancements with their Timation (Time Navigation) satellites, first launched in 1967, and with the third one in 1974 carrying the first atomic clock into orbit.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://support.radioshack.com/support_tutorials/gps/gps_tmline.htm |title=A Guide To The Global Positioning System (GPS) - GPS Timeline |publisher=Radio Shack |date= |accessdate=2010-01-14}}</ref>

<!-- Another important predecessor to GPS came from a different branch of the US military. In 1964, the [[US Army]] orbited its first SECOR ([[Sequential Collation of Range]]) satellite used for geodetic surveying. The SECOR system included three ground-based transmitters from known locations that would send signals to the satellite transponder in orbit. A fourth ground-based station at an undetermined position could then use those signals to fix its location precisely. The last SECOR satellite was launched in 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.astronautix.com/craft/secor.htm |title=SECOR Chronology |work=Mark Wade's Encyclopedia Astronautica |date= |accessdate=2010-1-19}}</ref> Decades later during the early years of GPS, civilian surveying became one of the first fields to make use of the new technology, because they could reap benefits of signals from the less-than-complete GPS constellation years before it was declared operational. GPS can be thought of as an evolution of the SECOR system where the ground-based transmitters have been migrated into orbit. -->
With these parallel developments in the 1960s, it was realized that a superior system could be developed by synthesizing the best technologies from 621B, Transit, Timation, and SECOR in a multi-service program.

During Labor Day weekend in 1973, a meeting of about 12 military officers at the Pentagon discussed the creation of a ''Defense Navigation Satellite System (DNSS)''. It was at this meeting that "the real synthesis that became GPS was created." Later that year, the DNSS program was named ''Navstar''. With the individual satellites being associated with the name Navstar (as with the predecessors Transit and Timation), a more fully encompassing name was used to identify the constellation of Navstar satellites, ''Navstar-GPS'', which was later shortened simply to GPS.<ref> {{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/?id=mB9W3H90KDUC |title=The Precision Revolution: GPS and the Future of Aerial Warfare |author=Michael Russell Rip, James M. Hasik |publisher=Naval Institute Press |page=65 |year=2002 |isbn=1557509735 |accessdate=2010-01-14}} </ref>

After [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]], carrying 269 people, was shot down in 1983 after straying into the USSR's [[prohibited airspace]],<ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.icao.int/cgi/goto_m.pl?icao/en/trivia/kal_flight_007.htm |title=ICAO Completes Fact-Finding Investigation |publisher=International Civil Aviation Organization |accessdate=2008-09-15}} </ref> in the vicinity of [[Sakhalin]] and [[Moneron Island]]s, President [[Ronald Reagan]] issued a directive making GPS freely available for civilian use, once it was sufficiently developed, as a common good.<ref name="KAL007">{{cite news|url= http://www.america.gov/xarchives/display.html?p=washfile-english&y=2006&m=February&x=20060203125928lcnirellep0.5061609 |title=United States Updates Global Positioning System Technology |publisher=[http://www.america.gov/ America.gov] |date=February 3, 2006}}</ref> The first satellite was launched in 1989, and the 24th satellite was launched in 1994.

Initially, the highest quality signal was reserved for military use, and the signal available for civilian use was intentionally degraded ("[[Selective Availability]]", SA). This changed with US President [[Bill Clinton]] ordering Selective Availability turned off at midnight May 1, 2000, improving the precision of civilian GPS from 100 meters (about 300 feet) to 20 meters (about 65 feet).  The US military by then had the ability to deny GPS service to potential adversaries on a regional basis.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://ngs.woc.noaa.gov/FGCS/info/sans_SA/docs/GPS_SA_Event_QAs.pdf |title=GPS & Selective Availability Q&A |publisher=[http://www.noaa.gov/] |accessdate=2010-05-28}}</ref>

GPS is owned and operated by the US Government as a national resource. Department of Defense (USDOD) is the steward of GPS. ''Interagency GPS Executive Board (IGEB)'' oversaw GPS policy matters from 1996 to 2004. After that the ''[[National Space-Based Positioning, Navigation and Timing Executive Committee]]'' was established by presidential directive in 2004 to advise and coordinate federal departments and agencies on matters concerning the GPS and related systems.  The executive committee is chaired jointly by the deputy secretaries of defense and transportation. Its membership includes equivalent-level officials from the departments of state, commerce, and homeland security, the joint chiefs of staff, and NASA. Components of the executive office of the president participate as observers to the executive committee, and the FCC chairman participates as a liaison.

USDOD is required by law to "maintain a Standard Positioning Service (as defined in the federal radio navigation plan and the standard positioning service signal specification) that will be available on a continuous, worldwide basis," and "develop measures to prevent hostile use of GPS and its augmentations without unduly disrupting or degrading civilian uses."

== Basic concept of GPS ==
A GPS receiver calculates its position by precisely timing the signals sent by GPS [[satellites]] high above the Earth. Each satellite continually transmits messages that include
* the time the message was transmitted
* precise orbital information (the [[ephemeris]])
* the general system health and rough orbits of all GPS satellites (the almanac).

The receiver uses the messages it receives to determine the transit time of each message and computes the distance to each satellite. These distances along with the satellites' locations are used with the possible aid of [[trilateration]], depending on which algorithm is used, to compute the position of the receiver.  This position is then displayed, perhaps with a moving map display or latitude and longitude; elevation information may be included.  Many GPS units show derived information such as direction and speed, calculated from position changes.

Three satellites might seem enough to solve for position since space has three dimensions and a position near the Earth's surface can be assumed. However, even a very small clock error multiplied by the very large [[speed of light]]<ref>GPS signals travel at the [[speed of light]], so computing the distance for a given elapsed time is almost a straightforward calculation. However, the speed of light [[speed of light#Interaction with transparent materials|varies]] slightly between the partial vacuum of space and the atmosphere. A receiver can approximate these effects and produce a reasonable estimate. Once a rough position is determined, some receivers carefully compute the amount of atmosphere the signal traveled through and adjust the distance accordingly.</ref> — the speed at which satellite signals propagate — results in a large positional error. Therefore receivers use four or more satellites to solve for the receiver's location and time. The very accurately computed time is effectively hidden by most GPS applications, which use only the location. A few specialized GPS applications do however use the time; these include [[time transfer]], traffic signal timing, and [[IS-95#Physical layer|synchronization of cell phone base stations]].

Although four satellites are required for normal operation, fewer apply in special cases. If one variable is already known, a receiver can determine its position using only three satellites. For example, a ship or aircraft may have known elevation. Some GPS receivers may use additional clues or assumptions (such as reusing the last known altitude, [[dead reckoning]], [[inertial navigation system|inertial navigation]], or including information from the vehicle computer) to give a less accurate (degraded) position when fewer than four satellites are visible.<ref> {{cite web |title=Continuous Navigation Combining GPS with Sensor-Based Dead Reckoning | url=http://www.gpsworld.com/gpsworld/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=154870&pageID=6 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061111202317/http://www.gpsworld.com/gpsworld/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=154870&pageID=6 | archivedate=2006-11-11 |date=2005-04-01 |author=Georg zur Bonsen, Daniel Ammann, Michael Ammann, Etienne Favey, Pascal Flammant |publisher=GPS World}}</ref><ref name="NAVGPS">{{cite web |title=NAVSTAR GPS User Equipment Introduction |format=PDF |url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pubs/gps/gpsuser/gpsuser.pdf |publisher=US Government}} Chapter 7</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=GPS Support Notes | url=http://www.navmanwireless.com/uploads/EK/C8/EKC8zb1ITsNwDqWcqLQxiQ/Support_Notes_GPS_OperatingParameters.pdf | format = PDF | date = January 19, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-11-10}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}} </ref>

=== Position calculation introduction ===
To provide an introductory description of how a GPS receiver works, error effects are deferred to a later section. Using messages received from a minimum of four visible satellites, a GPS receiver is able to determine the times sent and then the satellite positions corresponding to these times sent. The x, y, and z components of position, and the time sent, are designated as <math>\scriptstyle\left[x_i,\, y_i,\, z_i,\, t_i\right]</math> where the subscript ''i'' is the satellite number and has the value 1, 2, 3, or 4. Knowing the indicated time the message was received <math>\scriptstyle\  tr</math>, the GPS receiver can compute the transit time of the message as <math>\scriptstyle\left (tr-t_i\right ) </math>. Assuming the message traveled at the speed of light, [[speed of light|''c'']], the distance traveled or pseudorange, <math>\scriptstyle p_i</math> can be computed as <math>\scriptstyle\left (tr-t_i\right )c</math>.

A satellite's position and pseudorange define a sphere, centered on the satellite with radius equal to the pseudorange. The position of the receiver is somewhere on the surface of this sphere. Thus with four satellites, the indicated position of the GPS receiver is at or near the intersection of the surfaces of four spheres.  In the ideal case of no errors, the GPS receiver would be at a precise intersection of the four surfaces.

If the surfaces of two spheres intersect at more than one point, they intersect in a circle. The article [[trilateration]] shows this mathematically. A figure, ''Two Sphere Surfaces Intersecting in a Circle'', is shown below.  Two points where the surfaces of the spheres intersect are clearly shown in the figure.  The distance between these two points is the diameter of the circle of intersection.
[[Image:Lat 2spheres 2.svg|thumb|left|Two sphere surfaces intersecting in a circle]]

The intersection of a third spherical surface with the first two will be its intersection with that circle; in most cases of practical interest, this means they intersect at two points.<ref>It is also possible for a circle and a spherical surface to intersect at zero points, one point, or in the very special case where the centers of the three spheres are co-linear (i.e., all three on the same straight line) the sphere surface could intersect the entire circumference of the circle.</ref> Another figure, ''Surface of Sphere Intersecting a Circle (not a solid disk) at Two Points'', illustrates the intersection. The two intersections are marked with dots. Again the article [[trilateration]] clearly shows this mathematically.
[[Image:Circle sphere 2-colour.svg|thumb |right|Surface of sphere Intersecting a circle (not a solid disk) at two points]]

For automobiles and other near-earth vehicles, the correct position of the GPS receiver is the intersection closest to the Earth's surface.<ref> The two intersections are symmetrical about the plane containing the three satellites. Excluding the exceptional case when the three satellites are all in a plane containing the center of the earth, one intersection will be nearer the earth than the other. </ref>  For space vehicles, the intersection farthest from Earth may be the correct one.

The correct position for the GPS receiver is also the intersection closest to the surface of the sphere corresponding to the fourth satellite.

=== Correcting a GPS receiver's clock ===
One of the most significant error sources is the GPS receiver's clock. Because of the very large value of the [[speed of light]], ''c'', the estimated distances from the GPS receiver to the satellites, the [[pseudorange]]s, are very sensitive to errors in the GPS receiver clock; for example an error of one microsecond (0.000 001 second) corresponds to an error of {{convert|300|m|ft}}.  This suggests that an extremely accurate and expensive clock is required for the GPS receiver to work. Because manufacturers prefer to build inexpensive GPS receivers for mass markets, the solution for this dilemma is based on the way sphere surfaces intersect in the GPS problem.

It is likely that the surfaces of the three spheres intersect, because the circle of intersection of the first two spheres is normally quite large, and thus the third sphere surface is likely to intersect this large circle. It is very unlikely that the surface of the sphere corresponding to the fourth satellite will intersect either of the two points of intersection of the first three, because any clock error could cause it to miss intersecting a point. However, the distance from the valid estimate of GPS receiver position to the surface of the sphere corresponding to the fourth satellite can be used to compute a clock correction. Let <math>\scriptstyle r_4</math> denote the distance from the valid estimate of GPS receiver position to the fourth satellite and let <math>\scriptstyle p_4</math> denote the pseudorange of the fourth satellite. Let <math>\scriptstyle da \,=\, r_4 \,-\, p_4</math>.  <math>\scriptstyle da</math> is the distance from the computed GPS receiver position to the surface of the sphere corresponding to the fourth satellite. Thus the quotient, <math>\scriptstyle b \,=\, da / c\ </math>, provides an estimate of

:(correct time) − (time indicated by the receiver's on-board clock),

and the GPS receiver clock can be advanced if <math>\scriptstyle b</math> is positive or delayed if <math>\scriptstyle b</math> is negative.  However, it should be kept in mind that a less simple function of <math>\scriptstyle da</math> may be needed to estimate the time error in an iterative algorithm as discussed in the [[Global Positioning System#Navigation equations|Navigation equations]] section.

== Structure ==
The current GPS consists of three major segments. These are the space segment (SS), a control segment (CS), and a user segment (US).<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/gps_3-ocx.htm |title=GPS III Operational Control Segment (OCX) |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-08}}</ref> The [[U.S. Air Force]] develops, maintains, and operates the space and control segments. GPS satellites [[broadcast signal]]s from space, and each GPS receiver uses these signals to calculate its three-dimensional location (latitude, longitude, and altitude) and the current time.<ref name=gps.gov>{{cite web|url=http://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/index.html |title=Global Positioning System |publisher=Gps.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}</ref>

The space segment is composed of 24 to 32 satellites in [[medium Earth orbit]] and also includes the payload adapters to the boosters required to launch them into orbit. The control segment is composed of a master control station, an alternate master control station, and a host of dedicated and shared [[ground antenna]]s and monitor stations. The user segment is composed of hundreds of thousands of U.S. and allied military users of the secure GPS Precise Positioning Service, and tens of millions of civil, commercial, and scientific users of the Standard Positioning Service (see [[GPS navigation device]]s).

The space segment (SS) is composed of the orbiting GPS satellites, or Space Vehicles (SV) in GPS parlance. The GPS design originally called for 24 SVs, eight each in three circular [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]s,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel1/2219/7072/00285510.pdf?arnumber=285510 | title=Navstar GPS and GLONASS: global satellite navigation systems |publisher=IEEE | first =P. |last =Daly }}</ref> but this was modified to six planes with four satellites each.<ref>{{cite web | last = Dana | first = Peter H. | format = GIF | url = http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/gps/gif/oplanes.gif | title = GPS Orbital Planes | date = 1996-08-08 }}</ref> The orbital planes are centered on the Earth, not rotating with respect to the distant stars.<ref>[http://metaresearch.org/cosmology/gps-relativity.asp What the Global Positioning System Tells Us about Relativity].

Retrieved December 15, 2006.</ref> The orbits are arranged so that at least six satellites are always within [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] from almost everywhere on Earth's surface.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=gpsFaq | title = USCG Navcen: GPS Frequently Asked Questions | accessdate = 2007-01-31 }}</ref>  The result of this objective is that the four satellites are not evenly spaced (90 degrees) apart within each orbit.  In general terms, the angular difference between satellites in each orbit is 30, 105, 120, and 105 degrees apart which, of course, sum to 360 degrees.

Orbiting at an altitude of approximately 20,200 kilometers (about 12,550 miles or 10,900 [[nautical mile]]s; orbital radius of approximately 26,600 km (about 16,500 mi or 14,400 NM)), each SV makes two complete orbits each [[sidereal day]], repeating the same ground track each day.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Finding the repeat times of the GPS constellation |author=Agnew, D.C. and Larson, K.M.|journal=GPS Solutions |volume=11 |pages=71–76 |year=2007 |publisher=Springer |doi=10.1007/s10291-006-0038-4 |issue=1 }} [http://spot.colorado.edu/~kristine/gpsrep.pdf This article from author's web site], with minor correction.</ref> This was very helpful during development because even with only four satellites, correct alignment means all four are visible from one spot for a few hours each day.

Such an arrangement was shown to improve reliability and availability of the system, relative to a uniform system, when multiple satellites fail.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Massatt | first = Paul | coauthors = Wayne Brady | url = http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2002/index.html | title = Optimizing performance through constellation management | journal = Crosslink | month = Summer | year = 2002 | pages = 17–21 }}</ref> About eight satellites are visible from any point on the ground at any one time (see animation at right).

=== Control segment ===
[[File:GPS monitor station.jpg|right|thumb|Ground monitor station used from 1984 to 2007, on display at the [[Air Force Space & Missile Museum]] ]]

The control segment is composed of
# a master control station (MCS),
# an alternate master control station,
# four dedicated ground antennas and
# six dedicated monitor stations

The MCS can also access U.S. Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) ground antennas (for additional command and control capability) and NGA ([[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]) monitor stations. The flight paths of the satellites are tracked by dedicated U.S. Air Force monitoring stations in [[Hawaii]], [[Kwajalein]], [[Ascension Island]], [[Diego Garcia]], [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] and Cape Canaveral, along with shared NGA monitor stations operated in England, Argentina, Ecuador, Bahrain, Australia and Washington DC.<ref>US Coast Guard [http://igs.bkg.bund.de/root_ftp/IGS/mail/igsmail/year2005/5209 General GPS News 9-9-05]</ref> The tracking information is sent to the Air Force Space Command's MCS at [[Schriever Air Force Base]] 25 km (16 miles) ESE of Colorado Springs, which is operated by the [[2nd Space Operations Squadron]] (2 SOPS) of the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF). Then 2 SOPS contacts each GPS satellite regularly with a navigational update using dedicated or shared (AFSCN) ground antennas (GPS dedicated ground antennas are located at Kwajalein, Ascension Island, Diego Garcia, and Cape Canaveral). These updates synchronize the atomic clocks on board the satellites to within a few [[nanosecond]]s of each other, and adjust the [[ephemeris]] of each satellite's internal orbital model. The updates are created by a [[Kalman filter]] that uses inputs from the ground monitoring stations, [[space weather]] information, and various other inputs.<ref>[[USNO]] [http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/gpsinfo.html NAVSTAR Global Positioning System]. Retrieved May 14, 2006.</ref>

Satellite maneuvers are not precise by GPS standards. So to change the orbit of a satellite, the satellite must be marked ''unhealthy'', so receivers will not use it in their calculation. Then the maneuver can be carried out, and the resulting orbit tracked from the ground. Then the new ephemeris is uploaded and the satellite marked healthy again.

=== User segment ===
[[Image:GPS Receivers.jpg|thumb|right|GPS receivers come in a variety of formats, from devices integrated into cars, phones, and watches, to dedicated devices such as those shown here from manufacturers [[Trimble Inc|Trimble]], [[Garmin]] and [[Leica Geosystems|Leica]] (left to right).]]

The user segment is composed of hundreds of thousands of U.S. and allied military users of the secure GPS Precise Positioning Service, and tens of millions of civil, commercial and scientific users of the Standard Positioning Service. In general, GPS receivers are composed of an antenna, tuned to the frequencies transmitted by the satellites, receiver-processors, and a highly stable clock (often a [[crystal oscillator]]). They may also include a display for providing location and speed information to the user. A receiver is often described by its number of channels: this signifies how many satellites it can monitor simultaneously. Originally limited to four or five, this has progressively increased over the years so that, {{As of|2007|lc=on}}, receivers typically have between 12 and 20 channels.<ref>Though there are many receiver manufacturers, they almost all use one of the chipsets produced for this purpose. An example: {{cite web |url=http://gpstekreviews.com/2007/04/14/gps-receiver-chip-performance-survey/ |title=GPS Receiver Chip Performance Survey |publisher=GPS Technology Reviews}}</ref>
[[Image:j32 1 small.jpg|thumb|left|A typical [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] GPS receiver module measuring 15×17 mm.]]

GPS receivers may include an input for differential corrections, using the [[RTCM]] SC-104 format. This is typically in the form of an [[RS-232]] port at 4,800 bit/s speed. Data is actually sent at a much lower rate, which limits the accuracy of the signal sent using RTCM. Receivers with internal DGPS receivers can outperform those using external RTCM data. {{As of |2006}}, even low-cost units commonly include [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS) receivers.
[[Image:M10214 20071003 3764.jpg|thumb|right|A typical GPS receiver with integrated antenna.]]

Many GPS receivers can relay position data to a PC or other device using the [[NMEA 0183]] protocol.  Although this protocol is officially defined by the National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nmea.org/pub/index.html |title=Publications and Standards from the National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) |publisher=National Marine Electronics Association |accessdate=2008-06-27}}</ref> references to this protocol have been compiled from public records, allowing open source tools like [[gpsd]] to read the protocol without violating [[intellectual property]] laws. Other proprietary protocols exist as well, such as the [[SiRF]] and [[MediaTek|MTK]] protocols. Receivers can interface with other devices using methods including a serial connection, [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], or [[Bluetooth]].

== Applications ==
While originally a military project, GPS is considered a ''dual-use'' technology, meaning it has significant military and civilian applications.

GPS has become a widely deployed and useful tool for commerce, scientific uses, tracking, and surveillance. GPS's accurate time facilitates everyday activities such as banking, mobile phone operations, and even the control of power grids by allowing well synchronized hand-off switching.  Farmers, surveyors, geologists, and countless others perform their work more efficiently, safely, economically, and accurately.<ref name=gps.gov/>

=== Civilian ===
{{See also|GNSS applications|GPS navigation device}}
[[File:GPS roof antenna dsc06160.jpg|thumb|right|This [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] is mounted on the roof of a hut containing a scientific experiment needing precise timing.]]
Many civilian applications use one or more of GPS's three basic components: absolute location, relative movement, and time transfer.

* [[Cellular telephony]]: Clock synchronization enables time transfer, which is critical for synchronizing its spreading codes with other base stations to facilitate inter-cell handoff and support hybrid GPS/cellular position detection for [[E911#Wireless enhanced 911|mobile emergency calls]] and other applications. The first [[Mobile GPS navigation|handsets with integrated GPS]] launched in the late 1990s. The U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) mandated the feature in either the handset or in the towers (for use in triangulation) in 2002 so emergency services could locate 911 callers. Third-party software developers later gained access to GPS APIs  from [[Nextel]] upon launch, followed by [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] in 2006, and [[Verizon]] soon thereafter.
* [[Disaster relief]]/[[emergency service]]s: Depend upon GPS for location and timing capabilities.
* [[Geofence|Geofencing]]: [[Vehicle tracking system]]s, [[Handheld tracker|person tracking systems]], and [[Positioning Animals Worldwide|pet tracking]] systems use GPS to locate a vehicle, person, or pet. These devices attach to the vehicle, person, or the pet collar. The application provides 24/7 tracking and mobile or Internet updates should the trackee leave a designated area.<ref name="Spotlight">{{cite web|url=http://www.spotlightgps.com/ |title=Spotlight GPS pet locator |publisher=Spotlightgps.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-15}}</ref>
* [[Geotagging]]: Applying location coordinates to digital objects such as photographs and other documents for purposes such as creating map overlays.
* [[GPS Aircraft Tracking]]
* [[GPS tour]]s: Location determines what content to display; for instance, information about an approaching point of interest.
* [[Cartography|Map-making]]: Both civilian and military cartographers use GPS extensively.
* [[Navigation]]: Navigators value digitally precise velocity and orientation measurements.
* [[Phasor measurement unit| Phasor measurement units]]: GPS enables highly accurate timestamping of power system measurements, making it possible to compute [[phasor (sine waves)|phasors]].
* [[Recreation]]: For example, [[geocaching]], [[geodashing]], [[GPS drawing]] and [[waymarking]].
* [[Surveying]]: Surveyors use absolute locations to make maps and determine property boundaries.
* [[Tectonics]]: GPS enables direct fault motion  measurement in [[earthquakes]].
<!--*GPS enables researchers to explore Earth's [[environment]] including the atmosphere, ionosphere and gravity field. how???-->

<!-- Compared to a few years ago, GPS technology for handsets has matured considerably, offering much better performance in terms of sensitivity, power consumption, size and price. What is more, the OMA SUPL A-GPS standard has enabled lower cost deployment of A-GPS services that ensure a better and more consistent user experience necessary for the mass consumer market. The SUPL A-GPS standard allows network operators or handset manufacturers to deploy assistance services that reduce the time to first fix, lowers the power consumption, and enhances the sensitivity of the GPS receiver. The SUPL standard uses User Plane communication channels such as SMS and GPRS to transport the aiding data, as opposed to the control plane channels in networks, thereby reducing the load on the networks, as well as complexity and cost of service deployment. New business models have also become possible, ranging from hosted services for operators that want to minimize capital investments, to services deployed by handset vendors for end-users that cannot get similar services from their network operator yet.

The major handset software platforms and operating systems are evolving, ensuring easier integration of GPS functionality for handset manufacturers and more powerful features for application developers. Along with the improving performance of handsets, in terms of screen size, processing power and memory size, current handsets thus provide much better platforms for location-enabled applications and services than before.

The GPS value-chain was reshaped considerably in 2007 as several specialist GPS technology developers were acquired by wireless chipset vendors. These transactions are likely to enhance the possibilities to meet handset manufacturers’ demand for integrated connectivity solutions that include GPS at ever lower price points to enable true mass market deployment.

Sales of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handsets grew to about 24.5 million units in 2007 according to independent analyst firm Berg Insight. Although the number is very small in comparison with the 150 million GPS-enabled CDMA handsets sold, the number is growing rapidly. Berg Insight estimates that shipments of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handsets will grow to 370 million units in 2012, the equivalent of more than 26 percent of all GSM/WCDMA handsets sold that year. Including CDMA handsets, GPS-enabled handsets sales are estimated to reach about 560 million, or 35 percent of total handset shipments in 2012. -->

==== Restrictions on civilian use ====
The U.S. Government controls the export of some civilian receivers. All GPS receivers capable of functioning above {{km to mi|18}} altitude and {{convert|515|m/s|knot}}<ref>
Arms Control Association.[http://www.armscontrol.org/documents/mtcr Missile Technology Control Regime]. Retrieved May 17, 2006.</ref> are classified as [[United States Munitions List|munitions]] (weapons) for which [[U.S. State Department]] [[export license]]s are required. These limits attempt to prevent use of a receiver in a [[ballistic missile]]. They would not prevent use in a [[cruise missile]] because their altitudes and speeds are similar to those of ordinary aircraft.

This rule applies even to otherwise purely civilian units that only receive the L1 frequency and the C/A (Clear/Acquisition) code and cannot correct for Selective Availability (SA), etc.

Disabling operation above these limits exempts the receiver from classification as a munition. Vendor  interpretations differ. The rule targets operation given the combination of altitude and speed, while some receivers stop operating even when stationary. This has caused problems with some amateur radio balloon launches that regularly reach {{km to mi|30}}.

=== Military ===
As of 2009, military applications of GPS include:
* Navigation: GPS allows soldiers to find objectives, even in the dark or in unfamiliar territory, and to coordinate troop and supply movement. In the US armed forces, commanders use the ''Commanders Digital Assistant'' and lower ranks use the ''Soldier Digital Assistant''.<ref>

* Target tracking: Various military weapons systems use GPS to track potential ground and air targets before flagging them as hostile.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} These weapon systems pass target coordinates to [[precision-guided munition]]s to allow them to engage targets accurately. Military aircraft, particularly in [[air-to-ground]] roles, use GPS to find targets (for example, [[gun camera]] video from [[AH-1 Cobra]]s in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] show GPS co-ordinates that can be viewed with special software.
* Missile and projectile guidance: GPS allows accurate targeting of various military weapons including [[ICBM]]s, [[cruise missile]]s and [[precision-guided munition]]s.

== Communication ==
{{Main|GPS signals}}

The navigational signals transmitted by GPS satellites encode a variety of information including satellite positions, the state of the internal clocks, and the health of the network. These signals are transmitted on two separate carrier frequencies that are common to all satellites in the network. Two different encodings are used, a public encoding that enables lower resolution navigation, and an encrypted encoding used by the U.S. military.

=== Message format ===

|}

Each GPS satellite continuously broadcasts a ''navigation message'' at a rate of 50 bits per second (see [[bitrate]]). Each complete message is composed of 30-second [[Frame (networking)|frame]]s, distinct groupings of 1,500 bits of information. Each frame is further subdivided into 5 subframes of length 6 seconds and with 300 bits each. Each subframe contains 10 words of 30 bits with length 0.6 seconds each. Each 30 second frame begins precisely on the minute or half minute as indicated by the atomic clock on each satellite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gpsinformation.net/gpssignal.htm |title=Satellite message format |publisher=Gpsinformation.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-15}}</ref>

The first part of the message encodes the week number and the time within the week,<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Woessner, Anja Koehne |url=http://www.kowoma.de/en/gps/data_composition.htm |title=time-of-week |publisher=Kowoma.de |date= |accessdate=2010-10-15}}</ref> as well as the data about the health of the satellite. The second part of the message, the ''[[ephemeris]]'', provides the precise orbit for the satellite. The last part of the message, the ''almanac'', contains coarse orbit and status information for all satellites in the network as well as data related to error correction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.losangeles.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-070803-059.pdf |format=PDF |title=Interface Specification IS-GPS-200, Revision D: Navstar GPS Space Segment/Navigation User Interfaces |publisher=Navstar GPS Joint Program Office }} Page 103.</ref>

All satellites broadcast at the same frequencies. Signals are encoded using [[code division multiple access]] (CDMA) allowing messages from individual satellites to be distinguished from each other based on unique encodings for each satellite (that the receiver must be aware of). Two distinct types of CDMA encodings are used: the coarse/acquisition (C/A) code, which is accessible by the general public, and the precise (P) code, that is encrypted so that only the U.S. military can access it.

The ephemeris is updated every 2 hours and is generally valid for 4 hours, with provisions for updates every 6 hours or longer in non-nominal conditions. The almanac is updated typically every 24 hours. Additionally data for a few weeks following is uploaded in case of transmission updates that delay data upload.

All satellites broadcast at the same two frequencies, 1.57542 GHz (L1 signal) and 1.2276 GHz (L2 signal). The satellite network uses a CDMA spread-spectrum technique where the low-bitrate message data is encoded with a high-rate [[pseudorandom number generator|pseudo-random]] (PRN) sequence that is different for each satellite. The receiver must be aware of the PRN codes for each satellite to reconstruct the actual message data. The C/A code, for civilian use, transmits data at 1.023 million [[chip (CDMA)|chips]] per second, whereas the P code, for U.S. military use, transmits at 10.23 million chips per second. The L1 carrier is modulated by both the C/A and P codes, while the L2 carrier is only modulated by the P code.<ref>[http://www.kowoma.de/en/gps/signals.htm How GPS works.] Konowa.de (2005).</ref> The P code can be encrypted as a so-called P(Y) code that is only available to military equipment with a proper decryption key. Both the C/A and P(Y) codes impart the precise time-of-day to the user.

The L3 signal at a frequency of 1.38105 GHz is used by the United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (USNDS) to detect, locate, and report nuclear detonations (NUDETs) in the earth's atmosphere and near space.<ref>[http://www.fas.org/spp/military/program/nssrm/initiatives/usnds.htm United States Nuclear Detonation Detection System (USNDS)]</ref> One usage is the enforcement of nuclear test ban treaties.

The L4 band at 1.379913 GHz is being studied for additional ionospheric correction.

The L5 frequency band at 1.17645 GHZ was added in the process of [[GPS modernization]]. This frequency falls into an internationally protected range for aeronautical navigation, promising little or no interference under all circumstances. The first Block IIF satellite that would provide this signal is set to be launched in 2009<ref>[http://mg.gpsworld.com/gpsmg/Military+%26+Government+News/First-GPS-IIF-Satellite-Undergoes-Environmental-Te/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/470408?contextCategoryId=33824 First GPS IIF Satellite Undergoes Environmental Testing]. GPS World. November 5, 2007.</ref>. The L5 consists of two carrier components that are in phase quadrature with each other.  Each carrier component is bi-phase shift key (BPSK) modulated by a separate bit train.

=== Demodulation and decoding ===
<!-- Demodulation is done with carrier frequency; decoding is done with Gold Code. -->[[Image:gps ca gold.svg|thumb|left| 300px|Demodulating and Decoding GPS Satellite Signals|Demodulating and Decoding GPS Satellite Signals using the Coarse/Acquisition [[Gold code]].]]
Because all of the satellite signals are modulated onto the same L1 carrier frequency, the signals must be separated after demodulation. This is done by assigning each satellite a unique binary [[sequence]] known as a [[Gold code]]. The signals are decoded after demodulation using addition of the Gold codes corresponding to the satellites monitored by the receiver.<ref>{{cite web

If the almanac information has previously been acquired, the receiver picks the satellites to listen for by their PRNs, unique numbers in the range 1 through 32. If the almanac information is not in memory, the receiver enters a search mode until a lock is obtained on one of the satellites. To obtain a lock, it is necessary that there be an unobstructed line of sight from the receiver to the satellite. The receiver can then acquire the almanac and determine the satellites it should listen for. As it detects each satellite's signal, it identifies it by its distinct C/A code pattern.  There can be a delay of up to 30 seconds before the first estimate of position because of the need to read the ephemeris data.

Processing of the navigation message enables the determination of the time of transmission and the satellite position at this time.  For more information see [[GPS signals#Demodulation and decoding|Demodulation and Decoding, Advanced]].

== Navigation equations ==
The receiver uses messages received from four satellites to determine the satellite positions and time sent. The ''x, y,'' and ''z'' components of position and the time sent are designated as <math>\ \left [x_i, y_i, z_i, t_i\right ]</math> where the subscript ''i'' denotes the satellite and has the value 1, 2, 3, or 4. Knowing when the message was received <math>\ \  tr_i</math>, the receiver computes the message's transit time as <math>\ \left (tr_i-t_i\right ) </math>. Assuming the message traveled at the speed of light ([[Speed of light|c]]) the distance traveled, <math>\ \  p_i</math> is <math>\ \left (tr_i-t_i\right )c </math>. Knowing the distance from receiver to satellite and the satellite's position implies that the receiver is on the surface of a sphere centered at the satellite's position. Thus the receiver is at or near the intersection of the surfaces of four spheres. In the ideal case of no errors, the receiver is at the intersection of the surfaces of four spheres. Excluding the unrealistic case (for GPS purposes) of two coincident spheres, the surfaces of two intersecting spheres is either a point (if they merely touch) or a circle as depicted in the illustration below. Two of the points where the surfaces of the spheres intersect are clearly marked on the figure. The distance between these two points is the diameter of the circle of intersection.

[[Image:lat 2spheres 2.svg|thumb|center|Two sphere surfaces intersecting in a circle]]

This can be seen more clearly by considering a side view of the intersecting spheres. This view would match the figure because of the symmetry of the spheres. A view from any horizontal direction would look exactly the same. Therefore the diameter as seen from all directions is the same and thus the surfaces actually do intersect in a circle.  The article [[trilateration]] [[algebra]]ically confirms this geometric argument that the two sphere surfaces intersect in a circle.

Having found that two sphere surfaces intersect in a circle, we now consider how the intersection of the first two sphere surfaces, the circle, intersect with the third sphere. A circle and sphere surface intersect at zero, one or two points. For the GPS problem we are concerned with the case of two points of intersection. Another figure, Surface of Sphere Intersecting a Circle (not a solid disk) at Two Points, is shown below to aid in visualizing this intersection. Trilateration [[algebra]]ically confirms this geometric observation. The ambiguity of two points of intersection of three sphere surfaces can be resolved by noting the point that is closest to the fourth sphere surface.

[[Image:circle sphere 2-colour.svg|thumb|center|Surface of a sphere intersecting a circle (i.e., the edge of a disk) at two points]]

Having provided a discussion of how sphere surfaces intersect, we now formulate the equations for the case when errors are present.

Let <math>\ \ b</math> denote the clock error or bias, the amount that the receiver's clock is off. The receiver has four unknowns, the three components of GPS receiver position and the clock bias <math>\ \left [x, y, z, b\right ]</math>. The equation of the sphere surfaces are given by:
<math>(x-x_i)^2 + (y-y_i)^2 + (z-z_i)^2 = \bigl([tr_i + b - t_i]c\bigr)^2,</math>
:<math>\;i=1,2,3,4</math>

Another useful form of these equations is in terms of ''pseudoranges'', which are the approximate ranges based on the receiver clock's uncorrected time so that <math> p_i = \left (tr_i - t_i \right )c</math>. Then the equations becomes:
:<math>p_i = \sqrt{(x-x_i)^2 + (y-y_i)^2 + (z-z_i)^2}- bc, \;i=1,2,3,4.</math>

=== Methods of solution of navigation equations ===
* Bancroft's method is perhaps the most important method of solving the navigation equations because it involves an algebraic as opposed to numerical method.<ref name="Bancroft">{{cite web|url=http://www.macalester.edu/~halverson/math36/GPS.pdf |title=Global Positioning Systems |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-10-15}}</ref>  The method requires at least four satellites but more can be used.

Two numerical methods of computing GPS receiver position and clock bias are (1) by using [[trilateration]] and one dimensional numerical root finding and (2) [[multidimensional]] [[Newton-Raphson]] calculations.
* The receiver can use [[trilateration]] <ref name="HGPSW1">

[http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/travel/gps2.htm How GPS Receivers Work] at How Stuff Works</ref>  and one dimensional numerical root finding.<ref name="NR">
Press, Flannery, Tekolsky, and Vetterling 1986, ''Numerical Recipes, The Art of Scientific Computing'' (Cambridge University Press).</ref> Trilateration is used to determine the intersection of the surfaces of three spheres. In the usual case of two intersections, the point nearest the surface of the sphere corresponding to the fourth satellite is chosen. The Earth's surface can also sometimes be used instead, especially by civilian GPS receivers, because it is illegal in the United States to track vehicles more than {{convert|60,000|ft|m}} in altitude. Let da denote the signed magnitude of the vector from  the receiver position to the fourth satellite (i.e. da = r4 - p4) as defined in the section "Clock correction".  da is a function of the correction because the correction changes the satellite transmission times and thus the pseudoranges. The notation, da(correction) denotes this function. The problem is to determine the correction such that
:<math>da\left(correction\right) = 0</math>.
This is the familiar problem of finding the zeroes of a one dimensional non-linear function of a scalar variable.  Iterative numerical methods, such as those found in the chapter on root finding in ''Numerical Recipes''  can solve this type of problem.<ref name="NR"/> One advantage of this method is that it involves one dimensional as opposed to multidimensional numerical root finding.

* <span id="pos_multi_nr"></span>Alternatively, multidimensional root finding method such as [[Newton-Raphson]] method can be used.<ref name="NR"/> The approach is to linearize around an approximate solution, say <math>\ \left [x^{(k)}, y^{(k)}, z^{(k)}, b^{(k)}\right ]</math> from iteration ''k,'' then solve four linear equations derived from the quadratic equations above to obtain <math>\left [x^{(k+1)}, y^{(k+1)}, z^{(k+1)}, b^{(k+1)}\right ]</math>. The Newton-Raphson method is more rapidly convergent than other methods of numerical root finding.<ref name="NR"/> A disadvantage of this multidimensional root finding method as compared to single dimensional root findiing is that, "There are no good general methods for solving systems of more than one nonlinear equations."<ref name="NR"/>
* When more than four satellites are available, the calculation can use the four best or more than four, considering number of channels, processing capability, and [[#gdop|geometric dilution of precision]] (GDOP). Using more than four is an over-determined system of equations with no unique solution, which must be solved by [[least-squares]] or a similar technique.<ref name="Bancroft"/> If all visible satellites are used, the results are as good as or better than using the four best. Errors can be estimated through the residuals. With each combination of four or more satellites, a GDOP factor can be calculated, based on the relative sky directions of the satellites used.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/gps/gps.html#Gdop |title=Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) and Visibility |first=Peter H. |last=Dana |publisher=University of Colorado at Boulder |accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref> As more satellites are picked up, pseudoranges from various 4-way combinations can be processed to add more estimates to the location and clock offset. The receiver then takes the weighted average of these positions and clock offsets. After the final location and time are calculated, the location is expressed in a specific coordinate system such as [[latitude]] and [[longitude]], using the [[WGS 84]] [[datum (geodesy)|geodetic datum]] or a country-specific system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/gps/gps.html#PosVelTime |title=Receiver Position, Velocity, and Time |author=Peter H. Dana |publisher=University of Colorado at Boulder |accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref>
* Finally, results from other positioning systems such as [[GLONASS]] or the upcoming [[Galileo positioning system|Galileo]] can be incorporated or used to check the result. (By design, these systems use the same frequency bands, so much of the receiver circuitry can be shared, though the decoding is different.)

== Accuracy enhancement and surveying ==
{{Main|GPS augmentation}}

=== Error sources and analysis ===
The [[Error analysis for the Global Positioning System|analysis of errors]] in the information reported by the Global Positioning System is important to estimating the accuracy of position estimates and correcting for the errors. The positioning data provided directly by the satellites is extremely precise but there are many factors that can make the errors in the data non-trivial. In situations where high accuracy is necessary, understanding and compensating for these sources of error is important. Sources of error include atmospheric distortion (predominantly in the ionosphere), satellite clock inaccuracies, and the travel delays of the satellite signals.

=== Augmentation ===
Integrating external information into the calculation process can materially improve accuracy. Such augmentation systems are generally named or described based on how the information arrives. Some systems transmit additional error information  (such as clock drift, ephemera, or ionospheric delay), others characterize prior errors, while a third group provides additional navigational or vehicle information.

Examples of augmentation systems include the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS), [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service]] (EGNOS) , Differential GPS, [[Inertial Navigation System]]s (INS) and [[Assisted GPS]].

=== Precise monitoring ===
Accuracy can be improved through precise monitoring and measurement of existing GPS signals in additional or alternate ways.

The largest remaining error is usually the unpredictable delay through the ionosphere. The spacecraft broadcast ionospheric model parameters, but errors remain. This is one reason GPS spacecraft transmit on at least two frequencies, L1 and L2. Ionospheric delay is a well-defined function of frequency and the [[total electron content]] (TEC) along the path, so measuring the arrival time difference between the frequencies determines TEC and thus the precise ionospheric delay at each frequency.

Military receivers can decode the P(Y)-code transmitted on both L1 and L2. Without decryption keys, it is still possible to use a ''codeless'' technique to compare the P(Y) codes on L1 and L2 to gain much of the same error information. However, this technique is slow, so it is currently available only on specialized surveying equipment. In the future, additional civilian codes are expected to be transmitted on the L2 and L5 frequencies (see [[GPS modernization]]). Then all users will be able to perform dual-frequency measurements and directly compute ionospheric delay errors.

A second form of precise monitoring is called ''Carrier-Phase Enhancement'' (CPGPS). This corrects the error that arises because the pulse transition of the [[Pseudorandom number generator|PRN]] is not instantaneous, and thus the [[cross-correlation|correlation]] (satellite-receiver sequence matching) operation is imperfect. CPGPS uses the L1 carrier wave, which has a [[frequency|period]] of <math> \frac{1\ \mathrm{sec}}{1575.42 * 10^6} = 0.63475 \  \mathrm{nanoseconds} \approx 1 \ \mathrm{nanosecond} \ </math>, which is about one-thousandth of the C/A Gold code bit period of <math> \frac{1\ \mathrm{sec}}{1023 * 10^3} = 977.5 \ \mathrm{nanosecond} \   \approx 1000 \ \mathrm{nanosecond} \ </math>, to act as an additional [[clock signal]] and resolve the uncertainty. The phase difference error in the normal GPS amounts to {{convert|2|-|3|m|ft}} of ambiguity. CPGPS working to within 1% of perfect transition reduces this error to {{cm to in|3}} of ambiguity. By eliminating this error source, CPGPS coupled with DGPS normally realizes between {{convert|20|-|30|cm|in}} of absolute accuracy.

''Relative Kinematic Positioning'' (RKP) is a third alternative for a precise GPS-based positioning system. In this approach, determination of range signal can be resolved to a precision of less than {{cm to in|10}}. This is done by resolving the number of cycles that the signal is transmitted and received by the receiver by using a combination of differential GPS (DGPS) correction data, transmitting GPS signal phase information and ambiguity resolution techniques via statistical tests—possibly with processing in real-time ([[Real Time Kinematic|real-time kinematic positioning]], RTK).

=== Timekeeping {{anchor|GPS time|GPS time and date}} ===
==== Timekeeping and leap seconds ====
While most clocks are synchronized to [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), the atomic clocks on the satellites are set to ''GPS time'' (GPST; see the page of [[United States Naval Observatory]]). The difference is that GPS time is not corrected to match the rotation of the Earth, so it does not contain [[leap second]]s or other corrections that are periodically added to UTC. GPS time was set to match [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) in 1980, but has since diverged. The lack of corrections means that GPS time remains at a constant offset with [[International Atomic Time]] (TAI) (TAI - GPS = 19 seconds). Periodic corrections are performed on the on-board clocks to correct relativistic effects and keep them synchronized with ground clocks.{{cn|date=January 2011}}

The GPS navigation message includes the difference between GPS time and UTC, which as of 2009 is 15 seconds because of the leap second added to UTC December 31, 2008. Receivers subtract this offset from GPS time to calculate UTC and specific timezone values. New GPS units may not show the correct UTC time until after receiving the UTC offset message. The GPS-UTC offset field can accommodate 255 leap seconds (eight bits) that, given the current rate of change of the Earth's rotation (with one leap second introduced approximately every 18 months), should be sufficient to last until approximately the year 2300.

==== Timekeeping accuracy ====
GPS time is accurate to about 14ns.<ref>{{cite web|author=David W. Allan |url=http://www.allanstime.com/Publications/DWA/Science_Timekeeping/index.html |title=The Science of Timekeeping |publisher=Hewlett Packard |date=1997}}</ref>

==== Timekeeping format ====
As opposed to the year, month, and day format of the [[Gregorian calendar]], the GPS date is expressed as a week number and a seconds-into-week number. The week number is transmitted as a ten-[[bit]] field in the C/A and P(Y) navigation messages, and so it becomes zero again every 1,024 weeks (19.6 years). GPS week zero started at 00:00:00 UTC (00:00:19 TAI) on January 6, 1980, and the week number became zero again for the first time at 23:59:47 UTC on August 21, 1999 (00:00:19 TAI on August 22, 1999). To determine the current Gregorian date, a GPS receiver must be provided with the approximate date (to within 3,584 days) to correctly translate the GPS date signal. To address this concern the modernized GPS navigation message uses a 13-bit field that only repeats every 8,192 weeks (157 years), thus lasting until the year 2137 (157 years after GPS week zero).

=== Carrier phase tracking (surveying) ===
Another method that is used in surveying applications is carrier phase tracking. The period of the carrier frequency times the speed of light gives the wavelength, which is about 0.19 meters for the L1 carrier. Accuracy within 1% of wavelength in detecting the leading edge, reduces this component of pseudorange error to as little as 2 millimeters. This compares to 3 meters for the C/A code and 0.3 meters for the P code.

However, 2 millimeter accuracy requires measuring the total phase—the number of waves times the wavelength plus the fractional wavelength, which requires specially equipped receivers. This method has many surveying applications.

Triple differencing followed by numerical root finding, and a mathematical technique called [[least squares]] can estimate the position of one receiver given the position of another. First, compute the difference between satellites, then between receivers, and finally between epochs. Other orders of taking differences are equally valid. Detailed discussion of the errors is omitted.

The satellite carrier total phase can be measured with ambiguity as to the number of cycles. Let <math>\ \phi(r_i, s_j, t_k) </math> denote the phase of the carrier of satellite ''j'' measured by receiver ''i'' at time <math>\ \ t_k </math>. This notation shows the meaning of the subscripts ''i, j,'' and ''k.'' The receiver (''r''), satellite (''s''), and time (''t'') come in alphabetical order as arguments of <math>\ \phi </math> and to balance readability and conciseness, let <math>\ \phi_{i,j,k} = \phi(r_i, s_j, t_k) </math> be  a concise abbreviation. Also we define three functions, :<math>\ \Delta^r, \Delta^s, \Delta^t </math>, which return differences between receivers, satellites, and time points, respectively. Each function has variables with three subscripts as its arguments. These three functions are defined below. If <math>\  \alpha_{i,j,k} </math> is a function of the three integer arguments, ''i, j,'' and ''k'' then it is a valid argument for the functions, :<math>\ \Delta^r, \Delta^s, \Delta^t </math> , with the values defined as

:<math>\ \Delta^r(\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \alpha_{i+1,j,k} - \alpha_{i,j,k} </math> ,
:<math>\ \Delta^s(\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \alpha_{i,j+1,k} - \alpha_{i,j,k} </math> , and
:<math>\ \Delta^t(\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \alpha_{i,j,k+1} - \alpha_{i,j,k} </math> .

Also if <math>\  \alpha_{i,j,k}\ and\ \beta_{l,m,n} </math> are valid arguments for the three functions and ''a'' and ''b'' are constants then
<math>\ ( a\ \alpha_{i,j,k} + b\ \beta_{l,m,n} ) </math> is a valid argument with values defined as

:<math>\ \Delta^r(a\ \alpha_{i,j,k} + b\ \beta_{l,m,n}) = a \ \Delta^r(\alpha_{i,j,k}) +  b \ \Delta^r(\beta_{l,m,n})</math> ,
:<math>\ \Delta^s(a\ \alpha_{i,j,k} + b\ \beta_{l,m,n} )= a \ \Delta^s(\alpha_{i,j,k}) +  b \ \Delta^s(\beta_{l,m,n})</math> , and
:<math>\ \Delta^t(a\ \alpha_{i,j,k} + b\ \beta_{l,m,n} )= a \ \Delta^t(\alpha_{i,j,k}) +  b \ \Delta^t(\beta_{l,m,n})</math> .

Receiver clock errors can be approximately eliminated by differencing the phases measured from satellite 1 with that from satellite 2 at the same epoch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/633.htm |title=Between-Satellite Differencing |publisher=Gmat.unsw.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2010-10-15}}</ref> This difference is designated as <math>\ \Delta^s(\phi_{1,1,1}) =  \phi_{1,2,1} - \phi_{1,1,1}</math>

Double differencing<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/635.htm |title=Double differencing |publisher=Gmat.unsw.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2010-10-15}}</ref> computes the difference of receiver 1's satellite  difference from that of receiver 2. This approximately eliminates satellite clock errors. This double difference is:
:<math>\begin{align}
\Delta^r(\Delta^s(\phi_{1,1,1}))\,&=\,\Delta^r(\phi_{1,2,1} - \phi_{1,1,1})
                                  &=\,\Delta^r(\phi_{1,2,1}) - \Delta^r(\phi_{1,1,1})
                                  &=\,(\phi_{2,2,1}  - \phi_{1,2,1}) - (\phi_{2,1,1} - \phi_{1,1,1})
\end{align}</math>

Triple differencing<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/636.htm |title=Triple differencing |publisher=Gmat.unsw.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2010-10-15}}</ref> subtracts the receiver difference from time 1 from that of time 2. This eliminates the ambiguity associated with the integral number of wave lengths in carrier phase provided this ambiguity does not change with time. Thus the triple difference result eliminates practically all clock bias errors and the integer ambiguity. Atmospheric delay and satellite ephemeris errors have been significantly reduced. This triple difference is:
:<math>\ \Delta^t(\Delta^r(\Delta^s(\phi_{1,1,1}))) </math>

Triple difference results can be used to estimate unknown variables. For example if the position of receiver 1 is known but the position of receiver 2 unknown, it may be possible to estimate the position of receiver 2 using numerical root finding and least squares. Triple difference results for three independent time pairs quite possibly will be sufficient to solve for receiver 2's three position components. This may require the use of a numerical procedure.<ref name="NR1">chapter on root finding and nonlinear sets of equations</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UQW_VL2H56IC&pg=PA959&lpg=PA959&dq=%22Numerical+Analysis%22+multidimension++root+finding&source=web&ots=PLUUjn-33v&sig=P7btHJELgxmVpNI6_SnYjVZvUJc&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA442,M1 |title=Preview of Root Finding |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-15}}</ref> An approximation of receiver 2's position is required to use such a numerical method. This initial value can probably be provided from the navigation message and the intersection of sphere surfaces. Such a reasonable estimate can be key to successful multidimensional root finding. Iterating from three time pairs and a fairly good initial value produces one observed triple difference result for receiver 2's position. Processing additional time pairs can improve accuracy, overdetermining the answer with multiple solutions. Least squares can  estimate an overdetermined system. Least squares determines the position of receiver 2 which best fits the observed triple difference results for receiver 2 positions under the criterion of minimizing the sum of the squares.
