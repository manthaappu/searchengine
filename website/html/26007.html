<html> <head> <title>Negation normal form</title></head><body>A logical formula is in '''negation normal form''' if negation occurs only immediately above elementary propositions, and {<math>\lnot, \lor,\land</math>} are the only allowed Boolean connectives.  In classical logic each formula can be brought into this form by replacing implications and equivalences by their definitions, using [[De Morgan's laws]] to push negation inside, and eliminating double negations.  This process can be represented using the following [[rewrite rule]]s:

:<math>\lnot (\forall x. G) \to \exists x. \lnot G</math>
:<math>\lnot (\exists x. G) \to \forall x. \lnot G</math>
:<math>\lnot \lnot G \to G</math>
:<math>\lnot (G_1 \land G_2) \to (\lnot G_1) \lor (\lnot G_2)</math>
:<math>\lnot (G_1 \lor G_2) \to (\lnot G_1) \land (\lnot G_2)</math>

A formula in negation normal form can be put into the stronger [[conjunctive normal form]] or [[disjunctive normal form]] by applying the distributivity laws.
