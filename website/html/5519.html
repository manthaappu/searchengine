At PdM, he is the Rector's Delegate for research; he has been Department Chair, Head of the PhD Program, member of the Academic Senate and of the Board of Governors of Politecnico.

==Education and academic career==

He received his Dr.Eng. degree in [[Electrical Engineering]] from PdM, where he spent most of his professional life, as [[Assistant Professor|Assistant]], [[Associate Professor|Associate]], and [[Full Professor]]. He also taught and did research in other institutions: [[University of California, Los Angeles]], USA (1976), [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], USA (1979–80), [[University of Padua|Università degli Studi di Padova]], Italy (1980–81), [[Escuela Superior Latinoamericana de Informática]], Argentina (1990), [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], USA (1991), [[Technical University of Vienna]], Austria (1996), and [[University of Klagenfurt]], Austria (1996).

Ghezzi is a  1999  [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] fellow (citation: "Numerous research contributions from compiler theory to real-time systems to software processes. A strong contributor to the software engineering community in Europe and worldwide."<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://fellows.acm.org/fellow_citation.cfm?id=1434422 | accessdate=2010-06-13 | title=ACM Fellows Award: Carlo Ghezzi | publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] }}</ref>) and 2006 [[IEEE Fellow]] (citation: "for contributions to programming languages and software engineering"<ref>{{ cite web | publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] | url=http://www.ieee.org/membership_services/membership/fellows/chronology/fellows_2006.html | title=IEEE Fellow Class of 2006 | accessdate=2010-06-13 }}</ref>). In 2006, he was awarded the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[SIGSOFT]] Distinguished Service Award.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.sigsoft.org/awards/disSerAwd.htm | accessdate=2010-06-13 | title=ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Service Award | publisher=[[SIGSOFT]] }}</ref>  He is a Member of [[:it:Istituto lombardo di scienze e lettere|Istituto Lombardo Accademia di Scienze e Lettere]].

==Professional service==
He is a regular member of the program committee of important conferences of the [[software engineering]] field, such as the [[International Conference on Software Engineering]] (ICSE) and the [[Foundations of Software Engineering]] (FSE) conference, jointly held in conjunction with the [[European Software Engineering Conference]] (ESEC).

He has been chairing such conferences as program co-chair (ICSE 1991), program chair (ESEC/FSE '99), general chair ([http://www.ul.ie/~icse2000/organisation.html ICSE 2000]), and general co-chair (International Conference on Service Oriented Computing, [http://conferences.ece.ubc.ca/icsoc2006/ ICSOC 2006]).

He has been a keynote speaker at several conferences, including ESEC 1993,  the  IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance (ICSM 1997),  the European Joint Conference on Theory and Practice of Software ([http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/etaps06/ ETAPS 2006]), [http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/events/icse2009/home/ ICSE 2009], the IEEE International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems ([http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/ICECCS2010/ ICECCS 2010]), the IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Formal Methods ([http://www.sefm2010.isti.cnr.it/ SEFM 2010]), the International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement ([http://esem2010.case.unibz.it/ ESEM 2010]), ServiceWave ([http://servicewave.eu/2010/ ServiceWave 2010]), and Fundamentals of Software Engineering ([http://fsen.ir/2011/ FSEN 2011]).

He has been [[Editor in Chief]] of  ''[http://tosem.acm.org/ ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology]'' (2001–2006) and Associate Editor of ''[[IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering]]''. He is currently an Associate Editor of ''[http://www.elsevier.com/locate/scico Science of Computer Programming]'' ([[Elsevier]]), ''[http://www.springer.com/computer/communication+networks/journal/11761 Service Oriented Computing and Applications]'' ([[Springer Science+Business Media]]), and ''[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/15482/home Software Process Improvement and Practice]'' ([[John Wiley & Sons]]).

==Research==
His research has been constantly focused on different facets of [[software engineering]] and [[programming languages]]. Currently, he is active in the area of [[software architecture]]s, especially evolvable and distributed software architectures for ubiquitous and pervasive computer applications. His long term goal has been to contribute to making software more and more dependable, basing it on solid and rigorous methodological and theoretical foundations.

Ghezzi has co-authored over 180 papers, almost all of which are published internationally. His papers appeared on prestigious journals like the ''[[Journal of the ACM]]'', ''Information and Control'' (now ''[[Information and Computation]]''), ''[http://tosem.acm.org/ ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology]'', ''[http://userweb.cs.utexas.edu/~toplas/ ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems]'', ''[[IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering]]''.  

He is the co-author of 8 books, including:
* ''Programming Language Concepts''. With [[Mehdi Jazayeri|M. Jazayeri]]. (First edition: [[John Wiley & Sons]], 1982; ISBN 0-471-08755-6. Second edition: [[John Wiley & Sons]], 1987; ISBN 0-471-82173-X. Third edition: [[John Wiley & Sons]], 1998; ISBN 0-471-10426-4)
* ''Theoretical Foundations of Computer Science''. With D. Mandrioli. ([[John Wiley & Sons]], 1987; ISBN 0-471-83834-9)
