<html> <head> <title>David Maier</title></head><body>'''David Maier''' is a professor of computer science at [[Portland State University]].

He has been chairman of the program committee of ACM [[SIGMOD]]. He also served as an associate editor of [[ACM Transactions on Database Systems]]. Maier has consulted with [[Tektronix]], Inc., [[Servio Corporation]], the [[Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation]] (MCC), [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], [[Altair]], [[Honeywell]], [[Texas Instruments]], [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], [[Informix]], [[Oracle Corporation]], [[NCR Corporation|NCR]], and [[Object Design]], as well as several governmental agencies. He is a founding member of the [[Data-Intensive Systems Center]] (DISC), a joint project of [[OGI]] and [[Portland State University]]. He is the author of books on relational databases, logic programming and [[object-oriented database]]s,<ref>[[Malcolm P. Atkinson]], [[Fran√ßois Bancilhon]], [[David DeWitt]], [[Klaus R. Dittrich]], David Maier, [[Stanley Zdonik]]: The Object-Oriented Database System Manifesto. DOOD 1989: 223-240.</ref> as well as papers in [[database theory]], object-oriented technology and scientific databases. He received the [[Presidential Young Investigator Award]] from the [[National Science Foundation]] in 1984 and was awarded the 1997 [[SIGMOD Edgar F. Codd Innovations Award]] for his contributions in objects and databases. He is also an ACM Fellow. He holds a B.A. in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Oregon (Honors College, 1974) and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science by [[Princeton University]] (1978).

Maier established some of the earliest results on using the [[relational model]]. Together with his thesis advisor, [[Jeffrey Ullman]], and fellow Princeton students, including [[Alberto O. Mendelzon]]  and [[Yeshoshua Sagiv]], he co-authored a number of influential papers that laid out the fundamental issues and approaches for relational databases. In a now-famous paper (Maier, Mendelzon and Sagiv, TODS 1979), he introduced the chase, a method for testing implication of data dependencies that is now of widespread use in the database theory literature.<ref>David Maier, [[Alberto O. Mendelzon]], [[Yehoshua Sagiv]]: Testing Implications of Data Dependencies. ACM Trans. Database Syst. 4(4): 455-469 (1979).</ref> This work has been highly influential: it is used, directly or indirectly, on an everyday basis by people who design databases, and it is used in commercial systems to reason about the consistency and correctness of a data design. New applications of the chase in meta-data management and data exchange are still being discovered.

He is credited for coining the term [[Datalog]].<ref>Serge Abiteboul, Richard Hull, Victor Vianu: Foundations of databases. p305 [http://books.google.com/books?id=HN9QAAAAMAAJ&q=David+Maier&pgis=1#search_anchor].</ref>
