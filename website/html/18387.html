'''Infoshop.org''' is an [[anarchist]] website and project of the [[Alternative Media Project]].

== History ==
Infoshop was founded in January 1995 as the Mid-Atlantic Infoshop by [[Chuck Munson]].<ref name=alas>"[http://www.infoshop.org/inews/article.php?story=2008spain-interviews-chuck Alasbarricadas interviews Infoshop founder, Chuck Munson]", Infoshop.org, 2008-02-20.</ref> Having previously co-founded an online archive of anarchist texts, the [[Spunk Library]], in 1992, Munson established Infoshop as a general resource on anarchism, moving to the domain name Infoshop.org in 1998.<ref name=alas/> Munson reorganized the website as a collective project in 2001, and {{asof|November 2008|lc=on}}, it is run by a core of nine people, supplemented by regular writers and volunteers.<ref name=alas/> Having previously being involved in publishing ''[[Practical Anarchy]]'' magazine, the collective announced plans on launching a quarterly magazine titled ''Infoshop News & Views'' to go "head-to-head against other American leftist magazines".<ref name=alas/>

== Features ==
A prominent feature of the site is Infoshop News, an open publishing newswire similar to that of [[Indymedia]].<ref name=owens/> Initiated in 1997, the news service is one of several thousand [[English language]] publishers carried by [[Google News]]. The site has a number of other sections, including forums, and wikis. In April 2008, a link aggregator, Infoshop Links was launched, using software based on popular [[social bookmarking]] service [[Digg]].<ref>

</ref> The site also mirrors the anarchist-written [[FAQ]] "[[An Anarchist FAQ]]". A 2003 academic study of anarchist websites found that Infoshop was "the key anarchist site" and the only core anarchist site to closely cover the contemporary anarchist movement in addition to [[anarchist theory]].<ref name=owens>{{Cite journal
