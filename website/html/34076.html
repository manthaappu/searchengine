In [[fiction]], '''setting''' includes the [[time]], [[location (geography)|location]], and everything in which a [[storytelling|story]] takes place, and initiates the main [[Theatrical scenery|backdrop]] and [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] for a story. Setting has been referred to as story world <ref>[[#Truby|Truby]], 2007, p. 145</ref> or '''[[Social environment|milieu]]''' to include a [[Context (language use)|context]] (especially [[society]]) beyond the immediate surroundings of the story. Elements of setting may include [[culture]], [[historical period]], [[geography]], and [[hour]]. Along with [[Plot (narrative) | plot]], [[Character (arts) | character]], [[Theme (literature) | theme]], and [[Style (fiction) | style]], setting is considered one of the fundamental components of [[fiction]].<ref>[[#Obstfeld|Obstfeld]], 2002, p. 1, 65, 115, 171.</ref>  A setting is the time, place and social environment in which a story takes place.

==Role of setting==
Setting is a key role in plot, as in man vs. nature or man vs. society stories. In some stories the setting becomes a character itself. <ref>[[#Rozelle|Rozelle]], 2005, p. 2.</ref>  In such roles setting may be considered a [[plot device]] or [[literary device]].

The term "setting" is often used to refer to the social milieu in which the events of a novel occur.<ref>[[#Lodge|Lodge]], 1992, pps. 58-60.</ref> Novelist and novel-writing instructor [[Donna Levin]] has described how this social milieu shapes the characters’ values.<ref>[[#Levin|Levin]], 1992, pps.110-112.</ref> For example, the average citizen of Berkeley in the 1960s had very different attitudes towards authority, money, and pre-marital sex than those of the Antebellum South.
