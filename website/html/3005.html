'''Avonite''' ''Studio'' collection is a [[polyester]] solid-surface material.

'''Avonite''' ''Foundations'' collection is an [[acrylic resin|acrylic]] solid surface material.  

Both '''Avonite''' series are solid surfaces that have a textured [[granite]] or [[gemstone]] look manufactured by the company ''Avonite Surfaces'' and ''Aristech Acrylics LLC''. Avonite resembles stone, with the color being the same throughout the material. It is a popular material for use in baths and kitchens (as [[countertop]]s) since it can be worked and polished with woodworking tools. 

'''Avonite''' also manufacturers a 40% Post Industrial RECYCLED series of solid surfaces.
