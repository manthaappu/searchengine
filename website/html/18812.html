'''Interaction nets''' are a low level graphical computation paradigm first proposed by [[Yves Lafont]] and based on [[Jean-Yves Girard]]<nowiki>'s</nowiki> [[proof net]]s for [[linear logic]].  An interaction net system comprises: a set of agents, each with one principal port and zero or more auxiliary ports; a set of rules between agents (there is at most one rule for every pair of agents); and a net on which the rules are to be applied.  Compared to traditional term syntax, interaction nets enforce linearity -- each resource is used exactly once --, from which we can derive strong [[Confluence (term rewriting)|confluence]]. Thus, they provide a natural language for massive parallelism. 

They are also at the heart of the efficient and optimal, in Levy's sense, [[Evaluation strategy|evaluator]]s for [[lambda calculus]] available today.
