'''ATI Technologies Inc''', is a major designer and supplier of [[graphics processing unit]]s and motherboard [[chipsets]] based in [[Canada]]. In 2006, the company was acquired by [[Advanced Micro Devices]] (AMD) and was renamed to the AMD Graphics Products group.  Despite the acquisition, the ATI brand was retained for graphics cards until August 30, 2010. AMD have announced that it will retire the "ATI" name and instead brand its graphics chipsets as "AMD" beginning in late 2010.<ref>http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/358774/ati_re-branded_amd/</ref>

ATi Technologies is a [[fabless semiconductor company]] conducting in-house [[research and development]] and [[outsourcing]] the [[manufacturing]] and assembly of its products. Its main competitor is [[NVIDIA]] in the graphics and handheld market. The flagship product, the [[Radeon]] series of graphics cards, directly competes with [[NVIDIA]]'s [[GeForce]]. These two companies' dominance of the market forced other manufacturers into niche roles.

==History==
Lee Ka Lau<ref>[http://www.giving.utoronto.ca/chairs/showchairs.asp?ID=19 University of Toronto Division of University Advancement page]. Retrieved February 28, 2008.</ref>, Benny Lau and Kwok Yuen Ho<ref>[http://www.ati.com/designpartners/media/bios/kyho.html K.Y. Ho biography on ATI website]</ref> founded ATI in 1985 as "Array Technologies Incorporated". Working primarily in the [[original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] field, ATI produced integrated graphics cards for PC manufacturers such as [[IBM]] and [[Commodore International|Commodore]]. By 1987, ATI had grown into an independent graphics-card retailer, introducing EGA Wonder and VGA Wonder graphics card product lines under its brand that year<ref>[http://www.amd.com/us-en/Weblets/0,,7832_10554,00.html?redir=AAMD04#1980 History of AMD at AMD.com]</ref>. In May 1991, the company released the Mach8, ATI's first product able to process graphics without the CPU. Debuting in 1992, the Mach32 offered improved memory bandwidth and [[graphical user interface|GUI]] acceleration performance. ATI Technologies Inc. went public in 1993 with stock listed at [[NASDAQ]] and [[Toronto Stock Exchange]].

In 1994, the Mach64 accelerator debuted, powering the Graphics Xpression and Graphics Pro Turbo, offering hardware support for [[YUV]]-to-[[RGB]] [[color space]] conversion in addition to hardware zoom; early techniques of hardware-based video acceleration.

ATI introduced its first combination of 2D and [[3D computer graphics|3D]] accelerator under the name [[ATI Rage|3D Rage]]. This chip was based on the Mach 64, but it featured elemental 3D acceleration. The ATI Rage line powered almost the entire range of ATI graphics products. In particular, the [[ATI Rage|Rage Pro]] was one of the first viable 2D-plus-3D alternatives to [[3Dfx]]'s 3D-only Voodoo chipset. 3D acceleration in the Rage line advanced from the basic functionality within the initial 3D Rage to a more advanced [[DirectX|DirectX 6.0]] accelerator in the 1999 [[ATI Rage|Rage 128]].

The [[All-in-Wonder]] product line introduced in 1996 was the first combination of integrated graphics chip with [[TV tuner card]] and the first chip that enabled to display computer graphics on a TV set<ref>[http://www.amd.com/us-en/Weblets/0,,7832_10554,00.html?redir=AAMD04#1990 History of AMD - 1996 at AMD.com]</ref>. The cards featured 3D acceleration powered by ATI's second generation 3D Rage II, 64-bit 2D performance, TV-quality video acceleration, analog video capture, TV tuner functionality, flicker-free TV-out and stereo TV audio reception.

ATI made an entrance into the mobile computing sector by introducing 3D-graphics acceleration to [[laptop]]s in 1996. The Mobility product line had to meet requirements different from desktop PC, such as minimized power usage, reduced heat output, [[Transition Minimized Differential Signaling|TMDS]] output capabilities for laptop screens, and maximized integration. In 1997, ATI acquired [[Tseng Labs]]'s graphics assets, which included 40 [[engineer]]s.

The [[Radeon]] line of graphics products was unveiled in 2000. The initial Radeon [[graphics processing unit]] was an all-new design with DirectX 7.0 3D acceleration, video acceleration, and 2D acceleration. Technology developed for a specific Radeon generation could be built in varying levels of features and performance in order to provide products suited for the entire market range, from high-end to budget to mobile versions.

In 2000, ATI acquired [[ArtX]], which engineered the [[Nintendo GameCube#Graphics Processing Unit and System Chipset|Flipper]] graphics chip used in the [[Nintendo GameCube]] game console. They have also created a modified version of the chip (codenamed [[Hollywood (graphics chip)|Hollywood]]) for the successor of the [[GameCube]], the [[Wii]]. ATI was contracted by [[Microsoft]] to create the graphics core (codenamed [[Xenos (graphics chip)|Xenos]]) for the [[Xbox 360]]. Later in 2005, ATI acquired [[Terayon's]] cable modem [[silicon intellectual property]] strengthening their lead in the consumer digital television market<ref>[http://apps.ati.com/ir/PressReleaseText.asp?compid=105421&releaseID=671557 press release]</ref>. K. Y. Ho remained as Chairman of the Board until he retired in November 2005. [[David E. Orton|Dave Orton]] replaced him as the President and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of the organization.

On July 24, 2006, [[Advanced Micro Devices]] and ATI announced a plan to [[mergers and acquisitions|merge]] together in a deal valued at $5.4 billion. The merger closed on October 25, 2006<ref>[http://ir.ati.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=105421&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=921365&highlight= Press Release]</ref>. The acquisition consideration included over $2 billion financed from a loan and 56 million shares of AMD stock<ref>[http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/VirtualPressRoom/0,,51_104_543~113656,00.html AMD page]</ref>. ATI retained its name, logos and trademarks. ATI's then CEO Dave Orton was made the Executive Vice President of Visual and Media Businesses<ref>[http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/InvestorRelations/0,,51_306_14668,00.html AMD 2006 December Analyst Day page]</ref>.

It was reported that in December 2006 AMD/ATI, along with its main rival NVIDIA, received subpoenas from the [[United States Department of Justice]] regarding possible [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] violations in the graphics card industry<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9584_22-6140041.html|title=Justice Dept. subpoenas AMD, NVIDIA|publisher=New York Times|date= 1 December 2006}}</ref>.

In July 2007, AMD announced the resignation of Dave Orton. ATI, a subsidiary of AMD, is called the Graphics Product Group (GPG) inside the company<ref>[http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/InvestorRelations/0,,51_306_15086,00.html AMD 2007 Analyst Day page]</ref>. The top-level management of the Graphics Product Group consists of Rick Bergman, Senior Vice President and General Manager and Adrian Hartog, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Consumer Electronics Group. Both report to [[Dirk Meyer]], CEO of AMD<ref>[http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/AboutAMD/0,,51_52_570,00.html Corporate Information - Executive Biographies at AMD.com]</ref>.

On 30 August 2010, John Trikola announced that AMD will retire the "ATI" brand for its graphics chipsets, and will brand future products as "AMD".<ref>http://news.softpedia.com/news/AMD-Really-Dropping-the-ATI-Brand-154168.shtml</ref>

==Products==
[[Image:Ruby's Revenge 1024.jpg|right|thumb|300px|ATI's Ruby fictional female character.]]

In addition to developing high-end [[graphics processing unit|GPU]]s (originally called a VPU, visual processing unit, by ATI) for PCs And Apple Macs, ATI also designs embedded versions for laptops (Mobility Radeon), [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDA]]s and [[mobile phone]]s ([[Imageon]]), integrated motherboards (Radeon IGP), and others.

ATI promotes some of its products with the fictional "Ruby" female character, described as a "mercenary for hire."<ref>[http://ati.de/ruby/index.html Ruby's Headquarters at ATI.de]</ref> Computer-animated videos produced by RhinoFX about Ruby on a mission (being a sniper, saboteur, hacker and so on) are displayed at large technology shows such as ''CeBIT'' and [[Consumer Electronics Show|''CES'']].

===Computer graphics chipsets===
{{Expand list|date=April 2010}}

*'''[[ATI Wonder series|Graphics Solution / "Small Wonder"]]''' - Series of 8-bit [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] cards with [[Monochrome Display Adapter|MDA]], [[Hercules Graphics Card|Hercules]], [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] and [[Plantronics Colorplus|Plantronics Color+]] compatibility.

*'''[[ATI Rage|Rage]] Series''' - ATI's first 2D and [[3D accelerator]] chips. The series evolved from rudimentary 3D with 2D GUI acceleration and [[MPEG-1]] capability, to a highly competitive [[Direct3D]] 6 accelerator with then "best-in-class" DVD ([[MPEG2]]) acceleration. The various chips were very popular with [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]]s of the time. The Rage II was used in the first ATI [[All-In-Wonder]] multi-function video card, and more advanced All-In-Wonders based on Rage series GPUs followed. (1995–2004)
**'''[[ATI_Rage#Mobility|Rage Mobility]]''' - Designed for use in low-power environments, such as notebooks. These chips were functionally similar to their desktop counterparts, but had additions such as advanced [[power management]], [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] interfaces, and [[Multi monitor|dual monitor]] functionality.

*'''[[Radeon]] Series''' - Launched in 2000, the Radeon line is ATI's brand for their consumer 3D accelerator add-in cards. The original ''Radeon DDR'' was ATI's first DirectX 7 3D accelerator, introducing their first hardware [[transform and lighting|T&L]] engine. ATI often produced 'Pro' versions with higher clock speeds, and sometimes an extreme 'XT' version, and even more recently 'XT Platinum Edition (PE)' and 'XTX' versions. The Radeon series was the basis for many ATI All-In-Wonder boards.
**'''[[Radeon|Mobility Radeon]]''' - A series of power-optimized versions of Radeon graphics chips for use in laptops.  They introduced innovations such as modularized RAM chips, [[DVD]] (MPEG2) acceleration, notebook GPU card sockets, and "[[ATI PowerPlay|PowerPlay]]" power management technology.

*'''[[AMD 700 chipset series]]''' - exclusively for AMD processors, this is a chipset family supporting [[Phenom (processor)|Phenom]] processors and [[AMD Quad FX platform|Quad FX enthusiast platform]] (790FX), enthusiast chipset (790X), [[Integrated Graphics Processor|IGP]] (790GX, 785G, 780G, 740G) and single graphics card variants (770, 740) aimed at mainstream and value computing systems available.
*'''[[AMD 800 chipset series]]''' - exclusively for AMD processors, It includes support for up to six [[Serial ATA#SATA Revision 3.0 (SATA 6Gb/s)|SATA 6.0 Gbit/s]] ports, the C6 power state, which is featured in [[AMD Fusion|Fusion]] processors and [[Advanced Host Controller Interface|AHCI]] 1.2 with SATA [[port multiplier#FIS(Frame Information Structure)–based switching|FIS–based switching]] support. This is a chipset family supporting [[Phenom (processor)|Phenom]] processors and [[AMD Quad FX platform|Quad FX enthusiast platform]] (890FX), [[Integrated Graphics Processor|IGP]](890GX).

In addition to the above chipset ATI has announced that a deal has been struck with [[CPU]] and [[Motherboard]] manufacturers as of 2005, particularly [[Asus]] and [[Intel]], to create onboard 3D Graphics solutions for [[Intel]]'s new range of motherboards that will be released with their range of [[Intel]] [[Pentium M]]-based desktop processors, the [[Intel Core]] and [[Intel Core 2]] processors, the D101GGC and D101GGC2 chipset (codenamed "''Grand County''"<ref>[http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/32/94/329441_329441.pdf Intel Boxed Desktop Board Quick Guide (December 2006)]</ref>) based on the [[Xpress 200|Radeon Xpress 200]] chipset. However, high-end boards with integrated graphics processor (IGP) will still use [[Intel]] [[Intel GMA|GMA]] [[graphics processing unit|integrated graphics processor]]s. The deal with Intel was deemed to be officially ended with the purchase of ATI Technologies from AMD in July 2006, with Intel announcing [[Silicon Integrated Systems|SiS]] IGP chipset (D201GLY chipset, codenamed "''Little Valley''") for entry-level desktop platform, replacing the "''Grand County''" series chipsets.

===Multimedia and Digital TV products===
*'''[[All-In-Wonder]]''' series - A series of multimedia graphics cards which incorporating TV tuner and [[Radeon]] family [[video card|graphics card]]s onto one add-in card, which, after being seemingly discontinued was relaunched as All-In-Wonder HD on June 26, 2008.
*TV tuners
**'''TV Wonder''' and '''HDTV Wonder''' - a chipset family providing TV reception of various analog TV and digital TV signals ([[PAL]], [[NTSC]], [[ATSC]], [[DVB-T]] and so on) with first generation [[AVIVO]] technology, also supporting [[CableCARD]], and [[QAM tuner|Clear QAM]] technologies.
**'''Theater''' - a family of [[QAM]] and [[Single-sideband modulation|VSB]] demodulators for the Digital Cable ready and [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]] environments.
*'''Remote Wonder''', wireless remote control series for ATI multimedia products. Operates using radio frequency, away from mainstream implementations using [[Infrared#Communications|infrared]].

===Console graphics products===
*'''[[Nintendo GameCube#Technical specifications|Flipper]]''' - The [[Nintendo GameCube]] (codenamed "dolphin" during production) contains a 3D accelerator developed by ''ArtX, Inc'', a company acquired by ATI during the development of the GPU. Flipper is similar in capability to a [[Direct3D]] 7 accelerator chip. It consists of four rendering pipelines, with hardware [[transform and lighting|T&L]], and some limited pixel shader support. Innovatively the chip has 3 [[MiB]] of embedded [[1T-SRAM]] for use as ultra-fast low-latency (6.2 [[nanosecond|ns]]) texture and [[framebuffer]]/[[Z-buffer]] storage allowing 10.4 [[gigabytes|GB]]/second bandwidth (extremely fast for the time). Flipper was designed by members of the [[Nintendo 64]] Reality Coprocessor team who moved from SGI. The Flipper team went on to have a major hand in the development of the [[Radeon 9700]].
*'''[[Xenos (graphics chip)|Xenos]]''' - [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox 360]] video game console contains a custom graphics chip produced by ATI, known as "R500", "C1", or more often as ''Xenos''. Some of these features include the embedded DRAM ([[eDRAM]]). The Xenos also features the “True Unified Shader Architecture” which dynamically loads and balances pixel and vertex processing amongst a bank of identically capable processing units. This differs greatly from past-generations PC graphics chips that have separate banks of processors designed for their individual task (vertex/fragment). Another feature presented in Xenos is the hardware [[tessellation#Tessellations and computer graphics|surface tessellation]] to divide a surface into smaller triangles, similar to [[TruForm]] in terms of functionality, which is an advanced feature as it is not presented even in the most up-to-date [[Direct3D#Direct3D 10|DirectX 10]] specification. The recent generation [[Radeon R600]] GPU core inherited most of the features presented in Xenos, except [[eDRAM]].
*'''[[Hollywood (graphics chip)|Hollywood]]''' - Successor to Flipper. Part of [[Nintendo]]'s latest gaming console, [[Wii]].

===Handheld chipsets===
*'''[[Imageon]]''' - [[System-on-a-chip]] (SoC) design introduced in 2002 to bring integrated [[2D computer graphics|2D]] and [[3D computer graphics|3D]] graphics to handhelds devices, cellphones and [[Tablet PC]]s. Current top-of-line product is the Imageon 2298 which includes DVD quality recording and playback, TV output, and supports up to a 12-[[megapixel]] camera, with another line of Imageon products, the 2300 series supporting [[OpenGL]] ES 1.1+ extensions. The Imageon line was rebranded under AMD, after AMD acquired ATI in Q3 2006, as '''AMD Imageon'''.
*'''[[Imageon|Imageon TV]]''' - Announced in February 2006, allowing handhelds devices to receive digital broadcast TV ([[DVB-H]]) signals and enables watching TV programs on these devices, the chipset includes tuner, demodulator, decoder, and a full software stack, operates alongside the [[Imageon]] chip.

Besides full products, ATI has also supplied 3D and 2D graphics components to other vendors, specifically the [[Qualcomm]]<ref>[http://brew.qualcomm.com/bnry_brew/pdf/brew_2007/Tech-303_Ligon.pdf page 10 and 15]</ref> [[MSM7000]] series SoC chips of handheld and upcoming [[Freescale]] i. MX processors<ref>[http://www.dailytech.com/Freescale+Licenses+AMD+Technologies/article8909.htm DailyTech report]. Retrieved September 17, 2007.</ref>. ATI claimed in May 2006, that it had sold over 100 million<ref>[http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=31938 The Inquirer report]</ref> 'cell phone media co-processors', significantly more than ATI's rival NVIDIA, and announced in February 2007 that the firm had shipped a total of 200 million of Imageon products since 2003<ref>[http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/VirtualPressRoom/0,,51_104_543~115795,00.html AMD press release]. Retrieved July 27, 2007.</ref>.

In late 2008, the entire handheld division was sold off to [[Qualcomm]], so there will be no new Imageon products.

===High Performance Computing===
*'''[[AMD FireStream]]''', originally ATI Firestream, and previously rebranded as '''AMD Stream Processor''' for a short period of time, utilizing the [[stream processing]] concept, together with [[Close to Metal]] (CTM) hardware interface.

==ATI graphics drivers==
===Proprietary===
{{Main|ATI Catalyst}}

ATI currently provides proprietary graphics [[Device Driver|drivers]], and also assists development of open source drivers. The proprietary drivers are called ATI Catalyst, and are available for most platforms: [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]], [[Microsoft]] [[Windows 7]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[Linux]]. Linux users can also opt to use open source drivers.

===Open source===
{{Main|Graphics hardware and FOSS#ATI/AMD|l1=Graphics hardware and FOSS}}

Hardware component companies which only provide proprietary drivers have always been urged by the Linux community to open source their drivers, or at least provide the necessary documentation for the community to write their own drivers. In a 2002 interview with AMD official Hal Speed, it was suggested that AMD were strongly considering making the functional part of the ATI drivers open source<ref>[http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/08/02/32OPcurve_1.html 'AMD talks about ATI' at InfoWorld.com]</ref>. However, until the merger with AMD, ATI had no plans to release their graphics drivers as open source code:
{{Quote|Proprietary, patented optimizations are part of the value we provide to our customers and we have no plans to release these drivers to open source. In addition, multimedia elements such as content protection must not, by their very nature, be allowed to go open source.|[http://news.com.com/2061-10791_3-6104655.html ATI statement, August 2006]}}

Since 2007 ATI has cooperated with the development of open source graphics drivers. Although ATI has not made their Catalyst drivers open source, the programming specifications for a number of chipsets and features were published in several rounds. This greatly changed their support of the development of open source graphics drivers, as until that moment only unsupported open source drivers existed. Besides releasing the specifications, ATI also funded the development of new open source drivers, by Novell, for the newest generation of video cards.
