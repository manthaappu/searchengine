'''P.I.P.S.''' is a term ([[recursive acronym]]) for Symbian software libraries that means, '''P'''.I.P.S. '''I'''s '''P'''OSIX on '''S'''ymbian OS. It is intended to help [[C (programming language)|C]] language [[programmer]]s in migration of [[Desktop environment|desktop]] and [[Application server|server]] [[middleware]], [[Application software|application]]s to [[Symbian OS]] based mobile [[smartphone]] devices. <ref>[http://www.symbian.com/news/pr/2007/pr20078721.html Symbian introduces POSIX libraries on Symbian OS]</ref>

==Software libraries==

The PIPS [[Library (computing)|software libraries]] provides [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] [[application programming interface]]s in standard [[C (programming language)|C]] libraries such as 

* POSIX
** libc - The "C Standard Library" with system APIs mapped to Symbian OS APIs for better performance
** libm - A mathematical library
** libpthread - Implements POSIX-style threading support in terms of the underlying Symbian OS thread support
** libdl - Implements POSIX-style dynamic linking which extends the dynamic loading model of Symbian OS
* LIBZ
** libz
* OpenSSL
** libcrypt
** libcrypto
** libssl
* GNOME
** libglib

==Limitations==

The P.I.P.S. environment does not support signals. This lack of support for signals means that [[Inter-process_communication|IPC]] with signals is also not supported. Under P.I.P.S., I/O must be carried out in a synchronous manner.

==Extensions and successors: Open C and Open C++==
Open C and Open C++ are extensions by Nokia of P.I.P.S. In contrast to mere  P.I.P.S., they were only for [[Series 60]] phones. <ref>Wilcox, Mark and others, ''Porting to the Symbian Platform''', pages 106-107, 2009, Wiley</ref>
