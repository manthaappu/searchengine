'''FAMOS''' is a graphical data analysis program for evaluating and visually displaying measurement results. The program, whose name is an acronym for '''''F'''ast '''A'''nalysis And '''M'''onitoring '''O'''f '''S'''ignals'', was introduced in 1987 by the German company imc Meßsysteme GmbH (integrated measurement & control) in Berlin for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] 2.11. According to its manufacturer, FAMOS offers high speed display and processing of data sets of any size.

== Import of a wide variety of data formats ==
FAMOS can import data from different file formats, e.g. [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]]-, [[Binary file|Binary]]-, [[ASCII]]- or [[Matlab]]-files. With a file assistant it is also possible to create different import filters. It is possible to present the data in different grafical ways. The information can be combined, labeled and processed. 
FAMOS is able to store data in a proprietary as well as in [[ASCII]] or [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] [[File format| format]].

== Data analysis  ==
Imported data can be processed with a variety of mathematical operations, either manually or in automated procedures. FAMOS offers expansion modules for special operations such as electronic filters, for spectral analysis and for synchronized display of data and video sequences and for the [[Association for Standardisation of Automation and Measuring Systems|ASAM-ODS data model]]. It is also possible to play data back audibly with the PC sound card.

== Documentation ==
By means of its "Report Generator", FAMOS enables creation of documentations / lab reports  consisting of a variety of dialog elements and plots as well as graphics with controls which can be automatically hidden when printing. The reports generated can be subject to post-processing using various input data, and there are templates for partially or fully automated composition of reports.
