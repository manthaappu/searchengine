<html> <head> <title>FXG</title></head><body>'''FXG''' (Flash XML Graphics) is an [[XML]] graphics file format being developed by [[Adobe Systems]], as well as handling the capabilities of Adobe Flash. FXG is planned as a graphics interchange format for cross-application file support <ref name="spec">[http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/FXG+1.0+Specification FXG 1.0 specification]</ref><ref name="spec2">[http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/FXG+2.0+Specification FXG 2.0 specification]</ref>. Mark Anders noted on his blog that the specification was not being developed for inter-operability between Adobe products and third-parties, nor is the specification being designed to refactor a middle-aged file format for fidelity rather than elegance; Mark Anders noted that the first aim the specification was designed for was componentized graphics <ref name="motivation">[http://www.andersblog.com/archives/2009/05/post.html Mark Anders blog - Thoughts on FXG Design and Motivation]</ref>.

== Capabilities ==
It is noted on the specification website that ''"The FXG rendering model follows very closely the Flash Player 10 rendering model and exposes all graphics capabilities of the Flash platform as well as offering expandable support to accommodate future capabilities of the Flash Player <ref name="spec" /><ref name="spec2" />"''.

== Relation to other XML formats ==
The XML model for FXG is based as closely as possible on SVG<ref name="spec" /><ref name="spec2" />. There were some early misconceptions that the FXG file format was designed to be a standard for [[raster graphics]] file interchange, this has since been demonstrated to be incorrect <ref name="motivation" /><ref>[http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2009/05/adobe-fxg-and-ooxml-the-big-fi.html Rick Jelliffe - Adobe's FXG and Microsofts OOXML]</ref>.

== Interoperability ==
The FXG format is being created to allow Adobe products to share a common file format <ref>[http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2009/05/some_thoughts_about_psd.html John Nacks Blog - some thoughts about psd]</ref>.  The nature of the file format was questioned on the [[Create Project]] mailing list <ref>[http://www.mail-archive.com/create@lists.freedesktop.org/msg01427.html Create Project Mailing List - OpenRaster Vs. FXG]</ref>, where an employee of Adobe mentioned that it was a company policy to document file formats so that third parties could write and read these formats <ref>[http://www.mail-archive.com/create@lists.freedesktop.org/msg01447.html Leonard Rosenthol - Reply to create list thread OpenRaster vs. FXG]</ref>.
