<html> <head> <title>Collection catalog</title></head><body>In [[museum]]s and [[archive]]s, the [[Collection (museum)|collection]] of [[Object (museum)|objects]] or material is normally catalogued in a '''collection catalog''' (or '''collections catalog'''). Traditionally this was done using a [[card index]], but nowadays it is normally implemented using a computerized [[database]] (known as a '''collection database''') and may even be made available online.
