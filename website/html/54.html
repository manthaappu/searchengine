'''2-choice hashing''', also known as '''2-choice chaining''', is a variant of a [[hash table]] in which keys are added by hashing with two [[hash function]]s. The key is put in the array position with the fewer (colliding) keys. Some [[collision resolution scheme]] is needed, unless keys are kept in buckets. The [[average-case cost]] of a successful search is [[Big O notation|O(2 + (m-1)/n)]], where m is the number of keys and n is the size of the array. The most collisions is <math>\log_2 \ln n + \theta(m/n)</math> with high probability.
