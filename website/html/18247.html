<html> <head> <title>Informal fallacy</title></head><body>An '''informal fallacy''' is an [[Logical argument|argument]] whose stated premises fail to support their proposed conclusion.<ref>Kelley, D. (1994) ''The Art of Reasoning''. W W Norton & Company, Inc. ISBN 0-393-96466-3</ref> The deviation in an informal [[fallacy]] often stems from a flaw in the path of [[reason]]ing that links the premises to the conclusion. In contrast to a [[formal fallacy]], the error has to do with issues of [[inference|ratiocination]] manifest in [[natural language|language]] used to state the propositions; the range of elements that can be symbolized by language is broader than that which the symbolism of [[Mathematical logic|formal logic]] can represent.

== Deductive and inductive informal fallacies ==
Informal fallacies of [[deductive reasoning]] contain a fundamental disconnect between the premises and the conclusion that renders the argument [[validity|invalid]]. This disconnect often stems from the presence of a hidden [[co-premise]] that, if presented, would validate the argument.

[[Inductive reasoning|Inductive]] informal fallacies are slightly different from their deductive counterparts, as their merit rests in the [[Statistical inference|inductive strength]] of the premise-conclusion link rather than in the presence of hidden premises. For instance, the fallacy of [[hasty generalization]], can be roughly stated as:

:p) ''A'' is an ''X''
:p) ''A'' is also a ''Y''
:c) therefore, all ''X''s are also ''Y''s

If the populations ''X'' and ''Y'' are both too large to sample completely, then the statement is inductive. In such a case, a hasty generalization occurs when the number of ''X''s and ''Y''s is insufficient to represent the respective populations. It is important to distinguish between a principle of [[reasoning]] (deductive or inductive) and the premise of an argument.
