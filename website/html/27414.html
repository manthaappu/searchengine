'''OpenOpt''' is an open-source optimization framework licensed under the [[BSD licenses|BSD]] license, making it available to be used in both open- and closed-code software. 

The framework interfaces with many different algorithms for solving [http://openopt.org/Problems optimization problems] (solvers), both free (e.g. [[IPOPT]], Algencan, [[GLPK]]) and commercial (e.g. [[CPLEX]]). Some solvers are written in [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[Fortran]], and there are some Python-written own ones (e.g., [http://openopt.org/ralg ralg]). OpenOpt-connected solvers can have any type of license, but are primarily open source and OSI-approved ones such as [[GPL]], [[LGPL]], and [[BSD licenses|BSD]].

Originally developed in [[MATLAB]], OpenOpt is now developed in [[Python programming language|Python]] and has a single dependence: [[NumPy]] (numerical package for low-level matrix operations, well-known for [[Python_language|Python]] language programmers, with some code written in C, Fortran languages and wrappers to [[BLAS]], [[LAPACK]], [[ACML]], [[Math_Kernel_Library|MKL]] etc). This makes OpenOpt easy to install and OS-independent. 

If you have a model written in [[FuncDesigner]] (another software from OpenOpt developers), it can be optimized with first derivatives obtained via [[Automatic differentiation]]. Also, it can be used mere like a language of mathematical formulas, possibly with recursive import of variables/formulas from other files.

Both OpenOpt and [[FuncDesigner]] can solve constrained large-scale problems involving [[Sparse_matrix|sparse matrices]].

The software already has some essential [http://openopt.org/Applications applications] and is expected to become even more popular with [http://forum.openopt.org/viewtopic.php?id=67 Python release 3.3, where Just-In-Time accelerator will be done]. 

You can try OpenOpt and FuncDesigner on-line (without installation) via the [http://openopt.org/TryOnline SAGE-server]

Also OpenOpt website powers a numerical optimization forum.
