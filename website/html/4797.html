'''Business logic''', or '''domain logic''', is a non-technical term generally used to describe the functional [[algorithm]]s that handle [[information exchange]] between a [[database]] and a [[user interface]].

== Scope of business logic ==
Business logic:
* models [[real life]] business objects (such as accounts, loans, itineraries, and inventories)
* prescribes how business objects interact with one another
* enforces the routes and the methods by which business objects are accessed and updated

Business logic comprises:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ebizq.net/topics/bpm/features/5757.html?&pp=1|title=The Challenge of BPM Adoption|date=2005-03-27|author=Steven Minsky|publisher=eBizQ}}</ref>
* [[business rule]]s that express business policy (such as channels, location, logistics, prices, and products); and
* [[workflow]]s that are the ordered tasks of passing documents or data from one participant (a person or a software system) to another.

== Location of business logic ==
[[Image:Overview of a three-tier application vectorVersion.svg|thumb|right|Business logic in theory occupies the middle tier of a 3-tier architecture.]]
In single-tier applications, business logic, presentation logic, and [[CRUD (acronym)|CRUD]] are often fused, with each having intimate knowledge of, or being strongly [[coupling (computer science)|coupled]] to, the others.  This is seen as problematic, since changes to one result in changes to both of the others, requiring retesting and revalidation of the entire system for a single change.  The interweaving also limits the extent to which the CRUD and the business logic can be [[reusability|reused]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.awprofessional.com/articles/article.aspx?p=24260&seqNum=3|chapter=Introduction to Enterprise Software|author=Khawar Zaman Ahmed and Cary E.

In a [[multilayered architecture]] (compared to [[multitier architecture]]) business logic is a separate module.  In the common [[Three-tier (computing)|3-tier architecture]], the business logic in theory occupies the middle tier, the business-services tier or [[business layer]].  In practice, the business logic is often interwoven in the other two tiers (the user services tier and the database services tier), such as by encoding business logic in [[stored procedure]]s and in decisions about input validation and display formatting. However there is not a well defined rule:
<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codeproject.com/KB/architecture/DudeWheresMyBusinessLogic.aspx|title=Dude, where's my business logic?|author=Chad Z. Hower|work=The Code Project}}</ref> Chad Hower and others advocate storing ''all'' business logic in a business layer, and not encoding any business logic in the application's user services or database services tiers, while <ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.inter.nl.net/users/T.Koppelaars/J2EE_DB_CENTRIC.doc|title=A database-centric approach to J2EE application development|author=T. Koppelaars}}</ref> T. Koppelaars and others are for placing the business logic layer in the database using stored procedures.

==Tools for handling business logic==
Business logic can be extracted from procedural code using a [[BRMS|business rule management system]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Bring business logic to light: JRules 4.5 tames business rules with friendly tools|author=James Owen|publisher=JavaWorld|date=2003-09-19|url=http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-09-2003/jw-0919-iw-jrules.html}}</ref>
