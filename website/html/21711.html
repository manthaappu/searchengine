In [[mathematics]], a '''linear approximation''' is an approximation of a general [[function (mathematics)|function]] using a [[linear function]] (more precisely, an [[affine function]]). They are widely used in the method of [[finite differences]] to produce first order methods for solving or approximating solutions to equations.

==Definition==
Given a twice continuously differentiable function ''f'' of one [[real number|real]] variable, [[Taylor's theorem]] for the case ''n'' = 1 states that

:<math> f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + R_2\ </math>

where <math>R_2</math> is the remainder term. The linear approximation is obtained by dropping the remainder:

:<math> f(x) \approx f(a) + f'(a)(x - a).</math><ref>Some calculus textbooks write d''x'' for ''x''−''a'' (the change in ''x''), and then define d''f'':=''f''′(''a'')(''x''−''a'') so as to have a numerical equality d''f'' = ''f''′(''a'') d''x''.  This may be useful as a mnemonic for the fact that ''f''(''x'')−f(''a'') (the change in ''f'') is approximated by ''f''′(''a'')(''x''−''a''), but it conflicts with the actual definition of d''f'' as a [[differential form]].</ref>

This is a good approximation for ''x'' when it is close enough to ''a'' since a curve, when closely observed, will begin to resemble a straight line.  Therefore, the expression on the right-hand side is just the equation for the [[tangent line]] to the graph of ''f'' at (''a'',''f''(''a'')).  For this reason, this process is also called the '''tangent line approximation'''. 

Linear approximations for [[vector (geometric)|vector]] functions of a vector variable are obtained in the same way, with the derivative at a point replaced by the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] matrix. For example, given a differentiable function <math>f(x, y)</math> with real values, one can approximate  <math>f(x, y)</math> for <math>(x, y)</math> close to <math>(a, b)</math> by the formula
:<math>f\left(x,y\right)\approx f\left(a,b\right)+\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\left(a,b\right)\left(x-a\right)+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\left(a,b\right)\left(y-b\right).</math>

The right-hand side is the equation of the plane tangent to the graph of <math>z=f(x, y)</math> at <math>(a, b).</math>

In the more general case of [[Banach space]]s, one has

:<math> f(x) \approx f(a) + Df(a)(x - a)</math>

where <math>Df(a)</math> is the [[Fréchet derivative]] of <math>f</math> at <math>a</math>. 

To find an approximation of <math>\sqrt[3]{25}</math> one can do as follows.

# Consider the function <math> f(x)= x^{1/3}.\,</math> Hence, the problem is reduced to finding the value of <math>f(25)</math>.
# We have 
#:<math>f'(x)=\frac{x^{-2/3}}{3}=\frac{1}{3\sqrt[3]{x^2}}</math>
# According to linear approximation 
#:<math> f(25) \approx f(27) + f\ '(27)(25 - 27) = 3 - 2/27.</math>
# The result, 2.926, lies fairly close to the actual value 2.924…
