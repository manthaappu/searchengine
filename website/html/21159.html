A '''laptop/notebook cooler''', '''cooler pad''' or '''chill mat''' is an accessory for [[laptop]] computers that helps reduce their [[operating temperature]]. Normally used when the laptop's fan device is unable to sufficiently cool the laptop, a cooling pad may house active or passive cooling methods and rests beneath the laptop. Active coolers move air or liquid to direct heat away from the laptop quickly, while passive methods may rely on thermally conductive materials or increasing passive airflow.

==Active coolers==
Many cooler pads support the use of a power adapter, they typically run on power drawn through one of the laptop's [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] ports. Many cooler pads therefore compensate with a built-in USB hub. Other features include card readers for various forms of media such as [[keydrive]]s, [[memory card]]s, and 2.5" Laptop [[hard disk drive]]s.

Some of these "powered" coolers are designed to draw heat from the underside of the computer; others work in the opposite way by blowing cool air towards the machine. The fan speed is adjusted manually or automatically on certain models and on others stays at a fixed speed.

The contribution of heat from the energy requirement of the cooler is very minimal impact as USB ports are limited to 2.5 watts of output power, whereas a laptop can easily consume 40 W of electrical power.

==Passive coolers==
Typically, a  conductive cooling pad allows for the cooling of a laptop without using any power. These "Pads" are normally filled with an organic salt compound that allows them to absorb the heat from the laptop <ref name=" USpatent 7327340">[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=/netahtml/PTO/search-adv.htm&r=9&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=7324340&OS=7324340&RS=7324340 United States Patent 7,324,340]</ref>. They are good for a limited amount of time from around 6–8 hours of cooling. Other designs are simply a pad that elevates the laptop so that the fans in the laptop are allowed greater airflow.
