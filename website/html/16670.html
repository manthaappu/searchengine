'''High-water mark''' was introduced in Clark Weissmann's ''Security controls in the ADEPT-50 timesharing system'' published in the  AFIPS Conference Proceedings, volume 35, pages 119—133. FJCC, 1969.   It pre-dates the [[Bell-La Padula model‎|Bell-La Padula]] security model, whose first volume appeared in 1972. 

Under high-water mark, any object less than the user's security level can be opened, but the object is relabeled to reflect the highest security level currently open.  Hence the name.

The practical effect of the high-water mark was a gradual movement of all objects towards the highest security level in the system.  If user A is writing a CONFIDENTIAL document, and checks the unclassified dictionary, the dictionary becomes CONFIDENTIAL.  Then, when user B is writing a SECRET report and checks the spelling of a word, the dictionary becomes SECRET. Finally, if user C is assigned to assemble the daily intelligence briefing at the TOP SECRET level, reference to the dictionary makes the dictionary TOP SECRET, too.
