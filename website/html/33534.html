A '''search [[Suggestion|suggest]] [[drop-down list]]''' is a [[Query language|query]] feature used in [[computing]]. A quick system to show the searcher [[Computer shortcut|shortcut]]s, while the query is typed. Before the query has been typed, a drop-down list with the suggested complete search queries, is given as options to select and access. The suggested queries then enable the searcher to complete the required search quickly.

It is a form of [[Autocomplete|autocompletion]] while typing into a query [[text box]], before a detailed search result is entered. Lists can be based on popular searches or other options. The [[Computer science|computing science]] of [[syntax]] and [[algorithm]]s are used to form search results from data or a [[database]], with search suggested drop-down lists being a common industry standard for an instant search.

Search suggested lists are used by [[internet browsers]], [[website]]s and [[search engine]]s, local [[operating system]]s and [[database]]s.

[[Content management system]]s and frequent searches can assist [[Software engineering|software engineers]] in [[Optimization (computer science)|optimizing]] more refined queries with methods of parameters and subroutines. Suggestions can be results for the current query or related queries by words, time and dates, categories and [[Tag (metadata)|tags]]. The suggestion list may be reordered by other options, as [[Enumeration|enumerative]], [[Hierarchical organization|hierarchical]] or [[Faceted classification|faceted]].
