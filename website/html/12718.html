<html> <head> <title>Evolutionary programming</title></head><body>'''Evolutionary programming''' is one of the four major [[evolutionary algorithm]] paradigms.

It was first used by [[Lawrence J. Fogel]] in the US in 1960 in order to use simulated [[evolution]] as a learning process aiming to generate [[artificial intelligence]]. Fogel used [[finite state machine]]s as predictors and evolved them.
Currently evolutionary programming is a wide [[evolutionary computing]] dialect with no fixed structure or ([[Genetic representation|representation]]), in contrast with some of the other dialects. It is becoming harder to distinguish from [[Evolution strategy|evolutionary strategies]]. Some of its original variants are  quite similar to the later [[genetic programming]], except that the program structure is fixed and its numerical parameters are allowed to evolve.

Its main variation operator is [[Mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]]; members of the population are viewed as part of a specific species rather than members of the same species therefore each parent generates an offspring, using a (μ + μ) [[Selection (genetic algorithm)|survivor selection]].
