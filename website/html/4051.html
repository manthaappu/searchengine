Just like a "white balance" gives reference to true white to the CCDs, [[video camera]]s also have a function known as '''black balance'''.  Unlike [[Color temperature|white balance]], black balance is not adjusted every time. There is a lot of debate on whether it is necessary to do the black balance every time.    

Panasonic 102 XB camera operating instructions manual suggests that you black balance when:
*You use the camera for the first time
*Use the camera after a long time
*The [[Room temperature|ambient temperature]] changes greatly
*When you switch to normal shutter or slow shutter
*When switching between progressive and interlaced modes

Its main purpose is to eliminate any residual current being output from the pixel sites under conditions of complete darkness... often referred to as [[Johnsonâ€“Nyquist noise|thermal noise]]. That's why the camera will automatically close the iris completely when it does the black balance.

Conditions under which you may want to black balance are typically when the camera experiences a large change in [[operating temperature]], especially from colder to warmer. Otherwise, it is a periodic thing to allow for other minor factors that could come into play.

With CMOS sensor technology, black balancing may not be as necessary as it is with CCD type devices. We all talk about how clean and relatively noise free CMOS sensors are by design

Black balancing is done only in professional cameras. Amateur handycam users need not worry about black balance.  Professional camcorders like the Sony DSR 400, Panasonic [[DV|DVC Pro]] etc. have a switch which has to be flicked upwards to do the white balance.  The same switch when pressed downwards does a black balance.  In the Panasonic 102 3ccd series, the white balance switch when pressed just once triggers white balancing and when depressed and held for a few seconds completes the black balance.  Most cameramen never touch the black balance.  You can do the black balance if you feel that the colours are not truly represented even after doing the white balance.

Always CCD produce .25v electricity and given a Grey tint instead of black for compromising this adjust the black as black is very necessary so we adjusting the black balance for this purpose.
