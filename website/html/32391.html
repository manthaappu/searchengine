==RBAC Model==
Within an organization, [[role (computer science)|role]]s are created for various job functions.  The permissions to perform certain operations are assigned to specific roles.  Members of staff (or other system users) are assigned particular roles, and through those role assignments acquire the permissions to perform particular system functions. Since users are not assigned permissions directly, but only acquire them through their role (or roles), management of individual user rights becomes a matter of simply assigning appropriate roles to the user; this simplifies common operations, such as adding a user, or changing a user's department.

Three primary rules are defined for RBAC:

1. Role assignment: A subject can execute a transaction only if the subject has selected or been assigned a role.

2. Role authorization: A subject's active role must be authorized for the subject. With rule 1 above, this rule ensures that users can take on only roles for which they are authorized.

3. Transaction authorization: A subject can execute a transaction only if the transaction is authorized for the subject's active role. With rules 1 and 2, this rule ensures that users can execute only transactions for which they are authorized.

Additional constraints may be applied as well, and roles can be combined in a hierarchy where higher-level roles subsume permissions owned by sub-roles.


With the concepts of [[role hierarchy]] and constraints, one can control RBAC to create or simulate [[lattice-based access control]] (LBAC).  Thus RBAC can be considered a superset of LBAC.

When defining an RBAC model, the following conventions are useful:
* S     =       Subject                 =       A person or automated agent
* R	=	Role			=	Job function or title which defines an authority level
* P	=	Permissions		=	An approval of a mode of access to a resource
* SE	=	Session			=	A mapping involving S, R and/or P
* SA	=	Subject Assignment		 
* PA	=	Permission Assignment
* RH	=	Partially ordered role Hierarchy. RH can also be written: ≥ (The notation: x ≥ y means that x inherits the permissions of y.)
* A subject can have multiple roles.
* A role can have multiple subjects.
* A role can have many permissions.
* A permission can be assigned to many roles.

A constraint places a restrictive rule on the potential inheritance of permissions from opposing roles, thus it can be used to achieve appropriate separation of duties. For example, the same person should not be allowed to both create a login account and to authorize the account creation.

Thus, using [[set theory]] [[notation]]:
* <math>PA \subseteq P \times R</math> and is a many to many permission to role assignment relation.
* <math>SA \subseteq S \times R</math> and is a many to many subject to role assignment relation.
* <math>RH \subseteq R \times R</math>


A subject may have ''multiple'' simultaneous sessions with different permissions.

==Relation to Other Models==

Conversely, MAC can simulate RBAC if the role graph is restricted to a tree rather than a [[partially ordered set]].<ref>{{cite conference

Prior to the development of RBAC, MAC and DAC were considered to be the only known models for access control: if a model was not MAC, it was considered to be a DAC model, and vice versa. Research in the late 1990s demonstrated that RBAC falls in neither category.<ref>See [http://csrc.nist.gov/rbac/rbac-faq.html National Institute of Standards and Technology FAQ on RBAC models and standards], and the research of [http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/rbac/documents/ferraiolo-kuhn-92.pdf David Ferraiolo and Richard Kuhn]</ref> Unlike [[context-based access control]] (CBAC), RBAC does not look at the message context (such as a connection's source).

RBAC differs from [[access control lists]] (ACLs) used in traditional discretionary access control systems in that it assigns permissions to specific operations with meaning in the organization, rather than to low level data objects.  For example, an access control list could be used to grant or deny write access to a particular system file, but it would not dictate how that file could be changed.  In an RBAC-based system, an operation might be to create a 'credit account' transaction in a financial application or to populate a 'blood sugar level test' record in a medical application.  The assignment of permission to perform a particular operation is meaningful, because the operations are granular with meaning within the application.  RBAC has been shown to be particularly well suited to [[separation of duties]] (SoD) requirements, which ensure that two or more people must be involved in authorizing critical operations.  Necessary and sufficient conditions for safety of SoD in RBAC have been analyzed. An underlying principle of SoD is that no individual should be able to effect a breach of security through dual privilege. By extension, no person may hold a role that exercises audit, control or review authority over another, concurrently held role.<ref>{{cite conference

==Use and Availability==
The use of RBAC to manage user privileges within a single system or application is widely accepted as a best practice.  Systems including [[Microsoft]] [[Active Directory]], [[Microsoft SQL Server]], [[SELinux]], [[grsecurity]], [[FreeBSD]], [[Solaris Operating System|Solaris]], [[Oracle database|Oracle DBMS]], [[PostgreSQL|PostgreSQL 8.1]], [[SAP R/3]], [[ISIS Papyrus]], [[FusionForge]] and many others effectively implement some form of RBAC.

In an organization with a heterogeneous IT infrastructure and requirements that span dozens or hundreds of systems and applications, using RBAC to manage sufficient roles and assign adequate role memberships becomes extremely complex without hierarchical creation of roles and privilege assignments.  Alternate strategies for large scale assignment of privileges to users are discussed in this white paper:
