In [[token ring]] networks, A '''Lobe Attachment Module''' is a box with multiple interfaces to which new network nodes (known as lobes) can be attached. A LAM may have interfaces up to 20 lobes. Functionally a LAM is like a [[Media Access Unit|multi-station access unit]] (MAU), but with a larger capacity: 20 nodes as opposed to 8 nodes for MAU. The LAM interface may use either IBM connectors or [[8P8C]] (RJ-45) [[modular connector|modular plugs]]. 

LAMs can be [[Daisy chain#Computer Engineering|daisy chained]] and connected to a HUB, known as Controlled Access Unit (CAU) in token ring terminology. Each CAU can handle up to 4 LAMs for a total of 80 lobes.
