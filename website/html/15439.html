<html> <head> <title>Gmelin database</title></head><body>The '''Gmelin database''' is a large [[Chemical database|database]] of [[Organometallic chemistry|organometallic]] and [[Inorganic chemistry|inorganic]] compounds updated quarterly. It is based on the German publication the ''[[Gmelins Handbuch der anorganischen Chemie]]'' ("Gmelin's handbook on inorganic chemistry") written by [[Leopold Gmelin]] in 1887, and currently contains 1.5 million compounds and 1.3 million different reactions. The latest version contains every compound/reaction discovered between 1772 and 1995, with over 85,000 titles, keywords and abstracts, and is maintained by [[Elsevier MDL]].

The database has over 800 different data fields on subjects such as the compounds electric, magnetic, thermal, crystal and physiological information.

It is the sister database to the [[Beilstein database]], which deals with organic chemicals and reactions.

Access is part of the [[Reaxys]] system.
