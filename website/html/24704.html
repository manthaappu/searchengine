'''MIR''' (МИР) is the name of a series of early Soviet [[computer]]s, developed from 1965 (MIR-1) to 1969 (MIR-2) in a group headed by [[Victor Glushkov]]. It stands for «Машина для Инженерных Расчётов» (Machine for Engineering Calculations).  It was designed as a relatively small-scale computer for use in engineering and scientific applications.  Among other innovations, it contained a hardware implementation of a high-level programming language capable of [[Symbolic computation|symbolic manipulations]] with [[fraction]]s, [[polynomial]]s, [[derivative]]s and [[integral]]s.  Another innovative feature for that time was the [[user interface]] combining a keyboard with a monitor and [[light pen]] used for correcting texts and drawing on screen. It could be considered one of the first personal computers.
