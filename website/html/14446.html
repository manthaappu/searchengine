<html> <head> <title>Fuze Keeping Clock</title></head><body>The '''Fuze Keeping Clock (FKC)''' was a simplified version of the Royal Navy's [[High Angle Control System]] analogue fire control computer.<ref>The RN Pocket Gunnery Book, p. 153-154, paragraphs 432-435</ref> It first appeared as the FKC Mk1 in destroyers of the 1938 [[Tribal class destroyer (1936)|Tribal class]],<ref name=Hodges27>Tribal Class Destroyers, Hodges, p. 27</ref> while later variants were used on sloops, frigates, destroyers, aircraft carriers and several cruisers.<ref>Naval Weapons of WW2, Campbell, p. 19</ref> The FKC Mk1 was a non-[[tachymetric]] anti-aircraft fire control computer. It could accurately engage targets with a maximum speed of {{convert|250|kn|km/h}}.<ref name=Hodges27/>

==Operation==
The FKC received aircraft altitude, range, direction, and speed input information from the ''Rangefinder-Director'', vertical reference information from a ''Gyro Level Corrector'' and output to the guns the elevation and deflection data needed to hit the target, along with the correct fuze timing information, so that the shells fired would explode in the vicinity of the target aircraft.<ref>Hodges and Friedman, ''Destroyer weapons of WW2'', P51.</ref> Most guns controlled by the FKC had ''Fuze Setting Pedestals'' or ''Fuze Setting Trays'' where the correct fuze timing was set on a clockwork mechanism within the AA shell warhead.<ref>Hodges and Friedman, ''Destroyer weapons of WW2'', P95-96.</ref>

==Development==
[[List_of_World_War_II_British_naval_radar#Type_285|Type 285]] radar was an early addition to the FKC system, being fitted on new destroyers from mid 1941 onward, and retrofitted to existing destroyers as time and opportunity permitted.<ref>Howse, ''Radar at sea: The Royal Navy in World War 2''</ref> Later variants increased the maximum target speed to 500 knots,<ref>Destroyer Weapons of WW2, Hodges/Friedman, p. 102, ISBN 0851771378</ref> and were combined with [[Gyro Rate Unit]]s (GRU) which gave tachometric capabilities to the system, and [[radar]] which greatly improved ranging and rate keeping accuracy.<ref>Naval Weapons of WW2, Campbell</ref>
