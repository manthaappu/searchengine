GNU '''Octave''' is a high-level language, primarily intended for [[numerical analysis|numerical computations]]. It provides a convenient command line interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with [[MATLAB]]. It may also be used as a batch-oriented language.
As part of the [[GNU Project]], it is [[free software]] under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]].

== History ==
The project was conceived around 1988.  At first it was intended to be a companion to a chemical reactor design course. Real development was started by [[John W. Eaton]] in [[1992]].  The first alpha release dates back to January 4, 1993 and on February 17, 1994 version 1.0 was released. Version 3.0 was released on December 21, 2007.

The program is named after [[Octave Levenspiel]], a former professor of the principal author who was known for his ability to perform quick [[back-of-the-envelope calculation]]s.<ref name="about">{{cite web

==Deployments ==
In addition to use on desktops for personal scientific computing, Octave is used in academia and industry. For example,
Octave was used on a massive parallel computer at Pittsburgh supercomputing center to find vulnerability related to guessing social security numbers.<ref>

== Technical details ==
* Octave is written in [[C++]] using [[Standard Template Library|STL]] libraries.
* Octave uses an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] to execute the Octave scripting language.
* Octave is extensible using dynamically loadable modules.
* Octave interpreter works with [[gnuplot]] and [[Grace (plotting tool)|Grace]] software to create plots, graphs, and charts, and to save or print them.

== Octave, the language ==
The Octave language is an interpreted programming language.  It is a [[programming|structured programming]] language (similar to [[C (programming language)|C]]) and supports many common [[C standard library]] functions, and also certain [[POSIX|UNIX]] system calls and functions.<ref>{{cite web

Octave programs consist of a list of function calls or a [[script (computer programming)|script]].
The syntax is [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]-based and provides various functions for matrix operations.  It is not [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]], but it does support various [[data structure]]s. <!--Candidate for expansion -->

Its syntax is very similar to MATLAB, and careful programming of a script will allow it to run on both Octave and MATLAB.<ref>{{cite web

Because Octave is made available under the [[GNU General Public License]], it may be freely changed, copied and used.<ref name="about" /> The program runs under most [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s, as well as [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows]].<ref>{{cite web

== Notable features ==
===Command and variable name completion===
Typing a TAB character on the command line causes Octave to attempt to complete variable, function, and file names (similar to [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]]'s [[tab completion]]). Octave uses the text before the cursor as the initial portion of the name to complete.

===Command history===
When running interactively, Octave saves the commands typed in an internal buffer so that they can be recalled and edited.

===Data structures===
Octave includes a limited amount of support for organizing data in structures. For instance:
<pre>
octave:1> x.a = 1; x.b = [1, 2; 3, 4]; x.c = "string";
octave:2> x.a
ans =  1
octave:3> x.b
ans =

   1   2
   3   4

octave:4> x.c
ans = string
octave:5> x
x =
{
  a =  1
  b =

     1   2
     3   4

  c = string
}
</pre>

===Short-circuit boolean operators===
Octave's '&&' and '||' logical operators are evaluated in a [[Short-circuit evaluation|short-circuit]] fashion (like the corresponding operators in the [[C (programming language)|C]] language), in contrast to the element-by-element operators '&' and '|'.

===Increment and decrement operators===
Octave includes the C-like increment and decrement operators '++' and '--' in both their prefix and postfix forms.

===Unwind-protect===
Octave supports a limited form of exception handling modeled after the unwind-protect form of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]. The general form of an unwind_protect block looks like this:
<source lang="matlab">
unwind_protect
  body
unwind_protect_cleanup
  cleanup
end_unwind_protect
</source>

===Variable-length argument lists===
Octave has a real mechanism for handling functions that take an unspecified number of arguments without explicit upper limit. To specify a list of zero or more arguments, use the special argument <code>varargin</code> as the last (or only) argument in the list.

<source lang="matlab">
function s = plus (varargin)
  if (nargin==0)
    s = 0;
  else
    s = varargin{1} + plus (varargin{2:nargin});
  endif
endfunction
</source>

===Variable-length return lists===
A function can be set up to return any number of values by using the special return value <code>varargout</code>. For example:

<source lang="matlab">
function varargout = multiassign (data)
  for k=1:nargout
    varargout{k} = data(:,k);
  endfor
endfunction
</source>

===C++ Integration===
It is also possible to execute Octave code directly in a C++ program. For example, here is a code snippet for calling ''rand([9000,1])'':
<source lang="cpp">
  #include <octave/oct.h>
  ...
  ColumnVector NumRands(2);
  NumRands(0) = 9000;
  NumRands(1) = 1;
  octave_value_list f_arg, f_ret;
  f_arg(0) = octave_value(NumRands);
  f_ret = feval("rand",f_arg,1);
  Matrix unis(f_ret(0).matrix_value());
</source>

== MATLAB compatibility ==
Octave has been built with [[MATLAB]] compatibility in mind, and shares many features with [[MATLAB]]:

# Matrices as fundamental data type.
# Built-in support for complex numbers.
# Powerful built-in math functions and extensive function libraries.
# Extensibility in the form of user-defined functions.

There are a few purposeful, albeit minor, [http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/FAQ.html#MATLAB-compatibility differences]:

# Comment lines can be prefixed with the # character as well as the % character
# Various C-based operators ++, --, +=, *=, /= are supported
# Elements can be referenced without creating a new variable, e.g. [1:10](3)
# Strings can be defined with the " character as well as the ' character
