__NOTOC__
In [[type theory]] and [[programming language]]s, the '''POPLmark challenge''' is a set of [[Benchmarking|benchmarks]] designed to evaluate the state of [[automated reasoning|mechanization]] in the [[metatheory]] of programming languages, and to stimulate discussion and collaboration among a diverse cross section of the [[formal methods]] community. The challenge was initially proposed by the members of the ''PL club'' at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], in association with collaborators around the world. The ''Workshop on Mechanized Metatheory'' is the main meeting of researchers participating in the challenge.

The design of the POPLmark benchmark is guided by features common to reasoning about programming languages. The challenge problems do not require the formalisation of large programming languages, but they do require sophistication in reasoning about:

; [[Name binding|Binding]] : Most programming languages have some form of binding, ranging in complexity from the simple binders of [[simply typed lambda calculus]] to complex, potentially infinite binders needed in the treatment of [[record (computer science)|record]] [[pattern matching|pattern]]s.
; [[Mathematical induction|Induction]] : Properties such as [[subject reduction]] and [[strong normalisation]] often require complex induction arguments.
; Reuse : Furthering collaboration being a key aim of the challenge, the solutions are expected to contain reusable components that would allow researchers to share language features and designs without requiring them to start from scratch every time.

== The problems ==

{{As of|2007}}, the POPLmark challenge is composed of three parts. Part 1 concerns solely the types of [[system F-sub|System F<sub><:</sub>]] ([[System F]] with [[subtyping]]), and has problems such as:
# Checking that the type system admits [[transitivity]] of subtyping.
# Checking the transitivity of subtyping in the presence of [[record (computer science)|record]]s

Part 2 concerns the syntax and semantics of System F<sub><:</sub>. It concerns proofs of
# [[Type safety]] for the pure fragment
# Type safety in the presence of [[pattern matching]]

Part 3 concerns the usability of the formalisation of System F<sub><:</sub>. In particular, the challenge asks for:
# Simulating and animating the [[operational semantics]]
# Extracting useful algorithms from the formalisations

Several solutions have been proposed for parts of the POPLmark challenge, using tools such as [[Isabelle theorem prover|Isabelle/HOL]], [[Twelf]], [[Coq]] and [[Matita_proof_assistant|Matita]].
