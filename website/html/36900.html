<html> <head> <title>Tdbengine</title></head><body>'''Tdbengine''' is a [[relational database management system]] with an integrated programming language. It is designed to handle [[database]]s on the web. It connects to the webserver using the standard [[Common Gateway Interface|cgi]] interface.

The tdbengine is very small (about 400 KB), extremely quick and easy to administer. Currently versions for [[Linux]] (x86), [[FreeBSD]] (x86) and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] NT/2000 are available.

The tdbengine is distributed as [[freeware]]. Apart from many [[GNU]]-projects the tdbengine is written in [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]]. It can be compiled with FreePascal without any additional libraries or packages.

The data creation, modification and selection is done without any [[SQL]]. The integrated scripting language [[EASY (computer language)|EASY]] has a set of about 300 commands and directives which provide full and quick access.
