{{Computational physics}}
'''Computational physics''' is the study and implementation of numerical [[algorithm]]s to solve problems in [[physics]] for which a quantitative theory already exists.  It is often regarded as a subdiscipline of [[theoretical physics]] but some consider it an intermediate branch between theoretical and [[experimental physics]].

[[Physicist]]s often have a very precise mathematical theory describing how a system will behave. Unfortunately, it is often the case that solving the theory's equations [[ab initio]] in order to produce a useful prediction is not practical.  This is especially true with [[quantum mechanics]], where only a handful of simple models admit closed-form, analytic solutions. In cases where the equations can only be solved approximately, computational methods are often used.

== Applications of computational physics ==
Computation now represents an essential component of modern research in [[accelerator physics]], [[astrophysics]], [[fluid mechanics]], [[lattice field theory]]/[[lattice gauge theory]] (especially [[lattice QCD|lattice quantum chromodynamics]]), [[plasma physics]] (see [[plasma modeling]]), [[solid state physics]] and [[soft condensed matter]] physics.  Computational solid state physics, for example, uses [[density functional theory]] to calculate properties of solids, a method similar to that used by chemists to study molecules.

Many other more general numerical problems fall loosely under the domain of computational physics, although they could easily be considered{{by whom|date=November 2010}} pure [[mathematics]] or part of any number of applied areas.  These include

* Solving [[differential equation]]s
* Evaluating [[integral]]s
* Stochastic methods, especially [[Monte Carlo method]]s
* Specialized [[partial differential equation]] methods, for example the [[finite difference]] method and the [[finite element method]]
* The [[matrix eigenvalue problem]] &ndash; the problem of finding [[eigenvalue]]s of very large matrices, and their corresponding [[eigenvectors]] ([[eigenstates]] in [[quantum physics]])
* The [[pseudo-spectral method]]

All these methods (and several others) are used to calculate physical properties of the modeled systems. Computational Physics also encompasses the tuning of the software/hardware structure to solve the problems (as the problems usually can be very large, in processing power need or in memory requests).
