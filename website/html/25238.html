<html> <head> <title>Multi-Vendor Integration Protocol</title></head><body>{{Context|date=October 2009}}The '''Multi-Vendor Integration Protocol''' ('''MVIP''') is a hardware bus for [[computer telephony integration]] ([[Audiotex]]) equipment, a PCM data highway for interconnecting expansion boards inside a [[personal computer|PC]]. It was invented and brought to market by Natural Microsystems Inc (now NMS Communications).

Used to build call center equipment using regular PCs, MVIP provides a second communications bus within the computer that can multiplex up to 256 full-duplex voice channels from one voice card to another. Digital voice, fax and video is bussed over a ribbon cable connected at the top of each ISA or PCI card. MVIP products make a PC perform like a small-scale PBX. The protocol accommodated for a variety of expansion boards, including trunk interfaces (usually [[Digital Signal 1|T1]] or [[ISDN]]), voice processing boards equipment  [[speech recognition]] or fax processing. Each board could optionally provide a switch that could interconnect voice channels on the bus, allowing for a flexible routing of calls within the MVIP bus.

The MVIP bus was promoted as an alternative to the then-dominant [[PEP]] bus by [[Dialogic Corporation]] which had much less capacity and was not an open standard.
