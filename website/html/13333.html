The '''''Fastra II''''' is a [[desktop computer|desktop]] [[supercomputer]], designed for [[tomography]].<ref name="Main page">{{cite web | url=http://Fastra2.ua.ac.be/ | title=Main page of the official Fastra II website | publisher=Fastra2.ua.ac.be | accessdate=21 September 2010}}</ref> It was built in late 2009 by the ASTRA (All Scale Tomographic Reconstruction Antwerp) group of researchers of the IBBT (Interdisciplinary Institute for Broadband Technology) VisionLab at the [[University of Antwerp]] and [[Belgium|Belgian]] computer shop Tones, in collaboration with [[Asus]], a [[taiwan|Taiwanese]] [[multinational corporation|multinational]] computer product manufacturer, as the successor to the ''Fastra I'' (built in 2008).

According to the benchmarks at the official website for the ''Fastra II'', it beats its predecessor, the ''Fastra I'', which was slightly faster than a 512-core cluster.<ref name="Benchmarks" /> However, because of the amount of [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]]s in the computer, the system initially suffered from several issues, like the system refusing to reboot and heat issues due to lack of space between the video cards.<ref name="Technical details" /><ref name="Benchmarks" />

== Development ==

The computer was built as a researching and demonstration project and idea, by the ASTRA group of researchers at the Vision Lab in the University of Antwerp in Belgium, one of the researchers being Joost Batenburg.<ref name="Main page" /> Unlike other modern supercomputers, such as the ''[[Jaguar (computer)|Cray Jaguar]]'' and the ''[[IBM Roadrunner]]'', which cost millions of euros, the ''Fastra II'' only uses consumer hardware, costing € 6,000 in total.<ref name="Main page" />

The ''Fastra II'''s predecessor, the ''Fastra I'', has 4 dual-GPU [[GeForce 9 Series#GeForce 9800 GX2|GeForce 9800 GX2]] video cards, for a total of 8 GPUs. At that time, the ASTRA group needed a motherboard that had four [[PCI Express]] x16 slots with double-spacing between each of them. At that time, the only such motherboard the ASTRA group could find was the [[Micro-Star International|MSI]] K9A2 Platinum, which has four such slots.<ref name="Fastra I specifications">{{cite web | url=http://fastra.ua.ac.be/en/specs.html | title=Fastra I specifications | publisher=Fastra.ua.ac.be | accessdate=6 January 2011}}</ref> In 2009, the Asus P6T7 WS Supercomputer motherboard, which the ''Fastra II'' uses, was released, which has seven PCI Express x16 slots.<ref name="Asus P6T7 motherboard review">{{cite web | url=http://www.motherboards.org/reviews/motherboards/1913_1.html | title=ASUS P6T7 WS Supercomputer Motherboard Review :: Introduction | publisher=Motherboards.org | date=25 June 2009 | accessdate=6 January 2011}}</ref> The ''Fastra II'' has six faster dual-GPU [[GeForce 200 Series|GeForce GTX 295]] video cards, and a single-GPU GeForce GTX 275, for a total of 13 GPUs. In the ''Fastra II'', the GPUs mainly perform [[tomographic reconstruction]]. The technique which allows GPUs to perform general-purpose tasks like this outside of gaming, instead of [[Central processing unit|CPUs]], is called [[GPGPU]], general-purpose computing on graphics processing units.

Due to the massive amount of heat caused by the lack of space between all of the video cards, the researchers are forced to keep the side panel door open, so that the video cards can get regular air, and thus decreases the overall temperature inside the case.<ref name="Benchmarks" />

Due to the amount of GPUs in the system, at the initial attempt it did not boot. This was because its motherboard uses a 32 bit [[BIOS]]. The 32 bit BIOS which originally was in the system only had roughly 3 GB of address space for the video cards. However, Asus managed to provide them a specialized BIOS that entirely skipped the address space allocation of the GTX 295 video cards.<ref name="Technical details">{{cite web | url=http://fastra2.ua.ac.be/?page_id=214 | title=Technical details | publisher=Fastra2.ua.ac.be | accessdate=16 December 2010}}</ref>

All seven PCI Express x16 slots in the Asus P6T7 motherboard were used in the building of the ''Fastra II'' computer. However, the video cards in the ''Fastra II'' are wide enough to require two such slots each. To solve this issue, the researchers came up with flexible PCI Express cables, and Tones developed a custom cage, which allowed the video cards to suspend over the motherboard.<ref name="Main page" />

== Specifications and benchmarks ==

Like the ''Fastra I'', the ''Fastra II'' uses a Lian Li PC-P80 Armorsuit case, which has 10 expansion slots. The [[motherboard]] in the ''Fastra II'' was at that time the only [[workstation]] motherboard that had seven full-sized [[PCI Express]] x16 slots.<ref name="Specifications" />
The memory modules were initially six 2 GB modules, but were later upgraded to 4 GB each, for a total of 24 GB.<ref name="RAM upgrade">{{cite web | url=http://fastra2.ua.ac.be/?p=647 | title=System upgrade: 24GB of DDR3 RAM | publisher=Fastra2.ua.ac.be | date=23 April 2010 | accessdate=16 December 2010}}</ref>
Instead of an eighth dual-GPU video card, the single-GPU GTX 275 is in the computer because, out of all the video cards in the Fastra II, the GTX 275 is the only one the Fastra II's BIOS can fully initialize. The total amount of GPUs is 13. The video cards together bring 12 [[Tera-|tera]][[FLOPS|flops]] of computing power.<ref name="PC world">{{cite web | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/184648/Fastra_ii_12_teraflops_of_computing_power_on_a_desktop.html | title=Fastra II: 12 Teraflops of Computing Power on a Desktop | publisher=PC World | date=15 December 2009 | accessdate=22 September 2010}}</ref> Four of the six GTX 295 video cards have 2 [[Printed Circuit Board|PCBs]], while the other two have only 1 PCB.

According to the [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmarks]] on its official website, the ''Fastra II'' is faster and more power efficient than its competitors, including the ''Fastra I'' and the ''Tesla C1060''.<ref name="Benchmarks">{{cite web | url=http://Fastra2.ua.ac.be/?page_id=53 | title=Fastra II benchmarks | publisher=Fastra2.ua.ac.be | accessdate=21 September 2010}}</ref> The benchmarks were performed on the ''Fastra II'', the ''Fastra I'', a 512-core cluster (consisting of [[Opteron]] CPUs), an [[Nvidia Tesla]] C1060 workstation card on an [[Intel Core i7]] 940 CPU, and on an Intel Core i7 940 CPU itself. The ''Fastra II'' is over three times faster than the ''Fastra I'' in CT slice reconstruction speed. Although the ''Fastra II'' consumes more power than its predecessor, the ''Fastra I'', it's nearly 3 times as energy efficient as the ''Fastra I'', and over 300 times as energy efficient as the 512-core cluster. The video cards run at 37 degrees [[Celsius]] when idle, and at 60 degrees Celsius at full load.

== Applications and reception ==

The ''Fastra II'' received positive public impression. Techie.com called it the "world's most powerful desktop-sized supercomputer". They also described it as "so much power in such a small space."<ref name="Techie.com">{{cite web | last=Firmalan | first=Nepsurl | url=http://www.techie.com.ph/news/fastra-ii-is-worlds-most-powerful-desktopsized-supercomputer | title=Fastra II is world's most powerful desktop-sized supercomputer | publisher=Techie.com | date=15 December 2009 | accessdate=5 January 2011}}</ref> iTech News Net called it "the Most Powerful Desktop Supercomputer".<ref name="iTech News Net">{{cite web | url=http://www.itechnews.net/2009/12/20/fastra-ii-the-most-powerful-desktop-supercomputer/ | title=FASTRA II – the Most Powerful Desktop Supercomputer | publisher=iTechnews.net | author=Sze | date=20 December 2009 | accessdate=5 January 2011}}</ref>

The ''Fastra II'' is mainly being used on [[hospital]]s for [[medicine|medical]] reasons.<ref name="Techie.com" /> However, as the [[Nvidia]] drivers for the video cards do not support [[Scalable Link Interface|SLI]] for more than 4 GPUs, it's not good for gaming. SLI is a dual-GPU technology by Nvidia. Moreover, the ''Fastra II'''s motherboard is designed for workstations.<ref name="Specifications">{{cite web | url=http://Fastra2.ua.ac.be/?page_id=49 | title=Fastra II specifications | accessdate=6 June 2010 | publisher=Fastra2.ua.ac.be}}</ref>
