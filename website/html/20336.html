A '''KDL''' is a term used on [[BeOS]]/[[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]] and possibly other [[operating system]]s for a serious [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] error which causes the computer to drop into the [[kernel debugger]]. '''KDL''' stands for Kernel Debug(ger) Land.

While a KDL brought about by a buggy driver which is not crucial, such as a [[filesystem]] driver,  can be escaped from (with the command 'es'), it usually leaves the user needing to reboot.
