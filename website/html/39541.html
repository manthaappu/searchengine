'''VisiCalc''' was the first [[spreadsheet]] program available for personal computers. It is often considered the application that turned the [[microcomputer]] from a hobby for computer enthusiasts into a serious business tool.<ref name = "tomcalc"/> VisiCalc sold over 700,000 copies in six years.<ref>''Secrets of Software Success: Management Insights from 100 Software Firms Around the World'', ISBN 1578511054 (1999)</ref>

According to Bricklin, he was watching a professor at [[Harvard Business School]] create a financial model on a blackboard. When the professor found an error or wanted to change a parameter, he had to erase and rewrite a number of sequential entries in the table. Bricklin realized that he could replicate the process on a computer using an "electronic spreadsheet" to view results of underlying formulae.<ref name="joshcalc">{{cite web

==Successors==
Charles Babcock of ''[[InformationWeek]]'' wrote that, in retrospect, "VisiCalc was flawed and clunky, and couldn't do many things users wanted it to do."<ref>[http://www.techweb.com/article/showArticle.jhtml?articleId=191901844&pgno=1 What's The Greatest Software Ever Written? - Technology News by TechWeb<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Soon, more powerful spreadsheet programs were released, including [[SuperCalc]] (1980), [[Microsoft]]'s [[MultiPlan]] (1982), [[Lotus 1-2-3]] (1983), the spreadsheet module in [[AppleWorks]] (1984), and [[Microsoft Excel]], which was introduced for the [[Macintosh]] in 1985 and for [[Windows 2.0]] in 1987.

==Reception==
''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' reviewer Joseph Kattan wrote "VisiCalc isn't as easy to use as prepackaged home accounting programs, because you're required to design both the layout and the formulas used by the program. Because it is not pre-packaged, however, it's infinitely more powerful and flexible than such programs. You can use VisiCalc to balance your checkbook, keep track of credit card purchases, calculate your net worth, do your taxes - the possibilities are practically limitless."<ref name="8-Bit Product Reviews: VISICALC">[http://www.atarimagazines.com/v3n2/productreviews.html?tag= 8-Bit Product Reviews: VISICALC]</ref>
