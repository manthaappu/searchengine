A '''changelog''' is a log or record of changes made to a project, such as a [[website]] or software project, usually including such records as bug fixes, new features, etc.  Most [[open source]] projects include a changelog as one of the top level files in their distribution. 

Although the canonical naming convention for the file is ''ChangeLog'',<ref>[http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Gnits.html#Gnits The GNU automake manual]</ref> it is sometimes alternatively named as ''CHANGES'' or ''HISTORY'' (''NEWS'' is usually a different file reflecting changes between releases, not between the commits).  Some [[project maintainer]]s will append a ''.txt'' suffix to the file name.

Some [[revision control]] systems are able to generate the relevant information that is suited as a changelog.

==Format==
Changelog files are organized by paragraphs, which define a unique change within a function or file.
Most changelog files follow the following format: 
<pre>
YYYY-MM-DD  John Doe  <johndoe@example.com>

    * myfile.ext (myfunction): my changes made
    additional changes

    * myfile.ext (unrelated_change): my changes made
    to myfile.ext but completely unrelated to the above

    * anotherfile.ext (somefunction): more changes
</pre>

Note that between the date and the name, and again between the name and the email address, there are two spaces each. It is common to enclose the email address in < and >. The [[Emacs | Emacs Editor]] creates such entries when creating additional changelog entries.

==Changelogs in Wikis==
Most [[Wiki]] software includes ''changelogs'' as a fundamental feature (often called ''history'' in this context). For example, the "history" link at the top of a [[Wikipedia]] entry links to that page's changelog. This feature is vital for complying with the attribution requirements of some copyright licenses.
