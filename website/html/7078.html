<html> <head> <title>Community Education Computer Society</title></head><body>'''Community Education Computer Society''' ('''CECS''') describes itself as a [[South Africa]]n non-governmental organisation dedicated to a non-sexist, non-racist, democratic society. It has been involved in training other NGOs and CBOs (community-based organisations), as well as individual members of the disadvantaged community.

CECS [http://cecs.org.za/] sees itself as "the oldest national computer training NGO, established in April 1985, for the technological empowerment of the historically disadvantaged" in South Africa.

Its roots are traced to "a group of progressive teachers faced with computers the government had provided for schools." According to CECS, this group began investigating the possibilities of using their computers to design media and lessons at schools. CECS was launched at a meeting of some 250 primary and high school teachers in April 1985.

CECS has been active, in the past, in five regions in South Africa, covering all the major centres.
