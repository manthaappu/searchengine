'''TransADF''' is a program written for the [[Amiga]] computer that transfers the contents of a [[floppy disk]] or a similar [[block device]] to a file.  This program is notable for being one of the first (if not the first) to compress the disk image using the popular [[deflate]] algorithm, as utilized by [[PKZip]] and [[gzip]], amongst others.
