<html> <head> <title>Bottleneck traveling salesman problem</title></head><body>The '''Bottleneck traveling salesman problem''' (bottleneck TSP) is a problem in [[discrete optimization|discrete]] or [[combinatorial optimization]].  It is stated as follows:  Find the [[Hamiltonian path|Hamiltonian cycle]] in a [[Glossary of graph theory|weighted graph]] which minimizes the weight of the most weighty [[Glossary of graph theory|edge]] of the cycle.<ref name=gj>{{cite book|author = [[Michael R. Garey]] and [[David S. Johnson]] | year = 1979 | title = [[Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness]] | publisher = W.H. Freeman | isbn = 0-7167-1045-5}} A2.3: ND24, pg.212.</ref>

The problem is known to be [[NP-hard]]. The [[decision problem]] version of this, "for a given length ''x'', is there a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph ''g'' with no edge longer than ''x''?", is [[NP-complete]].<ref name=gj/>

In an '''asymmetric bottleneck TSP''', there are cases where the weight from node ''A'' to ''B'' is different from the weight from B to A (e. g. travel time between two cities with a traffic jam in one direction).

'''Euclidean bottleneck TSP''', or planar bottleneck TSP, is the bottleneck TSP with the distance being the ordinary [[Euclidean distance]]. The problem still remains NP-hard, however many heuristics work better.

If the graph is a [[metric space]] then there is an efficient [[approximation algorithm]] that finds a Hamiltonian cycle with maximum edge weight being no more than twice the optimum.<ref>{{cite journal|author = R.
