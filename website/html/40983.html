<html> <head> <title>ZPL (complexity)</title></head><body>In [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]], '''ZPL''' (Zero-error Probabilistic [[Logarithmic space]]) is the set of problems solvable by a [[probabilistic Turing machine]] which always yields the correct answer and uses logarithmic space on average. Probabilistic algorithms that always give the correct answer are called [[Las Vegas algorithm]]s.

Unlike its deterministic counterpart [[L (complexity)|L]], a '''ZPL''' machine can potentially use exponential time by exploiting randomness. If '''ZPL''' is restricted to polynomial time, we get the more interesting class [[ZPLP (complexity)|ZPLP]].

A surprising result is that '''ZPL''' is equal to both [[RL]] and [[NL (complexity)|NL]]; thus, if a problem can be solved in logarithmic space with nondeterminism or with one-sided error, it can be solved with no error and logarithmic space on average. See the articles on [[RL]] and [[NL (complexity)|NL]] for more information about ZPL.
