<html> <head> <title>Gaussian orbital</title></head><body>In [[computational chemistry]] and [[molecular physics]], '''Gaussian orbitals''' (also known as '''Gaussian type orbitals''', '''GTOs''' or '''Gaussians''') are [[function (mathematics)|function]]s used as [[atomic orbital]]s in the [[linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbital method|LCAO method]] for the computation of [[electron orbital]]s in [[molecule]]s.

== Rationale ==

The principal reason for the use of Gaussian [[Basis set (chemistry)|basis functions]] in molecular quantum chemical calculations is the 'Gaussian Product Theorem', which guarantees that the product of two GTOs centered on two different atoms is a finite sum of Gaussians centered on a point along the axis connecting them. In this manner, four-center integrals can be reduced to finite sums of two-center integrals, and in a next step to finite sums of one-center integrals. The speedup by 4--5 orders of magnitude compared to [[Slater orbitals]] more than outweighs the extra cost entailed by the larger number of basis functions generally required in a Gaussian calculation.

For reasons of convenience, many Gaussian integral evaluation programs work in a basis of Cartesian Gaussians even when spherical Gaussians are requested: the 'contaminants' are deleted a posteriori.

Correct form of atomic orbitals: 
: <math>\ R(r) = A r^l e^{-\alpha r}</math>

GTO: 
: <math>\ R(r) = A r^l e^{-\alpha r*r}</math>

==Molecular integrals==
Molecular integrals over cartesian gaussian functions were first proposed by Boys<ref>S.F. Boys, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/98423 Proc. R. Soc. London Ser. A 200, 542 (1950)]</ref> in 1950. Since then much work has been done to speed up the evaluation of these integrals which are the slowest part of many quantum chemical calculations. McMurchie and Davidson (1978) introduced [[Hermite]] Gaussian functions to take advantage of differential relations. [[John Pople|Pople]] and Hehre (1978) developed a local coordinate method. Obara and Saika introduced efficient recursion relations in 1985, which was followed by the development of other important recurrence relations. Gill and Pople (1990) introduced a 'prism' algorithm which allowed efficient use of 20 different calculation paths.
