'''Thematic images''' are usually image products of [[Statistical classification|classification]] processing of [[multispectral images]] of the [[earth]] surface. The classification process differentiates types of surface such as land, water, [[forest]], lake, structure etc. In more details we might have classes such as type of [[Crop (agriculture)|crop]], or [[pollution]] structure, burn forest, [[volcano]] eruption with [[lava]], clear or [[turbidity|turbid]] water, [[seawater]], [[phytoplankton]], or, in smaller scales, [[road]]s, crops, artificial structures etc.
