<html> <head> <title>Fault Tolerant Ethernet</title></head><body>'''Fault Tolerant Ethernet''' (FTE) is designed to provide rapid network redundancy. Each [[Node_(networking)|node]] is connected twice to a single LAN through the dual network interfaces. The driver and the FTE enabled components allow network communication to occur over an alternate route when the primary route fails. <ref>http://hpsweb.honeywell.com/Cultures/en-US/Products/Systems/ExperionPKS/FaultTolerantEthernet/default.htm</ref> FTE was created by [[Honeywell]].
