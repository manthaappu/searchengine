In [[topology]] and related areas of [[mathematics]], a '''quotient space''' (also called an '''identification space''') is, intuitively speaking, the result of identifying or "gluing together" certain points of a given space. The points to be identified are specified by an [[equivalence relation]]. This is commonly done in order to construct new spaces from given ones.

== Definition ==
Suppose ''X'' is a [[topological space]] and ~ is an [[equivalence relation]] on ''X''. We define a topology on the [[quotient set]] ''X''/~ (the set consisting of all [[equivalence class]]es of ~) as follows: a set of equivalence classes in ''X''/~ is [[open set|open]] if and only if their [[union (set theory)|union]] is open in ''X''.
This is the '''quotient topology''' on the quotient set ''X''/~.

Equivalently, the quotient topology can be characterized in the following manner: Let ''q'' : ''X'' &rarr; ''X''/~ be the projection map which sends each element of ''X'' to its equivalence class. Then the  quotient topology on ''X''/~ is the [[finest topology]] for which ''q'' is [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]].

Given a [[surjective]] map ''f'' : ''X'' &rarr; ''Y'' from a topological space ''X'' to a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''Y'' we can define the quotient topology on ''Y'' as the finest topology for which ''f'' is continuous. This is equivalent to saying that a subset ''V'' &sube; ''Y'' is open in ''Y'' if and only if its [[preimage]] ''f''<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''V'') is open in ''X''. The map ''f'' induces a unique equivalence relation on ''X'' by saying ''x''<sub>1</sub>~''x''<sub>2</sub> [[if and only if]] ''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>) = ''f''(''x''<sub>2</sub>). The quotient space ''X''/~ is then [[homeomorphic]] to ''Y'' (with its quotient topology) via the homeomorphism which sends the equivalence class of ''x'' to ''f''(''x'').

In general, a surjective, continuous map ''f'' : ''X'' &rarr; ''Y'' is said to be a '''quotient map''' if ''Y'' has the quotient topology determined by ''f''.

== Examples ==
*'''Gluing.'''  Often, topologists talk of gluing points together.  If ''X'' is a topological space and points <math>x,y \in X</math> are to be "glued", then what is meant is that we are to consider the quotient space obtained from the equivalence relation ''a ~ b'' if and only if ''a = b'' or ''a = x, b = y'' (or ''a = y, b = x'').  The two points are henceforth interpreted as one point.
*Consider the unit square ''I''<sup>2</sup> = [0,1]&times;[0,1] and the equivalence relation ~ generated by the requirement that all boundary points be equivalent, thus identifying all boundary points to a single equivalence class. Then ''I''<sup>2</sup>/~ is homeomorphic to the [[sphere|unit sphere]] ''S''<sup>2</sup>.
*'''[[Adjunction space]]'''. More generally, suppose ''X'' is a space and ''A'' is a [[subspace (topology)|subspace]] of ''X''. One can identify all points in ''A'' to a single equivalence class and leave points outside of ''A'' equivalent only to themselves. The resulting quotient space is denoted ''X''/''A''. The 2-sphere is then homeomorphic to the unit disc with its boundary identified to a single point: ''D''<sup>2</sup>/&part;''D''<sup>2</sup>.
*Consider the set ''X'' = '''R''' of all [[real number]]s with the ordinary topology, and write ''x'' ~ ''y'' [[if and only if]] ''x''&minus;''y'' is an [[integer]]. Then the quotient space ''X''/~ is [[homeomorphic]] to the [[unit circle]] ''S''<sup>1</sup> via the homeomorphism which sends the equivalence class of ''x'' to exp(2&pi;''ix'').
*A vast generalization of the previous example is the following: Suppose a [[topological group]] ''G'' [[group action|acts]] continuously on a space ''X''. One can form an equivalence relation on ''X'' by saying points are equivalent if and only if they lie in the same [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]]. The quotient space under this relation is called the '''orbit space''', denoted ''X''/''G''. In the previous example ''G'' = '''Z''' acts on '''R''' by translation. The orbit space '''R'''/'''Z''' is homeomorphic to ''S''<sup>1</sup>.

''Warning'': The notation '''R'''/'''Z''' is somewhat ambiguous. If '''Z''' is understood to be a group acting on '''R''' then the quotient is the circle. However, if '''Z''' is thought of as a subspace of '''R''', then the quotient is an infinite [[bouquet of circles]] joined at a single point.

== Properties ==
Quotient maps ''q'' : ''X'' &rarr; ''Y'' are characterized among surjective maps by the following property: if ''Z'' is any topological space and ''f'' : ''Y'' &rarr; ''Z'' is any function, then ''f'' is continuous if and only if ''f'' ∘ ''q'' is continuous.

The quotient space ''X''/~ together with the quotient map ''q'' : ''X'' &rarr; ''X''/~ is characterized by the following [[universal property]]: if ''g'' : ''X'' &rarr; ''Z'' is a continuous map such that ''a''~''b'' implies ''g''(''a'')=''g''(''b'') for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''X'', then there exists a unique continuous map ''f'' : ''X''/~ &rarr; ''Z'' such that ''g'' = ''f'' <small>O</small> ''q''. We say that ''g'' ''descends to the quotient''.

The continuous maps defined on ''X''/~ are therefore precisely those maps which arise from continuous maps defined on ''X'' that respect the equivalence relation (in the sense that they send equivalent elements to the same image). This criterion is constantly used when studying quotient spaces.

Given a continuous surjection ''f'' : ''X'' &rarr; ''Y'' it is useful to have criteria by which one can determine if ''f'' is a quotient map. Two sufficient criteria are that ''f'' be [[open map|open]] or [[closed map|closed]]. Note that these conditions are only [[sufficient condition|sufficient]], not [[necessary condition|necessary]]. It is easy to construct examples of quotient maps which are neither open nor closed.

== Compatibility with other topological notions ==
* [[Separation axioms|Separation]]
** In general, quotient spaces are ill-behaved with respect to separation axioms. The separation properties of ''X'' need not be inherited by ''X''/~, and ''X''/~ may have separation properties not shared by ''X''.
** ''X''/~ is a [[T1 space]] if and only if every equivalence class of ~ is closed in ''X''.
** If the quotient map is [[open map|open]] then ''X''/~ is a [[Hausdorff space]] if and only if ~ is a closed subset of the [[product space]] ''X''&times;''X''.
* [[Connectedness]]
** If a space is connected or [[path connected]], then so are all its quotient spaces.
** A quotient space of a [[simply connected]] or [[contractible]] space need not share those properties.
* [[Compact space|Compactness]]
** If a space is compact, then so are all its quotient spaces.
** A quotient space of a [[locally compact]] space need not be locally compact.
* [[Dimension]]
** The [[topological dimension]] of a quotient space can be more (as well as less) than the dimension of the original space; [[space-filling curve]]s provide such examples.
