'''Elmer''' is an open source ([[GNU General Public License|GPL]]) computational tool for multi-[[physics]] problems. It has been developed by [[CSC – IT Center for Science Ltd|CSC]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csc.fi/english/pages/elmer |title=Elmer - CSC |publisher=CSC — IT Center for Science Ltd |accessdate=2010-06-24}}</ref> in collaboration with [[Finland|Finnish]] universities, research laboratories and industry.

Elmer includes physical models of fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, electromagnetics, heat transfer and acoustics, for example. These are described by partial differential equations which Elmer solves by the [[Finite Element Method]] (FEM).

Elmer comprises several different parts: The boundary conditions and physical models are defined in ElmerGUI. The resulting problem definition is solved by ElmerSolver. Finally the results are visualized by ElmerPost. Additionally a utility ElmerGrid may be used for simple mesh manipulation.

The different parts of Elmer software may also be used independently. The strongest of the components is ElmerSolver which includes many sophisticated features. For pre- and post-processing the users may find also other alternatives.

The software runs on Unix and Windows platforms and can be compiled on a large variety of compilers. The solver can also be used in parallel mode on platforms that support [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]].
