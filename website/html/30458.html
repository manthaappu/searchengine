The '''Psion Wavefinder''' was a computer peripheral for receiving [[digital audio broadcasting]] radio signals, made by [[Psion]]. It attached via [[USB]] to a personal computer, and had no loudspeakers or controls of its own, with only a flashing light on the device. Psion hoped it would become a design classic.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2000/09/27/psion_mounts_163_299_digital/|title=Psion mounts £299 digital radio land grab|last=Orlowski|first=Andrew|date=27 September 2000|work=The Register|accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref>

The Wavefinder was released on 17 October 2000,<ref name=register>{{cite news|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/09/10/psion_wavefinder_saved_by_software/|title=Psion WaveFinder saved by software that works?|last=Lettice|first=John|date=10 September 2001|work=The Register|accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=launch>{{cite news|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/17896/psion-launches-pc-digital-radio|title=Psion launches PC digital radio|last=Lock|first=Darren|date=27 September 2000|work=PC Pro|accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref> and gave access to both DAB audio and DAB Data services. The device initially retailed for £299 (at the time the cheapest digital radio on the UK market)<ref name=pcpro>{{cite news|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/peripherals/818/psion-wavefinder|title=Psion WaveFinder review|last=Lee|first=Fai|date=1 November 2000|work=PC Pro|accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref> and was bundled with new PCs sold by Dixons,<ref name=launch/> but it was quickly discounted, retailing at £49.99 by that December,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/digitalfuture/2001/12/17/dab.shtml|title=It's a radio revolution!|date=17 December 2001|work=BBC Bristol|accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref> and was no longer produced by 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/05/15/psion_pulls_plugs_on_modem/|title=Psion pulls plugs on modem business|last=Lettice|first=John|date=15 May 2002|work=The Register|accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref> Psion ended support in 2004. The Wavefinder had frequent software problems, and an unofficial patch called WaveLite was released in 2001.<ref name=register/> The Wavefinder had widely-reported problems with the USB drivers in [[Windows XP]] Service Pack 2.

It will work with [[Windows XP]] with SP3. There are reports that the Wavefinder works in Vista. It is not compatible with [[Macintosh]] computers, except perhaps through the use of a [[PC emulator]] or [[Hardware virtualization|virtualisation]] solution. The unregulated power supply which is supplied with the Wavefinder has an output which can go up to 19 volts, this can cause the Wavefinder to develop faults. It is therefore recommended to use a regulated 12 volt supply.{{Or|date=August 2010}}
