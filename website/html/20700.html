{{lowercase|title=kinsmod}}
'''kinsmod''' is a program written by Silvio Cesare which, in the [[Linux]] operating system, allows the insertion of a potentially malicious [[Loadable kernel module]] by writing to the /dev/kmem device, regardless of whether the kernel has been compiled with [[Loadable kernel module]] support.  The [[Grsecurity]] Linux kernel patch-set provides a safe guard against this security risk, providing an option "Deny writing to /dev/kmem".  Note that on a correctly configured system only trusted users (normally only the administrator) are permitted to write to the /dev/kmem device and using kinsmod doesn't give a potential attacker any advantage.
