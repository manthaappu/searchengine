The '''Robot Hall of Fame''' was established in [[2003]] by the School of Computer Science at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], USA. It is designed to honor both achievements in [[robotics]] technology and robots from [[science fiction]] that have served as creative inspiration in robotics. The first induction ceremony was held at the [[Carnegie Science Center]] in Pittsburgh on November 10, 2003. The Robot Hall of Fame will become a physical presence within the RoboWorld exhibit at the [[Carnegie Science Center]]. Hailed as the largest permanent robotics exhibit in the United States, Roboworld will allow guests to interact and learn about robots through different themed areas. The Hall of Fame will feature interactive exhibits currently being developed by graduate students at [[Carnegie Mellon]]'s [[Entertainment Technology Center]].
