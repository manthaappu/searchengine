<html> <head> <title>Likelihood function</title></head><body>In [[statistics]], a '''likelihood function''' (often simply the '''likelihood''') is a function of the [[statistical parameter | parameters]] of a [[statistical model]], defined as follows: the ''likelihood'' of a set of parameter values given some observed outcomes is equal to the ''probability'' of those observed outcomes given those parameter values. Likelihood functions play a key role in [[statistical inference]], especially methods of estimating a parameter from a set of [[statistic | statistics]].

In non-technical parlance, "likelihood" is usually a synonym for "[[probability]]" but in statistical usage, a clear technical distinction is made. One may ask "If I were to flip a fair coin 100 times, what is the ''probability'' of it landing heads-up every time?" or "Given that I have flipped a coin 100 times and it has landed heads-up 100 times, what is the ''likelihood'' that the coin is fair?" but it would be improper to switch "likelihood" and "probability" in the two sentences.

Mathematically, writing ''X'' for the set of observed data and Θ for the set of parameter values, the expression ''P''(''X'' | Θ) (read "the probability of ''X'' given Θ") can be interpreted as the expression ''L''(Θ | ''X''), the likelihood of Θ given ''X''.  The interpretation of ''L''(Θ | ''X'') as a function of Θ is especially obvious when ''X'' is fixed and Θ is allowed to vary.

Generally, ''L''(Θ | ''X'') is permitted to be any positive multiple of ''P''(''X'' | Θ).  More precisely, then, a likelihood function is any representative from an [[equivalence class]] of functions,
:<math>L(\Theta \mid X) \in \left\lbrace \alpha \; P(X \mid \Theta) : \alpha > 0 \right\rbrace\,,</math>
where the constant of proportionality ''α'' > 0 is not permitted to depend upon Θ.  In particular, the numerical value ''L''(Θ | ''X'') alone is immaterial; all that matters are likelihood [[ratio]]s, such as those of the form
:<math>\frac{L(\theta_2 | X)}{L(\theta_1 | X)}
= \frac{\alpha P(X|\theta_2)}{\alpha P(X|\theta_1)}
= \frac{P(X|\theta_2)}{P(X|\theta_1)}
\,,</math>
that are invariant with respect to the [[constant of proportionality]] ''α''.

[[A. W. F. Edwards]] defined '''support''' to be the [[natural logarithm]] of the likelihood ratio, and the '''support function''' as the natural logarithm of the likelihood function (the same as the log-likelihood; see below).<ref>Edwards, A.W.F. 1972. ''Likelihood.'' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge (expanded edition, 1992, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore). ISBN 0-8018-4443-6</ref> However, there is potential for confusion with the [[support (mathematics)|mathematical meaning of 'support']], and this terminology is not widely used outside Edwards' main applied field of [[phylogenetics]].

For more about making inferences via likelihood functions, see also the method of [[maximum likelihood]], and [[likelihood-ratio test]]ing.

==Log-likelihood==
For many applications involving likelihood functions, it is more convenient to work in terms of the [[natural logarithm]] of the likelihood function, called the '''log-likelihood''', than in terms of the likelihood function itself.  Because the logarithm is a [[monotonically increasing]] function, the logarithm of a function achieves its [[maximum]] value at the same points as the function itself, and hence the log-likelihood can be used in place of the likelihood in [[maximum likelihood]] estimation and related techniques.  Finding the maximum of a function often involves taking the [[derivative]] of a function and solving for the parameter being maximized, and this is often easier when the function being maximized is a log-likelihood rather than the original likelihood function.

For example, some likelihood functions are for the parameters that explain a collection of statistically independent observations.  In such a situation, the likelihood function factors into a product of individual likelihood functions.  The logarithm of this product is a sum of individual logarithms, and the [[derivative]] of a sum of terms is often easier to compute than the derivative of a product.  In addition, several common distributions have likelihood functions that contain products of factors involving [[exponentiation]].  The logarithm of such a function is a sum of products, again easier to differentiate than the original function.

As an example, consider the [[gamma distribution]], whose likelihood function is

:<math>L (\alpha, \beta|x) = \frac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)} x^{\alpha-1} e^{-\beta x}</math>
and suppose we wish to find the maximum likelihood estimate of β for a single observed value ''x''.  This function looks rather daunting.  Its logarithm, however, is much simpler to work with:

:<math>\log L(\alpha,\beta|x) = \alpha \log \beta - \log \Gamma(\alpha) + (\alpha-1) \log x  - \beta x\,.</math>

The [[partial derivative]] with respect to β is simply

:<math>\frac{\partial \log L(\alpha,\beta|x)}{\partial \beta} = \frac{\alpha}{\beta} - x</math>

If there are a number of samples ''x''<sub>1</sub>,…,''x''<sub>''n''</sub>, then the joint log-likelihood will be the sum of individual log-likelihoods, and the derivative of this sum will be the sum of individual derivatives:

:<math>\frac{n \alpha}{\beta} - \sum_{i=1}^n x_i</math>

Setting this equal to zero and solving for <math>\beta</math> yields

:<math>\beta^* = \frac{\alpha}{\bar{x}}</math>

where <math>\beta^*\,</math> represents the maximum-likelihood estimate and <math>\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i</math> is the [[sample mean]] of the observations.

==Likelihood function of a parameterized model==
Among many applications, we consider here one of broad theoretical and practical importance.  Given a [[parameterized family]] of [[probability density function]]s (or [[probability mass function]]s in the case of discrete distributions)

:<math>x\mapsto f(x\mid\theta), \!</math>

where ''θ'' is the parameter,  the '''likelihood function''' is
:<math>\theta\mapsto f(x\mid\theta), \!</math>
written
:<math>L(\theta \mid x)=f(x\mid\theta), \!</math>

where ''x'' is the observed outcome of an experiment.  In other words, when ''f''(''x'' | ''θ'') is viewed as a function of ''x'' with ''θ'' fixed, it is a probability density function, and when viewed as a function of ''θ'' with ''x'' fixed, it is a likelihood function.

''Note:'' This is ''not'' the same as the probability that those parameters are the right ones, given the observed sample. Attempting to interpret the likelihood of a hypothesis given observed evidence as the probability of the hypothesis is a common error, with potentially disastrous real-world consequences in medicine, engineering or jurisprudence. See [[prosecutor's fallacy]] for an example of this.

From a geometric standpoint, if we consider ''f'' (''x'', ''θ'') as a function of two variables then the family of probability distributions can be viewed as level curves parallel to the ''x'' -axis, while the family of likelihood functions are the orthogonal level curves parallel to the θ-axis.

===Likelihoods for continuous distributions===
The use of the [[probability density]] instead of a probability in specifying the likelihood function above may be justified in a simple way. Suppose that, instead of an exact observation, ''x'', the observation is the value in a short interval (''x''<sub>''j''&minus;1</sub>, ''x''<sub>''j''</sub>), with length ''Δ''<sub>''j''</sub>, where the subscripts refer to a predefined set of intervals. Then the probability of getting this observation (of being in interval ''j'') is approximately

:<math>L_\text{approx}(\theta \mid x \text{ in interval } j)=\Delta_j f(x_{*}\mid\theta), \!</math>

where ''x''<sub>*</sub> can be any point in interval ''j''. Then, recalling that the likelihood function is defined up to a multiplicative constant, it is just as valid to say that the likelihood function is approximately

:<math>L_\text{approx}(\theta \mid x \text{ in interval } j)= f(x_{*}\mid\theta), \!</math>

and then, on considering the lengths of the intervals to decrease to zero,

:<math>L(\theta \mid x )= f(x\mid\theta). \!</math>

===Likelihoods for mixed continuous &mdash; discrete distributions===
The above can be extended in a simple way to allow consideration of distributions which contain both discrete and continuous components. Suppose that the distribution consists of a number of discrete probability masses ''p<sub>k</sub>''(θ) and a density ''f''(''x'' | ''θ''), where the sum of all the ''p'''s added to the integral of ''f'' is always one. Assuming that it is possible to distinguish an observation corresponding to one of the discrete probability masses from one which corresponds to the density component, the likelihood function for an observation from the continuous component can be dealt with as above by setting the interval length short enough to exclude any of the discrete masses. For an observation from the discrete component, the probability can either be written down directly or treated within the above context by saying that the probability of getting an observation in an interval that does contain a discrete component (of being in interval ''j'' which contains discrete component ''k'') is approximately

:<math>L_\text{approx}(\theta \mid x \text{ in interval } j \text{ containing discrete mass } k)=p_k(\theta)+\Delta_j f(x_{*}\mid\theta), \!</math>

where x<sub>*</sub> can be any point in interval ''j''. Then, on considering the lengths of the intervals to decrease to zero, the likelihood function for a observation from the discrete component is

:<math>L(\theta \mid x )= p_k(\theta), \!</math>

where ''k'' is the index of the discrete probability mass corresponding to observation ''x''.

The fact that the likelihood function can be defined in a way that includes contributions that are not commensurate (the density and the probability mass) arises from the way in which the likelihood function is defined up to a constant of proportionality, where this "constant" can change with the observation ''x'', but not with the parameter ''θ''.

== Example 1==
[[Image:likelihoodFunctionAfterHH.png|thumb|400px|The likelihood function for estimating the probability of a coin landing heads-up without prior knowledge after observing HH]]
[[Image:likelihoodFunctionAfterHHT.png|thumb|400px|The likelihood function for estimating the probability of a coin landing heads-up without prior knowledge after observing HHT]]
Let <math>p_\text{H}</math> be the probability that a certain coin lands heads up (H) when tossed. So, the probability of getting two heads in two tosses (HH) is <math>p_\text{H}^2</math>. If <math>p_\text{H} = 0.5</math>, then the probability of seeing two heads is 0.25.

In symbols, we can say the above as:

:<math>P(\text{HH} | p_\text{H}=0.5) = 0.25</math>.

Another way of saying this is to reverse it and say that "the likelihood that <math>p_\text{H} = 0.5</math>, given the observation HH, is 0.25"; that is:

:<math>L(p_\text{H}=0.5 | \text{HH}) = P(\text{HH} | p_\text{H}=0.5) = 0.25.</math>

But this is not the same as saying that the ''probability'' that <math>p_\text{H} = 0.5</math>, given the observation HH, is 0.25.

Notice that the likelihood that <math>p_\text{H} = 1</math>, given the observation HH, is 1. But it is clearly not true that the ''probability'' that <math>p_\text{H} = 1</math>, given the observation HH, is 1. Two heads in a row hardly proves that the coin ''always'' comes up heads. In fact, two heads in a row is possible for any <math>p_\text{H} > 0</math>.

The likelihood function is not a [[probability density function]]. Notice that the integral of a likelihood function is not in general 1.  In this example, the integral of the likelihood over the interval [0, 1] in <math>p_\text{H}</math> is 1/3, demonstrating that the likelihood function cannot be interpreted as a probability density function for <math>p_\text{H}</math>.

== Example 2==
{{Main|German tank problem}}

Consider a jar containing ''N'' lottery tickets numbered from 1 through ''N''. If you pick a ticket randomly then you get positive integer ''n'', with probability 1/''N'' if ''n'' ≤ ''N'' and with probability zero if ''n'' > ''N''. This can be written

:<math>P(n|N)= \frac{[n \le N]}{N}</math>

where the [[Iverson bracket]] [''n'' ≤ ''N''] is 1 when ''n'' ≤ ''N'' and 0 otherwise.
When considered a function of ''n'' for fixed ''N'' this is the probability distribution, but when considered a function of ''N'' for fixed ''n'' this is a likelihood function. The [[maximum likelihood]] estimate for ''N'' is ''N''<sub>0</sub> = ''n'' (by contrast, the [[Bias_of_an_estimator#Maximum_of_a_discrete_uniform_distribution|unbiased estimate]] is 2''n'' &minus; 1).

This likelihood function is not a probability distribution, because the total
:<math>\sum_{N=1}^\infty P(n|N) = \sum_{N} \frac{[N \ge n]}{N} = \sum_{N=n}^\infty \frac{1}{N}</math>
is a [[divergent series]].

Suppose, however, that you pick ''two'' tickets rather than ''one''.

The probability of the outcome {''n''<sub>1</sub>, ''n''<sub>2</sub>}, where ''n''<sub>1</sub> < ''n''<sub>2</sub>, is

:<math>P(\{n_1,n_2\}|N)= \frac{[n_2 \le N]}{\binom N 2} .</math>

When considered a function of ''N'' for fixed ''n''<sub>2</sub>, this is a likelihood function. The [[maximum likelihood]] estimate for ''N'' is ''N''<sub>0</sub> = ''n''<sub>2</sub>.

This time the total

:<math>\sum_{N=1}^\infty P(\{n_1,n_2\}|N) 
= \sum_{N} \frac{[N\ge n_2]}{\binom N 2}
=\frac 2 {n_2-1}  </math>

is a convergent series, and so this likelihood function can be normalized into a probability distribution.

If you pick 3 or more tickets, the likelihood function has a well defined [[mean value]], which is larger than the maximum likelihood estimate. If you pick 4 or more tickets, the likelihood function has a well defined  [[standard deviation]] too.

==Likelihoods that eliminate nuisance parameters==
In many cases, the likelihood is a function of more than one parameter but interest focuses on the estimation of only one, or at most a few of them, with the others being considered as [[nuisance parameter]]s. Several alternative approaches have been developed to eliminate such [[nuisance parameter]]s so that a likelihood can be written as a function of only the [[Nuisance parameter|parameter (or parameters) of interest]]; the main approaches being marginal, conditional and profile likelihoods.<ref>

These approaches are useful because standard likelihood methods can become unreliable or fail entirely when there are many nuisance parameters or when the nuisance parameters are high-dimensional.  This is particularly true when the nuisance parameters can be considered to be "missing data"; they represent a non-negligible fraction of the number of observations and this fraction does not decrease when the sample size increases. Often these approaches can be used to derive closed-form formulae for statistical tests when direct use of maximum likelihood requires iterative numerical methods.  These approaches find application in some specialized topics such as [[sequential analysis]].

===Conditional likelihood===
Sometimes it is possible to find a [[sufficient statistic]] for the nuisance parameters, and conditioning on this statistic results in a likelihood which does not depend on the nuisance parameters.

One example occurs in 2×2 tables, where conditioning on all four marginal totals leads to a conditional likelihood based on the non-central [[hypergeometric distribution]]. This form of conditioning is also the basis for [[Fisher's exact test]].

===Marginal likelihood===
{{Main|Marginal likelihood}}
<!-- needs expansion  ~~~~ -->
Sometimes we can remove the nuisance parameters by considering a likelihood based on only part of the information in the data, for example by using the set of ranks rather than the numerical values. Another example occurs in linear [[mixed model]]s, where considering a likelihood for the residuals only after fitting the fixed effects leads to [[residual maximum likelihood]] estimation of the variance components.

===Profile likelihood===
<!-- 1st 2 paras based on material previously headed "Concentrated likelihood"  ~~~~~ -->
It is often possible to write some parameters as functions of other parameters, thereby reducing the number of independent parameters.
(The function is the parameter value which maximizes the likelihood given the value of the other parameters.)
This procedure is called concentration of the parameters and results in the concentrated likelihood function, also occasionally known as the maximized likelihood function, but most often called the profile likelihood function.
<!--
Suggestions for expansion: an example of concentration [added below, on august 27, 2005]; explanation on usage in maximum likelihood in optimization -->

For example, consider a [[regression analysis]] model with [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] [[errors and residuals in statistics|errors]]. The most likely value of the error [[variance]] is the variance of the [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]]. The residuals depend on all other parameters. Hence the variance parameter can be written as a function of the other parameters.

Unlike conditional and marginal likelihoods, profile likelihood methods can always be used, even when the profile likelihood cannot be written down explicitly. However, the profile likelihood is not a true likelihood, as it is not based directly on a probability distribution, and this leads to some less satisfactory properties.  Attempts have been made to improve this, resulting in modified profile likelihood.

The idea of profile likelihood can also be used to compute [[confidence interval]]s that often have better small-sample properties than those based on asymptotic [[Standard error (statistics)|standard errors]] calculated from the full likelihood. In the case of parameter estimation in partially observed systems, the profile likelihood can be also used for [[identifiability]] analysis.<ref>

==Historical remarks==
In English, "likelihood" has been distinguished as being related to but weaker than "probability" since its earliest uses. The comparison of hypotheses by evaluating likelihoods has been used for centuries, for example by [[John Milton]] in [[Aeropagitica]]: "when greatest likelihoods are brought that such things are truly and really in those persons to whom they are ascribed".

In Danish, "likelihood" was used by [[Thorvald N. Thiele]] in 1889.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of Mathematical Statistics from 1750 to 1930 |author=[[Anders Hald]]|year=1998 |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |isbn=0471179124}}</ref><ref>

In English, "likelihood" appears in many writings by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], where [[Statistical model|model]]-based inference (usually [[abductive reasoning|abduction]] but sometimes including [[inductive reasoning|induction]]) is  distinguished from statistical procedures based on [[objective]] [[randomization]]. Peirce's preference for randomization-based inference is discussed in "[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#illus|Illustrations of the Logic of Science]]" (1877–1878) and "[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#SIL|A Theory of Probable Inference]]" (1883)".{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  <blockquote>
"probabilities that are strictly objective and at the same time very great, although they can never be absolutely conclusive, ought nevertheless to influence our preference for one hypothesis over another; but slight probabilities, even if objective, are not worth consideration; and merely subjective likelihoods should be disregarded altogether. For they are merely expressions of our preconceived notions" (7.227 in his ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]''{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"But experience must be our chart in economical navigation; and experience shows that likelihoods are treacherous guides. Nothing has caused so much waste of time and means, in all sorts of researchers, as inquirers' becoming so wedded to certain likelihoods as to forget all the other factors of the economy of research; so that, unless it be very solidly grounded, likelihood is far better disregarded, or nearly so; and even when it seems solidly grounded, it should be proceeded upon with a cautious tread, with an eye to other considerations, and recollection of the disasters caused." (''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#EP|Essential Peirce]]''{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, volume 2, pages 108–109)
</blockquote>
Like Thiele, Peirce considers the likelihood for a binomial distribution. Peirce uses the [[log odds|logarithm of the odds-ratio]] throughout his career. Peirce's propensity for using the [[log odds]] is discussed by [[Stephen Stigler]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In Great Britain, "likelihood" was introduced in mathematical statistics by [[R.A. Fisher]] in 1922<ref name=Fisher1922>{{cite journal

Fisher argues against [[inverse probability]] as a basis for statistical inferences, and instead proposes inferences based on likelihood functions. Fisher's use of "likelihood" fixed the terminology that is used by statisticians throughout the world.
