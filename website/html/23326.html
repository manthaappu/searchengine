'''MakerBot Industries''' is a company founded in January 2009 by [[Bre Pettis]], Adam Mayer, and Zach “Hoeken” Smith producing an [[open source]] [[3D printing|3D printer]] [[rapid prototyping]] machine called the Cupcake CNC. The Cupcake incorporates the ideas of the [[RepRap Project]] with the goal of bringing desktop 3D printing into the home at an affordable price, partially due to being able to produce some of its own parts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gizmodo.com/5364435/at-gizmodo-gallery-2009-makerbot-3d-printer|title=At Gizmodo Gallery 2009: MakerBot 3D Printer|date=2009-09-21|author=Adrian Covert|publisher=[[Gizmodo]]}}</ref> It allows people to make their own bots that can build almost anything up to 4"x4"x6". They print with [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS) , [[high-density polyethylene]] (HDPE)  and [[polylactic acid]] (PLA) plastics.<ref name="official">{{cite web|url=http://makerbot.com|title= MakerBot Industries - Robots That Make Things.}}</ref>

MakerBot started shipping in April 2009 and has sold units as fast as they can produce them.<ref>{{cite web|author=CupCake CNC Deluxe Kit |url=http://store.makerbot.com/cupcake-cnc/cupcake-cnc-deluxe-kit.html |title=CupCake CNC Deluxe Kit - CupCake CNC - MakerBot Industries |publisher=Store.makerbot.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-07}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> As of September 2009, there are over 200 machines.<ref name="wired">{{cite|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/08/makerbot/|title=3-D Printers Make Manufacturing Accessible|author=Priya Ganapati|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}</ref> Demand for the kits was so great in 2009, that the company solicited MakerBot owners to provide parts for future MakerBots from their own MakerBots.<ref name="dist">{{cite|url=http://blog.makerbot.com/2009/08/06/makerbot-is-pioneering-distributed-manufacturing-get-paid-to-make-parts-for-future-makerbots/|title=MakerBot is pioneering distributed manufacturing!

Cupcake CNC machines are sold as [[do it yourself]] kits. The circuit boards are already soldered, requiring only minor soldering on non-critical parts from the user.

MakerBot Industries has an online community called Thingiverse where users can post files, document their designs, and collaborate on open source hardware.  The site is not just for MakerBot, but rather for anyone with a digital fabrication device to share their designs.<ref name="wired" />

== Terminology ==
[[File:MakerBot-printing-cylinder.ogv|thumb|250px | alt=A MakerBot printing a cylindrical object|A MakerBot printing a cylindrical object]]
*Heated Build Platform:  A platform for building; meant to overcome the problem of replicated parts that curl due to selective cooling of the print layers.
*Raft:  A mesh-like layer of support material; meant to overcome the curling problem in replicated parts.
*Vitamin:  Any component of a Makerbot that the Makerbot cannot make for itself (e.g. metal rods, [[printed circuit boards]])

== Batch numbers and further products==
The latest batch is Batch #15 and shipped in the middle of May 2010.
A MakerBot named Gidget, of Batch #15, and the 2000th MakerBot is scheduled to appear at the September 16 Maker Faire in New York.

MakerBot Industries now features

*automatic build platform
*a Cyclops 3D scanner
