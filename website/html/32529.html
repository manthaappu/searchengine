'''rpath''' is a term in [[computer science]] which refers to a [[Run time (computing)|runtime]] [[search path]] hard-coded in an [[executable file]] or [[library (computer science)|library]], used during [[dynamic linking]] to find the libraries the executable or library requires. It is inserted in the executable or library at link time.

Specifically it encodes a path to shared libraries into the header of an executable (or another shared library).  This RPATH header value (so named in the [[Executable and Linkable Format]] header standards) may either override or supplement the system default dynamic linking search path (as defined in ''/etc/ld.so.conf'' on Linux systems, for example).

It can be thought of as a compile-time alternative to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment setting.  While LD_LIBRARY_PATH would have to be properly set in the environment of any process attempting to run a given program; the RPATH setting is compiled into that program's headers.  

The primary disadvantage of using RPATH is that it has higher priority than the LD_LIBRARY_PATH settings which makes things like running a precompiled binary out of a user's home directory or some other non-default location difficult or impossible. Use of RPATH also makes it difficult, if not impossible, to upgrade libraries without forcing a reinstallation of all the software dependent on (even the older versions of) the libraries.
