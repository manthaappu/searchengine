== History ==
In June 2006, smart card providers Axalto and Gemplus merged to become Gemalto.  Axalto was a Schlumberger IPO spin-off in 2004. In April 2010, Gemalto completed the acquisition of internet banking security specialist Todos AB.<ref>[http://www.gemalto.com/php/pr_view.php?id=737 Gemalto acquired Todos]</ref>

===Axalto and Schlumberger===
[[Schlumberger]] began its [[chip card]] activities in February 1979 when it licensed and marketed certain chip card technologies developed and patented by Roland Moreno, who is generally credited with the invention of the chip card.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gemalto.com/investors/download/07-03-2006-prospectus.pdf|title=''Gemalto 2006 prospectus”|accessdate=1 November 2008}}</ref>

Schlumberger developed the first telephone chip cards for [[France Telecom]] and the Swedish telecommunications operator [[Telia]] in the early 1980s. The company developed long-standing and close ties with telecommunications operators around the world and, as a result, played a role in industry-wide efforts to develop new digital mobile communication standards, particularly the [[GSM]] transmission standard (Global System for Mobile Communication). Schlumberger designed its first [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM]] (Subscriber Identity Module) card in the early 1990s for the launch of GSM in [[Europe]], and this led to the use of microprocessor card technology as an access and security solution for mobile telephony worldwide, in 3 billion handsets today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsmworld.com/news/statistics/index.shtml |title=”GSM World Statistics”|accessdate=1 November 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080822040039/http://www.gsmworld.com/news/statistics/index.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 22 August 2008}}</ref> 

In the early 1980s, the French banking sector decided to migrate from the magnetic stripe card-based payment system to a more modern and secure microprocessor card-based system. Schlumberger received its first contract in June 1981 to provide [[GIE Cartes Bancaires]], the French credit/debit card issuers’ association, with 5,000 microprocessor cards and 200 associated POS terminals. The microprocessor card-based payment system subsequently became standard in France and eventually led to a global standard known as [[EMV]], set up by Europay, MasterCard and Visa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gemalto.com/investors/agm/agm-2006-05-19/download/2005_annual_report.pdf|title=”Gemalto 2005 Annual Report”|accessdate=1 November 2008}}</ref> Today there are 730 million EMV cards in circulation.

Schlumberger experienced strong internal and external growth since the launch of its chip card operations in the early 1980s through the 1990s and 2000s, both in terms of revenue and product portfolio, particularly with the substantial growth in GSM-based mobile telecommunications. Significant acquisitions of regional companies in card production and personalization included Cowells (United Kingdom), Malco (United States), Printer (Mexico) and Cardtech (Brazil). The acquisition of Solaic in 1996 and Bull-CP8 from Bull in 2001 allowed the company to strengthen its presence in the banking services in France and China. 

In 2003, Schlumberger created Axalto as a division to consolidate into one company all of its card and POS terminal activities, which until then had been managed by several subsidiaries and joint ventures of the Schlumberger group. Subsequently Axalto
was successfully listed on the [[Euronext]] Paris market on May 18, 2004.

===Gemplus===
Gemplus started its operations in 1988 as a supplier of prepaid phonecards. Because of its presence in the market of the prepaid phonecards during the 1990s, the company developed ties with the telecommunications industry along with Schlumberger. 

Prior to 1999, the business was conducted through Gemplus S.C.A., a French limited partnership. In December 1999, Gemplus Associates, the general partner of Gemplus S.C.A., merged into Gemplus S.C.A., which became a joint stock company, Gemplus SA. In February 2000, the corporate structure was reorganized and a new holding company, Gemplus International SA, a Luxembourg corporation, was created. Texas Pacific Group became a shareholder of Gemplus at the time of its equity contribution in February 2000. 

In December 2000, the company completed an initial public offering of its capital stock, in the form of ordinary shares traded on the Eurolist of Euronext Paris, and ADSs traded on the U.S. NASDAQ exchange. In 2004, the company completed the planned reorganization of its corporate structure by transferring most of the subsidiaries of Gemplus SA to Gemplus International SA.

In April 2005, Gemplus acquired Setec OY, a company headquartered in Finland that, among other things, supplies conventional and electronic travel passports to various government agencies and products involving secure printing.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gemalto.com/investors/download/07-11-2006-engl_trans.pdf|title=”Public Exchange Offer”|accessdate=1 November 2008}}</ref>

===Merger and Digital Security Vision===
In June 2006, smart card providers Axalto and Gemplus merged to become Gemalto.  Gemalto Chairman Alex Mandl said of the merger, “Thanks to this merger, we have assembled the skills and the scale to fully serve three important markets: mobile telecom, secure transactions and security.” <ref name=multiple/>

With the merger, the two former smart card companies set out to achieve a new, broader  vision for Gemalto—to be the world’s leading digital security company.  Gemalto CEO Olivier Piou explained the term “digital security” and Gemalto’s vision in a 2008 interview: 

“Digital security has a key role to play in the ‘digital revolution’– a major trend already bringing huge benefits to developed countries, and being enthusiastically adopted by emerging nations. Yet fear of fraud, identity theft and other concerns are holding people back from making the most of these opportunities.  They need to feel that the wealth of devices and services on offer are both convenient to use and trustworthy. So convenience and trust are at the core of our vision of digital security. Developments in all our key markets show how well received they are… We are continuously expanding the possibilities of secure digital technology with new services and new products, and winning meaningful contracts in all segments and geographies.” <ref name=multiple/>
