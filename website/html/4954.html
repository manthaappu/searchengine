'''CAdES''' (''CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures'') is a set of extensions to [[Cryptographic Message Syntax|Cryptographic Message Syntax(CMS)]] signed data making it suitable for advanced [[electronic signature]].

==Description==
While [[Cryptographic Message Syntax|CMS]] is a general framework for digitally signing documents such as E-Mail([[S/MIME]]) or [[PDF]], CAdES specifies precise profiles of [[Cryptographic Message Syntax|CMS]] signed data for use with [http://europa.eu/eur-lex/pri/en/oj/dat/2000/l_013/l_01320000119en00120020.pdf advanced electronic signature in the meaning of European Union Directive 1999/93/EC]. One important benefit from CAdES is that electronically signed documents can remain valid for long periods, even if underlying cryptographic algorithms are broken.

==Profiles==
CAdES defines six profiles (forms) differing in protection level offered. Each profile includes and extends the previous one:

*'''CAdES''', basic form just satisfying Directive legal requirements for advanced signature;
*'''CAdES-T''' (timestamp), adding [[Trusted timestamping|timestamp]] field to protect against repudiation;
*'''CAdES-C''' (complete), adding references to verification data (certificates and revocation lists) to the signed documents to allow off-line verification and verification in future (but not storing actual verification data);
*'''CAdES-X''' (extended), adding [[Trusted timestamping|timestamps]] on the references introduced by CAdES-C to protect against possible compromise of certificates in chain in future;
*'''CAdES-X-L''' (extended long-term), adding actual certificates and revocation lists to the signed document to allow verification in future even if their original source is not available;
*'''CAdES-A''' (archival), adding possibility for periodical [[Trusted timestamping|timestamping]] (e.g. each year) of the archived document to prevent compromise caused by weakening signature during long-time storage period.
