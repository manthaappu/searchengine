<html> <head> <title>Co-NP-complete</title></head><body>In [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]], computational problems that are '''co-NP-complete''' are those that are the hardest problems in [[co-NP]], in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in '''[[P (complexity)|P]]'''. If there exists a way to solve a co-NP-complete problem quickly, then that algorithm can be used to solve all co-NP problems quickly.

Each Co-NP-complete problem is the [[complement (complexity)|complement]] of an [[NP-complete]] problem. The two sets are either equal or disjoint. The latter is thought more likely, but this is not known. See [[co-NP]] and [[NP-complete]] for more details.

Fortune showed in 1979 that if any [[sparse language]] is co-NP-complete (or even just co-NP-hard), then {{nowrap|[[P = NP problem|P = NP]]}},<ref>S. Fortune. A note on sparse complete sets. ''SIAM Journal on Computing'', volume 8, issue 3, pp.431–433. 1979.</ref> a critical foundation for [[Mahaney's theorem]].

==Formal definition==
A [[decision problem]] ''C'' is co-NP-complete if it is in [[co-NP]] and if every problem in co-NP is [[polynomial-time many-one reduction|polynomial-time many-one reducible]] to it. This means that for every Co-NP problem ''L'', there exists a polynomial time algorithm which can transform any instance of ''L'' into an instance of ''C'' with the same [[truth value]]. As a consequence, if we had a polynomial time algorithm for ''C'', we could solve all co-NP problems in polynomial time.

==Example==
One simple example of a co-NP complete problem is [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], the problem of determining whether a given [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean]] formula is a tautology; that is, whether every possible assignment of true/false values to variables yields a true statement. This is closely related to the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]], which asks whether there exists ''at least one'' such assignment.
