'''Rock-paper-scissors''' is a [[hand game]] played by two or more people. The game is known by many names, including ''scissors-paper-rock'', ''piedra papel o tijera'', ''fargling'', ''cachi-pún'', ''burung-batu-air'' ("bird-stone-water"), ''jan-ken-poi'', ''janken'', ''kauwi-bauwi-bo'', ''камень-ножницы-бумага'' and ''rochambeau''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://rpschamps.com/index.php/templates/j15_rps/images/propaganda/faq/game-basics|title=Game Basics|accessdate=2009-12-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/03/16/BA251812.DTL |title=Ready, set ...

The game is often used as a [[selection methods|selection method]] in a way similar to [[coin flipping]], [[drawing straws]], or throwing [[dice]]. However, unlike truly [[randomness|random]] selection methods, rock-paper-scissors can be played with a degree of skill, especially if the game extends over many sessions with the same players; it is often possible to recognize and exploit the non-random behavior of an opponent.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=Len|title=Rock, paper, scissors: game theory in everyday life|year=2008|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=9780465009381|page=94}}</ref>

== Game play ==
{{triple image|right|Rock-paper-scissors (rock).png|70|Rock-paper-scissors (paper).png|70|Rock-paper-scissors (scissors).png|70|Each of the three basic hand-signs (from left to right: rock, paper, and scissors) beats one of the other two, and loses to the other.}}

The players count aloud to three, or speak the name of the game (e.g. "Rock! Paper! Scissors!" or "Ro! Cham! Beau!"), each time raising one hand in a fist and swinging it down on the count. On the third count (saying, "Scissors!" or "Beau!"), the players change their hands into one of three gestures, which they then "throw" by extending it towards their opponent. Variations include a version where players use a fourth count — "Shoot!" — before throwing their gesture, or a version where they only shake their hands twice before "throwing." Others prefer a five count cadence by saying "Says Shoot!" or "And Shoot!" before throwing their gesture.  The gestures are:

* '''Rock''', represented by a clenched fist.
* '''Scissors''', represented by two fingers extended and separated.
* '''Paper''', represented by an open hand, with the fingers connected (horizontal).

The objective is to select a gesture which defeats that of the opponent. Gestures are resolved as follows:

* Rock blunts or breaks scissors: that is, rock defeats scissors
* Scissors cut paper: scissors defeats paper
* Paper covers, sands or captures rock: paper defeats rock

If both players choose the same gesture, the game is tied and the players throw again.

== History ==
{{Original research|date=January 2010}}
According to Xie Zhaozhe (谢肇淛)'s book ‘’Wuzazu(五杂组)‘’, in the Chinese [[Ming Dynasty|Ming dynasty period]], the game could date back to the time of Chinese [[Han Dynasty|Han dynasty]], it is called (手势令). Li rihua(李日华)'s book '' Note of Liuyanzhai(六砚斋笔记)''also reveals this game, calling it shoushiling(手势令), or huozhitou（豁指头）, or huoquan（豁拳）. In the 18th century these games were popular in Japan.　 The Japanese people invented Janken(Rock-paper-scissors) in the latter half of 19th century. As for Rock-paper-scissors, it came to be played all over the world in the 20th century. {{Nihongo|'''Jan-ken-pon'''|じゃんけんぽん}}, or more commonly {{Nihongo|'''janken'''|じゃんけん}}, often transliterated in other ways such as '''jack-en-poy''' (tagalog), '''janken-po''', etc., sometimes called {{Nihongo|'''rock ken'''|石拳|ishiken}}, and known as rock-paper-scissors or paper-scissors-stone in the [[English-speaking world]]. The origin or the derivation of the name is unknown. {{Nihongo|'''ken'''|拳|ken}} is a fist in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and ''Jan-ken-po'' is categorized as a {{Nihongo|"ken (fist) games"|拳遊び|ken asobi}}.
''Janken'' is believed to have been based on two older ''ken'' games, ''sū ken'' ({{Lang|ja|数拳}},  number competing game with fingers, likely similar to or identical with [[Morra]]) and ''san sukumi ken'' ({{Lang|ja|三すくみ拳}}, ''san sukumi'' means the freezing aspects of a snake, frog, and slug with fear). ''San sukumi ken'' has existed in Japan since ancient times, and ''sū ken'' was imported from China in the late 17th century; the name in China of ''sū ken'' is ''shǒushìlìng'' ({{Lang|zh|手勢令}}). ''Ken'' games began to increase in popularity in the middle of the 19th century.

== Variations ==
Players have developed numerous cultural and personal variations on the game, from simply playing the same game with different objects, to expanding into more weapons and rules.
*Rock-paper-scissors is frequently played in a "best two out of three" match, and in many cases psych-outs, shouting, and trick gestures are performed to confuse or trick the other player into throwing an illegal toss resulting in a loss. Some players prefer to shout the name of a throw they do not intend to throw in order to misdirect and confuse their opponent. It generally applies that what is thrown is what is officially counted in the match.  For instance, yelling Scissors or Paper, and actually throwing Rock. The rock is what is judged and tallied. During tournaments, players often prepare their sequence of three gestures prior to the tournament's commencement.<ref name="Lawrence Journal-World">Steve Vockrodt, [http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2007/apr/08/student_rivals_throw_down_rock_paper_scissors_tour/ "Student rivals throw down at rock, paper, scissors tournament"], ''[[Lawrence Journal-World]]'', April 8, 2007. Retrieved April 13, 2007.</ref><ref name="Fox News">Michael Y. Park, [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,188380,00.html "Rock, Paper, Scissors, the Sport"], ''[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]'', March 20, 2006. Retrieved April 13, 2007.</ref>

=== Additional weapons ===
With an odd number of choices, each beats half the weapons and loses to half the weapons. No even number of weapons can be made balanced, unless some pairs of weapons result in a draw; there will always be some weapons superior to others.

An example of an unbalanced four-weapon game adds "[[dynamite]]" as a trump. Dynamite, expressed as the extended index finger or thumb, always defeats rock, but is defeated by scissors. The paper-dynamite relationship is disputed; using it as a trump generally implies that "dynamite shreds paper," but there are those who claim that the paper would supposedly smother the fuse. Because of this dispute (and the potential unfair advantage that would result), organized rock-paper-scissors contests never use dynamite. A game theory analysis would eliminate one of the four symbols for being a strategy strictly dominated, and the resulting game would be isomorphic to the original rock, paper, scissor (i.e., only a symbol's name would change).<ref>{{cite web

Similarly, the French game "pierre, papier, ciseaux, puits" (rock, paper, scissors, well) is unbalanced; both the rock and scissors fall in the well and lose to it, while paper covers both rock and well. This means two "weapons", well and paper, can defeat two moves, while the last two weapons can only defeat one of the other three choices.

:''Main article: [[Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock]]''

One popular five-weapon expansion, claimed to have been invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla,<ref>{{cite web | title = Original Rock-Paper-Scissors-Spock-Lizard Page | url = http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html | author = Sam Kass | accessdate = 2009-03-11 }}</ref> adds "[[Spock]]" and "[[lizard]]" to the standard three. "Spock" is signified with the Star Trek [[Vulcan salute]], while "lizard" is shown by forming the hand into a sock-puppet-like mouth. Spock smashes scissors and vaporizes rock; he is poisoned by lizard and disproved by paper. Lizard poisons Spock and eats paper; it is crushed by rock and decapitated by scissors. This variant was mentioned in a 2005 article of ''[[The Times]]''<ref name="TimesSpockLizard">{{cite news| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/leading_article/article1080425.ece | title = ... and paper scissors | publisher = [[The Times]] Online | date = 11 June 2005 | accessdate = 2009-06-09 | location=London}}<!-- for some reason the Times website 404s on this link when the referrer is Wikipedia. Type it in by hand and it works --></ref> and appeared in an [[List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#ep25|episode]] of the [[situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', "The Lizard-Spock Expansion," in 2008.
As long as the number of moves is an odd number and that each move defeats exactly half of the other moves while being defeated by the other half, any combinations of moves will function as a game. For example, a 101-move version exists.<ref>{{cite web | title = RPS101 | url = http://www.umop.com/rps101/rps101chart.html }}</ref>

== Instances of use in real-life scenarios ==
=== Federal case ===
In 2006, Federal Judge [[Gregory A. Presnell|Gregory Presnell]] from the Middle District of Florida ordered opposing sides in a lengthy court case to settle a trivial (but lengthily debated) point over the appropriate place for a [[deposition (law)|deposition]] using the game of rock-paper-scissors.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003052251_game10.html | title = Exasperated judge resorts to child's game | agency = Associated Press | date = 2006-06-26 | accessdate = 2006-08-20 | work=The Seattle Times}}</ref>  The ruling in ''Avista Management v.

=== Auction house rock-paper-scissors match ===
[[Image:Paul Cézanne 076.jpg|thumb|''Large Trees Under the Jas de Bouffan'' sold for $11,776,000 at Christie's.<ref name="CityReview">[http://www.thecityreview.com/s05cimp1.html Art/Auctions logo, Impressionist & Modern Art, Christie's, 7 pm, May 4, 2005, Sale 1514].</ref>]]
When Takashi Hashiyama, CEO of [[Maspro Denkoh|a Japanese television equipment manufacturer]], decided to auction off the collection of [[impressionism|impressionist]] paintings owned by his corporation, including works by [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], and [[Vincent van Gogh|van Gogh]], he contacted two leading auction houses, [[Christie's]] International and [[Sotheby's]] Holdings, seeking their proposals on how they would bring the collection to the market as well as how they would maximize the profits from the sale. Both firms made elaborate proposals, but neither was persuasive enough to get Hashiyama’s business. Unwilling to split up the collection into separate auctions, Hashiyama asked the firms to decide between themselves who would hold the auction, which included Cézanne's "Large Trees Under the Jas de Bouffan", worth $12–16 million.

The houses were unable to reach a decision. Hashiyama told the two firms to play rock-paper-scissors to decide who would get the rights to the auction, explaining that "it probably looks strange to others, but I believe this is the best way to decide between two things which are equally good".

The auction houses had a weekend to come up with a choice of move. Christie's went to the 11-year-old twin daughters of an employee, who suggested "scissors" because "Everybody expects you to choose 'rock'." Sotheby's said that they treated it as a [[game of chance]] and had no particular strategy for the game, but went with "paper".<ref>{{Cite news

== Rock-paper-scissors in video games ==
===Main game mechanics===
Some [[Facebook]] apps revolve almost entirely around Rock-Paper-Scissors matches, like [[Rock-Paper-Sumo]].

===Secondary main game mechanics===
In these games, RPS is not the main way of resolving conflict or advancing in a game, but is mixed with other mechanics.

* [[Sega]]'s [[1986]] [[Alex Kidd in Miracle World]]: right at the end of each level, the player must beat an enemy at a best-of-three game of rock-paper-scissors.
* [[Naruto: Ultimate Ninja (series)|Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja 4]]: when two players collide, one must press a button to determine rock, paper, or scissors. The winner then proceeds to attack the loser.
* [[Dragon Warrior Monsters]], players must beat Goopi in rock-paper-scissors contests in order to progress in the game.
* [[Hudson Soft]]'s [[NES]] title [[Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom]] used "Finger Wars," a modified game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, to fight against enemies.
* In [[Mother 3]] the main character, Lucas, has to play Stone-Sheet-Clippers, the game's version of rock, paper, scissors, with the fictional band DCMC at the end of the 4th chapter.
* In the [[Fire Emblem]] series, there is a Rock-paper-scissor-like term called Weapon Triangle (Sword, Axe and Lance). Swords are fast attacking weapons, Axe are powerful weapons and Lances have long reach. Sword beats Axe, Axe beats Lance and Lance beats Sword. But there's still a chance for the weaker weapon to win if the character is strong enough.

=== Lizard mating strategies ===
{{Main|Common side-blotched lizard#Mating strategy}}
The [[common side-blotched lizard]] (''Uta stansburiana'') exhibits a rock-paper-scissors pattern in its mating strategies. Of its three color types of males,  "orange beats blue, blue beats yellow, and yellow beats orange" in competition for females, which is similar to the rules of rock-paper-scissors.<ref>{{cite web | title = The rock-paper-scissors game and the evolution of alternative male strategies | url = http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/~barrylab/lizardland/male_lizards.overview.html | author = [[Barry Sinervo|Sinervo, Barry]] | accessdate = 2006-08-20 | date = 2001-02-20 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = The Games Lizards Play | url = http://7thavenueproject.com/post/451026680/barry-sinervo-lizards-and-evolution | author = [[Barry Sinervo on the 7th Avenue Project Radio Show]] }}</ref>

=== Coliform bacteria ===
Some bacteria also exhibit a rock-paper-scissors dynamic when they engage in [[antibiotic]] production. The theory for this finding was demonstrated by computer simulation and in the laboratory by Benjamin Kerr, working at [[Stanford University]] with Brendan Bohannan.<ref>Nature. 2002 Jul 11;418(6894):171-4</ref> The antibiotics in question are the [[bacteriocin]]s - more specifically, [[colicin]]s produced by ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. Biologist Benjamin C. Kirkup, Jr. further demonstrated that the colicins were active as ''E. coli'' compete with each other in the intestines of mice, and that the rock-paper-scissors dynamics allowed for the continued competition among strains: antibiotic-producers defeat antibiotic-sensitives; antibiotic-resisters multiply and withstand and out-compete the antibiotic-producers, letting antibiotic-sensitives multiply and out-compete others; until antibiotic-producers multiply again.<ref>Nature. 2004 Mar 25;428(6981):412-4</ref>

===Red Bull Roshambull World Online Series===
The Red Bull Roshambull is a Recognized Unofficial event by the World RPS which takes place over the Facebook Application "Red Bull Roshambull". Although originally a unrecognized event, in January 2011 it was given a Official Recognized event status due to the number of people who regulary take part in the World Championships and other recognized leagues starting to compete.However the event is still seen as a Non Ranking event and any awards or titles given in the tournament are not officially recognized outside the event.

The World Series is a Multiple Tournament contest in which a players performance in each separate tournament is scored, and after a number of Tournaments within the event have taken place, a Triple Elimination Playoff takes place to decide a overall Championship.
Over the last few seasons extra events have been added to the series, the most popular of them being the Hidden Stars (a tournament for Novice players on the application who may not know about the event being given a chance to compete without any regulars taking part) and the World Series Blitz (where all the events take place over 1 day rather than once a week like in the main event).

The key feature of this event is the number of players who are not known as people who play in real-life tournaments who show a lot of ambition to try and compete with those who Play in the most recognized events on a regular basis. This has created a small Community of players as well as a small rivalry between both sets of players to prove who is better
