'''NotePub''' is an online notepad that allows for private, public, and shared notes. NotePub is also an open purpose [[wiki]] without a [[markup language]]. Notes can include files and images, and can be linked to other notes within NotePub, or to external websites. Content is organized chronologically and with tags. Read and write permissions can be set for each note and user name. The user interface relies on [[drag-and-drop]] techniques to include content from other web sites or upload multiple images and files from the client computer. The user interface has been criticized as cluttered and awkward at first, but hassle-free after some initial learning.<ref>[http://webworkerdaily.com/2009/03/04/notepub-messy-but-good/ "WebWorkerDaily article of NotePub"]</ref><ref>[http://www.makeuseof.com/dir/notepub-easily-create-share-rich-notes/ "MakeUseOf review on NotePub"]</ref> 

In most other examples of note taking software, such as [[Evernote]], [[Springnote]], and [[Google Notebook]], search results are limited to a single notebook (in effect, a collection of notes created by a single user). NotePub search results include all public and private notes to which the current user has access. The importance of NotePub to the evolution of [[notetaking]] software, [[wikis]], and [[collaborative real-time editor]]s is the innovation of all users sharing a single stream of online notes, with access permissions set on a note by note basis.<ref>[http://notepub.com/?note=2858 "NotePub Public Launch"]</ref>

Notepub does lack some of the features commonly found in notetaking software, such as [[RSS]] syndication. Its emphasis is more on quick accessibility than on features. <ref>[http://www.killerstartups.com/Web-App-Tools/notepub-com-the-most-direct-way-to-save-share-notes "KillerStartUps review of NotePub"]</ref>

NotePub first launched on May 1, 2008.
