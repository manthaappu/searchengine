[http://www.stle.org The Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers] or "STLE" is the premier technical society that serves the needs of more than 10,000 individuals and 150 companies and organizations that comprise the tribology and lubrication engineering business sector, bringing together managers, engineers, scientists, technicians, academics, and government institutions from around the world to learn and share the “best practices” for the [[tribology]] and [[lubrication]] fields. 

This professional organization's stated mission is to advance the science of tribology and the practice of lubrication engineering in order to foster innovation, improve the performance of equipment and products, conserve resources and protect the environment. Its stated vision is to be a leader in the global network of individuals, institutions, societies and corporate entities with a common interest in advancing the science of tribology and the practice of lubrication engineering.

This international and interdisciplinary society operates from its {{convert|9000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. headquarters building located in Park Ridge, Illinois, a suburb located fifteen miles (24 km) northwest of downtown Chicago, where staff focus on areas of membership, certification, technical information and training, and publications to better support its members who influence the worldwide communities affected by tribology and lubricants. 

==History==
STLE is an individual membership society focusing on professional, technical and scientific issues and needs. It was founded on March 3, 1944, in Chicago as the American Society of Lubrication Engineers (ASLE). From these early days, into the 1980s, the organization’s primary audience was plant engineers in charge of lubrication for production equipment at major facilities like auto plans or steel mills. Major activities were technical conferences, peer-reviewed publishing and educational activities. 

To adapt and reflect evolving market and audience needs, the organization’s membership voted in 1987 to change the name to Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers (STLE). This acknowledged a growing international participation and appealed to a more diverse audience that encompassed many aspects of engineering and tribology, as well as the traditional base of lubrication engineers and suppliers of liquid lubricants. 

Creation and dissemination of reliable technical information, STLE’s strength for 65 years, will continue defining the organization’s purpose and value in the future. As the world searches for solutions to environmental and energy challenges, many of which are tied to the fundamentals of tribology and lubricants, STLE stands ready to be the trusted source of information for an expanding audience of people looking for answers to these challenges. 

==Organization==
STLE is incorporated in the State of Illinois. Structure and governance procedures are defined in a Constitution and Bylaws, which have recently been updated and revised. In addition, a strategic plan directs the ongoing activities of the Society. Annual budget is approximately $2.25 million. 

STLE’s elected leadership is provided by a 24-member Board of Directors. The President, who serves a one-year term, is the organization’s chief elected officer and the chairman of the Board of Directors. 

Complementing and extending the work of the Board is an impressive volunteer network that includes hundreds of individuals serving in a variety of ways. This might include participation in one of 23 technical committees and councils, an administrative committee, serving as an associate editor or reviewer for a Society journal or local Section activity. 

Working in concert with the elected leadership and volunteers is a 9-person professional staff who work out of its headquarters in Park Ridge. In its entirety, the STLE staff have combined experience of more than 100 years in association and organization management.

STLE is recognized by the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3)non-profit organization.
