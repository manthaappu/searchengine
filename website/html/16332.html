<html> <head> <title>Harry Huskey</title></head><body>'''Harry Douglas Huskey''' (born January 19, 1916) is an [[United States|American]] computer designer pioneer.

Huskey was born in the [[Smoky Mountains]] region of [[North Carolina]] and grew up in [[Idaho]]. He gained his [[Master's degree|Master's]] and then his [[PhD]] in 1943 from the [[Ohio State University]] on ''Contributions to the Problem of Geocze''. Huskey taught [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and then worked part-time on the early [[ENIAC]] computer in 1945.

He visited the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] (NPL) in the [[United Kingdom]] for a year and worked on the [[Pilot ACE]] computer with [[Alan Turing]] and others. He was also involved with the [[EDVAC]] and [[SEAC]] computer projects.

Huskey designed and managed the construction of the [[Standards Western Automatic Computer]] (SWAC) at the [[National Bureau of Standards]] in [[Los Angeles]] (1949–1953). He also designed the [[Bendix G15|G15]] computer for [[Bendix Aviation Corporation]], which could perhaps be considered as the first "personal" computer in the world. He had one at his home that is now in the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington, DC]].

After five years at the National Bureau of Standards, Huskey joined the faculty of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1954 and then [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] from 1966. While at Berkeley, he supervised the research of pioneering programming language designer [[Niklaus Wirth]], who gained his PhD in 1963. He is now [[Professor Emeritus]] at the [[University of California]], after his retirement at the age of 70 in 1986. In 1994 he was inducted as a [[Fellow]] of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]].

Huskey married Velma Roeth (died 1991) and had four children. He married Nancy Grindstaff in 1994 and now lives in [[Spartanburg]], [[South Carolina]].

Huskey appeared with a junk dealer as the third pair of contestants in an episode of [[Groucho Marx]]'s radio show "[[You Bet Your Life]]". He was described as the designer of an "[[electronic brain]]". They selected the "state category" and missed the final question when they failed to identify Iowa as the state North of Missouri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otrcat.com/otr5/youbetyourlife500510no4932door(otrcat.com).mp3k |title=You Bet Your Life &#124; Old Time Radio |publisher=Otrcat.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref>
