<html> <head> <title>Barrett reduction</title></head><body>In [[modular arithmetic]], '''Barrett reduction''' is a reduction [[algorithm]] introduced in 1986 by P.D. Barrett.  A naive way of computing  

:<math>c = a \times b \pmod n. \, </math>

would be to use a fast [[division algorithm]].  Barrett reduction and [[Montgomery reduction]] are algorithms designed to optimize this operation.
