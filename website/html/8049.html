Under [[Mac OS 9]] and earlier, a '''control panel''' is a small [[application software|application]] which enabled the user to modify [[software]] and [[hardware]] settings such as the sound volume and desktop pattern. Control panels differ from [[Extension (Mac OS)|extensions]] in that they allow the user to specify options, whereas extensions provide the user with no interface for setting preferences. In many software distributions Extensions provided the functionality and the corresponding Control Panel provided all the configuration options.

==History==
The original control panels in the earliest [[Mac OS]] were all combined into one small [[Desk Accessory]]. [[Susan Kare]] designed the [[User interface|interface]] for the original control panel, and tried to make it as user-friendly as possible. This design was used until [[System 6]] when separate control panel files ("cdev"s) were added, accessible solely through the control panel.

With the debut of [[System 7]] the control panels were separated into individual small application-like processes accessible from the Finder, and by a sub-menu in the Apple menu provided by Apple Menu Options. By [[Mac OS 9]], many control panels were true applications.

Hearkening back to System 6, [[Mac OS X]]'s equivalent of control panels are found as "[[Preference Pane]]s" accessible solely through the [[System Preferences]] utility's unified interface. Preference panes in Mac OS X are small documents rather than independent applications.
