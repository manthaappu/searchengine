'''EMILE''' is the Early [[Macintosh|Mac]] Image LoadEr, a bootloader for loading [[Linux]] on Macintosh computers that have [[m68k]] processors. It was written by [[Laurent Vivier]], and is meant to eventually replace the [[Penguin Booter]] that  is more usually in use.

In contrast to the Penguin booter, which requires a working [[Mac OS]] installation, EMILE modifies the boot block on a hard disk to boot Linux directly.
