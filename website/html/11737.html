The '''Reverend Edwin William Smith''' (1876–1957) was a [[Primitive Methodist]] missionary/anthropologist and author who was born in [[South Africa]], studied at [[Elmfield College]], and then worked in [[Africa]]..

He was born at [[Aliwal North]], South Africa, on September 7, 1876. His parents were missionaries of the Primitive Methodist Connexion. His father, John Smith (1840–1915), went to Aliwal North in 1874 and spent ten of the next fourteen years there. Returning to London, he became secretary of the Primitive Methodist Missionary Society in the 1890s and president of the Primitive Methodist Conference in 1898.

Edwin Smith has been called the father of [[African Studies]], and features in ''[[Who was Who?]]''.

In 1899 he married Julia, daughter of James Fitch of Peasenhall, Suffolk. He served in Africa as a missionary of the Primitive Methodist Church, 1898-1915.
