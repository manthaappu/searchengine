<html> <head> <title>Octaeteris</title></head><body>In [[astronomy]], an '''octaeteris''' (plural: '''octaeterides''') is the period of eight [[solar year]]s after which the [[moon phase]] occurs on the same day of the year plus one or two days.

This period is also in a very good synchronicity with five [[Venus]]ian visibility cycles (the Venusian [[synodic period]]) and thirteen Venusian revolutions around the sun (Venusian [[sidereal period]]). This means, that if [[Venus]] is visible beside the [[moon]], after eight years the two will be again close together near the same date of the [[calendar]].

The Octaeteris, also known as Oktaeteris, was noted by [[Cleostratus]] in [[ancient Greece]] as a 2923.5 day cycle.  The 8 year short lunisolar cycle was probably known to many ancient cultures.  The mathematical proportions of the Octaeteris cycles were noted in Classic Vernal rock art in northeastern [[Utah]] by J. Q. Jacobs in 1990.  The Three Kings panel also contains more accurate ratios, ratios related to other planets, and apparent astronomic symbolism.
