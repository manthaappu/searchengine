<html> <head> <title>Flow Java</title></head><body>'''Flow Java''' is a [[conservative extension]] to the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]].
It integrates single assignment variables and logic variables, to Java.
Its development was influenced by [[Oz (programming language)|Mozart/Oz]].
Conceptually, the extension is similar to adding immutable [[futures and promises|futures]] but goes beyond that
by incorporating equivalence groups.

Syntactically, the extension adds few new tokens

 single Object s;
...which introduces a single assignment variable, and...
 s @= new Object();
...which binds s to a new object.
Or...
 Object o = new Object;
 s @= o;
...which binds s to o.
This makes s equivalent to o.
