The '''Rodin tool''', for formal modelling in Event-B. Event-B is a notation and method developed from the [[B-Method]] and is intended to be used with an incremental style of [[Modeling language|modelling]]. The idea of incremental modelling has been taken from programming: [[High-level programming language|modern programming languages]] come with [[integrated development environment]] that make it easy to modify and improve programs. The Rodin tool provides such an environment for Event-B.
The two main characteristics of the Rodin tool are its ease of use and its extensibility.
The tool focuses on modelling. It is easy to modify models and try out variations of a model. The tool can also be extended easily. This will make it possible to adapt the tool specific needs. So the tool can be adapted to fit into existing development processes instead demanding the opposite. 

Rodin (Rigorous Open Development Environment for Complex Systems) is
*Extension of [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] IDE (Java based)
*Rodin Eclipse Builder coordinates:
**Well-formedness + type checker
**Proof obligation (PO) generator
**Proof manager (PM)
**Propagation of changes

==Rodin Proof Manager (PM)==
*PM constructs proof tree for each PO
*Automatic and interactive modes
*PM manages used hypotheses
*PM calls reasoners to
**discharge goal, or
** split goal into subgoals
*Collection of reasoners:
**simplifier, rule‐based, decision procedures, …
*Basic tactics language to define PM and reasoners

==Industrial applications and case studies==
The Rodin project included five industrial case studies that served to validate the tool set and
helped with the elaboration of an appropriate methodology for using the tools. The case studies
were lead by industrial partners of the Rodin project supported by the other partners. The case
studies were as follows:
*a failure management system for an engine controller
*part of a platform for mobile Internet technology
*engineering of communications protocols
*an air-traffic display system
*an ambient campus application
