''N''Tropy is an [[computer library]] under development at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and the University of Pittsburgh Department of Physics and Astronomy that enables the rapid development of any [[algorithms]] that uses a [[kd-tree]] for running on a [[parallel computer]].  In its current form, it is geared towards [[astrophysics]] data, which is generally point-like in nature meaning that most efficient analysis [[algorithms]] tend to employ [[tree data structure]]s. 

The idea behind ''N''Tropy, like most libraries, is that the derive the benefits of an efficient tree implementation and [[parallel computing]] without having to write a tree structure nor a parallel program from scratch.  Instead, they take ''N''Tropy's existing tree structure and customize the data stored in each node to the needs of their application.  Then they can write a serial piece of code that describes their tree walk algorithm.  ''N''Tropy will then execute these tree walks in parallel on any sort of [[parallel computer]], from a [[Beowulf cluster]] to a [[Massively Parallel Processing]] computer (MPP) to machines in a [[computational grid]].

''N''Tropy is being developed under a grant from [[NASA]]'s Applied Information Systems Research Program.
