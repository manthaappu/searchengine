'''John von Neumann''' ({{IPA-en|vɒn ˈnɔɪmən}}) (December 28, 1903 – February 8, 1957) was a  [[Hungarians|Hungarian]]-born [[United States|America]]n [[mathematician]] who made major contributions to a vast range of fields,<ref name="NYT">{{cite web|author=Ed Regis|title=Johnny Jiggles the Planet|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7D91239F93BA35752C1A964958260|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1992-11-08|accessdate=2008-02-04}}</ref> including [[set theory]], [[functional analysis]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[ergodic theory]], continuous geometry, [[economics]] and [[game theory]], [[computer science]], [[numerical analysis]], [[hydrodynamics]] (of explosions), and [[statistics]], as well as many other mathematical fields. He is generally regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians in modern history.<ref>Impagliazzo, p. vii</ref> The mathematician [[Jean Dieudonné]] called von Neumann "the last of the great mathematicians",<ref>Dictionary of Scientific Bibliography, ed. C. C.

Von Neumann was a pioneer of the application of [[operator theory]] to [[quantum mechanics]], in the development of [[functional analysis]], a principal member of the [[Manhattan Project]] and the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] (as one of the few originally appointed), and a key figure in the development of [[game theory]]<ref name="NYT"/><ref>{{ cite book | last=Nelson | first=David | title=The Penguin Dictionary of Mathematics | pages=178–179 | isbn=0-141-01077-0 | year=2003 | publisher=Penguin | location=London }}</ref> and the concepts of [[cellular automata]]<ref name="NYT"/> and the [[von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]]. Along with Teller and [[Stanisław Ulam]], von Neumann worked out key steps in the [[nuclear physics]] involved in [[thermonuclear]] reactions and the [[hydrogen bomb]].

==Biography==
The eldest of three brothers, von Neumann was born '''Neumann János Lajos''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈnojmɒn ˈjaːnoʃ ˈlɒjoʃ}}; in Hungarian the family name comes first) on December 28, 1903 in [[Budapest]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], to somewhat wealthy Jewish parents.<ref>Doran, p. 1</ref><ref> Nathan Myhrvold, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,21839,00.html ''John von Neumann''.] [[Time (magazine)|Time]],  March 21, 1999. Accessed September 5, 2010</ref><ref>Clay Blair, Jr. [http://books.google.com/books?id=rEEEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA104&dq=%22John+von+Neumann%E2%80%8E%22+parents+jewish&hl=en&ei=5KSDTMHGJIaHOMrE9M0O&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22John%20von%20Neumann%E2%80%8E%22%20&f=false Was a prodigious servant to science and his country.] [[Life (magazine)|Life]], February 25, 1957; p. 104 </ref>  His father was Neumann Miksa (Max Neumann), a lawyer who worked in a [[bank]]. His mother was Kann Margit (Margaret Kann). 

János, nicknamed "Jancsi" (Johnny), was a [[child prodigy]] who showed an aptitude for languages, memorization, and mathematics. By the age of six, he could exchange jokes in [[Classical Greek]], memorize telephone directories, and display prodigious [[mental calculation]] abilities.<ref>William Poundstone, ''Prisoner's dilemma'' (Oxford, 1993), introduction</ref> He entered the Hungarian-speaking Lutheran high school [[Fasori Gimnázium|Fasori Evangelikus Gimnázium]] in Budapest in 1911. Although he attended school at the grade level appropriate to his age, his father hired private tutors to give him advanced instruction in those areas in which he had displayed an aptitude. Recognized as a mathematical [[child prodigy|prodigy]], at the age of 15 he began to study under [[Gábor Szegő]]. On their first meeting, Szegő was so impressed with the boy's mathematical talent that he was brought to tears.<ref>Impagliazzo, p. 5</ref>  In 1913, his father was rewarded with ennoblement for his service to the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian empire]]. (After becoming [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|semi-autonomous in 1867]], Hungary had found itself in need of a vibrant mercantile class.) The Neumann family thus acquiring the title ''margittai'', Neumann János became margittai Neumann János (John Neumann of Margitta), which he later changed to the German Johann von Neumann. He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[mathematics]] (with minors in [[experimental physics]] and [[chemistry]]) from [[Eötvös Loránd University|Pázmány Péter University]] in Budapest at the age of 22.<ref name="NYT"/> He simultaneously earned his diploma in [[chemical engineering]] from the [[ETH Zurich]] in Switzerland<ref name="NYT"/> at the behest of his father, who wanted his son to invest his time in a more financially viable endeavour than mathematics. Between 1926 and 1930, he taught as a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], the youngest in its history.  By age 25, he had published ten major papers, and by 30, nearly 36.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

His father, Max von Neumann died in 1929. In 1930, von Neumann, his mother, and his brothers emigrated to the United States. He [[anglicize]]d his first name to John, keeping the Austrian-aristocratic surname of von Neumann, whereas his brothers adopted surnames Vonneumann and Neumann (using the ''de Neumann'' form briefly when first in the U.S.).

Von Neumann was invited to [[Princeton University]], [[Princeton, New Jersey|New Jersey]] in 1930, and, subsequently, was one of the first four people selected for the faculty of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] (two of the others being [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Kurt Gödel]]), where he remained a mathematics professor from its formation in 1933 until his death.

In 1937, von Neumann became a [[Naturalized_citizen#United_States|naturalized citizen]] of the U.S. In 1938, von Neumann was awarded the [[Bôcher Memorial Prize]] for his work in analysis.

Von Neumann married twice. He married Mariette Kövesi in 1930, just prior to emigrating to the United States. They had one daughter (von Neumann's only child), [[Marina von Neumann Whitman|Marina]], who is now a distinguished professor of international trade and public policy at the [[University of Michigan]]. The couple divorced in 1937. In 1938, von Neumann married Klara Dan, whom he had met during his last trips back to Budapest prior to the outbreak of [[World War II]]. The von Neumanns were very active socially within the Princeton academic community, and it is from this aspect of his life that many of the anecdotes which surround von Neumann's legend originate.

In 1955, von Neumann was diagnosed with what was either [[bone cancer|bone]] or [[pancreatic cancer]].<ref>While there is a general agreement that the initially discovered bone tumor was a secondary growth, sources differ as to the location of the primary cancer. While Macrae gives it as pancreatic, the ''Life'' magazine article says it was prostate.</ref> Von Neumann died a year and a half later, in great pain. While at [[Walter Reed Hospital]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], he invited a [[Roman Catholic]] priest, Father Anselm Strittmatter, [[Benedictine|O.S.B.]], to visit him for consultation (a move which shocked some of von Neumann's friends).<ref>The question of whether or not von Neumann had formally converted to Catholicism upon his marriage to Mariette Kövesi (who was Catholic) is addressed by Halmos (ref. 5). He was baptised Roman Catholic but he certainly was not a practicing member of that religion after his divorce.</ref> The priest then administered to him the last [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Sacraments]].<ref name=amm>Halmos, P.R. The Legend of Von Neumann, The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 80, No. 4. (Apr., 1973), pp. 382–394</ref> He died under military security lest he reveal military secrets while heavily medicated. John von Neumann was buried at [[Princeton Cemetery]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[Mercer County, New Jersey|Mercer County]], [[New Jersey]].<ref>John von Neumann at [[Find a Grave]][http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=7333144]</ref>  

Von Neumann wrote 150 published papers in his life; 60 in pure mathematics, 20 in physics, and 60 in applied mathematics. His last work, written while in the hospital and later published in book form as ''[[The Computer and the Brain]]'', gives an indication of the direction of his interests at the time of his death.

==Logic and set theory==
{{Citations missing|section|date=April 2007}}
The axiomatization of mathematics, on the model      of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', had reached new levels of rigor and breadth at the end of the 19th century, particularly in arithmetic (thanks to [[Richard Dedekind]] and [[Giuseppe Peano]]) and geometry (thanks to [[David Hilbert]]). At the beginning of the twentieth century, [[set theory]], the new branch of mathematics discovered by [[Georg Cantor]], and thrown into crisis by [[Bertrand Russell]] with the discovery of [[Russell's paradox|his famous paradox]] (on the set of all sets which do not belong to themselves), had not yet been formalized.
{{Portal box|Set theory}} 
The problem of an adequate axiomatization of [[set theory]] was resolved implicitly about twenty years  later (by [[Ernst Zermelo]] and [[Abraham Fraenkel]]) by way of a series of principles which allowed for the construction of all sets used in the actual practice of mathematics, but which did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of sets which belong to themselves. In his doctoral thesis of 1925, von Neumann demonstrated how it was possible to exclude this possibility in two complementary ways: the ''[[axiom of foundation]]'' and the notion of ''[[Class (set theory)|class]].''
 
The [[axiom]] of foundation established that every set can be constructed from the bottom up in an ordered succession of steps by way of the principles of Zermelo and Fraenkel, in such a manner that if one set belongs to another then the first must necessarily come before the second in the succession (hence excluding the possibility of a set belonging to itself.) To demonstrate that the addition of this new axiom to the others did not produce contradictions, von Neumann introduced a method of demonstration (called the ''method of [[inner model]]s'') which later became an essential instrument in set theory.

The second approach to the problem took as its base the notion of class, and defines a set as a class which belongs to other classes, while a ''proper class'' is defined as a class which does not belong to other classes. Under the Zermelo/Fraenkel approach, the axioms impede the construction of a set of all sets which do not belong to themselves.  In contrast, under the von Neumann approach, the class of all sets which do not belong to themselves can be constructed, but it is a ''proper class'' and not a set.

With this contribution of von Neumann, the axiomatic system of the theory of sets became fully satisfactory, and the next question was whether or not it was also definitive, and not subject to improvement. A strongly negative answer arrived in September 1930 at the historic mathematical Congress of [[Königsberg]], in which [[Kurt Gödel]] announced his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|first theorem of incompleteness]]: the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete, in the sense that they cannot prove every truth which is expressible in their language. This result was sufficiently innovative as to confound the majority of mathematicians of the time. But von Neumann, who had participated at the Congress, confirmed his fame as an instantaneous thinker, and in less than a month was able to communicate to Gödel himself an interesting consequence of his theorem: namely that the usual axiomatic systems are unable to demonstrate their own consistency. It is precisely this consequence which has attracted the most attention, even if Gödel originally considered it only a curiosity, and had derived it independently anyway (it is for this reason that the result is called ''Gödel's second theorem'', without mention of von Neumann.)

==Quantum mechanics==
At the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] of 1900, [[David Hilbert]] presented his famous list of twenty-three problems considered central for the development of the mathematics of the new century. The sixth of these was ''[[Hilbert's sixth problem|the axiomatization of physical theories]].'' Among the new physical theories of the century the only one which had yet to receive such a treatment by the end of the 1930s was [[quantum mechanics]]. Quantum mechanics found itself in a condition of foundational crisis similar to that of set theory at the beginning of the century, facing problems of both  philosophical and  technical natures. On the one hand, its apparent non-determinism had not been reduced to an explanation of a deterministic form. On the other, there still existed two independent but equivalent heuristic formulations, the so-called [[matrix mechanics|matrix mechanical formulation]] due to [[Werner Heisenberg]] and the [[wave mechanics|wave mechanical formulation]] due to [[Erwin Schrödinger]], but there was not yet a single, unified satisfactory theoretical formulation.

After having completed the axiomatization of set theory, von Neumann began to confront the axiomatization of quantum mechanics. He immediately realized, in 1926, that a quantum system could be considered as a point in a so-called [[Hilbert space]], analogous to the 6N dimension (N is the number of particles, 3 general coordinate and 3 canonical momentum for each) phase space of classical mechanics but with infinitely many dimensions (corresponding to the infinitely many possible states of the system) instead: the traditional physical quantities (e.g., position and momentum) could therefore be represented as particular [[linear operators]] operating in these spaces. The ''physics'' of quantum mechanics was thereby reduced to the ''mathematics'' of the linear Hermitian operators on Hilbert spaces. 

For example, the famous [[uncertainty principle]] of Heisenberg, according to which the determination of the position of a particle prevents the determination of its momentum and vice versa, is translated into the ''non-commutativity'' of the two corresponding operators. This new mathematical formulation included as special cases the formulations of both Heisenberg and Schrödinger, and culminated in the 1932 classic ''[[The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics]].'' However, physicists generally ended up preferring another approach to that of von Neumann (which was considered elegant and satisfactory by mathematicians). This approach was formulated in 1930 by [[Paul Dirac]].

Von Neumann's abstract treatment permitted him also to confront the foundational issue of determinism vs. non-determinism and in the book he demonstrated a theorem according to which quantum mechanics could not possibly be derived by statistical approximation from a deterministic theory of the type used in classical mechanics. This demonstration contained a conceptual error{{Clarification needed|date=October 2010}}, but it helped to inaugurate a line of research which, through the work of [[John Stuart Bell]] in 1964 on [[Bell's Theorem]] and the experiments of [[Alain Aspect]] in 1982, demonstrated that quantum physics requires a ''notion of reality'' substantially different from that of classical physics.

==Economics and game theory==
Von Neumann's first significant contribution to economics was the [[minimax theorem]] of 1928. This theorem establishes that in certain [[zero-sum|zero sum games]] with [[perfect information]] (i.e., in which players know at each time all moves that have taken place so far), there exists a strategy for each player which allows both players to minimize their maximum losses (hence the name minimax). When examining every possible strategy, a player must consider all the possible responses of the player's adversary and the maximum loss. The player then plays out the strategy which will result in the minimization of this maximum loss.
Such a strategy, which minimizes the maximum loss, is called optimal for both players just in case their minimaxes are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign). If the common value is zero, the game becomes pointless.

Von Neumann eventually improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games with more than two players. This work culminated in the 1944 classic ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' (written with [[Oskar Morgenstern]]). The public interest in this work was such that [[The New York Times]] ran a front page story, something which only [[Einstein]] had previously elicited.

Von Neumann's second important contribution in this area was the solution, in 1937, of a problem first described by [[Léon Walras]] in 1874, the existence of situations of equilibrium in mathematical models of market development based on supply and demand. He first recognized that such a model should be expressed through [[disequations]] and not equations, and then he found a solution to Walras' problem by applying a [[fixed-point theorem]] derived from the work of [[L. E. J. Brouwer]]. The lasting importance of the work on general equilibria and the methodology of fixed point theorems is underscored by the awarding of  Nobel prizes in 1972 to [[Kenneth Arrow]], in 1983 to [[Gérard Debreu]], and in 1994 to [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John Nash]] who had improved von Neumann's theory in his Princeton Ph.D thesis.

Von Neumann was also the inventor of the method of proof, used in game theory, known as [[backward induction]] (which he first published in 1944 in the book co-authored with Morgenstern, ''Theory of Games and Economic Behaviour'').<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Projects/MacQuarrie/Chapters/Ch4.html | title=Mathematics and Chess | author=John MacQuarrie | publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland | accessdate=2007-10-18 | quote=Others claim he used a method of proof, known as 'backwards induction' that was not employed until 1953, by von Neumann and Morgenstern. Ken Binmore (1992) writes, Zermelo used this method way back in 1912 to analyze Chess. It requires starting from the end of the game and then working backwards to its beginning. (p.32) }}</ref>

==Mathematical statistics and econometrics==
Von Neumann made some fundamental contributions to mathematical statistics. In 1941, he derived the exact distribution of the ratio of mean square successive difference to the variance for [[normally]] distributed variables.<ref>von Neumann, John. (1941). [http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&version=1.0&verb=Display&handle=euclid.aoms/1177731677 "Distribution of the ratio of the mean square successive difference to the variance"]. Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 12, 367–395. ([http://www.jstor.org/pss/2235951 JSTOR])</ref> This ratio was applied to the residuals from regression models and is commonly known as the [[Durbin-Watson]] statistic<ref>Durbin, J., and Watson, G. S. (1950) [http://www.jstor.org/pss/2332391 "Testing for Serial Correlation in Least Squares Regression, I."] Biometrika 37, 409–428.</ref> for testing the null hypothesis that the errors are serially independent against the alternative that they follow a stationary first order [[autoregression]]. Subsequently, [[John Denis Sargan]] and [[Alok Bhargava]]<ref>Sargan, J.D. and [[Alok Bhargava]] (1983). [http://www.jstor.org/pss/1912252 "Testing residuals from least squares regression for being generated by the Gaussian random walk"]. Econometrica, 51, p. 153-174.</ref> extended the results for testing if the errors on a regression model follow a Gaussian [[random walk]] (i.e. possess a [[unit root]]) against the alternative that they are a stationary first order [[autoregression]]. Von Neumann's contributions to statistics have had a major impact on [[econometric]] methodology.

==Nuclear weapons==
[[Image:John von Neumann ID badge.png|right|frame|John von Neumann's wartime [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] ID badge photo.]]
Beginning in the late 1930s, von Neumann began to take more of an interest in applied (as opposed to pure) mathematics. In particular, he developed an expertise in [[explosion]]s—phenomena which are difficult to model mathematically. This led him to a large number of military consultancies, primarily for the Navy, which in turn led to his involvement in the [[Manhattan Project]].  The involvement included frequent trips by train to the project's secret research facilities in [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos, New Mexico]].<ref name="NYT"/>

Von Neumann's principal contribution to the atomic bomb itself was in the concept and design of the [[nuclear weapon design|explosive lenses]] needed to compress the [[plutonium]] core of the [[Trinity test]] device and the "[[Fat Man]]" weapon that was later dropped on [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. While von Neumann did not originate the "[[implosion-type nuclear weapon|implosion]]" concept, he was one of its most persistent proponents, encouraging its continued development against the instincts of many of his colleagues, who felt such a design to be unworkable. The lens shape design work was completed by July 1944.

In a visit to Los Alamos in September 1944, von Neumann showed that the pressure increase from explosion shock wave reflection from solid objects was greater than previously believed if the angle of incidence of the shock wave was between 90° and some limiting angle.  As a result, it was determined that the effectiveness of an atomic bomb would be enhanced with detonation some kilometers above the target, rather than at ground level.<ref name="Critical Assembly">{{ cite book | title=Critical Assembly: A Technical History of Los Alamos during the Oppenheimer Years, 1943–1945 | coauthors="Lillian Hoddeson, Paul W.

With contributions from Gordon Baym ... }}</ref>

Beginning in the spring of 1945, along with four other scientists and various military personnel, von Neumann was included in the target selection committee responsible for choosing the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] as the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|first targets of the atomic bomb]].  Von Neumann oversaw computations related to the expected size of the bomb blasts, estimated death tolls, and the distance above the ground at which the bombs should be detonated for optimum shock wave propagation and thus maximum effect.<ref name="Rhodes">{{cite book | last=Rhodes | first=Richard | title=The Making of the Atomic Bomb | year=1986 | location=New York | publisher=Touchstone Simon & Schuster | isbn=0-684-81378-5 }}</ref>  The cultural capital [[Kyoto]], which had been spared the firebombing inflicted upon militarily significant target cities like Tokyo in World War II, was von Neumann's first choice, a selection seconded by Manhattan Project leader General [[Leslie Groves]]. However, this target was dismissed by [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry Stimson]].<ref name="Groves">{{cite book | last=Groves | first=Leslie | title=Now It Can Be Told: The Story of the Manhattan Project | year=1962 | location=New York | publisher=Da Capo | isbn=0-306-80189-2 }}</ref>

On July 16, 1945, with numerous other Los Alamos personnel, von Neumann was an eyewitness to the [[Trinity test|first atomic bomb blast]], conducted as a test of the implosion method device, 35 miles (56 km) southeast of [[Socorro, New Mexico|Socorro]], [[New Mexico]].  Based on his observation alone, von Neumann estimated the test had resulted in a blast equivalent to 5 [[ton|kilotons]] of [[TNT equivalent|TNT]], but [[Enrico Fermi]] produced a more accurate estimate of 10 kilotons by dropping scraps of torn-up paper as the shock wave passed his location and watching how far they scattered.  The actual power of the explosion had been between 20 and 22 kilotons.<ref name="Critical Assembly" />

After the war, [[Robert Oppenheimer]] remarked that the physicists involved in the Manhattan project had "known sin". Von Neumann's response was that "sometimes someone confesses a sin in order to take credit for it."

Von Neumann continued unperturbed in his work and became, along with [[Edward Teller]], one of those who sustained the hydrogen bomb project. He then collaborated with [[Klaus Fuchs]] on further development of the bomb, and in 1946 the two filed a secret patent on "Improvement in Methods and Means for Utilizing Nuclear Energy", which outlined a scheme for using a fission bomb to compress fusion fuel to initiate a [[thermonuclear reaction]].<ref>Herken, pp. 171, 374</ref> The Fuchs-von Neumann patent used [[radiation implosion]], but not in the same way as is used in what became the final hydrogen bomb design, the [[Teller-Ulam design]]. Their work was, however, incorporated into the "George" shot of [[Operation Greenhouse]], which was instructive in testing out concepts that went into the final design. The Fuchs-von Neumann work was passed on, by Fuchs, to the USSR as part of his [[nuclear espionage]], but it was not used in the Soviet's own, independent development of the Teller-Ulam design. The historian Jeremy Bernstein has pointed out that ironically, "John von Neumann and Klaus Fuchs, produced a brilliant invention in 1946 that could have changed the whole course of the development of the hydrogen bomb, but was not fully understood until after the bomb had been successfully made."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bernstein|first1=Jeremy|title=John von Neumann and Klaus Fuchs: an Unlikely Collaboration|journal=Physics in Perspective|volume=12|pages=36|year=2010|doi=10.1007/s00016-009-0001-1}}</ref>

==Computer science==

Von Neumann's hydrogen bomb work was also played out in the realm of computing, where he and [[Stanisław Ulam]] developed simulations on von Neumann's digital computers for the hydrodynamic computations. During this time he contributed to the development of the [[Monte Carlo method]], which allowed complicated problems to be approximated using [[random number]]s. Because using lists of "truly" random numbers was extremely slow, von Neumann developed a form of making [[pseudorandom number]]s, using the [[middle-square method]]. Though this method has been criticized as crude, von Neumann was aware of this: he justified it as being faster than any other method at his disposal, and also noted that when it went awry it did so obviously, unlike methods which could be subtly incorrect.

While consulting for the [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] on the [[EDVAC]] project, von Neumann wrote an incomplete ''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]''.  The paper, which was widely distributed, described a [[computer]] architecture in which the data and the program are both stored in the computer's memory in the same address space.  This architecture is to this day the basis of modern computer design, unlike the earliest computers that were 'programmed' by altering the electronic circuitry.  Although the single-memory, stored program architecture is commonly called [[von Neumann architecture]] as a result of von Neumann's paper, the architecture's description was based on the work of [[J. Presper Eckert]] and [[John William Mauchly]], inventors of the [[ENIAC]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].<ref>The mistaken name for the architecture is discussed in [http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/rbm/mauchly/jwm9.html John W. Mauchly and the Development of the ENIAC Computer], part of the online [http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~museum/ ENIAC museum], in Robert Slater's computer history book, ''Portraits in Silicon'', and in Nancy Stern's book ''From ENIAC to UNIVAC''.</ref> 

Von Neumann also created the field of [[cellular automaton|cellular automata]] without the aid of computers, constructing the first [[self-replication|self-replicating]] automata with pencil and graph paper.  The concept of a [[Von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]] was fleshed out in his posthumous work ''Theory of Self Reproducing Automata''.<ref name=TSRA>{{Cite book|year=1966|author=John von Neumann|editor=[[Arthur W. Burks]]|title=Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata|publisher=Univ. of Illinois Press|place=Urbana and London|.}} [http://www.history-computer.com/Library/VonNeumann1.pdf PDF reprint]</ref> Von Neumann proved that the most effective way of performing large-scale mining operations such as mining an entire [[natural satellite|moon]] or [[asteroid belt]] would be by using self-replicating machines, taking advantage of their [[exponential growth]].

He is credited with at least one contribution to the study of algorithms. [[Donald Knuth]] cites von Neumann as the inventor, in 1945, of the [[merge sort]] algorithm, in which the first and second halves of an array are each sorted recursively and then merged together.<ref>{{ cite book | last=Knuth | first=Donald | authorlink=Donald Knuth | year=1998 | title=The Art of Computer Programming: Volume 3 Sorting and Searching | pages=159 | isbn=0-201-89685-0 | publisher=Addison-Wesley | location=Boston }}</ref> His algorithm for simulating a [[fair coin]] with a biased coin<ref>{{ cite journal | last=von Neumann | first=John | year=1951 | title=Various techniques used in connection with random digits | journal=National Bureau of Standards Applied Math Series | volume=12 | pages=36 }}</ref> is used in the "software whitening" stage of some [[hardware random number generator]]s.

He also engaged in exploration of problems in numerical [[hydrodynamics]].  With [[R. D. Richtmyer]] he developed an algorithm  defining ''artificial viscosity'' that improved the understanding of [[shock wave]]s.  It is possible that we would not understand much of astrophysics, and might not have highly developed jet and rocket engines without that work.  The problem was that when computers solve hydrodynamic or aerodynamic problems, they try to put too many computational grid points at regions of sharp discontinuity ([[shock wave]]s). The ''artificial viscosity'' was a mathematical trick to slightly smooth the shock transition without sacrificing basic physics.

==Politics and social affairs ==
Von Neumann obtained at the age of 29 one of the first five professorships at the new [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] (another had gone to [[Albert Einstein]]).  He was a frequent consultant for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the [[United States Army]], the [[RAND Corporation]], [[Standard Oil]], [[IBM]], and others.

Throughout his life von Neumann had a respect and admiration for business and government leaders; something which was often at variance with the inclinations of his scientific colleagues. He enjoyed associating with persons in positions of power, and this led him into government service.<ref>MAA documentary, especially comments by Morgenstern regarding this aspect of von Neumann's personality</ref>

As President of the Von Neumann Committee for Missiles, and later as a member of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]], from 1953 until his death in 1957, he was influential in setting U.S. scientific and military policy.  Through his committee, he developed various scenarios of nuclear proliferation, the development of intercontinental and submarine missiles with atomic warheads, and the controversial strategic equilibrium called [[mutual assured destruction]]. During a [[United States Senate|Senate]] committee hearing he described his political ideology as "violently anti-[[Communism|communist]], and much more militaristic than the norm". 

Von Neumann's interest in meteorological prediction led him to propose manipulating the environment by spreading colorants on the [[polar ice caps]] to enhance absorption of solar radiation (by reducing the [[albedo]]), thereby raising global temperatures. He also favored a preemptive nuclear attack on the [[Soviet Union]], believing that doing so could prevent it from obtaining the atomic bomb.<ref>Macrae p. 332; Heims, pp. 236–247.</ref>

==Personality==

Von Neumann invariably wore a conservative grey flannel business suit – he was even known to play tennis wearing his business suit – and he enjoyed throwing large parties at his home in Princeton, occasionally twice a week.<ref>Macrae pp. 170–171</ref> His white clapboard house at 26 Westcott Road was one of the largest in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]].<ref>Ed Regis. Who Got Einstein's Office?: Eccentricity and Genius at the Institute for Advanced Study. Perseus Books 1988 p 103</ref>
Despite being a notoriously bad driver, he nonetheless enjoyed driving (frequently while reading a book) – occasioning numerous arrests as well as accidents.
When [[Cuthbert Hurd]] hired him as a consultant to IBM, Hurd often quietly paid the fines for his traffic tickets.<ref name="cch">{{cite web |title= An Interview with Cuthbert C. Hurd |author= Nancy Stern |publisher=  [[Charles Babbage Institute]], University of Minnesota |date= January 20, 1981 |url= http://www.cbi.umn.edu/oh/pdf.phtml?id=159 |accessdate= June 3, 2010 }}</ref> 

It was said of him at Princeton that, while he was indeed a demigod, he had made a detailed study of humans and could imitate them perfectly.<ref name=goldstine>{{cite book

Von Neumann liked to eat and drink heavily; his wife, Klara, said that he could count everything except calories. He enjoyed [[Jewish humor|Yiddish]] and [[Off-color humor|"off-color" humor]] (especially limericks).<ref name=amm/>

==Honors==
The [[John von Neumann Theory Prize]] of the [[Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences]] (INFORMS, previously TIMS-ORSA) is awarded annually to an individual (or  group) who have made fundamental and sustained contributions to theory in [[operations research]] and the management sciences. 

The [[IEEE John von Neumann Medal]] is awarded annually by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] "for outstanding  achievements in computer-related science and technology."

The John von Neumann Lecture is given annually at the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] (SIAM) by a researcher who has contributed to applied mathematics, and the chosen lecturer is also awarded a monetary prize.

The crater [[Von Neumann (crater)|Von Neumann]] on the [[Moon]] is named after him.

The John von Neumann Computing Center in Princeton, New Jersey ({{Coord|40.348695|N|74.592251|W|type:landmark|name=John von Neumann Computing Center}}) was named in his honour.

The professional society of Hungarian computer scientists, [[John von Neumann Computer Society]], is named after John von Neumann.<ref>{{cite web|title=Introducing the John von Neumann Computer Society|publisher=John von Neumann Computer Society|url=http://www.njszt.hu/neumann/neumann.head.page?nodeid=210|accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref> 

On February 15, 1956, Neumann was presented with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Dwight Eisenhower]].

On May 4, 2005 the [[United States Postal Service]] issued the ''American Scientists'' commemorative [[postage stamp]] series, a set of four 37-cent self-adhesive stamps in several configurations.  The scientists depicted were John von Neumann, [[Barbara McClintock]], [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], and [[Richard Feynman]].

The [[John von Neumann Award]] of the [[Rajk László College for Advanced Studies]] was named in his honour, and has been given every year since 1995 to professors who have made an outstanding contribution to the exact social sciences and through their work have strongly influenced the professional development and thinking of the members of the college.
