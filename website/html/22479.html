<html> <head> <title>Locally Hausdorff space</title></head><body>In [[mathematics]], in the field of [[topology]], a [[topological space]] is said to be '''locally Hausdorff''' if every point has an [[open set|open]] [[neighbourhood (topology)|neighbourhood]] that is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] under the [[subspace topology]].

Here are some facts:

* Every [[Hausdorff space]] is locally Hausdorff.
* Every locally Hausdorff space is [[T1 space|T<sub>1</sub>]].
* There are locally Hausdorff spaces where a sequence has more than one limit. This can never happen for a Hausdorff space.
* The [[non-Hausdorff manifold|bug-eyed line]] is locally Hausdorff (it is in fact [[locally metrizable]]) but not Hausdorff.
* The [[etale space]] for the [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] of differentiable functions on a [[differential manifold]] is not Hausdorff, but it is locally Hausdorff.
* A T<sub>1</sub> space need not be locally Hausdorff; an example of this is an infinite set given the [[cofinite topology]].
* Let ''X'' be a set given the particular point topology. Then ''X'' is locally Hausdorff at precisely one point. From the last example, it will follow that a set (with more than one point) given the [[particular point topology]] is not a [[topological group]]. Note that if ''x'' is the 'particular point' of ''X'', and y is distinct from ''x'', then any set containing ''y'' that doesn't also contain ''x'' inherits the discrete topology and is therefore Hausdorff. However, no neighbourhood of ''y'' is actually Hausdorff so that the space cannot be locally Hausdorff at ''y''.
* If ''G'' is a topological group that is locally Hausdorff at ''x'' for some point ''x'' of ''G'', then ''G'' is Hausdorff. This follows from that fact that if ''y'' is a point of ''G'', there exists a homeomorphism from ''G'' to itself carrying ''x'' to ''y'', so ''G'' is locally Hausdorff at every point, and is therefore T<sub>1</sub> (and T<sub>1</sub> topological groups are Hausdorff).
