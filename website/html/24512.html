The '''Microsoft text-to-speech voices''' are [[speech synthesis|speech synthesizers]] provided for use with applications that use the [[Microsoft Speech API]].

Microsoft Sam is the default text-to-speech male voice in Microsoft [[Windows 2000]] and [[Windows XP]].  Though not the default, Microsoft Sam is available in [[Windows Vista Home Premium]]. It is used by [[Microsoft Narrator|Narrator]], the [[screen reader]] program built into the operating system.

Microsoft Mike and Microsoft Mary are optional male and female voices respectively, available for download from the Microsoft website. Lernout and Hauspie Michael and Michelle are also optional male and female voices licensed by Microsoft from [[Lernout & Hauspie]], and available through [[Microsoft Office XP]] and [[Microsoft Office 2003]] or [[Microsoft Reader]].

There are both SAPI 4 and SAPI 5 versions of these text to speech voices. SAPI 5 voices are only available on Windows 2000 and later Windows NT-based operating systems. While SAPI 5 versions of Microsoft Mike and Microsoft Mary are downloadable only as a [[Merge Module]] <ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=5e86ec97-40a7-453f-b0ee-6583171b4530 Speech SDK 5.1]</ref>, the installable versions may be installed on end users' systems by third party speech applications. SAPI 4 redistributable versions are downloadable for [[Windows 9x]], although no longer from the Microsoft website.

Beginning with [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]], ''Microsoft Anna'' is the default English voice. Under [[Windows Vista Home Premium]], Microsoft Sam can be chosen from the drop-down list. Microsoft Anna is a SAPI 5-only  voice and is designed to sound more natural than Microsoft Sam.<ref>[http://blogs.msdn.com/robch/archive/2006/08/29/730032.aspx Microsoft Anna - The new TTS voice in Vista]</ref> [[Microsoft Streets & Trips]] 2006 and later install the Microsoft Anna voice on [[Windows XP]] systems for the voice-prompt direction feature. A Chinese voice called ''Microsoft Lili'' is available in Chinese versions of Windows Vista and later.  Microsoft Sam, Microsoft Mike and Microsoft Mary do not work on Windows Vista (excluding Home Premium edition for Microsoft Sam) and later.
