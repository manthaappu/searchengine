<html> <head> <title>Form taxon (botany)</title></head><body>'''Form taxon''' is used by [[Paleobotany|paleobotanists]] to name the fossil parts of plants where identification with a complete plant, whether living, or a reconstructed [[fossil]], is not possible.  

It is often not possible to associate the [[wood]], [[leaf]], [[flower]], [[fruit]] and [[pollen]] of a [[fossil plant]] with each other, as fossil plants are usually found as disarticulated parts, and the individual parts are often insufficient for identification. This is particularly for older material which is less closely related to modern representatives, and may be less well preserved. Consequently paleobotanists use '''form taxa''' in [[botanical nomenclature]].

==Suffix==
The part of the plant is often, but not universally, indicated by the use of a [[suffix]] in the [[generic name]]:
*wood fossils may have generic names ending in ''-xylon''
*leaf fossils generic names ending in ''-phyllum''
*fruit fossils generic names ending in ''-carpon'', ''-carpum'' or ''-carpus''
*pollen fossils generic names ending in ''-pollis'' or ''-pollenoides''.
