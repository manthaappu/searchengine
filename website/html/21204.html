<html> <head> <title>Late Move Reductions</title></head><body>'''Late Move Reductions''' (LMR) is a non-game specific enhancement to the [[alpha-beta pruning|alpha-beta algorithm]] and its variants which attempts to examine a [[game tree|game search tree]] more efficiently.  It uses the assumption that good game-specific move ordering causes a program to search the most likely moves early.  If a cut-off is going to happen in a search, the first few moves are the ones most likely to cause them.  In games like [[chess]], most [[computer chess|programs]] search winning captures and "[[killer heuristic|killers]]" first.  LMR will reduce the search depth for moves searched later at a given node.  This allows the program to search deeper along the critical lines, and play better.

Most chess programs will search the first several moves at a node to full depth.  Often, they do not reduce moves considered to be very tactical, such as captures or promotions.

This search reduction can lead to a different search space than the pure alpha-beta method which can give different results.  Care must be taken to select the reduction criteria or the search will miss some deep threats.
