In mathematics, the '''mice problem''' is a problem in which a number of mice (or bugs, dogs, missiles, etc.), starting from the corners of a regular polygon, follow each other and it must be determined when they meet. 

The most common version has the mice starting at the corners of a unit square, moving at unit speed. In this case they meet after a time of one unit, because the distance between two neighboring bugs always decreases at a speed of one unit. More generally, for a regular polygon of ''n'' sides, the distance between neighboring bugs decreases at a speed of 1 &minus; cos(2&pi;/''n''), so they meet after a time of 1/(1 &minus; cos(2&pi;/''n'')).
