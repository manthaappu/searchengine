<html> <head> <title>Bounded variation</title></head><body>In [[mathematical analysis]], a function of '''bounded variation''', also known as a '''BV function''', is a [[real number|real]]-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]] whose [[total variation]] is bounded (finite): the [[graph of a function]] having this property is well behaved in a precise sense. For a [[continuous function]] of a single [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]], being of bounded variation means that the [[distance]] along the [[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]] of the [[y-axis|''y''-axis]], neglecting the contribution of motion along [[x-axis|''x''-axis]], traveled by a [[point (mathematics)|point]] moving along the graph has a finite value. For a continuous function of several variables, the meaning of the definition is the same, except for the fact that the continuous path to be considered cannot be the whole graph of the given function (which is an [[Glossary of differential geometry and topology#H|hypersurface]] in this case), but can be every [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the graph itself with a [[hyperplane]] (in the case of functions of two variables, a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]) parallel to a fixed ''x''-axis and to the ''y''-axis.

Functions of bounded variation are precisely those with respect to which one may find [[Riemann&ndash;Stieltjes integral]]s of all continuous functions.

Another characterization states that the functions of bounded variation on a closed interval are exactly those ''f'' which can be written as a difference ''g'' &minus; ''h'', where both ''g'' and ''h'' are bounded [[monotonic function|monotone]].

In the case of several variables, a function ''f'' defined on an [[open subset]] '''<math> \Omega </math>''' of ℝ''<sup>n</sup>'' is said to have bounded variation if its [[distribution (mathematics)|distributional derivative]] is a finite [[Vector-valued function|vector]] [[Radon measure]].

One of the most important aspects of functions of bounded variation is that they form an [[Associative algebra|algebra]] of [[continuous function|discontinuous functions]] whose first derivative exists [[almost everywhere]]: due to this fact, they can and frequently are used to define [[generalized solution]]s of nonlinear problems involving [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]s, [[ordinary differential equation|ordinary]] and [[partial differential equation]]s in [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[engineering]]. Considering the problem of [[Distribution_(mathematics)#Problem_of_multiplication|multiplication of distributions]] or more generally the problem of defining general nonlinear operations on [[generalized function]]s, ''function of bounded variation are the smallest [[Algebra over a field|algebra]] which has to be embedded in every space of [[generalized function]]s preserving the result of [[multiplication]]''.

==History==
According to Boris Golubov, ''BV'' functions of a single variable were first introduced by [[Camille Jordan]], in the paper {{Harv|Jordan|1881}} dealing with the convergence of [[Fourier series]]. The first successful step in the generalization of this concept to functions of several variables was due to [[Leonida Tonelli]]<ref>[[Leonida Tonelli|Tonelli]] introduced what is now called after him '''Tonelli plane variation''': for an analysis of this concept and its relations to other generalizations, see the entry "[[Total variation]]".</ref>, who introduced a class of ''[[continuous function|continuous]]'' ''BV'' functions in 1926 {{Harv|Cesari|1986|pp=47–48}}, to extend his [[direct method (calculus of variation)|direct method]] for finding solutions to problems in the [[calculus of variations]] in more than one variable. Ten years after, in {{Harv|Cesari|1936}}, [[Lamberto Cesari]] ''changed the [[continuous function|continuity]] requirement'' in Tonelli's definition ''to a less restrictive [[integral|integrability]] requirement'', obtaining for the first time the class of functions of bounded variation of several variables in its full generality: as Jordan did before him, he applied the concept to resolve of a problem concerning the convergence of [[Fourier series]], but for functions of ''two variables''. After him, several authors applied ''BV'' functions to study [[Fourier series]] in several variables, [[geometric measure theory]], [[calculus of variations]], and [[mathematical physics]]. [[Renato Caccioppoli]] and [[Ennio de Giorgi]] used them to define [[measure theory|measure]] of [[smooth function|non smooth]] [[boundary (topology)|boundaries]] of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] (see the entry about "''[[Caccioppoli set]]''" for further informations). [[Olga Arsenievna Oleinik]] introduced her view of [[generalized solution]]s for [[nonlinear]] [[partial differential equation]]s as functions from the space ''BV'' in the paper {{Harv|Oleinik|1957}}, and was able to construct a generalized solution of bounded variation of a first order partial differential equation in the paper {{Harv|Oleinik|1959}}: few years later, [[Edward D. Conway]] and [[Joel A. Smoller]] applied ''BV''-functions to the study of a single [[hyperbolic equation|nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equation]] of [[First-order partial differential equation|first order]] in the paper {{Harv|Conway|Smoller|1966}}, proving that the solution of the [[Cauchy problem]] for such equations is a function of bounded variation, provided the [[Cauchy boundary condition|initial value]] belongs to the same class. [[Aizik Isaakovich Vol'pert]] developed extensively a calculus for ''BV'' functions: in the paper {{Harv|Vol'pert|1967}} he proved the [[Bounded variation#Chain rule for BV functions|chain rule for BV functions]] and in the book {{Harv|Hudjaev|Vol'pert|1985}} he, jointly with his pupil [[Sergei Ivanovich Hudjaev]], explored extensively the properties of ''BV'' functions and their application. His chain rule formula was later extended by [[Luigi Ambrosio]] and [[Gianni Dal Maso]] in the paper {{Harv|Ambrosio|Dal Maso|1990}}.

==Formal definition==
=== ''BV'' functions of one variable ===
{{EquationRef|1|Definition 1.1.}} The '''total variation''' of a [[real number|real]]-valued (or more generally [[complex number|complex]]-valued) [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''<math>f</math>'', defined on an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [''a'' , ''b'']⊂ℝ is the quantity

:<math> V^a_b(f)=\sup_{P \in \mathcal{P}} \sum_{i=0}^{n_P-1} | f(x_{i+1})-f(x_i) |. \,</math>

where the [[supremum]] is taken over the set <math> \scriptstyle \mathcal{P} =\left\{P=\{ x_0, \dots , x_{n_P}\}|P\text{ is a partition of } [a,b] \right\} </math> of all [[partition of an interval|partitions]] of the interval considered.

If <math> f </math> is [[derivative|differentiable]] and its derivative is Riemann-integrable, its total variation is the vertical component of the [[arc length|arc-length]] of its graph, that is to say,

:<math> V^a_b(f) = \int _a^b |f'(x)|\,\mathrm{d}x.</math>

{{EquationRef|2|Definition 1.2.}} A real-valued function <math> f </math> on the [[real line]] is said to be of '''bounded variation''' ('''BV function''') on a chosen [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] <math>[a,b]</math>⊂ℝ if its total variation is finite, ''i.e.''
:<math> f \in BV([a,b]) \iff V^a_b(f) < +\infty </math>

It can be proved that a real function ''ƒ'' is of bounded variation in an interval if and only if it can be written as the difference ''ƒ'' = ''ƒ''<sub>1</sub> &minus; ''ƒ''<sub>2</sub> of two non-decreasing functions: this result is known as the [[Jordan decomposition]].

Through the [[Stieltjes integral]], any function of bounded variation on a closed interval [''a'', ''b''] defines a [[bounded linear functional]] on ''C''([''a'', ''b'']). In this special case<ref>See for example {{harvtxt|Kolmogorov|Fomin|1969|pp=374&ndash;376}}.</ref>, the [[Riesz representation theorem]] states that every bounded linear functional arises uniquely in this way. The normalised positive functionals or [[probability measure]]s correspond to positive non-decreasing lower [[semicontinuous function]]s. This point of view has been important in
[[spectral theory]]<ref>For a general reference on this topic, see {{harvtxt|Riesz|Szőkefalvi-Nagy|1990}}</ref>, in particular in its application to [[spectral theory of ordinary differential equations|ordinary differential equations]].

===''BV'' functions of several variables===
Functions of bounded variation, BV [[function (mathematics)|functions]], are functions whose distributional [[directional derivative|derivative]] is a [[finite]] [[Radon measure]]. More precisely:

{{EquationRef|3|Definition 2.1.}} Let '''<math> \Omega </math>''' be an [[open subset]] of ℝ''<sup>n</sup>''. A  function '''<math> u </math>''' belonging to '''[[Lp space|<math>L^1(\Omega)</math>]]''' is said of '''bounded variation''' ('''BV function'''), and write

:<math> u\in BV(\Omega)</math>

if there exists a finite [[Vector valued function|vector]] [[Radon measure]] <math> \scriptstyle Du\in\mathcal M(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)</math> such that the following equality holds

:<math> 
\int_\Omega u(x)\,\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)\mathrm{d}x = - \int_\Omega \langle\boldsymbol{\phi}, Du(x)\rangle 
\qquad \forall\boldsymbol{\phi}\in C_c^1(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)
</math>

that is, '''<math>u</math>''' defines a [[linear functional]] on the space <math> \scriptstyle C_c^1(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)</math> of [[Smooth function|continuously differentiable]] [[Vector valued function|vector functions]] <math> \scriptstyle\boldsymbol{\phi} </math> of [[support (mathematics)#Compact support|compact support]] contained in '''<math> \Omega </math>''': the vector [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] '''<math>Du</math>''' represents therefore the [[Distribution (mathematics)#Formal definition|distributional]] or [[weak derivative|weak]] [[gradient]] of '''<math>u</math>'''.

An equivalent definition is the following.

{{EquationRef|4|Definition 2.2.}} Given a function '''<math>u</math>''' belonging to '''<math>L^1(\Omega)</math>''', the '''total variation of <math>u</math>''' in is defined as

:<math> V(u,\Omega):=\sup\left\{\int_\Omega u(x)\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)\mathrm{d}x\colon\boldsymbol{\phi}\in C_c^1(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n),\ \Vert\boldsymbol{\phi}\Vert_{L^\infty(\Omega)}\le 1\right\}</math>

where <math> \scriptstyle \Vert\;\Vert_{L^\infty(\Omega)}</math> is the [[essential supremum]] [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]]. Sometimes, especially in the theory of [[Caccioppoli set]]s, the following notation is used

:<math>\int_\Omega\vert D u\vert = V(u,\Omega)</math>

in order to emphasize that <math>V(u,\Omega)</math> is the total variation of the [[Distribution (mathematics)#Formal definition|distributional]] / [[weak derivative|weak]] [[gradient]] of '''<math>u</math>'''. This notation reminds also that if '''<math>u</math>''' is of class  '''<math>C^1</math>''' (i.e. a [[continuous function|continuous]] and [[differentiable function]] having [[continuous function|continuous]] [[derivative]]s) then its [[Total variation|variation]] is exactly the [[Integral (measure theory)|integral]] of the [[absolute value]] of its [[gradient]].

The space of '''functions of bounded variation''' ('''BV functions''') can then be defined as

:<math> BV(\Omega)=\{ u\in L^1(\Omega)\colon V(u,\Omega)<+\infty\}</math>

The two definitions are equivalent since if <math> \scriptstyle V(u,\Omega)<+\infty </math> then

:<math>\left|\int_\Omega u(x)\,\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)\mathrm{d}x \right |\leq V(u,\Omega)\Vert\boldsymbol{\phi}\Vert_{L^\infty(\Omega)}
\qquad \forall \boldsymbol{\phi}\in C_c^1(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)
</math>

therefore <math>\scriptstyle \int_\Omega u(x)\,\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)</math> defines a [[continuous linear functional]] on
the space <math>\scriptstyle C_c^1(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)</math>. Since <math>\scriptstyle C_c^1(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)
\subset C^0(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)</math> as a [[linear subspace]], this [[continuous linear functional]] can be extended [[continuous function|continuously]] and [[linearity|linearily]] to the whole <math>\scriptstyle C^0(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)</math> by the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]] i.e. it defines a [[Radon_measure#Duality|Radon measure]].

===Locally ''BV'' functions===
If the [[function space]] of [[locally integrable function]]s, i.e. [[Function (mathematics)|function]]s belonging to <math>\scriptstyle L^1_{loc}(\Omega)</math>, is considered in the preceding definitions {{EquationNote|2|1.2}}, {{EquationNote|3|2.1}} and {{EquationNote|4|2.2}} instead of the one of [[integrable function|globally integrable functions]], then the function space defined is that of '''functions of locally bounded variation'''. Precisely, developing this idea for {{EquationNote|4|definition 2.2}}, a '''[[local property|local]] variation''' is defined as follows,
:<math> V(u,U):=\sup\left\{\int_\Omega u(x)\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)\mathrm{d}x\colon\boldsymbol{\phi}\in C_c^1(U,\mathbb{R}^n),\ \Vert\boldsymbol{\phi}\Vert_{L^\infty(\Omega)}\le 1\right\}</math>
for every [[Set (mathematics)|set]] <math>\scriptstyle U\in\mathcal{O}_c(\Omega)</math>, having defined <math>\scriptstyle \mathcal{O}_c(\Omega)</math> as the set of all [[compact set|compact]] [[open subset]]s of '''<math>\Omega</math>''' respect to the standard [[topology]] of [[dimension (mathematics)|finite dimensional]] [[vector space]]s, and correspondingly the class of functions of locally bounded variation is defined as
:<math>BV_{loc}(\Omega)=\{ u\in L^1_{loc}(\Omega)\colon V(u,U)<+\infty\; \forall U\in\mathcal{O}_c(\Omega)\}</math>

===Notation===
There are basically two distinct conventions for the notation of spaces of functions of locally or globally bounded variation, and unfortunately they are quite similar: the first one, which is the one adopted in this entry, is used for example in references {{Harvtxt|Giusti|1984}} (partially), {{Harvtxt|Hudjaev|Vol'pert|1985}} (partially), {{Harvtxt|Giaquinta|Modica|Souček|1998}} and is the following one
*<math>\scriptstyle BV(\Omega)</math> identifies the [[Space (mathematics)|space]] of functions of globally bounded variation
*<math>\scriptstyle BV_{loc}(\Omega)</math> identifies the [[Space (mathematics)|space]] of functions of locally bounded variation
The second one, which is adopted in references {{Harvtxt|Vol'pert|1967}} and {{Harvtxt|Maz'ya|1985}} (partially), is the following:
*<math>\scriptstyle \overline{BV}(\Omega)</math> identifies the [[Space (mathematics)|space]] of functions of globally bounded variation
*<math>\scriptstyle BV(\Omega)</math> identifies the [[Space (mathematics)|space]] of functions of locally bounded variation

==Basic properties==
Only the properties common to [[Function (mathematics)|function]]s of one variable and to [[Function (mathematics)|function]]s of several variables will be considered in the following, and [[Mathematical proof|proof]]s will be carried on only for functions of several variables since the [[Mathematical proof|proof]] for the case of one variable is a straightforward adaptation of the several variables case: also, in each section it will be stated if the property is shared also by functions of locally bounded variation or not. References {{Harv|Giusti|1984|pp=7–9}}, {{Harv|Hudjaev|Vol'pert|1985}} and {{Harv|Màlek|Nečas|Rokyta|Růžička|1996}} are extensively used.

===''BV'' functions have only jump-type discontinuities===
In the case of one variable, the assertion is clear: for each point <math>x_0</math> in the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] <math>]a , b[</math>⊂ℝ of definition of the function '''<math>u</math>''', either one of the following two assertions is true

:<math> \lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0^-}}\!\!\!u(x) = \!\!\!\lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0^+}}\!\!\!u(x) </math>
:<math> \lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0^-}}\!\!\!u(x) \neq \!\!\!\lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0^+}}\!\!\!u(x) </math>

while both [[Limit of a function|limits]] exist and are finite. In the case of functions of several variables, there are some premises to understand: first of all, there is a [[Linear continuum|continuum]] of [[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]]s along which it is possible to approach a given point '''<math>x_0</math>''' belonging to the domain '''<math>\Omega</math>'''⊂ℝ''<sup>n</sup>''. It is necessary to make precise a suitable concept of [[Limit of a function|limit]]: choosing a [[unit vector]] <math>\scriptstyle{\boldsymbol\hat a}\in\mathbb{R}^n</math> it is possible to divide '''<math>\Omega</math>''' in two sets

:<math>\Omega_{({\boldsymbol\hat a},\boldsymbol{x}_0)} = \Omega \cap \{\boldsymbol{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n|\langle\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_0,{\boldsymbol\hat a}\rangle>0\} \qquad 
\Omega_{(-{\boldsymbol\hat a},\boldsymbol{x}_0)} = \Omega \cap \{\boldsymbol{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n|\langle\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_0,-{\boldsymbol\hat a}\rangle>0\} </math>

Then for each point '''<math>x_0</math>''' belonging to the domain <math>\scriptstyle\Omega\in\mathbb{R}^n</math> of the ''BV'' function '''<math>u</math>''', only one of the following two assertions is true

:<math> \lim_{\overset{\boldsymbol{x}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{x}_0}{\boldsymbol{x}\in\Omega_{({\boldsymbol\hat a},\boldsymbol{x}_0)}}}\!\!\!\!\!\!u(\boldsymbol{x}) = \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\lim_{\overset{\boldsymbol{x}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{x}_0}{\boldsymbol{x}\in\Omega_{(-{\boldsymbol\hat a},\boldsymbol{x}_0)}}}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!u(\boldsymbol{x})
</math>
:<math>  \lim_{\overset{\boldsymbol{x}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{x}_0}{\boldsymbol{x}\in\Omega_{({\boldsymbol\hat a},\boldsymbol{x}_0)}}}\!\!\!\!\!\!u(\boldsymbol{x}) \neq \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\lim_{\overset{\boldsymbol{x}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{x}_0}{\boldsymbol{x}\in\Omega_{(-{\boldsymbol\hat a},\boldsymbol{x}_0)}}}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!u(\boldsymbol{x})
</math>

or '''<math>x_0</math>''' belongs to a [[subset]] of '''<math>\Omega</math>''' having zero <math>n-1</math>-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]]. The quantities

:<math>\lim_{\overset{\boldsymbol{x}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{x}_0}{\boldsymbol{x}\in\Omega_{({\boldsymbol\hat a},\boldsymbol{x}_0)}}}\!\!\!\!\!\!u(\boldsymbol{x})=u_{\boldsymbol{\hat a}}(\boldsymbol{x}) \qquad \lim_{\overset{\boldsymbol{x}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{x}_0}{\boldsymbol{x}\in\Omega_{(-{\boldsymbol\hat a},\boldsymbol{x}_0)}}}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!u(\boldsymbol{x})=u_{-\boldsymbol{\hat a}}(\boldsymbol{x})</math>

are called '''approximate limits''' of the ''BV'' function '''<math>u</math>''' at the point '''<math>x_0</math>'''.

===''V''(&middot;, &Omega;) is lower semi-continuous on ''BV''(&Omega;)===
The [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] <math>\scriptstyle V(\cdot,\Omega):BV(\Omega)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+</math> is [[semi-continuity|lower semi-continuous]]:
to see this, choose a [[Cauchy sequence]] of ''BV''-functions '''<math>\scriptstyle\{u_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}</math>''' converging to '''[[locally integrable function|<math>\scriptstyle u\in L^1_\text{loc}(\Omega)</math>]]'''. Then, since all the functions of the sequence and their limit function are [[integral|integrable]] and by the definition of [[lower limit]]

:<math>\liminf_{n\rightarrow\infty}V(u_n,\Omega)\geq\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int_\Omega u_n(x)\,\mathrm{div}\, \boldsymbol{\phi}\, \mathrm{d}x = \int_\Omega u(x)\,\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}\, \mathrm{d}x \qquad\forall\boldsymbol{\phi}\in C_c^1(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n),\quad\Vert\boldsymbol{\phi}\Vert_{L^\infty(\Omega)}\leq 1 </math>

Now considering the [[supremum]] on the set of functions <math>\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{\phi}\in C_c^1(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)</math> such that <math>\scriptstyle \Vert\boldsymbol{\phi}\Vert_{L^\infty(\Omega)}\leq 1 </math> then the following inequality holds true

:<math>\liminf_{n\rightarrow\infty}V(u_n,\Omega)\geq V(u,\Omega)</math>

which is exactly the definition of [[semicontinuity|lower semicontinuity]].

===''BV''(&Omega;) is a Banach space===
By definition '''<math>BV(\Omega)</math>''' is a [[subset]] of '''[[integrable function|<math>L^1(\Omega)</math>]]''', while [[linearity]] follows from the linearity properties of the defining [[integral]] i.e.

:<math>\begin{align}
\int_\Omega [u(x)+v(x)]\,\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)\mathrm{d}x & = 
\int_\Omega u(x)\,\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)\mathrm{d}x +\int_\Omega v(x)\,\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)\mathrm{d}x = \\
& =- \int_\Omega \langle\boldsymbol{\phi}(x), Du(x)\rangle- \int_\Omega \langle \boldsymbol{\phi}(x), Dv(x)\rangle
                                               =- \int_\Omega \langle \boldsymbol{\phi}(x), [Du(x)+Dv(x)]\rangle 
\end{align}
</math>

for all <math>\scriptstyle\phi\in C_c^1(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)</math> therefore <math>\scriptstyle u+v\in BV(\Omega)</math>for all <math>\scriptstyle u,v\in BV(\Omega)</math>, and

:<math>
\int_\Omega c\cdot u(x)\,\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)\mathrm{d}x = 
c\!\int_\Omega u(x)\,\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)\mathrm{d}x = 
-c\! \int_\Omega \langle \boldsymbol{\phi}(x), Du(x)\rangle
</math>

for all <math>\scriptstyle c\in\mathbb{R}</math>, therefore <math>\scriptstyle cu\in BV(\Omega)</math> for all <math>\scriptstyle u\in BV(\Omega)</math>, and all <math>\scriptstyle c\in\mathbb{R}</math>. The proved [[vector space]] properties imply that '''<math>BV(\Omega)</math>''' is a [[vector subspace]] of '''[[Lp space|<math>L^1(\Omega)</math>]]'''. Consider now the function <math>\scriptstyle\|\;\|_{BV}:BV(\Omega)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^+</math> defined as

:<math>\| u \|_{BV} := \| u \|_{L^1} + V(u,\Omega)</math>

where <math>\scriptstyle\| \; \|_{L^1}</math> is the usual '''[[Lp space#Lp spaces|<math>L^1(\Omega)</math> norm]]''': it is easy to prove that this is a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] on '''<math>BV(\Omega)</math>'''. To see that '''<math>BV(\Omega)</math>''' is [[completeness|complete]] respect to it, i.e. it is a [[Banach space]], consider a [[Cauchy sequence]] <math>\scriptstyle\{u_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{R}}</math> in '''<math>BV(\Omega)</math>'''. By definition it is also a [[Cauchy sequence]] in '''<math>L^1(\Omega)</math>''' and therefore has a [[limit of a sequence|limit]] '''<math>u</math>''' in '''<math>L^1(\Omega)</math>''': since '''<math>u_n</math>''' is bounded in '''<math>BV(\Omega)</math>''' for each '''<math>n</math>''', then <math>\scriptstyle \Vert u \Vert_{BV} < +\infty </math> by [[semicontinuity|lower semicontinuity]] of the variation <math>\scriptstyle V(\cdot,\Omega)</math>, therefore '''<math>u</math>''' is a ''BV'' function. Finally, again by lower semicontinuity, choosing an arbitrary small positive number '''<math>\scriptstyle\varepsilon</math>'''

:<math>\Vert u_j - u_k \Vert_{BV}<\varepsilon\quad\forall j,k\geq N\in\mathbb{N} \quad\Rightarrow\quad V(u_k-u,\Omega)\leq \liminf_{j\rightarrow +\infty} V(u_k-u_j,\Omega)\leq\varepsilon</math>

===''BV''(&Omega;) is not separable===
To see this, it is sufficient to consider the following example belonging to the space '''<math>BV(]0,1[)</math>'''<ref>The example is taken from  {{Harvtxt|Giaquinta|Modica|Souček|1998|p=331}}</ref>: for each 0<''&alpha;''<1 define
:<math>\chi_\alpha=\chi_{]\alpha,1[}= 
\begin{cases} 0 & \mbox{if } x \notin\; ]\alpha,1[ \\ 
              1 & \mbox{if } x \in [\alpha,1[ 
\end{cases} 
</math>
as the [[indicator function|characteristic function]] of the [[Interval (mathematics)#Terminology|left-closed interval]] <math>[\alpha,1[</math>. Then, chosing ''&alpha;,&beta;''∈<math>]0,1[</math> such that ''&alpha;''≠''&beta;'' the following relation holds true:
:<math>\Vert \chi_\alpha - \chi_\beta \Vert_{BV}=2+|\alpha-\beta|</math>
Now, in order to prove that every [[Dense set|dense subset]] of '''<math>BV(]0,1[)</math>''' cannot be [[countable set|countable]], it is sufficient to see that for every ''&alpha;''∈<math>]0,1[</math> it is possible to construct the [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]]s
:<math>B_\alpha=\left\{\psi\in BV(]0,1[);\Vert \chi_\alpha - \psi \Vert_{BV}\leq 1\right\}</math>
Obviously those balls are [[Disjoint sets|pairwise disjoint]], and also are a [[indexed family]] of [[set (mathematics)|set]]s whose [[index set]] is <math>]0,1[</math>. This implies that this family has the [[cardinality of the continuum]]: now, since any dense subset of '''<math>BV(]0,1[)</math>''' must have at least a point inside each member of this family, its cardinality is at least that of the continuum and therefore cannot a be countable subset<ref>The reasoning is the same used by {{Harvnb|Kolmogorov|Fomin|1969|pp=48&ndash;49}}, example 7, in order to prove the non [[Separable space|separability]] of the space of [[bounded sequence]]s.</ref>. This example can be obviously extended to higher dimensions, and since it involves only [[Local property|local properties]], it implies that the same property is true for '''<math>BV_{loc}</math>'''.

===Chain rule for ''BV'' functions===
[[Chain rule]]s for [[smooth function|nonsmooth function]]s are very important in [[mathematics]] and [[mathematical physics]] since there are several important [[Mathematical model|physical model]]s whose behavior is described by [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] or [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]s with a very limited degree of [[Smooth function|smoothness]].The following version is proved in the paper {{Harv|Vol'pert|1967|p=248}}: all [[partial derivative]]s must be intended in a generalized sense. i.e. as [[Generalized_derivative#Basic_idea|generalized derivative]]s

'''Theorem'''. Let <math>\scriptstyle f:\mathbb{R}^p\rightarrow\mathbb{R}</math> be a function of class '''<math>C^1</math>''' (i.e. a [[continuous function|continuous]] and [[differentiable function]] having [[continuous function|continuous]] [[derivative]]s) and let <math>\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x})=(u_1(\boldsymbol{x}),\ldots,u_p(\boldsymbol{x})) </math> be a function in '''<math>BV(\Omega)</math>''' with '''<math> \Omega </math>''' being an [[open subset]] of <math> \scriptstyle\mathbb{R}^n </math>.
Then <math>\scriptstyle f\circ\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x})=f(\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x}))\in BV(\Omega) </math> and

:<math>\frac{\partial f(\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x}))}{\partial x_i}=\sum_{k=1}^p\frac{\partial\bar{f}(\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x}))}{\partial u_k}\frac{\partial{u_k(\boldsymbol{x})}}{\partial x_i}
\qquad\forall i=1,\ldots,n</math>

where <math>\scriptstyle\bar f(\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x}))</math> is the mean value of the function at the point '''<math>\scriptstyle x \in\Omega</math>''', defined as

:<math>\bar f(\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x}))=\int_0^1 f\left(\boldsymbol{u}_{\boldsymbol{\hat a}}(\boldsymbol{x})t + \boldsymbol{u}_{-\boldsymbol{\hat a}}(\boldsymbol{x})(1-t)\right)dt</math>

A more general [[chain rule]] [[formula]] for [[lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz continuous functions]] <math>\scriptstyle f:\mathbb{R}^p\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^s</math> has been found by [[Luigi Ambrosio]] and [[Gianni Dal Maso]] and is published in the paper {{Harv|Ambrosio|Dal Maso|1990}}. However, even this formula has very important direct consequences: choosing <math>\scriptstyle f(u)=v(\boldsymbol{x})u(\boldsymbol{x})</math> where <math>\scriptstyle v(\boldsymbol{x})</math> is a ''BV'' function the preceding formula becomes the '''''[[Product rule|Leibniz rule]]''''' for '''<math>BV</math>''' functions

:<math>\frac{\partial v(\boldsymbol{x})u(\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial x_i} = {\bar u(\boldsymbol{x})}\frac{\partial v(\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial x_i} + 
{\bar v(\boldsymbol{x})}\frac{\partial u(\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial x_i} </math>

This implies that '''the product of two functions of bounded variation is again a function of bounded variation''', therefore '''<math>BV(\Omega)</math>''' is an [[Associative algebra|algebra]].

===BV(&Omega;) is a Banach algebra===
This property follows directly from the fact that '''<math>BV(\Omega)</math>''' is a [[Banach space]] and also an [[associative algebra]]: this implies that if '''<math>\{v_n\}</math>''' and '''<math>\{u_n\}</math>''' are [[Cauchy sequence]]s of <math>BV</math> functions converging respectively to [[function (mathematics)|function]]s '''<math>v</math>''' and  '''<math>u</math>''' in '''<math>BV(\Omega)</math>''', then

::<math>\begin{matrix}
  vu_n\xrightarrow[n\to\infty]{} vu \\
  v_nu\xrightarrow[n\to\infty]{} vu 
        \end{matrix}\quad\Longleftrightarrow
\quad vu\in BV(\Omega)</math>

therefore the ordinary [[Pointwise product|product of functions]] is [[continuity (mathematics)|continuous]] in '''<math>BV(\Omega)</math>''' respect to each argument, making this function space a [[Banach algebra]].

==Generalizations and extensions==
=== Weighted ''BV'' functions ===
It is possible to generalize the above notion of [[total variation]] so that different variations are weighted differently. More precisely, let <math>\scriptstyle \varphi : [0, +\infty)\longrightarrow [0, +\infty)</math> be any increasing function such that <math>\scriptstyle \varphi(0) = \varphi(0+) =\lim_{x\rightarrow 0_+}\varphi(x) = 0</math> (the '''[[weight function]]''') and let <math>\scriptstyle f: [0, T]\longrightarrow X </math> be a function from the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] <math>[0 , T]</math>⊂ℝ taking values in a [[normed vector space]] <math>X</math>. Then the <math>\scriptstyle \boldsymbol\varphi</math>'''-variation''' of <math>f</math> over <math>[0, T]</math> is defined as

:<math>\mathop{\varphi\mbox{-Var}}_{[0, T]} (f) := \sup \sum_{j = 0}^{k} \varphi \left( | f(t_{j + 1}) - f(t_{j}) |_{X} \right),</math>

where, as usual, the supremum is taken over all finite [[partition of an interval|partitions]] of the interval <math>[0, T]</math>, i.e. all the [[finite set]]s of [[real number]]s <math>t_i</math> such that

:<math>0 = t_{0} < t_{1} < \ldots < t_{k} = T.</math>

The original notion of [[Total variation|variation]] considered above is the special case of <math>\scriptstyle \varphi</math>-variation for which the weight function is the [[identity function]]: therefore an [[integrable function]] <math>f</math> is said to be a '''weighted ''BV'' function''' (of weight <math>\scriptstyle\varphi</math>) if and only if its <math>\scriptstyle \varphi</math>-variation is finite.

:<math>f\in BV_\varphi([0, T];X)\iff \mathop{\varphi\mbox{-Var}}_{[0, T]} (f) <+\infty</math>

The space <math>\scriptstyle BV_\varphi([0, T];X)</math> is a [[topological vector space]] with respect to the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]

:<math>\| f \|_{BV_\varphi} := \| f \|_{\infty} + \mathop{\varphi \mbox{-Var}}_{[0, T]} (f),</math>

where <math>\scriptstyle\| f \|_{\infty}</math> denotes the usual [[supremum norm]] of ''<math>f</math>''. Weighted ''BV'' functions were introduced and studied in full generality by [[Wladislav Orlicz]] and [[Julian Musielak]] in the paper {{Harv|Musielak|Orlicz|1959}}: [[Laurence Chisholm Young]] studied earlier the case <math>\scriptstyle\varphi(x)=x^p</math> where ''<math>p</math>'' is a positive integer.

===''SBV'' functions===
'''SBV functions''' ''i.e.'' ''Special functions of Bounded Variation'' where introduced by [[Luigi Ambrosio]] and [[Ennio de Giorgi]] in the paper {{Harv|Ambrosio|De Giorgi|1988}}, dealing with free discontinuity [[variational problem]]s: given an [[open subset]] '''<math> \Omega </math>''' of ℝ''<sup>n</sup>'', the space '''<math>SBV(\Omega)</math>''' is a proper [[subspace]] of  '''<math>BV(\Omega)</math>''', since the [[weak derivative|weak]] [[gradient]] of each function belonging to it const exactly of the [[sum]] of a <math>n</math>-[[dimension]]al [[Support (mathematics)|support]] and a <math>n-1</math>-[[dimension]]al [[Support (mathematics)|support]] [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] and ''no intermediate-dimensional terms'', as seen in the following definition.

'''Definition'''. Given a [[locally integrable function]] '''<math>u</math>''', then <math>\scriptstyle u\in {S\!BV}(\Omega) </math> if and only if

'''1.''' There exist two [[Borel function]]s <math>f</math> and <math>g</math> of [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]] '''<math>\Omega</math>''' and [[codomain]] ℝ''<sup>n</sup>'' such that

:<math> \int_\Omega\vert f\vert dH^n+ \int_\Omega\vert g\vert dH^{n-1}<+\infty.</math>

'''2.''' For all of [[Smooth function|continuously differentiable]] [[Vector valued function|vector functions]] <math> \scriptstyle\phi </math> of [[support (mathematics)#Compact support|compact support]] contained in '''<math> \Omega </math>''', ''i.e.'' for all <math> \scriptstyle \phi \in 
C_c^1(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)</math> the following formula is true:

:<math> \int_\Omega u\mbox{div} \phi dH^n = \int_\Omega \langle \phi, f\rangle dH^n +\int_\Omega \langle \phi, g\rangle dH^{n-1}.</math>

where <math>H^\alpha</math> is the <math>\alpha</math>-[[dimension]]al [[Hausdorff measure]].

Details on the properties of ''SBV'' functions can be found in works cited in the bibliography section: particularly the paper {{Harv|De Giorgi|1992}} contains a useful [[bibliography]].

===''bv'' sequences===
As particular examples of [[Banach spaces]], {{harvtxt|Dunford|Schwartz|1958|loc=Chapter IV}} consider spaces of '''sequences of bounded variation''', in addition to the spaces of functions of bounded variation. The total variation of a [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]] ''x''=(''x''<sub>i</sub>) of real or complex numbers is defined by
:<math>TV(x) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty |x_{i+1}-x_i|.</math>

The space of all sequences of finite total variation is denoted by ''bv''. The norm on ''bv'' is given by
:<math>\|x\|_{bv} = |x_1| + TV(x) = |x_1| +  \sum_{i=1}^\infty |x_{i+1}-x_i|.</math>
With this norm, the space ''bv'' is a Banach space.

The total variation itself defines a norm on a certain subspace of ''bv'', denoted by ''bv''<sub>0</sub>, consisting of sequences ''x'' = (''x''<sub>i</sub>) for which
:<math>\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n =0.</math>
The norm on ''bv''<sub>0</sub> is denoted
:<math>\|x\|_{bv_0} = TV(x) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty |x_{i+1}-x_i|.</math>
With respect to this norm ''bv''<sub>0</sub> becomes a Banach space as well.

===Measures of bounded variation===
A [[signed measure|signed]] (or [[complex measure|complex]]) [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] ''<math>\mu</math>'' on a [[sigma-algebra|measurable space]] <math>(X,\Sigma)</math> is said to be of bounded variation if its [[Total variation#Total variation in measure theory|total variation]]'' <math>\scriptstyle\Vert \mu\Vert=|\mu|(X)</math>'' is bounded: see {{harvtxt|Halmos|1950|p=123}}, {{harvtxt|Kolmogorov|Fomin|1969|p=346}} or the entry "[[total variation]]" for further details.

==Examples==
[[Image:Sin x^-1.svg|right|thumb|The function ''f''(''x'')=sin(1/''x'') is ''not'' of bounded variation on the interval <math> [0,2 / \pi] </math>.]]
The function

:<math>f(x) = \begin{cases} 0, & \mbox{if }x =0 \\ \sin(1/x), & \mbox{if } x \neq 0 \end{cases} </math>

is ''not'' of bounded variation on the interval <math> [0, 2/\pi]</math>

[[Image:Xsin(x^-1).svg|thumb|right|The function ''f''(''x'')=''x'' sin(1/''x'') is ''not'' of bounded variation on the interval <math> [0,2 / \pi] </math>.]]
While it is harder to see, the function

:<math>f(x) = \begin{cases} 0, & \mbox{if }x =0 \\ x \sin(1/x), & \mbox{if } x \neq 0 \end{cases} </math>

is ''not'' of bounded variation on the interval <math> [0, 2/\pi]</math> either.

[[Image:X^2sin(x^-1).svg|thumb|right|The function ''f''(''x'')=''x''<sup>2</sup> sin(1/''x'') ''is'' of bounded variation on the interval <math> [0,2 / \pi] </math>.]]
At the same time, the function

:<math>f(x) = \begin{cases} 0, & \mbox{if }x =0 \\ x^2 \sin(1/x), & \mbox{if } x \neq 0 \end{cases} </math>

is of bounded variation on the interval <math> [0,2/\pi]</math>. However, ''all three functions are of bounded variation on each interval'' <math>[a,b]</math> ''with'' <math>a>0</math>.

The [[Sobolev space]] '''<math> W^{1,1}(\Omega)</math>''' is a [[proper subset]] of '''<math> BV(\Omega)</math>'''. In fact, for each '''<math> u </math>''' in '''<math> W^{1,1}(\Omega) </math>''' it is possible to choose a [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] <math> \scriptstyle \mu:=\nabla u \mathcal L</math> (where <math> \scriptstyle\mathcal L</math> is the [[Lebesgue measure]] on '''<math>\Omega</math>''') such that the equality

:<math> \int u\mathrm{div}\phi = -\int \phi\, d\mu = -\int \phi \nabla u \qquad \forall \phi\in C_c^1 </math>

holds, since it is nothing more than the definition of [[weak derivative]], and hence holds true. One can easily find an example of a ''BV'' function which is not '''<math>W^{1,1}</math>''':  in dimension one, any step function with a non-trivial jump will do.

==Applications==
=== Mathematics ===

Functions of bounded variation have been studied in connection with the set of [[classification of discontinuities|discontinuities]] of functions and differentiability of real functions, and the following results are well-known. If <math>f</math> is a [[real number|real]] [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of bounded variation on an interval <math>[a,b]</math> then

* <math>f</math> is [[continuous function|continuous]] except at most on a [[countable set]];
* <math>f</math> has [[one-sided limit]]s everywhere (limits from the left everywhere in <math>(a,b]</math>, and from the right everywhere in <math>[a,b)</math> ;
* the [[derivative]] <math>f'(x)</math> exists [[almost everywhere]] (i.e. except for a set of [[measure zero]]).

For [[real number|real]] [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] of several real variables

* the [[Indicator function|characteristic function]] of a [[Caccioppoli set]] is a ''BV'' function: ''BV'' functions lie at the basis of the modern theory of perimeters.
* [[Minimal surface]]s are [[Graph of a function|graph]]s of ''BV'' functions: in this context, see reference {{Harv|Giusti|1984}}.

===Physics and engineering===
The ability of ''BV'' functions to deal with discontinuities has made their use widespread in the applied sciences: solutions of problems in mechanics, physics, chemical kinetics are very often representable by functions of bounded variation. The book {{Harv|Hudjaev|Vol'pert|1985}} details a very ample set of mathematical physics applications of ''BV'' functions. Also there is some modern application which deserves a brief description.

*The [[Mumford-Shah functional]]: the segmentation problem for a two-dimensional image, i.e. the problem of faithful reproduction of contours and grey scales is equivalent to the [[minimum|minimization]] of such [[functional]].
