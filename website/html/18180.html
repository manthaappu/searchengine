<html> <head> <title>Industrial-grade prime</title></head><body>'''Industrial-grade primes''' (the term is apparently due to [[Henri Cohen (number theorist)|Henri Cohen]]<ref>Chris Caldwell, [http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=PRP ''The Prime Glossary: probable prime''] at The [[Prime Pages]].</ref>) are [[integer]]s for which [[primality]] has not been certified (i.e. rigorously proven), but they have undergone [[probable prime]] tests such as the [[Miller-Rabin primality test]], which has a positive, but negligible, failure rate.

Industrial-grade primes are sometimes used instead of certified primes in [[algorithms]] such as [[RSA encryption]], which require the user to generate large [[prime numbers]].  [[Primality test|Certifying the primality]] of large numbers (over 100 digits for instance) is significantly harder than showing they are industrial-grade primes. The latter can be done almost instantly with a [[failure rate]] so low that it is highly unlikely to ever fail in practice. In other words, the number is certified to be prime with very high, but not absolute, confidence.
