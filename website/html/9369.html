<html> <head> <title>Data exchange</title></head><body>'''Data exchange''' is the process of taking [[data]] structured under a ''source'' [[Database schema|schema]] and actually transforming it into data structured under a ''target'' schema, so that the target data is an accurate representation of the source data. Data exchange is similar to the related concept of [[data integration]] except that data is actually restructured (with possible loss of content) in data exchange. There may be no way to transform an [[instance]] given all of our constraints. Conversely, there may be numerous ways to transform the instance (possibly infinitely many), in which case we must identify and justify a "best" choice of solutions.
