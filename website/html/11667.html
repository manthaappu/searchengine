'''Edgar Frank "Ted" Codd''' (August 23, 1923 – April 18, 2003) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[computer science|computer scientist]] who, while working for [[International Business Machines|IBM]], invented the [[relational model]]  for database management, the theoretical basis for [[relational database]]s. He made other valuable contributions to [[computer science]], but the relational model, a very influential general theory of data management, remains his most mentioned achievement.

== Biography==
Edgar Frank Codd was born on the [[Isle of Portland]] in [[England]]. After attending [[Poole Grammar School]], he studied [[mathematics]] and [[chemistry]] at [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]], before serving as a pilot in the [[Royal Air Force]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. In 1948, he moved to [[New York]] to work for IBM as a mathematical [[programmer]]. In 1953, angered by Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]], Codd moved to [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]]. A decade later he returned to the [[United States|U.S.]] and received his doctorate in computer science from the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]]. Two years later he moved to [[San Jose, California]], to work at [[IBM]]'s [[Almaden Research Center|San Jose Research Laboratory]], where he continued to work until the 1980s.  During the 1990s, his health deteriorated and he ceased work.<ref>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/edgar-codd-730256.html Edgar Codd's obituary in The Independent</ref>

Codd received the [[Turing Award]] in 1981, and in 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]].<ref>[http://fellows.acm.org/homepage.cfm?alpha=C&srt=alpha ACM Fellows]</ref>

Codd died of [[heart failure]] at his home in [[Williams Island, Florida]], at the age of 79 on April 18, 2003.<ref name = "IBM">[http://www.research.ibm.com/resources/news/20030423_edgarpassaway.shtml  Edgar F Codd Passes Away], IBM Research, 2003 Apr 23.</ref>

== Work ==

In the 1960s and 1970s he worked out his theories of data arrangement, issuing his paper "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks" in 1970, after an internal IBM paper one year earlier.<ref>Michael Owens. The Definitive Guide to SQLite, p.47. New York: Apress (Springer-Verlag) 2006. ISBN 978-1-59059-673-9.</ref> To his disappointment, IBM proved slow to exploit his suggestions until commercial rivals started implementing them.

Initially, IBM refused to implement the relational model in order to preserve revenue from [[IMS/DB]].  Codd then showed IBM customers the potential of the implementation of its model, and they in turn pressured IBM.  Then IBM included in its [[IBM Future Systems project|Future Systems]] project a [[System R]] subproject — but put in charge of it developers who were not thoroughly familiar with Codd's ideas, and isolated the team from Codd{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}.  As a result, they did not use Codd's own [[Alpha (language)|Alpha]] language but created a non-relational one, [[SEQUEL]].  Even so, [[SEQUEL]] was so superior to pre-relational systems that it was copied, based on pre-launch papers presented at conferences, by [[Larry Ellison]] in his [[Oracle Database]], which actually reached market before [[SQL/DS]] — due to the then-already proprietary status of the original name, SEQUEL had been renamed [[SQL]].

Codd continued to develop and extend his relational model, sometimes in collaboration with [[Christopher J. Date|Chris Date]].  One of the [[Database normalization|normalized forms]], the [[Boyce-Codd normal form]], is named after him.

[[Codd's theorem]], a result proven in his seminal work on the relational model, equates the expressive power of [[relational algebra]] and [[relational calculus]] (which, in essence, is equivalent to [[first-order logic]]).

As the relational model started to become fashionable in the early 1980s, Codd fought a sometimes bitter campaign to prevent the term being misused by database vendors who had merely added a relational veneer to older technology. As part of this campaign, he published his [[Codd's 12 rules|12 rules]] to define what constituted a relational database.  This made his position in [[IBM]] increasingly difficult, so he left to form his own consulting company with [[Chris Date]] and others.

Edgar Codd coined the term ''[[OLAP]]'' and wrote the twelve laws of online analytical processing, although these were never truly accepted after it came out that his white paper on the subject was paid for by a software vendor.  His last work, a book named ''The Relational Model for Database Management, version 2'', was not so well received {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}.  On the other hand, his extension of the ideas in the relational model to cover database design issues, in his [[Relational Model/Tasmania|RM/T]], have proved important {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}.  Codd also contributed knowledge in the area of [[cellular automata]].<ref name=Codd68>{{cite book|author = Codd, Edgar F.|title=Cellular Automata|publisher=Academic Press, New York|year=1968}}</ref>

In 2004, [[SIGMOD]] renamed its highest prize to the [[SIGMOD Edgar F. Codd Innovations Award]], in his honor.
