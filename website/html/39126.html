'''VISQ''' (Portuguese acronym for "Variables that Interact Semi-Quantitatively") is a scientific-educational [[software]] developed in 1993 by M. Thielo (as an [[physics]] undergrad at the time) and Kurtz dos Santos, based on Jon Ogborn ideas for semi-quantitative modeling of [[dynamical systems]], for both [[MS-DOS]] and [[Macintosh]] systems. Awarded by the [[Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul]] (UFRGS) in 1994, the system is based on the theory of continuous [[neural networks]], and have been used in many research projects since then, mainly in Master Dissertations in the area of [[environmental education]]. An introduction to VISQ (in Portuguese) can be found at the university site <ref>[http://www.modelciencias.furg.br/bin/ferramentas/semi/visq.php VISQ: and introduction to semiquantitative modelling tools(in portuguese)]</ref>, and the [[software]] can be freely downloaded from the author's site<ref>[http://www.if.ufrgs.br/~thielo/visq.zip Downloading VISQ for MS-DOS]</ref>
