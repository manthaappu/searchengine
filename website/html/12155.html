<html> <head> <title>Engel expansion</title></head><body>The '''Engel expansion''' of a positive [[real number]] ''x'' is the unique non-decreasing sequence of [[natural number|positive integer]]s <math>\{a_1,a_2,a_3,\dots\}</math> such that

:<math>x=\frac{1}{a_1}+\frac{1}{a_1a_2}+\frac{1}{a_1a_2a_3}+\cdots.\;</math>

[[Rational number]]s have a finite Engel expansion, while [[irrational number]]s have an infinite Engel expansion. If ''x'' is rational, its Engel expansion provides a representation of ''x'' as an [[Egyptian fraction]]. Engel expansions are named after [[Friedrich Engel (mathematician)|Friedrich Engel]], who studied them in 1913.

An expansion analogous to an '''Engel expansion''', in which alternating terms are negative, is called a [[Pierce expansion]].

== Engel expansions, continued fractions, and Fibonacci ==

Kraaikamp and Wu (2004) observe that an Engel expansion can also be written as an ascending variant of a [[continued fraction]]:

:<math>x = \frac{\displaystyle 1+\frac{\displaystyle 1+\frac{\displaystyle 1+\cdots}{\displaystyle a_3}}{\displaystyle a_2}}{\displaystyle a_1}.</math>

They claim that ascending continued fractions such as this have been studied as early as [[Fibonacci]]'s [[Liber Abaci]] (1202). This claim appears to refer to Fibonacci's compound fraction notation in which a sequence of numerators and denominators sharing the same fraction bar represents an ascending continued fraction:

:<math>\frac{a\ b\ c\ d}{e\ f\ g\ h} = \dfrac{d+\dfrac{c+\dfrac{b+\dfrac{a}{e}}{f}}{g}}{h}.</math>

If such a notation has all numerators 0 or 1, as occurs in several instances in [[Liber Abaci]], the result is an Engel expansion. However, Engel expansion as a general technique does not seem to be described by Fibonacci.

==Algorithm for computing Engel expansions==
To find the Engel expansion of ''x'', let

:<math>u_1=x,</math>

:<math>a_k=\left \lceil \frac{1}{u_k} \right \rceil,</math>

and

:<math> u_{k+1}=u_ka_k-1</math>

where <math>\left \lceil r \right \rceil</math> is the [[floor function#The ceiling function|ceiling function]] (the smallest integer not less than ''r''). 

If <math>u_i=0</math> for any ''i'', halt the algorithm.

== Example ==
To find the Engel expansion of 1.175, we perform the following steps.

:<math>u_1 = 1.175, a_1=\left \lceil \frac{1}{1.175} \right\rceil = 1; \, </math>

:<math>u_2 = u_1a_1-1=1.175\cdot1-1=0.175, a_2=\left\lceil\frac{1}{0.175}\right\rceil=6 \, </math>

:<math>u_3 = u_2a_2-1=0.175\cdot6-1=0.05, a_3=\left\lceil\frac{1}{0.05}\right\rceil=20 \, </math>

:<math>u_4 = u_3a_3-1=0.05\cdot20-1=0 \, </math>

The series ends here. Thus,

:<math>1.175=\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{1\cdot6}+\frac{1}{1\cdot6\cdot20}</math>

and the Engel expansion of 1.175 is {1, 6, 20}.

==Engel expansions of rational numbers==

Every positive rational number has a unique finite Engel expansion. In the algorithm for Engel expansion, if ''u<sub>i</sub>'' is a rational number ''x''/''y'', then ''u''<sub>''i''+1</sub> = (&minus;''y'' mod ''x'')/''y''. Therefore, at each step, the numerator in the remaining fraction ''u<sub>i</sub>'' decreases and the process of constructing the Engel expansion must terminate in a finite number of steps. Every rational number also has a unique infinite Engel expansion: using the identity

:<math>\frac{1}{n}=\sum_{r=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+1)^r}.</math>

the final digit ''n'' in a finite Engel expansion can be replaced by an infinite sequence of (''n'' + 1)s without changing its value. For example

:<math>1.175=\{1,6,20\}=\{1,6,21,21,21,\dots\}.\;\;</math>

This is analogous to the fact that any rational number with a finite decimal representation also has an infinite decimal representation (see [[0.999...]]).

[[Paul Erdős|Erdős]], [[Alfréd Rényi|Rényi]], and Szüsz asked for nontrivial bounds on the length of the finite Engel expansion of a rational number ''x''/''y''; this question was answered by Erdős and [[Jeffrey Shallit|Shallit]], who proved that the number of terms in the expansion is O(''y''<sup>1/3 + &epsilon;</sup>) for any &epsilon; > 0.<ref>{{harvtxt|Erdős|Rényi|Szüsz|1958}}; {{harvtxt|Erdős|Shallit|1991}}.</ref>

==Engel expansions for some well-known constants==
:<math>\pi=\{1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 17, 19, 300, 1991, 2492, \dots\}\;</math> {{OEIS|id=A006784}}

:<math>e=\{1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, \dots\}\;</math> {{OEIS|id=A000027}}

And in general,

:<math>e^{1/r}-1=\{1r, 2r, 3r, 4r, 5r, 6r, \dots\}\;</math>

:<math>\sqrt{2}=\{1,3,5,5,16,18,78,102,120,144, \dots\}\;</math> {{OEIS|id=A028254}}

:<math>1=\{2,2,2,2,2, \dots\}.\;</math>

In general, an Engel expansion with constant terms is a [[geometric series]].
