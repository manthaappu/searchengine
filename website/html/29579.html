<html> <head> <title>Polynomial arithmetic</title></head><body>'''Polynomial arithmetic''' includes basic mathematical operations such as [[addition]], [[subtraction]], and [[multiplication]]. These operations are defined naturally as if the [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] <math>x</math> was an [[element (mathematics)|element]] of <math>S</math>. [[Division (mathematics)|Division]] is defined similarly, but requires that <math>S</math> be a [[Field (mathematics)|field]]. Examples of fields include [[rational numbers]], <math>Z_p</math> for <math>p</math> [[prime number|prime]], and [[real numbers]]. The set of all [[integers]] is not a field and does not support polynomial division.

==Addition and subtraction==
Addition and subtraction are performed by adding or subtracting corresponding [[coefficients]]. If

: <math>f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i; g(x) = \sum_{i=0}^m b_ix^i</math>

then addition is defined as

: <math>f(x)+g(x)= \sum_{i=0}^m (a_i+b_i)x^i </math>  where m > n

==Multiplication==
Multiplication is performed much the same way as addition and subtraction, but instead by multiplying the corresponding coefficients. If <math>f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i; g(x) = \sum_{i=0}^m b_ix^i</math> then multiplication is defined as <math>f(x)\times g(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n+m} c_ix^i</math> where <math>c_k=a_0b_k+a_1b_{k-1}+\cdots+a_{k-1}b_1+a_kb_0</math>. Note that we treat <math>a_i</math> as zero for <math>i>m</math> and that the degree of the product is equal to the [[sum]] of the degrees to the two polynomials.
