'''Baltie''' is a [[proprietary software|proprietary]] [[Educational programming language|educational]] [[computer]] [[programming language]] used as a learning aid for beginning [[programmer]]s. Most commonly used to teach younger students with little or no experience in programming. The difference between Baltie and other programming languages is that Baltie uses icons instead of written text, though in Baltie 4, C# text commands are allowed.

==Baltie's history==
Icon languages Baltie 2 and Baltie 3 were developed by [[Czech Republic|Czech]] company [[SGP Systems]] in 1996 and next version in 1999 from the language called Baltazar (1993) and are based on the [[C (programming language)|C]] language. Baltie 4 C# is already based on [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]

===Baltie 2===
Baltie 2 was the first publicly shipped version. Ran on [[Microsoft DOS]] 5.0 and allows users to build their programs using icon commands. The environment was very limited and targeted only for very young children (3+ years). Only commands like "Go", "Turn Left", "Turn Right", "Conjure" were implemented and building stand-alone executable application was not possible. The application itself was developed in SGP Systems's language called ''Baltazar'' based on C language in early 1995.

===Baltie 3===
===Baltie 4 C#===
Baltie 4 C# is an educational programming language which is a continuation of Baltie 3. As a first version of Baltie, programmers can use text commands (not only icons as in previous versions). Is based on C# language, contains [[compiler]] and [[debugger|built-in debugger]]. Also creates [[exe|executable files]] (.exe) which can be executed without Baltie IDE. Programming in Baltie is [[object oriented programming|object oriented]]. Users can choose whether they use primary icons (graphical representation of text commands like ''for'' statement or ''if'' statement) in the icon editor or text commands in the text editor. Icon commands are converted to the C# code which is compiled. Baltie contains a special window called C# code preview where user can see icon commands and correspondent C# code. This is very useful for young and kids which have no experiences with programming at all. The biggest noticeable change in Baltie 4 C# is a complete 3D environment with Baltie character (or without for mature users). Baltie 4 C# consist of following modes: 3D interactive mode with Baltie, 2D interactive mode with Baltie, 3D(2D) programming mode with Baltie, 3D(2D) programming mode, Console programming mode and C# programming mode where icons are completely hidden and model editor.
