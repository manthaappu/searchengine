'''Resampling''' is synonymous with several processes commonly used in manipulating audio, through which a segment of [[sample (signal)|sampled]] audio (often erroneously termed a sample) is manipulated before being stored back to a (possibly different) sampled format.

==Sample rate conversion==
This operation in [[digital signal processing]] involves converting a sampled signal from one [[sampling frequency]] to another without changing the period of the sample as would occur if the sampled audio was played at the new rate directly.  For instance, the output waveform of a [[digital audio workstation]] that was processed at 96 [[kHz]] must be resampled to 44.1 kHz to be placed on a [[Compact Disc]]. See [[sample rate conversion]].

==Sample depth conversion==
This operation in digital signal processing involves converting each sample of a sampled signal from one representation of amplitude to another. For instance, the output waveform of a digital audio workstation that was processed using 24 bits to represent amplitude would be resampled to 16 bits to be placed on a Compact Disc. See [[quantization (sound processing)]].

==Mixing==
The term "resampling" is often applied to short recordings completed before final [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixdown]] that are reused or substituted in the work, synonymous with bouncing as applied to [[multitrack recording]]. Such resampling was commonplace to work with the limitations of contemporary [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]] or other [[Digital audio workstation|digital audio manipulation systems]], where memory or processor use could be reduced by combining several samples that would always sound simultaneously through recording their combination to make a new sample
