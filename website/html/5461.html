'''Capistrano''' is an [[open source]] tool for running scripts on multiple servers; its main use is deploying [[web application]]s. It automates the process of making a new version of an application available on one or more [[web server]]s, including supporting tasks such as changing databases. 

Capistrano is written in the [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby language]] and is distributed using the [[RubyGems]] distribution channel. It is an outgrowth of the [[Ruby on Rails]] web application framework, but has also been used to deploy web applications written using other frameworks, including ones written in [[PHP]].

Capistrano is implemented primarily for use on the [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]] command line. Users of the ''Ruby on Rails'' framework may choose from many [[Capistrano recipes]]; e.g. to deploy current changes to the web application or roll back to the previous deployment state.

Originally called SwitchTower, the name was changed to Capistrano in March 2006 because of a trademark conflict.

The original author, Jamis Buck, announced on February 24, 2009 that he is no longer the maintainer of the project.<ref>http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2009/2/25/net-ssh-capistrano-and-saying-goodbye</ref>

== Internals ==

Capistrano is a utility and framework for executing commands in parallel on multiple remote machines, via SSH. It uses a simple [[Domain-specific programming language|Domain Specific Language]] borrowed in part from the tool [[Rake (software)|rake]].
Rake is similar to ''make'' in the [[C (programming language)|C]] world and allows you to define tasks, which may be applied to machines in certain roles. It also supports tunneling connections via some gateway machine to allow operations to be performed behind VPNs and firewalls.

Capistrano was originally designed to simplify and automate deployment of web applications to distributed environments, and originally came bundled with a set of tasks designed for deploying Rails applications. The deployment tasks are now (as of Capistrano 2.0) opt-in and require clients to explicitly put "load ‘deploy’" in their recipes. <ref>http://github.com/jamis/capistrano/tree/master/README.rdoc</ref>
