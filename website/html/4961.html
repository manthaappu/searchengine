==History==
In 2003, prior to the country’s official accession to NATO, Estonia proposed the creation of a “cyber excellence center”. The [[2006 Riga summit]] listed possible cyber attacks among the asymmetric threats to the common security and acknowledged the need for programs to protect information systems over the long term. The cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 highlighted for the first time the potential vulnerability of any NATO countries, their institutions and societies, and even NATO itself to disruption or penetration of their information and communications systems.

Estonia’s proposals for a NATO cyber excellence center received strong support from the alliance’s Secretary-General “Jaap” de Hoop Scheffer. NATO completed an assessment of the situation, partly in light of Estonia’s experience, in October 2007, and approved a NATO policy on cyber defense in January 2008. NATO’s summit communiqué in Bucharest in April announced NATO’s readiness to “provide a capability to assist allied nations, upon request, to counter a cyber attack”.
