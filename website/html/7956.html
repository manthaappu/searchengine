Since the program was written in [[UCSD Pascal]], it was easy to port to different platforms, but did so at the expense of performance, which was critical at the time of its release, given the limited amount of memory, processing power, and disk I/O available on a desktop computer.  It was soon overtaken by [[Lotus 1-2-3]], a more limited integrated software package, but one written in [[assembly language]], yielding much better performance.
