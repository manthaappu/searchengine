The Peruvian Spider monkey (Ateles ''chamek'') is a subspecies of black spider monkey that lives not only in [[Peru]], but also in [[Brazil]] and [[Bolivia]]. At two feet (0.6 m) long, they are relatively large among species of monkey, and their strong, prehensile tails can be up to three feet (1 m) long.  Unlike many species of monkey, they have virtually no thumb. Peruvian spider monkeys live in groups of up to a dozen individuals called bands. They prefer to eat fleshy fruit, and this leads them to move among habitats, but they also eat small animals, insects and leaves based on availability. Females separate from the band to give birth, typically in the fall.  Ateles ''chamek'' are independent at about 10 months, with a lifespan of about 20 years.

==Characteristics==
Ateles ''chamek'' weighs up to 20 pounds (9 kg.)<ref> Haugaasen, T., and Peres, C. Primate assemblage structure in Amazonian flooded and unflooded forests. American J of Primatology 67:243-258, 2005. </ref>.  Its body can be 24 inches (0.7 m) long and the tail can be 36 inches (1 m)long. It has four elongated fingers and virtually no thumb, which is typical for spider monkeys but unusual for other monkeys. It can move easily through the trees and it uses its tail like an extra limb. It has an agility that can only be compared to the gibbon of Asia.  It has a life span of up to 20 years.<ref> Spider Monkeys, Great Book of the Animal Kingdom, Crescent Books, Inc., ISBN 0517088010 pp. 378-379 </ref>

==Distribution ==    
The range of the Peruvian Spider monkey is not limited to Peru but also includes Bolivia and Brazil. <ref> Iwanaga, S., Ferrari S.F., 2002. Geographic distribution and abundance of woolly (Lagothrix cana) and spider (Ateles chamek) monkeys in southwestern Brazilian Amazonia. American Journal of Primotology.</ref>  They live in the jungles, occupying the canopy and the sub-canopy, and sometimes in the mountains. They live in territorial bands of 6-12 individuals whose territory covers about 20 square kilometers.<ref> Haugaasen, T., and Peres, C. Primate assemblage structure in Amazonian flooded and unflooded forests. American J of Primatology 67:243-258, 2005. </ref> Band size is somewhat seasonal,<ref> Iwanaga, S., Ferrari S.F., 2001. Party Size and Diet of Syntopic Atelids (Ateles chamek and Lagothrix cana) in Southwestern Brazilian Amazonia. </ref> probably because females separate themselves from the band for a few months to give birth, primarily in the fall. It has to contest with other spider monkeys, wooly monkeys, and howler monkeys for food and territory.<ref> Spider Monkeys, Great Book of the Animal Kingdom, Crescent Books, Inc., ISBN 0517088010 pp. 378-379 </ref>  

==Food==
The Peruvian spider monkey feeds on leaves, berries, small animals such as birds and frogs, flowers, termites, honey, grubs, and fruits. It would rather eat plant matter and insects, but when it finds them, it will eat baby birds, bird eggs, and frogs.<ref> Spider Monkeys, Great Book of the Animal Kingdom, Crescent Books, Inc., ISBN 0517088010 pp. 378-379 </ref>  In the Amazon, bands of Ateles ''chamek'' show strong seasonal variations in habitat based on the availability of fleshy fruits. <ref> Wallace, R.B.

==Growth and Reproduction==
The spider monkey has a reproductive period that can span throughout the year, though most babies are born in the fall. It has a gestation period of about 140 days. The pregnant female leaves the group to have her baby and returns 2-4 months later. The newborn spider monkey is independent at about 10 months.<ref> Spider Monkeys, Great Book of the Animal Kingdom, Crescent Books, Inc., ISBN 0517088010 pp. 378-379 </ref>  

==Similar or Related Species==
The other subspecies of black spider monkey is Ateles ''paniscus paniscus''.  It is distinguished from Ateles ''paniscus chamek'' by the number of chromosomes (2n = 32 in A.p. ''paniscus'' vs. 2n = 34 in A.p. ''chamek'') in addition to several specific chromosomal differences. The two subspecies have been interbred in captivity, resulting in offspring with reduced fertility (but not sterility).<ref> de  Boer, L.E.M., de Bruijn, M., 2005. Chromosomal distinction between the red-faced and black-faced black spider monkey (Ateles ''paniscus paniscus'' and A.''chamek''.)</ref>  There are several related species such as the Central American spider monkey or [[Geoffroy%27s_Spider_Monkey|Geoffroy’s Spider Monkey]] (A. g. ''ornatus''), and the white-bellied spider monkey (A. ''hybridus''). Both of these have a prehensile tail, a thumbless hand, and other characteristics that are found in all spider monkeys.<ref> Spider Monkey, Animal The Definitive Visual Guide to the World’s Wildlife, ISBN 0789477645 p. 123; Spider Monkeys, Great Book of the Animal Kingdom, Crescent Books, Inc., ISBN 0517088010 pp. 378-379 </ref>
