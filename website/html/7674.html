<html> <head> <title>Concurrent ML</title></head><body>'''Concurrent ML''' (CML) is a [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent]] extension of the [[Standard ML]] programming language.

==Sample Code==
Here is sample code to print "[[hello, world]]" to the console.  It spawns a [[thread (computer science)|thread]] which creates a channel for [[string (computer science)|strings]].  This thread then spawns another thread which prints the first string that is received on the channel. The former thread then sends the "hello, world\n" string on the channel. It uses [[Standard ML of New Jersey|SML/NJ]] and CML
(note that the heap name will be different on non linux-x86 platforms; you may need to change the line with "cml_test.x86-linux" to 
something different):

'''cml_test.cm''':

    '''Library'''
        '''structure''' Hello
    '''is'''
        $cml/basis.cm
        $cml/cml.cm
        cml_test.sml

'''cml_test.sml''':

    '''structure''' Hello =
    '''struct'''
        '''open''' CML
            
        '''fun''' hello () =
            '''let''' '''val''' c : string chan = channel ()
            '''in'''
                spawn ('''fn''' () => TextIO.print (recv c));
                send (c, "hello, world\n");
                exit ()
            '''end'''
            
        '''fun''' main (name, argv) =
            RunCML.doit (fn () => ignore (spawn hello), NONE)
    '''end'''

'''Running''':

    $ '''ml-build cml_test.cm Hello.main'''
