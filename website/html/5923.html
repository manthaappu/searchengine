==Biography==
Originally from New Jersey, Van Loan attended the [[University of Michigan]], where he obtained his B.S. (1969), M.A. (1970), and Ph.D (1973), all in mathematics (with the B.S. in applied mathematics).<ref>[http://www.news.cornell.edu/chronicle/99/6.17.99/VanLoan.html Cornell Chronicle: ''Charles Van Loan named chair of computer science''].</ref> His PhD dissertation was entitled "Generalized Singular Values with Algorithms and Applications" and his thesis adviser was [[Cleve Moler]].<ref>[http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=5337 Mathematics Genealogy Project: ''Charles Francis Van Loan''].</ref> Following a postdoctorate at the [[University of Manchester]], he joined the Department of Computer Science at [[Cornell University]] in 1975, and served as the Department Chair from 1999 to 2006.<ref>[http://www.siam.org/visiting/speakers/vanloan.php SIAM Visiting Lecturer Bio: ''Professor Charles Van Loan''].</ref> 

Van Loan ran the Computer Science Graduate Program from 1982-1987 at Cornell and was the Director of the Undergraduate Studies from 1994â€“1998 and 1999-2003.<ref>http://www.cs.cornell.edu/cv/biographical.htm</ref> He was awarded the Ford chair in 1998.<ref name="Statement From Chair"/>  He held the position from July 1999 to June 2006. Van Loan won the Robert Paul Advising Award in 1998, and the James and Martha D. McCormick Advising Award in 2003.<ref>[http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Information/Awards/ByEducation/index.htm Awards given to Cornell CS faculty members and researchers].</ref>  Other awards Van Loan won include the Merrill Scholar Faculty Impact Award in 1998 and 2009 and the James and Mary Tien Teaching Award, College of Engineering in 2009.<ref>http://www.cs.cornell.edu/cv/Vita.htm</ref> 
He is also known to have a pair of purple signature Nike Air Jordans.

==Books==
Van Loan's best known book is ''Matrix Computations, 3/e'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996, ISBN 978-0-8018-5414-9), written
with [[Gene H. Golub]]. He is also the author of ''Handbook for Matrix Computations'' ([[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|SIAM]], 1988, ISBN 0-89871-227-0), ''Computational Frameworks for the Fast Fourier Transform'' ([[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|SIAM]], 1992, ISBN 0-89871-285-8), ''Introduction to Computational Science and Mathematics'' (Jones and Bartlett, 1996, ISBN 0-86720-473-7), and ''Introduction to Scientific Computation: A Matrix-Vector Approach Using Matlab'' (2nd ed., Prentice-Hall, 1999, ISBN 0-13-949157-0).  His latest book is ''Insight Through Computing: A MATLAB Introduction to Computational Science and Engineering''  ([[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|SIAM]], 2009, ISBN 978-0-898716-91-7) written with K-Y Daisy Fan.<ref>http://www.amazon.com/Insight-Through-Computing-Introduction-Computational/dp/0898716918/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1290266642&sr=8-1</ref>
