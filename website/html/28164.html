'''PR/SM''' ('''Processor Resource/System Manager''') is a type-1 [[Hypervisor]] that allows multiple [[LPAR|logical partition]]s to share physical resources such as [[Central processing unit|CPU]]s, [[Channel I/O|I/O channels]] and [[direct access storage device]]s (DASD).  It is integrated with all [[IBM System z]] machines.  

[[IBM]] introduced PR/SM in 1985 with the IBM 3090-E processors.  

IBM developed the concept of [[Hypervisor]]s ([[Virtual machine|virtual machines]] in [[IBM CP-40|CP-40]] and [[CP-67]] and in 1972 provided it for the [[IBM System/370|S/370]] as Virtual Machine Facility/370<ref>{{cite manual |url=http://www.vm.ibm.com/pubs/HCSF8A50.PDF |title=z/VMâ„¢built on IBM Virtualization Technology General Information Version 4 Release 3.0 |id=GC24-5991-04 |date=2002-04-12 |first=Copyright IBM Corp. |last=1990, 2002}}</ref>. IBM introduced the Start Interpretive Execution ('''SIE''') instruction as part of 370-XA on the 3081, and VM/XA versions of [[VM (operating system)|VM]] to exploit it. PR/SM is a type-1 Hypervisor based on the CP component of [[VM (operating system)|VM/XA]] that runs directly on the machine level and allocates system resources across LPAR's to share physical resources. It is a standard feature on [[IBM System z]] machines.
