{{Hispanic and Latino Americans}}
The '''Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers''' (SHPE) was founded in [[Los Angeles, California]], in 1974 by a group of [[engineer]]s employed by the city of Los Angeles. Their objective was to form a national organization of professional engineers to serve as role models in the [[Hispanic]] community. 

[[Social networking]] was the key basis for the organization. SHPE quickly established two student chapters to begin the network that would grow to encompass the nation as well as reach countries outside the United States. Today, SHPE enjoys a strong but independent network of professional and student chapters throughout the nation.
