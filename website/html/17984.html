'''Immediate mode''' rendering is a style for [[application programming interface]]s of graphics libraries, in which client calls directly cause rendering of graphics objects to the display. It does not preclude the use of [[Multiple buffering|double-buffering]]. In contrast to [[retained mode]], lists of objects to be rendered are not saved by the API library. Instead, the application must re-issue all drawing commands required to describe the entire scene each time a new frame is required, regardless of actual changes. This method provides the maximum amount of control and flexibility to the application program.

Although drawing commands have to be re-issued for each new frame, modern systems using this method are generally able to avoid the unnecessary duplication of more memory-intensive display data by referring to that unchanging data in the relatively short drawing commands.

<!-- Link to textures, vertex buffers (in video memory) to explain last sentence? -->
