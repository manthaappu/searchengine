== Early life ==
He was born in [[Strasbourg]], [[Alsace]], and he lived in [[Breslau]] in his early childhood years. Due to political circumstances, he waited until 1946 to study Mathematics and Physics at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] in [[Munich]].

== Career ==
After graduating, he worked shortly as a high school teacher before he returned to university. He completed his doctorate degree in Physics with [[Friedrich Bopp|Fritz Bopp]] with a dissertation on a [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] problem posed by [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] related to [[Homopolar generator|Unipolar Induction]].<ref>Samelson, Klaus: ''Bemerkungen zur Theorie der Unipolarinduktion und verwandter Effekte'' (Remarks on the Theory of Unipolar Induction and Related Effects), Ph.D. thesis, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, München, 1951, Advisor: Fritz Bopp.</ref>

Dr Samelson became interested in [[Numerical analysis|Numerical Analysis]], and when Hans Piloty, an electrical engineer, and Robert Sauer, a professor of Mathematics, began working together, he joined and got involved in early computers as a research associate in the Mathematical Institute of the Technical University Munich.

This changed his scientific career. His first publications came from Sauer's interests dealing with supersonic flow and precision problems of digital computations for numerical calculations of [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|Eigenvalues]].

Soon after, Samelson's strong influence began on the development of Computer Science and Informatics as a new scientific discipline. With [[Friedrich L. Bauer]], who also had Fritz Bopp as his Ph.D. advisor, he studied the structure of programming languages in order to develop efficient algorithms for their translation and implementation. This research led to bracketed structures and it became clear to Samelson that this principle should govern the translation of programming languages and the run-time system with stack models and block structure. It was a fundamental breakthrough in how computer systems are modeled and designed.

Piloty, Bauer and Samelson had also worked on the design of [[PERM, computer|PERM]], a computer based partially on the [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]] concept. By 1955, the PERM was completed and they continued work that Bauer had begun in 1951 on concepts in automatic programming.  

Samelson played a key role in the design of [[ALGOL]] 58 and ALGOL 60.

In 1958, he accepted a chair for Mathematics at the [[University of Mainz]], and since 1963 he held a chair at the Technical University Munich where he and F.L. Bauer, began to develop a university curriculum for Informatics and Computer Science. He was involved with international standards in programming and informatics through [[International Federation for Information Processing|IFIP]]. He became an editor of the journal Acta Informatica when it began in 1971.
