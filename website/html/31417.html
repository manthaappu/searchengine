<html> <head> <title>Real-time clock alarm</title></head><body>A '''real time clock alarm''' is a feature that can be used to allow a [[computer]] to 'wake up' after shut down to execute tasks every day or on a certain day. It can sometimes be found in the 'Power Management' section of a [[motherboard]]'s [[BIOS]] setup. However, newer BIOS setups do not include an RTC alarm option, although it can still be set from within user applications. [[Wake On LAN]], [[Wake-on-ring|Wake on ring]], and [[Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface|IPMI]] functions could also be used to start a computer after it is turned off.

In [[Linux]], the real time clock alarm can be set or retrieved using /proc/acpi/alarm or /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm.<ref>http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/ACPI_Wakeup</ref>

In [[Microsoft Windows]] there are different programs which could be used to 'wake up' a computer from standby or hibernation.<ref>http://www.dennisbabkin.com/php/download.php?what=WOSB</ref> [[Task Scheduler]] settings for power management can be used to 'Wake the computer to run this task'.
