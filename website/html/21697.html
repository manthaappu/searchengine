A '''line drawing algorithm''' is a graphical [[algorithm]] for approximating a line segment on discrete graphical media. On discrete media, such as [[pixel]]-based [[computer display|display]]s and [[computer printer|printer]]s, line drawing requires such an approximation (in nontrivial cases).

On continuous media, by contrast, no algorithm is necessary to draw a line. For example, [[oscilloscope]]s use natural phenomena to draw lines and curves.

==A na&iuml;ve line-drawing algorithm==
<code>
 dx = x2 - x1
 dy = y2 - y1
 '''for''' x '''from''' x1 '''to''' x2 {
 	y = y1 + (dy) * (x - x1)/(dx)
 	plot(x, y)
 }
</code>
It is assumed here that the points have already been ordered so that <math>x_2 > x_1</math>.
This algorithm works just fine when <math>dx >= dy</math> (ie., slope is less than or equal to 1), but if <math>dx < dy</math> (ie., slope greater than 1), the line becomes quite sparse with lots of gaps, and in the limiting case of <math>dx = 0</math>, only a single point is plotted!

The na&iuml;ve line drawing algorithm is inefficient and thus, slow on a digital computer. Its inefficiency stems from the number of operations and the use of floating-point calculations. Line drawing algorithms such as [[Bresenham's line algorithm|Bresenham]]'s or [[Xiaolin Wu's line algorithm|Wu]]'s are preferred instead.

==List of line drawing algorithms==
The following is a partial list of line drawing algorithms:
*[[Digital Differential Analyzer (graphics algorithm)]] &mdash; Similar to the naive line-drawing algorithm, with minor variations.
*[[Bresenham's line algorithm]] &mdash; optimized to use only additions (i.e. no divisions or multiplications); it also avoids floating-point computations.
*[[Xiaolin Wu's line algorithm]] &mdash; can perform [[anti-aliasing]]
