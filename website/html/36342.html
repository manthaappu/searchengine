<html> <head> <title>Symbolic dynamics</title></head><body>In [[mathematics]], '''symbolic dynamics''' is the practice of modeling a topological or smooth [[dynamical system]] by a discrete space consisting of infinite [[sequence]]s of abstract symbols, each of which corresponds to a [[system state|state]] of the system, with the dynamics (evolution) given by the [[shift operator]]. Formally, a [[Markov partition]] is used to provide a [[finite cover]] for the smooth system; each set of the cover is associated with a single symbol, and the sequences of symbols result as a trajectory of the system moves from one of the covering sets to another.

== History ==
The idea goes back to [[Jacques Hadamard]]'s 1898 paper on the [[geodesic]]s on [[surface]]s of negative [[curvature]]. It was applied by [[Marston Morse]] in 1921 to the construction of a nonperiodic recurrent geodesic. Related work was done by [[Emil Artin]] in 1924 (for the system now called [[Artin billiard]]), P. J. Myrberg, [[Paul Koebe]], [[Jakob Nielsen (mathematician)|Jakob Nielsen]], [[G. A. Hedlund]]. 

The first formal treatment was developed by Morse and Hedlund in their 1938 paper. [[George Birkhoff]], Norman Levinson and M. L. Cartwright–[[J. E. Littlewood]] have applied similar methods to qualitative analysis of nonautonomous second order differential equations. 

[[Claude Shannon]] used symbolic sequences and [[shift of finite type|shifts of finite type]] in his 1948 paper ''[[A mathematical theory of communication]]'' that gave birth to [[information theory]]. 

The theory was further advanced in the 1960s and 1970s, notably, in the works of [[Steve Smale]] and his school, and of [[Yakov Sinai]] and the Soviet school of [[ergodic theory]]. A spectacular application of the methods of symbolic dynamics is [[Sharkovskii's theorem]] about [[periodic orbit]]s of a continuous map of an interval into itself (1964).

==Examples==
Concepts such as [[heteroclinic orbit]]s and [[homoclinic orbit]]s have a particularly simple representation in symbolic dynamics.

== Applications ==
Symbolic dynamics originated as a method to study general dynamical systems; now its techniques and ideas have found significant applications in [[data storage device|data storage]] and [[data transmission|transmission]], [[linear algebra]], the motions of the planets and many other areas. The distinct feature in symbolic dynamics is that time is measured in ''[[discrete time|discrete]]'' intervals. So at each time interval the system is in a particular ''state''. Each state is associated with a symbol and the evolution of the system is described by an infinite [[sequence]] of symbols &mdash; represented effectively as [[String (computer science)|strings]]. If the  system states are not inherently discrete, then the [[state vector]] must be discretized, so as to get a [[coarse-grained]] description of the system.
