'''ex.plode.us''' was a website [[search engine]] that indexed people. It was created by [http://curverider.co.uk/ Curverider], the creators of the [[Elgg (software)|Elgg]] social networking platform.<ref>[http://www.mcall.com/features/columnists/all-netizen0302mar02,0,4008357.column 'Explode' blows down barriers that separate social networks]</ref>  Ex.plode.us aggregated social data from [[43 Things]], [[flickr]], [[jaiku]], [[Live Journal]], [[tribe.net]], [[twitter]], and [[YouTube]].

Initially launched as Explode! in February 2007 <ref>[http://blogs.zdnet.com/social/?p=97 Explode, a meta-social network]</ref> as purely a [[social network]] aggregation utility and widget it was re-launched in May 2007 as a people search engine.<ref>[http://www.vecosys.com/2007/05/16/explodeus-relaunches-with-a-bang/ Ex.plode.us relaunches with a bang]</ref>

In August 2007 a [[Facebook]] version was released, taking advantage of the recently opened Facebook [[API]].<ref>[http://eduspaces.net/dtosh/weblog/191833.html Dave Tosh :: Blog :: Social search comes to Facebook via Explode]</ref><ref>[http://curverider.co.uk/blog/2007/08/30/starting-to-open-up-facebook-with-explode/ Social search comes to Facebook via Explode]</ref> However, the Facebook application did not allow ex.plode.us to aggregate information from Facebook.

In February 2008 a discussion on tribe.net dominated by tribe users who voiced privacy concerns resulted in tribe.net blocking ex.plode.us from accessing tribe users' [[FOAF]] data.<ref>[http://brainstorm.tribe.net/thread/34fb1a79-351d-4251-8318-829623c1c9cb?newpostingid=7c402919-fa8e-4ca4-8d5d-dd7a2c9b56fe#7c402919-fa8e-4ca4-8d5d-dd7a2c9b56fe What is ex.plode.us and have we been sold out? ]</ref> Individuals who were users of both ex.plode.us and tribe.net lost a great deal of their network on ex.plode.us.

As of February 2010, ex.plode.us no longer exists.

It had hacked into some YouTube users accounts to get the 'sign up name' to display with the 'user name'. Google still has searches related to this hacking.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
