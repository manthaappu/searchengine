'''Ryo Kawasaki''' ([[:ja:川崎燎|川崎燎]], Kawasaki Ryo) (born February 25, 1947) chose a career as a [[jazz fusion]] [[guitarist]] after spending some years studying as a scientist. During the 60s he played with various Japanese jazz groups and also formed his own bands. In the early 70s he came to [[New York]] where he settled and found steady work in very distinguished company, including the bands of [[Gil Evans]], [[Elvin Jones]], [[Chico Hamilton]], [[Ted Curson]] and [[Joanne Brackeen]]. In the mid-80s, Kawasaki drifted out of performing music in favour of writing music [[software]] [[Computer program|programmes]] for [[computers]]. He also produced several techno dance singles, forming his own company, Satellites Records, for their release. 

In 1991 he returned to jazz and proved to be as skilled and adept as ever on albums recorded for a Japanese [[label]] but marketed in the United States by his own company. Thanks to his long and wide experience, Kawasaki is able to switch with apparent ease between hard bop and jazz-rock. His playing is notable for its fluency and a sometimes hard-hitting style.

==Life==
===Early life (1947–1968)===

Ryo Kawasaki was born in [[Kōenji]], Tokyo while Japan was still struggling and recovering from the early post World War II period. His father Torao Kawasaki was a renowned and honored Japanese [[diplomat]] and worked for The [[Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] since 1919. Torao worked at several Japanese [[Consular]] and [[Embassies]] including San Francisco, [[Honolulu]], Fengtian (then capital of [[Manchu]], now [[Shenyang]] as city of China), [[Shanghai]] and [[Beijing]] while active as [[English teacher]] and [[translator]] for official diplomatic conferences. Ryo's mother Hiroko was also [[multilingual]] and spoke German, Russian, English, and Chinese aside from her native tongue Japanese. Hiroko grew up in [[Manchu]] and then met Torao in [[Shanghai]]. Torao was already 58 years of age when Ryo was born as an only child and these unique circumstances of Ryo's parents may already have hinted Ryo's later developments and wandering nature in international circuit as an artist.

Kawasaki's entire life has been marked by his innate inquisitiveness and powers of invention, both in music and science. While his mother encouraged him to take [[piano]] and [[ballet]] lessons, he has decided taking voice lessons and [[solfege]] at age four and [[violin]] lessons at five, and was reading music before elementary school. As a grade scholar, he began a lifelong fascination with [[astronomy]] and [[electronics]] (he built his own radios, TVs and [[music|audio]] systems including [[amplifiers]] and [[loudspeaker|speakers]] as well as [[telescopes]]). When Ryo was 10-years-old, he bought a [[ukulele]] and, at 14, he got his first [[acoustic guitar]]. The album Midnight Blue by [[Kenny Burrell]] and [[Stanley Turrentine]] inspired Ryo to study [[jazz]].

In high school he began hanging out at coffee-houses that featured live music, formed a jazz ensemble and built an [[electric organ]] that served as a primitive [[synthesizer]]. By the time he was 16, his band was playing professionally in cabarets and strip joints. Although he continued to play music regularly, he attended Nippon University, majored in [[quantum physics]] and earned his [[Bachelor of Science]] Degree. Although he has failed to prove his main interest and intuitive belief at that time, which is to prove that speed ([[propagation]]) of [[gravity]] must be much greater than [[speed of light]]. He also did some teaching and contest judging at the [[Yamaha]] musical instrument manufacturer's jazz school. Additionally he worked as a [[sound engineer]] for Japanese [[Victor Records]] and [[BGM]]/[[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] Music where he learned [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] and [[editing]].

===Early career in Japan (1969–1973)===

He recorded his first solo album for [[Polydor Records]] when he was 22. Although he continued to perform with his jazz group, and at a young age was voted the #3 [[jazz guitarist]] in a Japanese jazz [[Opinion poll|poll]], Ryo spent most of the next three years working as [[studio musician]] on everything from advertising jingles to pop songs including countless radio and TV appearances. He recorded his second album for [[Toshiba]] when he was 24. He played with [[B.B. King]] at a blues festival and also met [[George Benson]] (they jammed for five hours at Ryo's house). 

He also has recorded and worked with notable Japanese Jazz legends such as drummer Takeshi Inomata and Sound limits, saxophonist Jiro Inagaki and Soul Mates, saxophonist Keiichiro Ebisawa, saxophonist Seiichi Nakamura, pianist Masahiko Sato ([[:ja:佐藤允彦|佐藤允彦]]), saxophonist Hidehiko Matsumoto ([[:ja:松本英彦|松本英彦]]) and many others.

===Developments in New York City (1973–2002)===
====1973–1979 (as guitarist)====

In 1973, Kawasaki arrived in New York. A friend picked him up at the airport and offered him an immediate gig with [[Joe Lee Wilson]] playing at the [[Lincoln Center]] as part of the [[Newport Jazz Festival]]. Soon Ryo was jamming regularly as part of the jazz community's "loft scene", and was invited to play with [[Bobbi Humphrey]]. A few months later, Ryo walked up to his apartment and found a stranger waiting for him at his front door. It was [[Gil Evans]] and he invited Ryo to join The Gil Evans Orchestra ([[David Sanborn]], [[Howard Johnson (jazz musician)|Howard Johnson]], [[Tom Malone (musician)|Tom Malone]], [[Lew Soloff]]) which was then working on a jazz recording of [[Jimi Hendrix]] compositions. Hendrix had dreamed up the concept with Evans, but Jimi died a week before the project started in 1970. Kawasaki also played on another Gil Evans album on RCA, There Comes a Time, with [[Tony Williams]] on [[Drum kit|drums]]. Ryo rehearsed for a month with the third edition of Tony Williams' Lifetime with trio format with bassist [[Doug Rauch]] working with [[Carlos Santana]] at that time, but Tony left to spend a year in Europe before the band got the chance to perform in public.

Kawasaki followed in the footsteps of [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]], [[Gábor Szabó]] and [[Larry Coryell]] by becoming the [[guitarist]] in the [[Chico Hamilton]] Band, playing on a U.S. tour and working on various film scores that Chico recorded in [[Hollywood]]. Ryo made his debut U.S. album, Juice, in 1976 for [[RCA]] and was one of the first Japanese jazz artists to sign with a major label in the States. Sidemen on the project included [[Tom Coster]] ([[Carlos Santana]]) and [[Sam Morrison]] ([[Miles Davis]]). Kawasaki followed that recording with two more albums, ''Prism'' and ''Eight Mile Road'', for the Japanese [[record label|label]] East Wind. He also joined the [[Elvin Jones]] Band for a year-long tour of North and South America and Europe. By 1978, Kawasaki was tired of touring with other bands and returned to his own projects.

He explored [[Music of India]], learned [[ragas]] and recorded an Audio Fidelity album, Ring Toss, that combined eastern and western music. With [[Dave Liebman]] he recorded Nature's Revenge for the German [[MPS]] [[label]] and they toured Europe. Ryo also toured European jazz festivals with [[Joanne Brackeen]] as piano – guitar duo, and they recorded a pair of albums—AFT and Trinkets and Things—for Timeless Records in Holland. In Japan, [[Sony]]'s Open Sky label signed Ryo for three albums—Mirror of my Mind, Little Tree and Live—the latter, recorded in a Tokyo club, was one of the first all-digital recordings. Notable musicians participated on those recordings are : [[Michael Brecker]], [[Harvey Mason]], [[Leon Pendarvis]], [[Azar Lawrence]], [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]], [[Lincoln Goines]], [[Badal Roy]], [[Nana Vasconcelos]], [[Buddy Williams]], [[Larry Willis]] and [[Alex Blake]] to name a few. He also recorded an album called ''Sapporo'' for Swiss label America Sound in 1980 while touring Switzerland and Germany.

====1979–1990 (as inventor and programmer)====
Kawasaki invented his own [[guitar synthesizer]] in 1979, and used it to perform numerous solo shows at [[planetarium]]s from 1980 to 1983. He also formed the jazz-rock group The Golden Dragon and performed concerts regularly in the 80s. [[Fostex]] developed the first quarter- inch-tape, eight-track recorder and asked Ryo to be the first artist to use it. He recorded the album Ryo in 1981 for [[Philips Records]] and gained notoriety for creating all the music himself. He played only a nylon-string acoustic guitar with all his backing tracks created on his guitar synthesizer including the entire original [[orchestration]] of [[Joaquin Rodrigo]]'s well known [[Concierto de Aranjuez]] – [[Tempo#Basic_tempo_markings|Adagio]] movement. He did another similar recording, Lucky Lady, the next year.

When the [[Commodore 64]] computer came out with a sound-chip in it, Kawasaki became fascinated by the possibilities. He learned to write [[computer programs]] and devoted 16-hours-a-day for two years creating four [[Music video game#Free form music games|music software programs]]—''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer]]'', ''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer#Kawasaki Rhythm Rocker|Kawasaki Rhythm Rocker]]'', ''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer#Kawasaki Magical Musicquill|Kawasaki Magical Musicquill]]'', and ''[[Kawasaki Synthesizer#Kawasaki MIDI Workstation|Kawasaki MIDI Workstation]]''—distributed by Sight and Sound Music. The first three programs were for school and home use, and the last one was for professional studios. He created an all-synthesized album, Images, in 1987; and the soundtrack, Pleasure Garden, in 1990 for an [[IMAX]] film about the preservation of the Earth's endangered tropical rain forests.

From 1986 to 1990, Kawasaki produced a series of high-charting [[12 inch single|12 inch]] [[Dance music|dance]]  singles—"Electric World", "One Kiss", "No Expectations", "Say Baby I Love You", "Don't Tell Me", "Wildest Dreams", "Life is The Rhythm", "Pleasure Garden" and "Acid Heat"—that mixed free-style, house, acid house and ambient sounds. All of the production was done at his home studio, The Satellite Station, and the records were released on his own label, Satellites Records. His band and a dance troupe also performed extensively in New York dance clubs. In addition, for five years (1988 to 1993), Kawasaki was the New York producer and director of two Japanese national weekly music radio programs, "The Music Now" and "Idex Music Jam." In 1991. He also collaborated with Japanese [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] master Kicho Takano and produced "Crystallization" in 1986.

====1991–2000 (return to jazz guitarist)====
Kawasaki's musical direction took another dramatic turn when he was signed by the new jazz and adult contemporary Japanese label One Voice as an artist and [[record producer]]. Ryo's return to jazz, and his first album for the label, was the 1992 acoustic solo guitar album "[[Here, There and Everywhere]]" (released on One Voice in Japan and on Satellites Records in the U.S.). Kawasaki has produced and performed on three albums by [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] singer and [[guitarist]] [[Camila Benson]] for this label. Ryo's has continued to release a steady string of albums—the acoustic "My Reverie" (music from [[Bill Evans]], [[Debussy]], [[Ravel]] and [[Gershwin]]), the electric jazz guitar-oriented "Love Within The Universe" (which received considerable airplay across the country), "Remixes Remixes Vol. 1" (also featuring Benson), "Sweet Life" and CD releases of "Mirror of my Mind" (a jazz ensemble recording with [[Harvey Mason]], [[Michael Brecker]], [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]], Leon Pendarvis and vocalist Radha Shottam).

His another recent release "Cosmic Rhythm" in 1999 features British singer lyrisist [[Clare Foster]] along with Ryo's current rhythm section [[Victor Jones]] on Drums, [[Lincoln Goines]] on Bass. The album also features [[David Kikoski]] on Piano and [[Shunzo Ohno]] on Flugel Horn. All the songs were arranged and recorded by Ryo Kawasaki including original ten songs by Ryo himself.

During 1995–1999, three noteworthy [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] Super Stars [[Puff Daddy]], [[Kool G Rap]] and [[Keith Murray (rapper)|Keith Murray]] have recorded Ryo's original composition "[[Bamboo Child]]" on their latest albums more than twenty years later from its original recording, proving that even Ryo's old recording would perfectly match with current Hip-Hop beats and moods.

===New developments in Estonia and beyond (2000 – present)===

Ryo has released live studio trio album "Reval" in 2001, recorded in [[Tallinn]] [[Estonia]] with Estonia's leading musicians Toivo Unt on Bass, [[Aivar Vassiljev]] on Drums and Kristi Keel on [[English horn]]. 

His other projects include being a [[composer]], [[music director]] as well as [[guitarist]] for the jazz ballet "Still Point" for [[Estonia]]n National [[Opera House]] during 2000 -2002. This ballet is choreographed by [[Russell Adamson]], a native [[Jamaica]]n who resides in [[Helsinki]]. Ryo also released his third [[acoustic guitar]] solo album 'E' in 2002.  From year 2000, Kawasaki has further expanded his live appearances into Russia and [[Baltic region]] Jazz Festivals. His quartet has appeared at Rigas Ritmi Jazz Festival in [[Riga]]/[[Latvia]], [[Pori]] and other jazz festivals in Finland, [[Ukraine]], [[Lithuania]] as well as [[:ru:Саранск|Саранск]] ([[Saransk]]) Jazz Ark Festival, Saransk is a Capital of [[Mordovia]] [[Republic]] located 630 km east from Moscow. He also appeared numerous times at [[Nõmme]] Jazz Festival in [[Estonia]] while assisting the production of this jazz festival. 

Kawasaki's most recent projects during 2005–2008 include guitar trio project with American [[drummer]] [http://brianmelvin.com Brian Melvin] and Estonian [[bassist]] Toivo Unt under the name "Art of Trio" performing in variety of venues in Finland, Sweden and [[Baltic states]], and performing with Estonian [[Singing|vocalist]] Jaanika Ventsel, while touring and recording in Japan for the duo project with [[bassist]] Yoshio 'Chin' Suzuki ([[:ja:鈴木良雄|鈴木良雄]]), their new duo CD "[[Agana]]" was released in February 2007. In 2008, Ryo has formed jazz ensemble with Estonian pianist/keybordist [http://www.tonunaissoo.com Tõnu Naissoo]. Also his 2nd duo CD with Yoshio 'Chin' Suzuki ([[:ja:鈴木良雄|鈴木良雄]]) and first CD with "Art of Trio" are completed and ready to be released during 2009 while his composition "Raisins" was included on "[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]/[[GTA4]]" fusion station in 2008.
