'''Windows Marketplace for Mobile''' is a service by [[Microsoft]] for its [[Windows Mobile]] platform that allows users to browse and download applications that have been developed by third-parties.  The application are available for use directly on Windows Mobile 6.5 devices, and on personal computers.  It was announced at the 2009 [[Mobile World Congress]], and began operation on 6 October 2009, featuring an initial 246 applications.<ref name=PCworld1>[http://www.pcworld.com/article/173225/whats_inside_the_windows_mobile_marketplace.html]</ref> Initially it is available only for Windows Mobile 6.5, and was made available to all 6.x versions few weeks later.<ref>http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windowsphone/archive/2009/11/16/windows-marketplace-for-windows-mobile-6-0-and-6-1.aspx</ref> On February 15, 2010 Microsoft announced its next generation mobile platform named [[Windows Phone 7]]. With this newly redesigned platform, Microsoft will use a separate app store, called [[Windows Phone Marketplace]], for its new mobile OS, and will not share the same apps, UI, or some features of the current version for Windows Mobile 6.x because of the many differences in user interface and experience between these two platforms.

==Pricing and features==
Windows Marketplace for Mobile, available through applications for Windows Mobile and personal computers, offers a 24-hour return policy for buyers, and 70% of each application sale will be paid to developers.<ref name="giz explains">{{cite web |url=http://i.gizmodo.com/5199933/giz-explains-all-the-smartphone-mobile-app-stores |title=Giz Explains: All The Smartphone Mobile App Stores |author=Herrman, John |date=2009-04-06 |publisher=Gizmodo |accessdate=2009-04-06}}</ref> A one-time $99 USD fee for developers to list an unlimited number of paid applications or up to five free applications yearly in the store is charged by Microsoft.  After five free applications have been listed for the year, each additional free application can be listed for a $19.99 USD fee.  Microsoft accepts payment from buyers through credit cards and [[Mobile network operator|carrier]] charges.

Microsoft announced that students that are members of Microsoft's [[DreamSpark]] program can submit applications to the store for free, waiving the $99 USD fee.

Carriers also have the ability to create a [[brand]]ed section of the store to market carrier-specific applications and services for their customers.<ref name="nextgen" />

Microsoft enforces certain rules before developers can submit apps to the Marketplace.<ref>http://developer.windowsphone.com/resources/en-us/MarketplaceContentPolicies.pdf</ref> Some of these restrictions include:
