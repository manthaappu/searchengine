The VP8 makes a brightness map of whatever data it processes - white appears to be higher in elevation, black appears lower and mid-range appears between these two extremes.<ref>Bernard Ruffin, 1999, The Shroud of Turin ISBN 0879736178 page 79</ref><ref> Heller, John H. ''Report on the Shroud of Turin''. Houghton Mifflin, 1983. ISBN 0395339677 page 207</ref> The VP8 does not create 3D images, but rather creates brightness maps.  It was delivered by Schumacher to John Jackson's basement and when they processed the image through the VP8, the results they saw were extraordinary.<ref>http://shroudnm.com/vp8talk.html</ref>  Air Force Academy Professors John Jackson and Eric Jumper (future members of the [[STURP]] team) who used it to analyze the [[Shroud of Turin]] and used the data from that analysis to create a cardboard model of the Shroud.<ref>http://shroudnm.com/docs/SEAM-VP8-Presentation.pdf</ref> When the VP8 processes the data from the Shroud, the result is a 3-Dimensional image.<ref>http://ShroudNM.com (created & maintained by Andy Weiss) is the online presence of the Shroud Exhibit and Museum - SEAM (the only museum in the world where one can walk in and interact with the VP8). SEAM was created by Pete Schumacher, production engineer of the VP8 Image Analyzer</ref>  

The work of Jackson, Jumper and Schumacher prove that the image on the Shroud of Turin is encoded with 3-Dimensional data. What is most interesting about this image is that it resides on the very top 1 or 2 microfibers of the fiber. The image exists because the cellulose of these top microfibers dehydrated or aged differently than the rest of the cloth. Modern science does not understand the process by which the image on the Shroud was formed and all duplication efforts have all failed to duplicate all the peculiar properties of the Shroud of Turin image.<ref>http://shroudnm.com/docs/SEAM-VP8-Presentation.pdf</ref><ref>http://shroudnm.com/docs/SEAM-Shroud-of-Turin-Presentation.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.shroud.com/library.htm</ref>
