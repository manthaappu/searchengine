'''''Computational Linguistics''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] in the field of [[computational linguistics]]. It is published quarterly by [[MIT Press]] for the [[Association for Computational Linguistics]] (ACL). The journal includes articles, squibs and book reviews.

The journal was established as the ''American Journal of Computational Linguistics'' in 1974 by David Hays and was originally published only as [[microform|microfiche]] until 1978. George Heidorn transformed it into a print journal in 1980, with quarterly publication. In 1984 the journal was renamed ''Computational Linguistics''. Since 2009, it has become an online-only [[open access journal]], freely available to anyone.
