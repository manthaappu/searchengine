The '''[[muffin tin|muffin-tin]] approximation''' is a shape approximation of the [[potential field]] in an atomistic environment. It is most commonly employed in [[quantum mechanical]] simulations of [[electronic band structure]] in [[Solid-state physics|solids]]. The approximation was proposed by [[John C. Slater]].<ref>

In its simplest form, non-overlapping spheres are centered on the atomic positions. Within these regions, the [[Screening effect|screened potential]] experienced by an electron is approximated to be spherically symmetric about the given nucleus. In the remaining interstitial region, the potential is approximated as a constant. Continuity of the potential between the atom-centered spheres and interstitial region is enforced.

In the interstitial region of constant potential, the single electron wave functions can be expanded in terms of [[plane wave]]s. In the atom-centered regions, the wave functions can be expanded in terms of [[spherical harmonic]]s and the [[eigenfunction]]s of a radial [[Schrödinger equation]].<ref name="slater37"/><ref name="slater37a">

}}</ref> Such use of functions other than plane waves as basis functions is termed the augmented plane-wave approach (of which there are many variations). It allows for an efficient representation of single-particle wave functions in the vicinity of the atomic cores where they can vary rapidly (and where plane waves would be a poor choice on convergence grounds in the absence of a [[pseudopotential]]).
