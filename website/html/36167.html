The game was basically a graphically enhanced version of the NES and Virtual Console video game {{nihongo|''[[Gomoku Narabe Renju]]''|五目ならべ||"5 Points in a Row"}}<ref>{{cite web | url = http://kurx.net/game/gamebook/fc/JPnesHe.txt| title = Japanese title | publisher = JPNES | date = | accessdate = 2010-05-31}}</ref>. Now players can choose up to four different menu options; leading to slight variations on the game. The people who are playing the video board game actually have traditional Japanese faces attributed to them now. Names are given to these faces so the player can memorize each and every individual computer opponent. There is even a tournament mode that allows a player to go up against multiple computer opponents in a single-elimination challenge.

Players can have three options while playing: they can either look up the record scrolls (using the paper scroll icon), pause the game (by clicking on the guy who is holding out his hand), or quit the game (by using the running man icon).
