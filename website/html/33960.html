'''Serenity''' is a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] code coverage, complexity, dependency, abstractness and distance metrics library with a [[Hudson (software)|Hudson]] plugin for displaying reports. Serenity uses dynamic byte code manipulation to add coverage code to class files. Trend reports are generated and rendered in the GUI.

Serenity supports Ant and Maven projects.
