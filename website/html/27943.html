<html> <head> <title>Oxford Text Archive</title></head><body>'''Oxford Text Archive''' ('''OTA''') is an archive of electronic texts and other literary and language resources which have been created, collected and distributed for the purpose of research into literary and linguistic topics. The OTA was founded by Lou Burnard of [[Oxford University Computing Services]] in 1976, and is thought to be the oldest archive of academic textual resources in electronic form. The OTA is part of the Research Technologies Service of OUCS.

From 1996 to 2008, the OTA was one of the centres of the [[Arts and Humanities Data Service]], and hosted [[AHDS Literature, Languages and Linguistics]], a national centre for the support of digital research in literary and linguistic subject areas in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].

[[AHDS Literature, Languages and Linguistics]] was funded to provide free advice to those from [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Higher Education]] in the best practice in digital resource creation. The OTA continues to accept deposits of primary-source academic electronic editions and linguistic corpora, and is one of the key centres in the emerging European research infrastructure (CLARIN, the Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure).
