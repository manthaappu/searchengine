<html> <head> <title>Fuzzy cognitive map</title></head><body>A '''Fuzzy cognitive map''' is a [[cognitive map]] within which the relations between the elements (e.g. concepts, events, project resources) of a "mental landscape" can be used to compute the "strength of impact" of these elements. The theory behind that computation is [[fuzzy logic]]<ref>[[Bart Kosko]], ''Fuzzy Cognitive Maps'', International Journal of Man-Machine Studies, 24(1986) 65-75 (first introduction of FCMs): [http://sipi.usc.edu/~kosko/FCM.pdf] see also [http://sipi.usc.edu/~kosko/Virtual_Worlds_FCM.pdf]</ref>.
Fuzzy cognitive maps are signed fuzzy digraphs.  They may look at first blush like [[Hasse diagrams]] but they are not.
[[Spreadsheet]]s or tables are used to map FCMs into [[Matrix (Mathematics)|Matric]]es for further computation<ref>On line calculator and downloadable Java applications for FCM computations: http://www.ochoadeaspuru.com/fuzcogmap/index.php</ref><ref>Java standalone library for FCM computations: http://jfcm.megadix.it/</ref>.

A simple application of FCMs is described in a book<ref name="confusion">William R. Taylor: ''[http://www.americanconfusion.com/?p=122 Lethal American Confusion] (How Bush and the Pacifists Each Failed in the War on Terrorism)'', 2006, ISBN 0-595-40655-6 (FCM application in chapter 14)</ref> of William R. Taylor, where the war in Afghanistan and Iraq is analyzed. And in [[Bart Kosko]]'s book ''Fuzzy Thinking''<ref name="FuzzyThinking">Bart Kosko: ''Fuzzy Thinking'', 1993/1995, ISBN 0-7868-8021-X (Chapter 12: Adaptive Fuzzy Systems)''</ref>, several Hasse diagrams illustrate the use of FCMs. As an example, one FCM quoted from Rod Taber<ref name="Drugs">Rod Taber: ''Knowledge Processing with Fuzzy Cognitive Maps'', Expert Systems with Applications, vol. 2, no. 1, 83-87, 1991 ([[:de:Bild:FCMdrug520.png|Hasse diagram]] in German Wikipedia)</ref> describes 11 factors of the American cocaine market and the relations between these factors. For computations, Taylor uses pentavalent logic (scalar values out of {-1,-0.5,0,+0.5,+1}). That particular map of Taber uses trivalent logic (scalar values out of {-1,0,+1}). Taber et al.  also illustrate the dynamics of map fusion and give a theorem on the convergence of combination in a related article <ref name='Medical'>Rod Taber, Ronald R. Yager, and Cathy M.

While applications in social sciences<ref name="confusion"/><ref name="FuzzyThinking"/><ref name="Drugs"/><ref>Costas Neocleous, Christos Schizas, Costas Yenethlis: ''[http://www.congreso-info.cu/UserFiles/File/Info/Info2006/Ponencias/271.pdf Fuzzy Cognitive Models in Studying Political Dynamics  - The case of the Cyprus problem]''</ref> introduced FCMs to the public, they are used in a much wider range of applications, which all have to deal with creating and using models<ref>Chrysostomos D. Stylios, Voula C. Georgopoulos, Peter P. Groumpos: ''[http://med.ee.nd.edu/MED5/PAPERS/067/067.PDF The Use of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps in Modeling Systems]''</ref> of uncertainty and complex processes and systems. Examples:
*In business FCMs can be used for product planning<ref>Antonie Jetter: ''Produktplanung im Fuzzy Front End'', 2005, ISBN 3-8350-0144-2</ref>.
*In economics, FCMs support the use of [[game theory]] in more complex settings<ref>Vesa A. Niskanen: ''[http://www.ijicic.org/fic04-20.pdf Application of Fuzzy Linguistic Cognitive Maps to Prisoner's Dilemma]'', 2005, ICIC International pp. 139-152, ISSN 1349-4198</ref>.
*In project planning FCMs help to analyze the mutual dependencies between project resources.
*In robotics<ref name="FuzzyThinking"/><ref>Marc BÃ¶hlen: ''[http://www.realtechsupport.org/pdf/SpaceRobotics2000.pdf More Robots in Cages]'',</ref> FCMs support machines to develop fuzzy models of their environments and to use these models to make crisp decisions.
*In computer assisted learning FCMs enable computers to check, whether students understand their lessons<ref>Benjoe A. Juliano, Wylis Bandler: ''Tracing Chains-of-Thought (Fuzzy Methods in Cognitive Diagnosis)'', Physica-Verlag Heidelberg 1996, ISBN 3-7908-0922-5</ref>.
*In [[expert system]]s<ref name="Drugs"/> a few or many FCMs can be aggregated into one FCM in order to process estimates of knowledgeable persons<ref>W. B.
