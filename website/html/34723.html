Using private funding from a series of friend and family donations, savings, and small loans from the bank, Dada was able to publish the first Smarthome catalog in 1992. In February, 1995, SmartLabs' Smarthome launched one of the first e-commerce sites on the Web. By the end of the summer in 1995, Smarthome.com had a full-functioning e-basket and [[search engine]], which it continues to build upon today. The company currently has about 100 employees and offers more than 5,000 items for the customized [[automation]] of the home via their website, catalog and retail store in Irvine, CA.
