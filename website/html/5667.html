'''Ccache''' is a [[software development]] tool that caches the output of [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]] [[compiler|compilation]] so that the next time, the same compilation can be avoided and the results can be taken from the cache. This can greatly speed up recompiling time. The detection is done by [[Fingerprint (computing)|hashing]] different kinds of information that should be unique for the compilation and then using the hash sum to identify the cached output. ''Ccache'' is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]].
