<html> <head> <title>Principle of distributivity</title></head><body>The '''principle of distributivity''' states that the algebraic [[distributive law]] is [[validity|valid]] for [[classical logic]], where both [[logical conjunction]] and [[logical disjunction]] are distributive over each other so that for any [[proposition]]s ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' the [[Logical equivalence|equivalence]]s
:<math>A \land (B \lor C) \iff (A \land B) \lor (A \land C)</math>
and
:<math>A \lor (B \land C) \iff (A \lor B) \land (A \lor C)</math>
hold.

The principle of distributivity is valid in [[classical logic]], but invalid in [[quantum logic]]. The article ''[[Is logic empirical?]]'' discusses the case that quantum logic is the correct, empirical logic, on the grounds that the principle of distributivity is [[consistency|inconsistent]] with a reasonable [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretation of quantum phenomena]].
