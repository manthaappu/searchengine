'''Local Security Authority Subsystem Service''' (LSASS), is a [[Process (computing)|process]] in [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]]s that is responsible for enforcing the [[security policy]] on the system.  It verifies users logging on to a Windows computer or server, handles password changes, and creates [[access token]]s. It also writes to the [[Windows Security Log]].

Forcible termination of <tt>lsass.exe</tt> will result in the Welcome screen losing its accounts, prompting a restart of the machine.
