In [[mathematics]], in the field of [[topology]], a [[topological space]] is said to be '''pseudonormal''' if given two disjoint [[closed set]]s in it, one of which is [[countable]], there are disjoint open sets containing them. Note the following:

* Every [[normal space]] is pseudonormal.
* Every pseudonormal space is [[regular space|regular]].
