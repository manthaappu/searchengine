'''Open XML Paper Specification''' (also referred to as '''OpenXPS'''), is an open [[specification]] for a [[page description language]] and a fixed-document format originally developed by [[Microsoft]] as ''XML Paper Specification'' (''XPS'') that was later standardized by [[Ecma International]] as international standard '''ECMA-388'''. It is an [[XML]]-based (more precisely [[Extensible Application Markup Language|XAML]]-based) specification, based on a new print path and a [[color management|color-managed]] [[vector graphics|vector-based]] document format that supports [[Device Independence|device independence]] and [[resolution independence]]. OpenXPS was standardized as an [[open standard]] document format on June 16, 2009.<ref name="notes2self">{{Cite web

| title=OpenXPS - OpenXML Paper Specification
| author=Steve McGibbon (Microsoft)
| date=2009-06-17}}</ref>

==Development of the XML Paper Specification==
In 2003 [[Global Graphics]] was chosen by [[Microsoft]] to provide consultancy and proof of concept development services on XPS and worked with the Windows development teams on the specification and reference  architecture for the new format.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/665662/global_graphics_xps_reference_rip_available_from_microsoft/index.html |title=Global Graphics XPS reference |publisher=Redorbit.com |date=2006-09-21 |accessdate=2009-12-10}}</ref>

The XPS document format consists of structured XML markup that defines the layout of a document and the visual appearance of each page, along with rendering rules for distributing, archiving, rendering, processing and printing the documents. Notably, the markup language for XPS is a subset of [[XAML]], allowing it to incorporate [[vector graphics|vector-graphic]] elements in documents, using [[Extensible Application Markup Language|XAML]] to mark up the WPF primitives. The elements used are described in terms of paths and other geometrical primitives.

An XPS file is in fact a [[Unicode | Unicoded]]  [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] archive using the [[Open Packaging Conventions]], containing the files which make up the document. These include an XML markup file for each page, text, [[Odttf|embedded fonts]], raster images, 2D [[vector graphics]], as well as the [[digital rights management]] information. The contents of an XPS file can be examined simply by opening it in an application which supports ZIP files.

==Features==
XPS specifies a set of document layout functionality for paged, printable documents. It also has support for features such as [[color gradient]]s, [[transparency (graphic)|transparencies]], [[CMYK]] [[color space]]s, [[Color calibration|printer calibration]], multiple-ink systems and print [[XML schema|schemas]]. XPS supports the [[Windows Color System]] [[color management]] technology for color conversion precision across devices and higher dynamic range. It also includes a software [[Raster image processor|raster image processor (RIP)]] which is downloadable separately.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/print/RRIP.mspx |title=Reference Raster Image Processor (RIP) |publisher=Microsoft.com |date=2007-01-09 |accessdate=2009-12-10}}</ref> The print subsystem also has support for [[Indexed color|named colors]], simplifying color definition for images transmitted to printers supporting those colors.

XPS also supports [[HD Photo]] images natively for raster images.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/pix/archive/2007/03/12/hd-photo.aspx |title=HD Photo information on Microsoft Photography team blog |publisher=Blogs.msdn.com |date=2007-03-12 |accessdate=2009-12-10}}</ref> The XPS format used in the spool file represents advanced graphics effects such as 3D images, glow effects, and gradients as Windows Presentation Foundation primitives, which are processed by the printer drivers without [[rasterisation|rasterization]], preventing rendering artifacts and reducing computational load.

==Similarities with PDF and PostScript==

{{Main|Comparison of OpenXPS and PDF}}

Like [[Adobe Systems]]'s [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] format, XPS is a fixed-layout document format designed to preserve document fidelity,<ref name=XPSvsPDF>{{Cite web|last=Foley |first=Mary Jo |url=http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/operating_systems/microsoft_readies_new_document_printing_specification.html |title=Microsoft Readies New Document Printing Specification |publisher=Microsoft-watch.com |date=2005-04-25 |accessdate=2009-12-10}}</ref> providing device-independent document appearance. PDF is a database of objects, created from [[PostScript]] and also directly generated from many applications, whereas XPS is based on XML. Both formats are [[lossless data compression|compressed]], albeit using different methods. The filter pipeline architecture of XPS is also similar to the one used in printers supporting the PostScript page description language. PDF includes dynamic capabilities not supported by the XPS format.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amyuni.com/blog/?p=8 |title=Comparison of PDF, XPS and ODF by an ISV providing PDF solutions |publisher=Amyuni.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-10}}</ref>

==Viewing and creating XPS documents==
XPS is supported on several versions of Windows.

Because the printing architecture of Windows Vista uses XPS as the spooler format,<ref name="XPSvsPDF" /> it has native support for generating and reading XPS documents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/features/details/xps.mspx |title=XPS Documents in Windows Vista |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-10}}</ref> XPS documents can be created by printing to the [[virtual printer|virtual]] XPS [[printer driver]]. The XPS Viewer is installed by default in [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]]. The viewer is hosted within [[Internet Explorer]] in Windows Vista, but is a native application in Windows 7. The IE-hosted XPS viewer and the XPS Document Writer are also available to [[Windows XP]] users when they download the [[.NET Framework]] 3.0. The IE-hosted viewer supports [[digital rights management]] and [[digital signature]]s. Users who do not wish to view XPS documents in the browser can download the XPS Essentials Pack,<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=b8dcffdd-e3a5-44cc-8021-7649fd37ffee&displaylang=en Download details: XPS Essentials Pack Version 1.0] Microsoft XML Paper Specification Essentials Pack</ref> which includes a standalone viewer and the ''XPS Document Writer''. The ''XPS Essentials Pack'' also includes providers to enable the IPreview and [[IFilter]] capabilities used by [[Windows Search|Windows Desktop Search]], as well as shell handlers to enable thumbnail views and file properties for XPS documents in [[Windows Explorer]].<ref name="XPSEP">{{Cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/xps/viewxps.mspx |title=View and generate XPS |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-10}}</ref> The ''XPS Essentials Pack'' is available for Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Vista.<ref name="XPSEP"/> Installing this pack enables operating systems prior to Windows Vista to use the XPS print processor{{Clarify|date=May 2009}}, instead of the GDI-based WinPrint{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}, which can produce better quality prints for printers that support XPS in hardware (directly consume the format).<ref>[http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/c/5/9c5b2167-8017-4bae-9fde-d599bac8184a/XPSDrv_FilterPipe.doc XPSDrv Filter Pipeline: Implementation and Best Practice]{{Dead link|date=December 2009}}</ref> The [[print spooler]] format on these operating systems when printing to older, non-XPS-aware printers, however, remains unchanged.

Windows 7 contains a standalone version of the XPS viewer that supports digital signatures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/xps/viewxps.mspx |title=View and Generate XPS |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-10}}</ref>

==Licensing==
In order to encourage wide use of the format, Microsoft has released XPS under a royalty-free patent license called the ''Community Promise for XPS'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/xps/xpscommunitypromise.mspx |title=Community Promise for XPS |publisher=Microsoft.com |date=2007-01-31 |accessdate=2009-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/xps/xpscommunitypromisefaq.mspx |title=Community Promise for XPS FAQs |publisher=Microsoft.com |date=2007-01-31 |accessdate=2009-12-10}}</ref> allowing users to create implementations of the specification that read, write and render XPS files as long as they include a notice within the source that technologies implemented may be encumbered by patents held by Microsoft. Microsoft also requires that organizations "engaged in the business of developing (i) scanners that output XPS Documents; (ii) printers that consume XPS Documents to produce hard-copy output; or (iii) print driver or raster image software products or components thereof that convert XPS Documents for the purpose of producing hard-copy output, [...] will not sue Microsoft or any of its licensees under the XML Paper Specification or customers for infringement of any XML Paper Specification Derived Patents (as defined below) on account of any manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, importation or other disposition or promotion of any XML Paper Specification implementations."  The specification itself is released under a royalty-free copyright license, allowing its free distribution.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/xps/xpslicense.mspx#EIB XML Paper Specification Licensing], Microsoft. Retrieved on June 8, 2006.</ref>

==Standardization==
Microsoft submitted the XPS specification to [[Ecma International]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Reimer |first=Jeremy |url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070701-microsoft-submits-pdf-competitor-to-standards-body.html |title=War and PDF: Microsoft submits XPS to standards body |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=2007-07-01 |accessdate=2009-12-10}}</ref>

In June 2007 Ecma International Technical Committee 46 (TC46) was set up to develop a standard based on the Open XML Paper Specification (OpenXPS).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC46.htm |title=TC46 - XML Paper Specification (XPS) |publisher=Ecma-international.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-10}}</ref>

At the 97th General Assembly held in [[Budapest]], June 16, 2009, Ecma International approved Open XML Paper Specification (OpenXPS) as an Ecma standard (ECMA-388).<ref name="notes2self" />
