'''Amy Hennig''' (born 1964/65)<ref name=LATimes>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-himi7-2010feb07,0,7109862.story|title=How I Made It: Amy Hennig|last=Fritz|first=Ben|date=7 February 2010|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=26 February 2010}}</ref> is a video game director and [[screenwriter|script writer]] currently employed by video game company [[Naughty Dog]]. She began her work in the industry on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], making her design debut with ''[[Michael Jordan: Chaos in the Windy City]]''. She soon went to work for [[Crystal Dynamics]], working primarily on the ''[[Legacy of Kain]]'' series. With Naughty Dog, her work has been on two primary series: the ''[[Jak and Daxter]]'' series and the ''[[Uncharted]]'' series.

With her writing style, Hennig believes that the creative direction of a script holds more importance than the graphics of the game. She has been called one of the most influential women in the [[video game industry]] by ''[[Edge magazine]]'', and has been cited as an example of how more women are becoming involved in a previously male dominated field.

==Life==
Three events in Hennig's life greatly influenced her later work; all happened in 1977. The release of the [[Atari 2600]], ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'', and ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' changed how games and entertainment in general would be developed.<ref name=LATimes/>

Hennig graduated from [[University of California, Berkeley]] with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[English literature]].<ref name=LATimes/> She went on to the film school at [[San Francisco State University]], when she was hired as an artist for an [[Atari]] game called [[ElectroCop]].<ref name=LATimes/> Her work on the game made her realize that the video game industry interested her more than the [[film industry]]; she dropped out of film school soon after.<ref name=LATimes/> Hennig claims that her literature degree and film studies have helped her work: "Everything I learned as an undergraduate with English literature and in film school about editing and shots and the language of film has come into play, but in a way I couldn't possibly have planned."<ref name=LATimes/>

==Writing style==
Hennig believes the term [[platformer]] is outdated and misused with many modern games, preferring a different term like "traversal" for some.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2007/11/19/naughty-dog-we-need-a-new-word-for-platformer/|title=Naughty Dog: We Need A New Word For "Platformer"|last=John|first=Tracey|date=19 November 2007|publisher=MTV Multiplayer Blog. [[MTV]]|accessdate=1 February 2010}}</ref> She also feels that focusing too much on graphics can inhibit a game, saying that once game writers focus on creative expression, video games will greatly improve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3160325|title=The Future of Games|last=Ashley|first=Robert|date=18 June 2007|publisher=[[1UP.com]]. [[UGO Networks]]|accessdate=1 February 2010}}</ref>

She often uses supporting characters to highlight personality aspects of other characters through interactions within the script. For example, [[Chloe Frazer]] acts as a foil for [[Nathan Drake (character)|Nathan Drake]], highlighting the darker aspects of his personality and past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/uncharted-2-among-thieves-launch-interview|title=Uncharted 2: Among Thieves |last=Purchese|first=Robert|date=16 October 2009|publisher=[[Eurogamer]].
