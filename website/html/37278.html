[[Image:The Elements of Programming Style.jpg|200px|thumb|Cover of the second edition]]
'''''The Elements of Programming Style''''', by [[Brian W. Kernighan]] and [[P. J. Plauger]], is a study of [[programming style]], advocating the notion that computer programs should be written not only to satisfy the compiler, but also with human readers in mind (especially [[software maintenance]] engineers).

The book pays explicit homage, in title and tone, to ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', by [[William Strunk Jr.|Strunk]] & [[E. B. White|White]].

The book is built on short examples from actual, published programs in programming textbooks. Its advice is therefore delivered not in an academic or pedagogical vacuum, but rather in the context of examples which are believable and realistic, sometimes uncomfortably so. The style is diplomatic and generally sympathetic in its criticism, and unabashedly honest as well&mdash; some of the examples with which it finds fault are from the authors' own work (one example in the second edition is from the first edition).

Its lessons are summarized at the end of each section in pithy maxims, such as "Let the machine do the dirty work."

Modern readers may find it a shortcoming that its examples use older [[procedural programming languages]] ([[Fortran]] and [[PL/I]]) which are quite different from those popular today. (Few of today's popular languages had been invented when this book was written.) However, many of the book's points that generally concern stylistic and structural issues that transcend the idiosyncrasies of particular languages.
