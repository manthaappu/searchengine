'''Identity Management Theory''' (also frequently referred to as IMT) is an [[intercultural communication]] theory from the 1990s. It was developed by [[William R. Cupach]] and Tadasu Todd Imahori on the basis of Erving Goffman's ''Interaction ritual: Essays on face-to-face behavior'' (1967). Cupach and Imahori distinguish between intercultural [[communication]] (speakers from different [[culture]]s) and intracultural communication (speakers sharing the same culture).

To understand IMT, it is important to be familiar with Cupach and Imahori's view of [[Cultural identity|identities]]. Among the multiple identities which an individual possesses, cultural and relational identities are regarded as essential to IMT.

Cupach and Imahori claim that presenting one's [[face]] shows facets of an individual's identity. Whether an interlocuter is able to maintain face or not, reveals his or her interpersonal [[Metacommunicative competence|communication competence]]. The use of [[stereotype]]s in intercultural conversations often results from the ignorance of each other's culture; the application of stereotypes, however, is face threatening. Being able to manage the resulting tensions, is part of intercultural communication competence. For becoming competent in developing intercultural relationships, the following three phases have to be passed: 
# "trial and error": act of looking for similar aspects in certain identities. 
# "mixing up" the communicators' identities to achieve a relational identity acceptable for both participants
# renegotiating the distinctive cultural identities with the help of the relational identity that was created in phase 2
Cupach and Imahori call these phases "cyclical" as they are gone through by intercultural communicators for each aspect of their identities.
