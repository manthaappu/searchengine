'''''Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill''''' is a controversial book by [[Robert Whitaker (author)|Robert Whitaker]] published in 2002 which is highly critical of the psychiatric profession.<ref name=gold>{{cite news|author=Goldman, Larry S., MD|title=Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill|date=May 13, 2002|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/432570;meddomainjsession=1GGGMVcK9Gdtv5HnhvMtgmNBKgB01VrvRTNd9LPrZ1tlRpRGCMCB!-1300228618|work=MedScape Today|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=November 6, 3010}}</ref> Problems with many historical aspects of treatment, as well as [[antipsychotic]]s, are covered. The book received mixed reviews within the medical literature, which noted issues of bias in sourcing but nonetheless felt the discussion of social issues in psychiatry was important. The book received some better reviews from the lay press.

Whitaker, a medical journalist who was a finalist for a 1999 Pultizer Prize,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/1999-Public-Service|year=1999|title=The 1999 Pulitzer Prize Winners: Public Service|publisher=The Pulitzer Prizes|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}</ref> has never suffered mental illness himself.<ref name=WNET /> He told [[WNET]] that members of his extended family have suffered it, a situation he believes he shares with most Americans.<ref name=WNET>{{cite audio|people=Nikolchev, Alexandra|title=Manufacturing mental illness|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/uncategorized/manufacturing-mental-illness/1787/|date=June 29, 2010|publisher=WNET via Public Broadcasting Service (PBS): Need to Know|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref>

==Synopsis==
===Part One: The Original Bedlam (1750–1900)===
Part One describes early treatments like a spinning chair which could reach 100 revolutions per minute, the Tranquilizer Chair which immobilized patients, and water therapies.<ref name="Whitaker_2010">{{cite book | author = Whitaker, Robert H. | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill | edition = | language = | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | year = 2010 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 0-465-02014-3 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>{{rp|12–13, 16}} Whitaker then describes [[moral treatment]], dating back to 1793 and the French Revolution and established in the U.S. by Quakers in 1817, in which lay superintendents treated the mentally ill in small homes and with great kindness and good outcomes: About 35 to 80 percent of patients were discharged within a year, the majority of them cured. [[Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital|Pennsylvania Hospital]] reported that about 45 percent of patients were discharged as cured and 25 percent discharged as improved. In [[Worcester State Hospital]], 35 percent were chronically ill or had died while mentally ill.<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|36}} Dr. George Wood, a visitor, reported in 1851:

{{cquote|"...you encounter persons walking, conversing, reading or variously occupied, neatly and often handsomely dressed, to whom as you pass you receive an introduction as in ordinary social life; and you find yourself not unfrequently quite at a loss to determine whether the persons met with are really the insane, or whether they may not be visitors or officials in the establishment."<ref>Morton, ''History of Pennsylvania Hospital'', p. 172, cited in Whitaker, p. 20</ref>}}

===Part Two: The Darkest Era (1900–1950)===
Part Two describes the rise of [[eugenics]] which did away with moral treatment in favor of forced [[sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] of the mentally ill, and led to newly invigorated fields of [[psychiatry]] and [[neuroscience]] whose experts practiced [[Hypoglycemia|insulin coma]], [[Pentylenetetrazol|metrazol]] convulsion, forced [[electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock]], and [[lobotomy]].<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|136}}

===Part Three: Back to Bedlam (1950–1990s)===
[[File:Chlorpromazine-3D-balls.png|thumb|[[Chlorpromazine]], marketed in the U.S. as [[Thorazine]], was first synthesized by [[Rhône-Poulenc]] in 1950.<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|142}}]]
Part Three describes the invention of the [[Antipsychotic|neuroleptic]] drug [[chlorpromazine]] (Thorazine) by [[Rhône-Poulenc]] in France, and its purchase by Smith, Kline & French (today known as [[GlaxoSmithKline]]). The drug "produced an effect similar to frontal lobotomy", according to early reports by the company's lead investigator.<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|154–55}}  Whitaker says that pharmaceutical advertising, articles published in the scientific literature, and stories in the media of "miracle drugs" transformed Thorazine into a ''healing'' drug.<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|158}}

Whitaker says that marketing money from pharmaceutical companies began to flow to the [[American Medical Association]] in 1951, a year after Thorazine was synthesized, because of the [[Durham-Humphrey Amendment]] to the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] which "greatly expanded the list of medications that could only be obtained with a doctor's prescription".<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|148–149}}

In Part Three, Whitaker also describes the American (but not for example [[United Kingdom|British]]) propensity to classify patients as "schizophrenic", as well as the error (confusion of [[schizophrenia]] with the yet-to-be-discovered [[encephalitis lethargica]]) in the original classification by [[Emil Kraepelin]] which psychiatry chose to not revisit and fix.<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|167,169}} Whitaker then describes three pathways that [[dopamine]] may take in the human brain, and quotes first-person accounts of the effects of antipsychotic drugs on individuals.<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|162–164,176–187}}

He calls a 1996 ''New York Times'' advertisement by a consortium of pharmaceutical companies a "bald-faced lie": the group sought to say that the cause of psychosis and schizophrenia is an abnormal dopamine level and that their drugs worked by altering the level of dopamine.<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|199}} Whitaker then criticizes some American studies, and points out the work of George Crane at the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] to get [[tardive dyskinesia]] recognized, and he contrasts the dosages that [[United Kingdom|British]] doctors were comfortable in prescribing (300 milligrams per day of Thorazine) with what American psychiatrists prescribed (1,500 up to perhaps 5,000 milligrams per day).<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|200–202,204–209}}

He sees irony in the fact that ''The New York Times'' reported on Soviet forced use of neuroleptic drugs (which Florida Senator Edward Gurney called "chemicals which covert human beings into vegetables") in "psychiatric jails" but called the same drugs "widely acknowledged to be effective" when reporting on American schizophrenic patients.<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|216–218}}

Whitaker describes the demise of modern-day moral treatment in a short history of Loren Mosher's [[Soteria Project]], funded by the U.S. while Mosher was chief of schizophrenia at NIMH.<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|226}} He attributes the results in a [[World Health Organization]] 1979 study of outcomes for schizophrenia patients (which found better outcomes in undeveloped countries like [[India]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Colombia]] than in developed countries like the [[United States]], [[England]], [[Denmark]], [[Ireland]], [[Russia]], [[Czecholslovakia]] and [[Japan]]) to doctors in the developed world who maintained their patients on medications.<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|226–229}}

He then describes fifty years of American scientists doing experiments on schizoprenia patients: to intentionally exacerbate their symptoms and study the results. He compares the doctors' behavior, unfavorably, to 1947 after American trials of Nazi doctors ended in the [[Nuremberg Code]] for ethics in human experimentation.<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|235,247}}

===Part Four: Mad Medicine Today (1990s–Present)===
Part Four is Whitaker's description of drug trials for the newer [[atypical antipsychotic]]s. He says that many of these trials were stacked in favor of the drug being proposed by eliminating the [[placebo]], or by comparing multiple doses of the new drug against a single, very high dose of the old one.<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|273–274}} He says that the pharmaceutical companies and the press used their influence to make claims for these drugs (some claims that the [[Food and Drug Administration]] had explicitly asked them not to make).<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|227}} [[Risperidone]] and [[olanzapine]], for example, were both claimed to have fewer side effects than the first generation of antipsychotics. Whitaker also tells the stories of patients whose deaths were caused by drug trials but were not mentioned to the public.<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|269–272}}

===Epilogue===
Whitaker calls it a type of medical fraud that we tell schizophrenics that they suffer from too much dopamine or [[serotonin]] activity and that drugs put these brain chemicals back in "balance".<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|290}} He writes, "Little is known about what causes schizophrenia. Antipsychotic drugs do not fix any known brain abnormality, nor do they put brain chemistry back into balance. What they do is alter brain function in a manner that diminishes certain characteristic symptoms....".<ref name="Whitaker_2010"/>{{rp|291}}

==Reception==
===Lay press===
The [[American Library Association]] decided the book was one of the best histories of 2002.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' magazine placed it among the year's best science books.<ref>{{cite news|title=Reviews|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2002/may/featreviews|date=May 2002|publisher=Kalmbach Publishing|work=Discover|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref> Recognizing Whitaker for marshalling evidence, a reviewer writing for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' thought his hopes for moral treatment were admirable but inadequate.<ref>{{cite news|author=Saltzman, Jonathan|title=How the mentally ill have been treated----and mistreated----in America|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-03-24/entertainment/0203230067_1_insanity-defense-illness-mclean-hospital/|publisher=The Institute for Public Affairs|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref> Writers for ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' and ''[[In These Times]]'' both liked the book but wondered why the author didn't mention [[Thomas Szasz]], a critic of psychiatry.<ref>{{cite news|author=Schlesinger, Judith|title='Mad in America': beware chemistry|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-02-10/entertainment/0202110268_1_robert-whitaker-mad-treatments|date=February 10, 2002|publisher=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Pechina, Edit M.|title=The Cuckoo's Nest|url=http://www.inthesetimes.com/issue/26/16/culture2.shtml|date=June 7, 2002|publisher=The Institute for Public Affairs|work=In These Times|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref>

===Psychiatry responds===
''Mad in America'' stirred some emotions in the medical profession. [[Richard Bentall]] writes that one of his physician friends "felt as bruised as a sinner who had been denounced by a strident evangelical preacher" upon reading Whitaker's ''Mad in America.''<ref name="isbn0-8147-9148-4">{{cite book | author = Bentall, Richard P. | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Doctoring the Mind: Is Our Current Treatment of Mental Illness Really Any Good? | edition = | language = | publisher = NYU PRESS | location = | year = 2009 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 0-8147-9148-4 | oclc = | doi = | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=V2ahyDKjMykC&pg=PR15 | accessdate = }}</ref>

David Pilgrim, writing "News of scandal is a few decades too late" for ''[[Times Higher Education]],'' focuses on the book's shortcomings, saying, "The semi-academic froth he generates distracts the reader from a legitimate outrage, which is not his alone. It was shared by many others well before 1998" (the year Whitaker began writing on mental health).<ref>{{cite news|author=Pilgrim, David|title=News of scandal is a few decades too late|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=180204&sectioncode=30|date=October 3, 2003|publisher=TSL Education|work=Times Higher Education|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}</ref>

Physician Larry S. Goldman wrote a highly critical review of the book in ''[[Medscape|Medscape Today]],'' stating that it "looks as if it were commissioned by [[Scientology and psychiatry|Scientologists]]."<ref name=gold/> Goldman writes that Whitaker "is ready to throw the baby out with the bath water" because ''Mad in America'' fails to acknowledge any [[Schizophrenia#Neural|biological abnormalities in schizophrenia]] despite the considerable literature in this area, while at the same conceding that Whitaker's argument that the true [[causes of schizophrenia]] are not known is correct. Goldman also writes that the book promotes something akin to a [[conspiracy theory]] "because it strings together many decades of disparate flops into a unifying theme of ongoing catastrophe." Goldman concludes that the "overheated style" of the book "tends to undermine some of its more important points, such as the unhealthy symbiosis between the US pharmaceutical industry and much of the psychiatric research community and the ever-present miserliness of public mental healthcare systems."<ref name=gold/>

Clinical psychologist Claudia Bukszpan Rutherford similarly acknowledges the book's insight into many of the problems of clinical psychiatry over the years has good points, but is hampered by the author's extreme position and lack of investigation into what improves the prognosis of schizophrenia in underdeveloped countries. She adds that his minimizing of the severity and impact of the illness itself takes away from criticism of treatment.<ref>{{cite journal| author= Rutherford, Claudia B. |year=2002|title=Review of Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill by Robert Whitaker|journal=Human Nature Review|volume=2|pages=95–98|accessdate=8 Noivember 2010|url=http://www.human-nature.com/nibbs/02/mia.html}}</ref>

The book was also reviewed in ''[[JAMA]]'', where reviewer Daniel J. Luchins, MD, of the University of Chicago observed the review of scientific literature to be biased at times. He noted the book omitted a key five year follow up study published in 1981 by May and colleagues,<ref name=Jama>{{cite news|title=Review: Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/extract/287/23/3149/|year=2002|publisher=American Medical Association|work=JAMA|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}</ref> which showed some benefits from treatment with antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia.<ref name="pmid6113821">{{cite journal | author = May PR, Tuma AH, Dixon WJ, Yale C, Thiele DA, Kraude WH | title = Schizophrenia.

Psychiatry | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 776–84 | year = 1981 | month = July | pmid = 6113821 | doi = | url = | issn = }}</ref> Despite this, Luchins concluded the book was of value in highlighting social aspects of treatment in psychiatry.<ref name=Jama/>

Physician J. van Gijn, reviewing the book for the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]],'' writes that "the book is more of an indictment than a historical account," and starts by pointing out that Whitaker "virtually equates mental illness with schizophrenia; depression and other psychiatric disorders are mentioned only parenthetically." Van Gijn summarizes the pre-1950 coverage of the book without much commentary, but then criticizes the rest of the book. Specifically, he questions Whitaker's assertion that Kraepelin's schizophrenia patients in fact suffered from [[encephalitis lethargica]]. With regard to antipsychotic medication, van Gijn notes that "Although there may be truth in the notion that dosages of antipsychotic drugs in the United States are higher than necessary, the author weakens his position by issuing continuous and unrelenting condemnations (for instance, “The [[Nuremberg Code]] doesn't apply here”), despite a dearth of evidence to support them." Van Gijn then describes Whitaker's attack on the [[dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia]] as "simplistic reasoning," and concludes that "Although [Whitaker] is widely read on the subject, the facts are largely arranged to suit his prejudice, especially in the chapters on drug treatment. American psychiatric institutions may have their failings in the current management of patients with schizophrenia, but they deserve better critics."<ref>{{cite doi|10.1056/NEJM200206273462620}}</ref>

In a rejoinder to Goldman's review, physician Nathaniel S. Lehrman disagrees with Goldman, and writes that "Whitaker is right," and goes on to agree with the main points in the book, namely that [[antipsychotic]] drugs cause [[brain damage]], that despite "psychiatrically produced misconceptions," they "do not fix any known brain abnormality nor do they put brain chemistry back into balance. What they do is alter brain functions in a manner that diminishes certain characteristic symptoms." Lehrman then writes that all the data accumulated on the neurobiology of schizophrenia "has hardly helped patient care."<ref>{{cite news|author=Lehrman, Nathaniel S., MD|title=Reply to Dr. Larry S.
