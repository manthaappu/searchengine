<html> <head> <title>Megamax C</title></head><body>'''''Megamax C''''' was a [[K&R]] implementation of C for the Atari ST, Apple IIGS (APW C) and Macintosh computers. The package included a [[one-pass compiler]], resource construction kit and documentation. It allowed [[68000]] assembly language to be mixed with the [[C programming language|C]] code.

It had bugs, notably not implementing [[tail recursion]] properly, but was one of the faster development tools for the [[Atari ST]], due to built-in [[cache|caching]] of disk files.

Megamax C was written by Michael Bunnell and Eric Parker.  Megamax C was superseded by ''Laser C''.
