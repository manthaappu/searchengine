<html> <head> <title>Process capability index</title></head><body>In [[process improvement]] efforts, the '''process capability index''' or '''process capability ratio''' is a statistical measure of [[process capability]]: The ability of a process to produce output within [[Specification (technical standard)|specification]] limits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section1/pmc16.htm|title=What is Process Capability?|accessdate=2008-06-22|work=[http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/index.htm NIST/Sematech Engineering Statistics Handbook]|publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]}}</ref>  The concept of process capability only holds meaning for processes that are in a state of [[statistical control]].  Process capability indices measure how much [[Common-cause and special-cause|"natural variation"]] a process experiences relative to its specification limits and allows different processes to be compared with respect to how well an organization controls them.

If the upper and lower [[Specification (technical standard)|specification]] limits of the process are USL and LSL, the target process mean is T, the estimated mean of the process is <MATH>\hat{\mu}</MATH> and the estimated variability of the process (expressed as a [[standard deviation]]) is <MATH>\hat{\sigma}</MATH>, then commonly-accepted process capability indices include:

<MATH>\hat{\sigma}</MATH> is estimated using the [[Unbiased estimation of standard deviation|sample standard deviation]].

==Recommended values==
Process capability indices are constructed to express more desirable capability with increasingly higher values.  Values near or below zero indicate processes operating off target (<MATH>\hat{\mu}</MATH> far from T) or with high variation.

Fixing values for minimum "acceptable" process capability targets is a matter of personal opinion, and what consensus exists varies by industry, facility, and the process under consideration.  For example, in the automotive industry, the AIAG sets forth guidelines in the [[Production Part Approval Process]], 4th edition for recommended C<SUB>pk</SUB> minimum values for critical-to-quality process characteristics.  However, these criteria are debatable and several processes may not be evaluated for capability just because they have not properly been assessed.

Since the process capability is a function of the specification, the Process Capability Index is only as good as the specification . For instance, if the specification came from an engineering guideline without considering the function and criticality of the part, a discussion around process capability is useless, and would have more benefits if focused on what are the real risks of having a part borderline out of specification. The loss function of [[Taguchi methods|Taguchi]] better illustrates this concept.

It should be noted though that where a process produces a characteristic with a capability index greater than 2.5, the unnecessary precision may be expensive<ref>{{Cite book| author=Booker, J. M.; Raines, M.; Swift, K. G. | title=Designing Capable and Reliable Products | date=2001 | publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]] | location=[[Oxford]] | isbn=9780750650762 | oclc=47030836}}</ref>.

==Relationship to measures of process fallout==
The mapping from process capability indices, such as C<SUB>pk</SUB>, to measures of process fallout is straightforward.  Process fallout quantifies how many defects a process produces and is measured by [[Defects per million opportunities|DPMO]] or [[Parts-per notation|PPM]].  Process yield is, of course, the complement of process fallout and is approximately equal to the area under the [[probability density function]] <MATH>\Phi(\sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\sigma}^\sigma e^{-t^2/2} \, dt</MATH> if the process output is approximately [[normally distributed]].

In the short term ("short sigma"), the relationships are:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! C<SUB>pk
! Sigma level (σ)
! Area under the [[probability density function]] <MATH>\Phi(\sigma)</MATH>
! Process yield
! Process fallout (in terms of DPMO/PPM)

|-

|-
| 2.00 || 6 || 0.9999999980 || 99.9999998% || 0.002
|}
In the long term, processes can shift or drift significantly (most [[control chart]]s are only sensitive to changes of 1.5σ or greater in process output), so process capability indices are not applicable as they require [[statistical control]].

==Example==
Consider a quality characteristic with target of 100.00 [[Micrometre|μm]] and upper and lower specification limits of 106.00 μm and 94.00 μm respectively.  If, after carefully monitoring the process for a while, it appears that the process is in control and producing output predictably (as depicted in the [[run chart]] below), we can meaningfully estimate its mean and standard deviation.
[[File:ProcessCapabilityExample.svg]]

If <MATH>\hat{\mu}</MATH> and <MATH>\hat{\sigma}</MATH> are estimated to be 98.94 μm and 1.03 μm, respectively, then
{| class="wikitable"
 ! Index
|-
| <MATH>\hat{C}_p = \frac{USL - LSL} {6 \hat{\sigma}} = \frac{106.00 - 94.00} {6 \times 1.03} = 1.94</MATH>
|-
| <MATH>\hat{C}_{pk} = \min \Bigg[ {USL - \hat{\mu} \over 3 \hat{\sigma}}, { \hat{\mu} - LSL \over 3 \hat{\sigma}} \Bigg] = \min \Bigg[ {106.00 - 98.94 \over 3 \times 1.03}, { 98.94 - 94 \over 3 \times 1.03} \Bigg] = 1.60</MATH>
|-
| <MATH>\hat{C}_{pm} = \frac{ \hat{C}_p } { \sqrt{ 1 + \left ( \frac{\hat{\mu} - T} {\hat{\sigma}} \right )^2 } } = \frac{ 1.94 } { \sqrt{ 1 + \left ( \frac{98.94 - 100.00} {1.03} \right )^2 } } = 1.35</MATH>
|-
| <MATH>\hat{C}_{pkm} = \frac{ \hat{C}_{pk} } { \sqrt{ 1 + \left ( \frac{\hat{\mu} - T} {\hat{\sigma}} \right )^2 } } = \frac{ 1.60 } { \sqrt{ 1 + \left ( \frac{98.94 - 100.00} {1.03} \right )^2 } } = 1.11</MATH>
|}

The fact that the process is running about 1σ below its target is reflected in the markedly different values for C<SUB>p</SUB>, C<SUB>pk</SUB>, C<SUB>pm</SUB>, and C<SUB>pkm</SUB>.
