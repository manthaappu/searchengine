<html> <head> <title>Krylov subspace</title></head><body>In [[linear algebra]], the order-''r'' '''Krylov subspace''' generated by an ''n''-by-''n'' matrix ''A'' and a vector ''b'' of dimension ''n'' is the [[linear subspace]] [[Linear span|spanned]] by the images of ''b'' under the first ''r'' powers of ''A'' (starting from <math>A^0=I</math>), that is,
::<math>\mathcal{K}_r(A,b) = \operatorname{span} \, \{ b, Ab, A^2b, \ldots, A^{r-1}b \}. \, </math>

It is named after Russian applied mathematician and naval engineer [[Alexei Krylov]], who published a paper on this issue in 1931.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.uu.nl/people/vorst/kryl.html|title=A.N.Krylov, a short biography|author=Mike Botchev|year=2002}}</ref>

Modern [[iterative method]]s for finding one (or a few) eigenvalues of large [[sparse matrix|sparse matrices]] or solving large systems of linear equations avoid matrix-matrix operations, but rather multiply vectors by the matrix and work with the resulting vectors. Starting with a vector, ''b'', one computes <math>A b</math>, then one multiplies that vector by ''A'' to find <math>A^2 b</math> and so on.  All algorithms that work this way are referred to as Krylov subspace methods; they are among the most successful methods currently available in numerical linear algebra.  

Because the vectors tend very quickly to become almost [[linear independence|linearly dependent]], methods relying on Krylov subspace frequently involve some [[orthogonalization]] scheme, such as [[Lanczos iteration]] for [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian matrices]] or [[Arnoldi iteration]] for more general matrices.

The best known Krylov subspace methods are the [[Arnoldi iteration|Arnoldi]], [[Lanczos iteration|Lanczos]], [[Conjugate gradient]], [[GMRES]] (generalized minimum residual), [[BiCGSTAB]] (biconjugate gradient stabilized), QMR (quasi minimal residual), TFQMR (transpose-free QMR), and MINRES (minimal residual) methods.
