'''Windows Mobile Device Center''' is a synchronization [[software]] program developed by [[Microsoft]], and the successor to [[ActiveSync]]. It is designed to synchronize various content including music, video, [[Contact book|contact]]s, [[Calendaring software|calendar]] events, [[Bookmark (World Wide Web)|web browser favorite]]s, and other files between [[Windows Mobile]] devices and the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system.
