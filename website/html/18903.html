In [[geometry]], an '''interior angle''' (or '''internal angle''') is an [[angle]] formed by two sides of a [[simple polygon]] that share an endpoint in.  This angle must be an angle on the inner side of the polygon to be an internal angle. A simple polygon has exactly one internal angle per [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]].

If every internal angle of a polygon is less than 180°, the polygon is called [[convex polygon|convex]].

In contrast, an '''exterior angle''' (or '''external angle''') is an angle formed by one side of a simple polygon and a line extended from an adjacent side.

The sum of the internal angle and the external angle on the same vertex is 180°.

For example:
x+35+75=180<br />
x+110=180<br />
x+110-110=180-110<br />
x=70

The sum of all the internal angles of a polygon can be determined by 180(n-2) where n is the number of sides.  A pentagon's internal angles add up to of 540 degrees (shown below)<br>
<math>180(n-2)=
180(5-2)=
180(3)=
540</math><br>
Knowing this you can easily find the measure of each angle if it is a equiangular polygon with <br><math>\frac{180(n-2)}{n}</math>.
<br>So continuing from the above example with the pentagon:<br>
<math>\frac{540}{n}=\frac{540}{5}=108</math>

(The exterior angle can be worked out by doing the following sum 360/number of sides in the equiangular polygon
The interior angle can then be found by taking away the value of the exterior angle from 180.
So in a pentagon there are 5 sides so to work out the exterior angle you do 360/5 =72
So the interior angle is 180-72=108 so the interior angle = 108 degrees) 

The sum of the external angles of any convex polygon is 360°.
