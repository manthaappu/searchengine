The '''Joy programming language''' is a purely [[functional programming language]] that was produced by Manfred von Thun of [[La Trobe University]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. Joy is based on composition of functions rather than [[lambda calculus]]. It has turned out to have many similarities to [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]], due not to design but to a sort of parallel evolution and convergence.

== How it works ==

Joy is unusual (except for [[function-level programming]] languages and some esoteric ones, such as [[unlambda]]) in its lack of a [[lambda calculus|lambda]] operator, and therefore lack of [[Parameter (computer science)|formal parameters]]. To illustrate this with a common example, here is how the square function might be defined in an [[imperative programming language]] ([[C (programming language)|C]]):

 int square(int x) {
   return x*x;
 }

The variable x is a formal parameter which is replaced by the actual value to be squared when the function is called. Now here's how the same function would be defined in a [[functional programming|functional]] language ([[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]):

<source lang="scheme">
(define square
  (lambda (x) 
    (* x x)))
</source>

This is different in many ways, but it still uses the formal parameter x in the same way. Now here is how the square function would be defined in Joy:

 DEFINE square == dup * .

To explain: In Joy, everything is a function that takes a [[stack (data structure)|stack]] as an argument and returns a stack as a result. For instance, the numeral '5' does not represent an integer constant, but instead a short program that pushes the number 5 onto the stack. 

* The '''dup''' operator simply duplicates the top element of the stack by pushing a copy of it.
* The '''*''' operator pops two numbers off the stack and pushes their product.

So this definition of the square function says to make a copy of the top element and then multiply the two top elements, leaving the square of the original top element on top of the stack. There is no need for a formal parameter at all. This design gives Joy conciseness and power, as illustrated by this definition of [[quicksort]]:

<pre>
<nowiki>
 DEFINE qsort ==
   [small]
   []
   [uncons [>] split]
   [[swap] dip cons concat]
   binrec .
</nowiki>
</pre>

"binrec" is one of Joy's many [[recursion|recursive]] [[combinator]]s, implementing binary recursion. It expects four quoted programs on top of the stack which represent:

* the termination condition (if a list is "small" (1 or 0 elements) it is already sorted), 
* what to do if the termination condition is met (in this case nothing), 
* what to do by default (split the list into two halves by comparing each element with the pivot), and finally 
* what to do at the end (insert the pivot between the two sorted halves).

== Mathematical purity ==
In Joy, the [[meaning function]] is a [[homomorphism]] from the [[syntax|syntactic]] [[monoid]] onto the [[semantics|semantic]] [[monoid]]. That is, the syntactic relation of [[concatenation]] of [[symbol]]s maps directly onto the semantic relation of [[Function composition|composition]] of [[function (mathematics)|functions]]. It is a [[homomorphism]] instead of an [[isomorphism]] because it is [[onto]] but not [[one-to-one]], that is, some sequences of symbols have the same meaning (e.g. "dup +" and "2 *") but no symbol has more than one meaning.

Its library routines mirror those of ISO [[C (programming language)|C]], though the current implementation is not easily extensible with functions written in C.
