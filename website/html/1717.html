==Description==
{{See also|AmigaOS}}

AmigaOS 4 can be divided into two parts; the [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]] and the [[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]].

===Workbench===
The [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]] is the GUI of OS4, a graphical interface file manager and application launcher for the Operating System. It also includes some general purpose tools and utility programs such as a Notepad for typing text, MultiView for viewing images and [[Amigaguide]] documents, Unarc for unpacking Archives, a PDF reader, a number of small preferences programs for changing settings of the GUI and OS etc., etc.

===Kickstart===
The [[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]] contains many of the core components of the OS. Prior to version 4 of AmigaOS the Kickstart had been released mostly on a [[Read-only memory|ROM]] (included with the computer). In OS4 the Kickstart is instead stored on the hard disk. It consists mainly of:

* [[Exec (Amiga)|Exec]], a preemptive multitasking kernel.
* [[Intuition (Amiga)|Intuition]], a windowing system API.
* [[AmigaDOS]] and AmigaShell, the AmigaDOS is the disk operating system for the OS, whereas the Shell is the integrated Command Line Interface (CLI). The CLI and the GUI complement each other and share the same privileges.
* [[Petunia JIT|Petunia]], a Motorola 68020 processor emulator with dynamic recompilation, also called just-in-time compilation ([[Just-in-time compilation|JIT]] compilation), for PowerPC based Amigas. It gives OS4 backward compatibility to some extent, it will only run system friendly (following the OS3.x API without communicating directly with the classic Amigas' [[Amiga#Hardware|custom chipset]]) AmigaOS 3.x programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amiga.hu/amigos/rachy/petunia.html
|title=Project Petunia
|publisher=Almos Rajnai
|date=2006-12-30
|accessdate=2010-11-10}}</ref> For the programs that Petunia can't handle, such as most "bang the hardware" (which uses legacy Amiga hardware directly) Amiga [[Amiga games|games]] and [[Amiga demos|demos]], the third party OS4 native emulator [[E-UAE]] can be used which can emulate different Amiga chipsets (OCS, ECS, AGA) as well.

==History==
{{Main|History of the AmigaOS 4 dispute}}

During the five years of development, users of [[AmigaOne]] machines could download Pre-Release versions of AmigaOS 4.0 from Hyperion's repository as long as these were made available. As witnessed by many users on Amiga discussion forum sites, these versions were stable and reliable, despite the fact that they were technically labeled as "Pre-Releases".

On 20 December 2006, [[Amiga, Inc]] abruptly terminated<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amiga.com/about/history/?t=os |title=Announcement at Amiga Inc. official site |publisher=Amiga.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-31| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080729061610/http://www.amiga.com/about/history/?t=os| archivedate = July 29, 2008}}</ref> the contract with [[Hyperion Entertainment]] to produce or sell AmigaOS 4. Nevertheless, AmigaOS 4.0 was released commercially for Amigas with [[PowerUP (accelerator)|PowerUP]] accelerator cards in November 2007<ref>[http://www.hyperion-entertainment.biz:8080/news/2007-11-22 AmigaOS 4.0 for Classic Amiga gone Gold.]</ref> (having been available only to developers and beta-testers until then). The Italian computer company [[ACube Systems]] has announced [[Sam440ep]]<ref>[http://www.acube-systems.biz/eng/sam.php SAM440ep motherboard.]{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}</ref> and Sam440ep-flex motherboards, which are AmigaOS 4 compatible. Also, a third party bootloader, known as the "Moana", was released on torrent sites; it allows installation of the Sam440ep version of OS4 to Mac Mini G4's. However this is both unofficial and unsupported as of today, and very incomplete, especially regarding drivers. During the judicial procedure (between Hyperion and Amiga, Inc),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.justia.com/cases/featured/washington/wawdce/2:2007cv00631/143245/ |title=Amiga Inc v.

On 30 September 2009, Hyperion Entertainment and Amiga, Inc reached settlement agreement where Hyperion is granted an exclusive, perpetual, worldwide right to AmigaOS 3.1 in order to use, develop, modify, commercialize, distribute and market AmigaOS 4.x and subsequent versions of AmigaOS (including AmigaOS 5 without limitation).<ref>{{Cite web

===Development process===
{{Main|AmigaOS versions}}

There have been many different versions of the [[AmigaOS]] operating system (OS) during its two decades of history.

====Versions 1.0 to 1.4====
[[Image:Amiga Workbench 1 0.png|thumb|200px|Amiga Workbench 1.0 (1985).]]

The first AmigaOS was introduced in 1985 and developed by [[Commodore International]]. It was nicknamed [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|''Workbench'']] from the name of its [[Graphical user interface]] (GUI), due to an error of Commodore Marketing and Sales Department, which labeled the OS disk just with the name "Workbench Disk" and not with the correct name "AmigaOS Disk (Workbench)". The first versions of AmigaOS (1.0 and up to 1.3) are here indicated with the name of their original disks to preserve original custom.

Kickstart/Workbench 1.4 was a [[Software testing#Beta testing|beta]] version of the upcoming 2.0 update and never released, but the Kickstart part was shipped in very small quantities with early [[Amiga 3000]] computers, where it is often referred to as the "[[Superkickstart]] ROM". In these machines it is only used to bootstrap the machine and load the Kickstart that will be used to actually boot the system. The appearance of a very early first release of 1.4 was similar to 1.3, but with colors slightly changed. A second version was similar to that of 2.0 and higher, with just minor differences. It is, however, possible to dump out of the OS selection screen by clicking where one would expect to see a close gadget. This will cause the machine to boot Kickstart 1.4 using either the wb_2.x: partition, or from a floppy.

[[File:Wb 20.png|thumb|200px|Amiga Workbench 2.0 (1990).]]

====Versions 2.0 to 3.1====
Workbench 2.0 improvements introduced a lot of major advances to the GUI of Amiga operating system. The blue and orange colour scheme was replaced with a grey and light blue with 3D aspect in the border of the windows. The Workbench was no longer tied to the 640Ã256 (PAL) or 640Ã200 (NTSC) display modes, and much of the system was improved with an eye to making future expansion easier. For the first time, a standardised "look and feel" was added. This was done by creating the ''Amiga Style Guide'', and including libraries and software which assisted developers in making conformant software. Technologies included the GUI element creation library ''gadtools'', the software installation scripting language ''Installer'', and the ''[[AmigaGuide]]'' hypertext help system.

====Versions 3.5 and 3.9====
<!--[[Image:AmigaOS.svg|right|thumb|200px|Evolution of AmigaOS.]]-->
[[File:AmigaOS 3 and clones.svg|right|thumb|200px|Evolution of AmigaOS 3.x.]]
After the demise of [[Commodore International|Commodore]], the later owners of the Amiga trademark granted a license to a German company called [[Haage & Partner]] to update the Amiga's operating system. Along with this update came a change in the way people referred to the Amiga's operating system. Rather than specifying "Kickstart" or "Workbench", the updates were most often referred to as simply "AmigaOS".
Whereas all previous OS releases were Motorola 68000 compatible, some OS components from release 3.5 onwards required a 68020 or better.

====Versions 4.0 and 4.1====
Eventually Amiga Inc. contracted Hyperion Entertainment to develop the [[PowerPC]] native AmigaOS 4 (OS4).
<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0BxlY9g_OfLqDMDUxZWU2MDQtYWNmMi00ZmQyLTlmMDctYTdhYzdmYTM2YWQ1&hl=en |title=Amiga/Hyperion contract|date=2010-10-10|accessdate=2010-09-03}}</ref> Unlike the previous versions which were based on the [[Motorola]] [[68k]] central processor, OS4 is running only on PowerPC computer systems. Amiga, Inc.'s (current Amiga trademark owners) distribution policies for AmigaOS 4.0 and any later versions required that OS4 must be bundled with all new third-party hardware "Amigas", with the sole exception of Amigas with [[Phase5]] PowerPC accelerator boards, for which OS4 is sold separately. This requirement was overturned in the agreement reached between Amiga, Inc. and Hyperion in the settlement of a lawsuit over the ownership of AmigaOS 4.

==AmigaOS 4 prominent features==
{{Original research|section|date=November 2010|discuss=Talk:AmigaOS_4#Fast ON and OFF}}
{{Unreliable sources|section|date=November 2010}}
Prominent features compared to other operating systems or previous versions of AmigaOS:<ref>{{Cite web|date=March 23, 2009 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx3q2wFIn6k |title=YouTube video "Why use Amiga in 2009? - Long cut" |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2009-03-23 |accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref>

===General===
* '''Quick on:''' AmigaOS boots and reboots up in a few seconds.<ref>{{Cite web|date=May 12, 2009 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87DeoBqGSeA |title=YouTube video AmigaOS 4.1 Startup and reboot |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2010-05-15 |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref>
* '''Instant off / fast reboot:''' An oft-touted feature is that AmigaOS can be switched off in an instant by just hitting the off switch.<ref>{{Cite web|date=May 12, 2009 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7ofkdlGGF4 |title=YouTube video AmigaOS 4.1 Reboot and shut down |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2009-05-12 |accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref>  Arguably, however, this is not a feature, but a low expectation.  AmigaOS is as vulnerable to dataloss as any other operating system, should it be switched off at the wrong time.  In fact, operating systems with modern filesystem data integrity checking are actually more capable of surviving this.
* '''Responsiveness:''' Optimized to '''respond to user actions''' in an instant. A fully pre-emptive multitasking scheduler ensures that important tasks will get a fair share of processing time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Appearance===
[[File:AmiagOS 4 screen drag.png|right|thumb|Workbench screen in front, web browser screen behind.]]
* '''Screens:''' You can have as many different screens as you like for any purpose, each with its own application on it. Or you can open a "public screen" which several applications can share. Switching between different screens takes an instant, and you can come back to an application and find it exactly how you left it. It is even possible to drag the current screen down to reveal another screen behind it (even with a different screen resolution), so that you can view two screens simultaneously, or even drag and drop files and other content from one screen to another.<ref>{{Cite web|date=January 19, 2007 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSA-q1qniMY |title=YouTube video Amiga OS4 Intuition |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2007-01-19 |accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref>
* '''Customisable [[Graphical user interface|GUI]]:''' Allows replacement of window gadgets with new designs, application of [[gradient]]s or [[texture (computer graphics)|textures]] of your choice to virtually every graphical element in the interface. It is possible to alter the geometry of the window drawing to suit personal taste, change font usage throughout the interface, configure the appearance of menus and chose own 3D effects. Having a different look for each public screen is also feasible.
* '''Menuing:''' The menu bar appears at the top of the screen when pressed down the right mouse button, and disappears when it is not needed, thus reducing screen clutter and giving more room to work.

===File handling===
* '''Clear file structure:''' Operating system files are divided up into clearly labelled drawers (folders) so you know exactly where to find whatever you're looking for. For example, all libraries are stored in "Libs:" standard virtual device and absolute path finder for "Libs" directory, Fonts are all in "Fonts:" absolute locator, the files for language localization are all stored in "Locale:" and so on.
* '''[[RAM disk]]:''' Like a virtual hard drive, it acts like any other disk, and stores files and data in memory rather than on your actual hard drive. The RAM disk is dynamically resizable and takes up only as much of your memory as it needs to. It can be used as a temporary store for your own purposes or as a place for software installers to put temporary files, and is cleared out at reboot so you won't be cluttering up your computer with thousands of unnecessary files that bog down your system. Additionally there is an optional '''RAD disk''', a recoverable version of the RAM disk, which preserves contents after a reboot.<ref>[http://www.amigaos4.com/index.php%3Foption=content&task=view&id=8&Itemid=.html Feature Spotlight: The RAM Disk.]</ref>
* '''Datatypes:''' Recognises and '''handles file types''': displaying a picture, playing a music file, decoding a video file, rendering a web page etc. Any application can access Datatypes transparently, and thus have the ability to use any file that you have a Datatype for.
* '''Icon handling:''' A file can have a default icon representing the type of file or a custom icon specific to the individual file. Additionally icons can store extra commands and [[metadata]] about the associated file â which program to open it in, for example.
* '''Assigning devices:''' Instead of assigning drives (devices) a letter or fixed label, each drive can be given a name. Drives can be given more than one name so the system always knows where things are, if it is the system boot drive it is also known as "Sys:". Areas of hard drive can be assigned a label as if they were a virtual disk. For example, it is possible to mount MP3 players as "MP3:" and external networked resources as logical devices.

===Other===
[[File:AmigaOS 4.1 Update 1 Live CD.png|thumb|right|Booted from AmigaOS 4.1 Update 1 Live CD.]]
* '''Live CD:''' The OS4 installation CD can be used as a [[Live CD]].
* '''Dockies:''' It is a fully configurable docking bar for icons, allowing quick access to most used applications. These dock bar icons, "Dockies", are fully dynamic, which means they can show real-time content and act as useful micro tools. A Docky might act as a magnifying glass, display the time, or show you the latest weather forecast or stock market information direct from the Internet.
* '''Scripting:''' Implemented scripting as a fundamental feature. Using the [[AREXX]] scripting language and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] it is possible to automate, integrate and remote control almost every application and function of the computer. Function sets and tools from several applications can be brought together into a single, integrated interface to allow the most complex jobs to be performed with the utmost simplicity.
[[File:Amiga-grim1.png|thumb|right|A visit from the Grim Reaper.]]
* '''[[Guru Meditation|The Grim Reaper]]:''' The "[[Guru Meditation]]" is replaced by "The Grim Reaper", a crash handling system that catches crashes and lock ups, and stops them from getting out of control. It can provide complete information about the crash and can simply kill the offending task and free up the resources it was using.
* '''AmiUpdate:'''  Is an updating system designed purely for the latest incarnation of the AmigaOS 4.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amiupdate.net/ |title=AmigaOS 4 updating system |publisher=Amiupdate.net |date= |accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref> It is capable to update OS files and also all Amiga programs which are registered to use the same update program that is standard for Amiga. Updating AmigaOS requires only few libraries to be put in standard OS location "Libs:", "Fonts:" etc. This leaves Amiga users with a minimal knowledge of the system almost free to perform by hand the update of the system files.
