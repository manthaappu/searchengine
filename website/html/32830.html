On [[POSIX]]-compliant platforms, '''SIGTTIN''' is the [[Signal (computing)|signal]] sent to a [[process (computing)|process]] when it attempts to read from the [[teletypewriter|tty]] while in the background. The [[C preprocessor|symbolic constant]] for SIGTTIN is defined in the [[header file]] <code>signal.h</code>. Symbolic signal names are used because signal numbers can vary across platforms.

==Etymology==
''SIG'' is a common [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] for signal names. ''TT'' is for ''tty'', an abbreviation for ''[[teletypewriter]]'', an archaic type of [[computer terminal]]. ''IN'' refers to [[Input/output|input]].

==Usage==
SIGTTIN may be sent to a background process that attempts to read from its [[controlling terminal]].  In practical terms this controlling terminal is usually an interactive terminal session at which the user initiated the background job.

The default action of SIGTTIN is to stop the process.  Background processes thus suspended can be placed into the foreground to accept input by the [[Unix shell|shell]] using the [[fg (Unix)|''fg'' command]] or by sending them the [[SIGCONT]] signal.

The SIGTTIN signal provides an alternative to this reliance on human interaction.   On receiving the SIGTTIN, for instance, an appropriately coded program may opt to  perform a default action rather than waiting for a human user to foreground it and respond.

Typically this signal applies to processes under [[job control (Unix)|job control]]; [[daemon (computer software)|daemons]] do not have controlling terminals and should never receive this signal.

==See also==
* [[SIGTTOU]] - a corresponding signal received if a background process tries to write to its controlling terminal.
