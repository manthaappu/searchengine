A '''reconfigurable datapath array''' (rDPA) is a coarse-grained [[morphware]] unit for [[Reconfigurable Computing]]. Instead of [[FPGA]]s ([[field-programmable gate array]]s) having single bit configurable logic blocks (CLBs), rDPAs have multiple bits wide (for instance, 32 bit path width) reconfigurable datapath units ([[rDPU]]s).

A '''Reconfigurable datapath array''' or '''rDPA''' is a [[semiconductor]] device containing reconfigurable data path units ('''[[rDPU]]''') and programmable interconnects. Each rDPU can be configured to perform an individual function. These rDPUs and interconnects can be programmed after the manufacturing process by the customer/designer (hence the term "reconfigurable") so that the rDPA can perform whatever complex computation is needed. Because rDPUs are multiple bits wide (for instance, 32 bits), we talk about coarse-grained reconfigurability - in contrast to [[FPGA]]s with single-bit wide configurable logic blocks, called fine-gained reconfigurable.

rDPAs are structurally programmed from [[configware]] sources, compiled into pipe networks to be mapped onto the rDPA. rDPAs are not instruction-stream-driven and have no instruction fetch at run time. rDPUs do not have a program counter. The term '''reconfigurable datapath array''' or '''rDPA''' has been coined by Rainer Kress in 1993 when having been at [[University of Kaiserslautern|TU Kaiserslautern]].
