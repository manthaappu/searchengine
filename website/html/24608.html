'''MindManager''', called '''MindMan''' until version 3.5, is a commercial [[mind map]]ping software application developed by Mindjet Corporation.  Mind maps created in MindManager are based on the mind mapping method by [[Tony Buzan]].  The latest version, MindManager 9, is only available for [[Microsoft Windows]].<ref name=PCWorld_Staff/> The Mac OS X version still uses MindManager 8.

Files created in the most recent versions are compatible with both Windows and Apple platforms.  Features include support for manual and automatic [[task management]], filters, an open [[API]], and RSS support.  MindManager also provides integration with Microsoft Office applications such as Outlook and Excel.<ref name=PCWorld_Staff>{{Citation

==File format==
{{unreferenced|section|date=August 2010}}
The MindManager file format is a [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] archive with XML and binary data inside:
* Document.xml: this contains the structure and data in the map.  The format of the XML is defined by the [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]] files also included in the zip archive.
* Preview.png: a small thumbnail-sized image of the map
* xsd\MindManagerApplication.xsd: the primary XML Schema file
* xsd\MindManagerCore.xsd: a supporing core XML schema file
* xsd\MindManagerDelta.xsd: a supporting XML schema file that supports differences between map versions
* xsd\MindManagerPrimitive.xsd: a supporting primitive XML schema file.
* bin\*.bin: all attachments and images not provided with MindManager in the map
The MindManager file format is backwards and forwards compatible with versions 5 through 8.  The MindManager file format XSD schemas are also publicly available.

==Integration & add-ins==
{{self-published|section|date=August 2010}}
Latter day versions of MindManager create maps which can pull data from [[Microsoft Excel]] and [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook]], and can be exported to [[Microsoft Word|Word]], [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]], [[Microsoft Visio|Visio]] and [[Microsoft Project|Project]], as HTML web pages, as an embeddable Player, and as [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] documents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/Mindjet-Launches-MindManager-8-MindManager/story.aspx?guid={7990C908-6778-4A0D-856E-DF72D3BE1053} |title=Mindjet's Press Release about MindManager 8 |publisher=Mindjet |accessdate=2008-11-16}}</ref>

MindManager also integrates into many other applications through its published [[API]]. The availability of this has made it accessible so that third party add-ins can be created to extend the functionality of MindManager. These add-ins cover applications such as [[Lotus Notes]] & software from [[Salesforce.com]]. MindManager 8 for Mac provides enhanced integration with Apple's productivity tools such as [[Ichat|iChat]], [[iCal]] and [[Pages]].  Further examples of extensibility for MindManager can be found on the Mindjet Solutions Website.
