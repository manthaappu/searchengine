<html> <head> <title>ACM SIGACT</title></head><body>'''ACM SIGACT''' or '''SIGACT''' is the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] [[Special Interest Group]] on Algorithms and Computation Theory, whose purpose is support of research in [[theoretical computer science]].

==Publications==
SIGACT publishes a quarterly print newsletter, '''''SIGACT News'''''. Its online version, ''SIGACT News Online'', is available since 1996 for SIGACT members, with unrestricted access to some features.

==Conferences==
SIGACT sponsors a number of annual conferences.

*COLT: [[Conference on Learning Theory]]
*PODC: ACM [[Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing]] (jointly sponsored by [[SIGOPS]])
*PODS: ACM [[Symposium on Principles of Database Systems]]
*POPL: ACM [[Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages]]
*SoCG: ACM [[Symposium on Computational Geometry]] (jointly sponsored by [[SIGGRAPH]])
*SODA: ACM/SIAM [[Symposium on Discrete Algorithms]] (jointly sponsored by the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]]). Two annual workshops held in conjunction with SODA also have the same joint sponsorship:
**ALENEX: Workshop on Algorithms and Experiments
**ANALCO: Workshop on Analytic Algorithms and Combinatorics
*SPAA: ACM [[Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures]]
*STOC: ACM [[Symposium on the Theory of Computing]]

COLT, PODC, PODS, POPL, SODA, and STOC are all listed as highly cited venues by both citeseerx<ref>[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/stats/venues citeseerx venue impact factor], citeseerx.</ref> and libra.<ref>[http://libra.msra.cn/conf_category_24.htm Libra Conferences], LIBRA.</ref>
