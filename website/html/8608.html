<html> <head> <title>Cryptographic Message Syntax</title></head><body>The '''Cryptographic Message Syntax''' (CMS) is the [[IETF]]'s standard for [[Cryptography|cryptographically]] protected messages. It can be used to [[Digital signature|digitally sign]], [[Cryptographic hash function|digest]], [[Message authentication code|authenticate]] or [[encryption|encrypt]] any form of digital data.

CMS is based on the syntax of [[PKCS]]#7, which in turn is based on the [[Privacy-enhanced Electronic Mail|Privacy-Enhanced Mail]] standard. The newest version of CMS ({{As of|2009|lc=on}}) is specified in RFC 5652 (but see also RFC 5911 for updated ASN.1 modules conforming to ASN.1 2002).

The architecture of CMS is built around [[X.509|certificate-based]] key management, such as the profile defined by the [[PKIX]] [[working group]].

CMS is used as the key cryptographic component of many other cryptographic standards, such as [[S/MIME]], [[PKCS]]#12 and the RFC 3161 [[Digital timestamping]] protocol.

[[OpenSSL]] is an [[open source]] software that can encrypt, decrypt, sign and verify, compress and uncompress CMS documents.
