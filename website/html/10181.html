A '''dial box''' is a [[computer peripheral]] for [[direct manipulation interface| direct 3D manipulation]] e.g. to interactively input the rotation and torsion angles of a model displayed on a computer screen. Dial boxes were common input tools in the first years of interactive 3D graphics and they were available for [[Silicon Graphics]] (SGI) or [[Sun Microsystems]] and sold with their [[workstation]]s. Currently they have been replaced by   standard [[computer mouse]] interaction techniques.

Standard dial box has 8 dials mounted on a plate. The plate is set upright with the help of a stand and usually located next to the computer screen for convenient access. The connection to a computer is made via the serial port ([[RS-232]]).

One of the fields of application for dial boxes was [[molecular graphics]].

==Dial box models==

At least two different models of dial boxes were sold with the SGI brand. 

DLS80-1022 (SGI part number 9980992) was made by [[Danaher Corporation|Danaher controls]], has 8 large dials and a single [[D-subminiature|DE-9]] connector which contains both the power and data pins. The connection to the computer serial port the dial box power supply is made with a special DE-9 â€“ DE-9, [[DIN connector|DIN-5]] splitter cable. Essentially the same dial box was also sold as the [[Sun Microsystems]] DLS80-1012, part number 370-1223-01.

The Japanese made SGI SN-921 (type number 9780804) has somewhat smaller dials. It has a separate 5 V power supply connector in addition to the DE-9 serial connector, but it also needs a serial cable with a custom [[pinout]] [http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Comp/comp.sys.sgi.hardware/2006-03/msg00053.html].
