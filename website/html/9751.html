In [[computer science]], '''declarative programming''' is a [[programming paradigm]] that expresses the logic of a [[computation]] without describing its [[control flow]].<ref>{{citation|last=Lloyd|first=J.W.|title=Practical Advantages of Declarative Programming}}</ref> Many languages applying this style attempt to minimize or eliminate [[side effect (computer science)|side effects]] by describing ''what'' the program should accomplish, rather than describing ''how'' to go about accomplishing it.<ref>[http://foldoc.org/index.cgi?query=declarative+language Declarative language] in The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing, Editor Denis Howe.</ref> This is in contrast with [[imperative programming]], which requires an explicitly provided [[algorithm]].

Declarative programming often considers [[Program (machine)|programs]] as theories of a [[formal logic]], and computations as deductions in that logic space. Declarative programming has become of particular interest recently, as it may greatly simplify writing [[parallel computing|parallel programs]].<ref>http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~pls/damp09/</ref>

Common declarative languages include those of [[regular expression]]s, [[logic programming]], and [[functional programming]].

== Definition ==

Declarative programming is often defined as any style of programming that is not [[imperative programming|imperative]].  A number of other common definitions exist that attempt to give the term a definition other than simply contrasting it with imperative programming.  For example:

* A program that describes ''what'' computation should be performed and not ''how'' to compute it
* Any programming language that lacks [[Side effect (computer science)|side effects]] (or more specifically, is [[Referential transparency (computer science)|referentially transparent]])
* A language with a clear correspondence to [[mathematical logic]]. [http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/papers/diss.ps.gz] <!-- this citation is just for this bullet point -->

These definitions overlap substantially.

==Subparadigms==

Declarative programming is an umbrella term that includes a number of better-known [[programming paradigm]]s.

===Functional programming===
{{Main|Functional programming}}

Functional programming, and in particular [[purely functional]] programming, attempts to minimize or eliminate side effects, and is therefore considered declarative.  Most functional languages, such as [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], [[Objective Caml]] and [[Unlambda]], however, do permit side effects in practice.

While functional languages typically do appear to specify "how", a compiler for a purely functional programming language is free to extensively rewrite the operational behavior of a function, so long as the same result is returned for the same inputs.  This can be used to, for example, make a function compute its result in [[parallel computing|parallel]], or to perform substantial optimizations (such as [[Deforestation (computer science)|deforestation]]) that a compiler may not be able to safely apply to a language with side effects.

===Logic programming===
{{Main|Logic programming}}

Logic programming languages such as [[Prolog]] state and query relations.  The specifics of ''how'' these queries are answered is up to the implementation and its theorem prover, but typically take the form of some sort of [[unification (computing)|unification]].  Like functional programming, many logic programming languages permit side effects, and as a result are not strictly declarative.

===Constraint programming===
{{Main|Constraint programming}}
In Constraint programming relations between variables are stated in the form of constraints, specifying the properties of a solution to be found. The set of constraints is then [[Solver (computer science)|solved]] by giving a value to each variable so that the solution is consistent with the maximum number of constraints.

Constraint programming is often used as a complement to other paradigms: functional, logical or even imperative programming.

===Domain-specific languages===
{{Main|Domain-specific language}}

Some well-known examples of declarative domain specific languages (DSLs) include [[regular expression]]s, [[CSS]], and a subset of [[SQL]] (SELECT queries, for example).  DSLs have the advantage of being useful while not necessarily needing to be [[Turing-complete]], which makes it easier for a language to be purely declarative.

Many markup languages such as [[HTML]], [[MXML]], [[XAML]], [[XSLT]], [[SVG]] or other [[user interface markup language]]s are often declarative.  HTML, for example, only describes what should appear on a webpage and doesn't specify the possible [[interaction]]s with it.

Some software systems now combine traditional user interface markup languages such as HTML with declarative markup that defines what (but not how) the back-end server systems should do to support the declared interface. Such systems, typically using a domain specific [[XML]] [[Xml namespace|namespace]], include abstractions of [[SQL]] database syntax or parameterised calls to web services using [[Representational State Transfer|REST]] and [[SOAP]].

===Hybrid languages===
[[Makefiles]], for example, specify dependencies in a declarative fashion [http://phoenix.labri.fr/wiki/doku.php?id=an_overview_on_dsls], but include an imperative list of actions to take as well. Similarly, [[yacc]] specifies a context free grammar declaratively, but includes code snippets from a host language, which is usually imperative (such as [[C (programming language)|C]]).
