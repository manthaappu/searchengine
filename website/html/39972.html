<html> <head> <title>Web template</title></head><body>A '''web template''' is a tool used to [[Separation of concerns|separate]] content from presentation in [[web design]], and for mass-production of [[web document]]s. It is a basic component of a [[web template system]]. 

Web templates can be used to set up any type of [[website]]. In its simplest sense, a web template operates similarly to a [[form letter]] for use in setting up a website.

[[Image:TempEngWeb017b.svg|thumb|right|254px|Content (from a [[database]]), and "presentation specifications" (in a web template), are combined (through the [[template engine (web)|template engine]]) to mass-produce web documents.]]

==Template Uses==
Web templates can be used by any individual or organization to set up their website. Once a template is purchased or downloaded, the user will replace all generic information included in the web template with their own personal, organizational or product information. Templates can be used to:

* Display personal information or daily activities as in a [[blog]].
* Sell products on-line.
* Display information about a company or organization.
* Display family history.
* Display a gallery of photos.
* Place music files such as mp3 on line for play through a web browser.
* Place videos on-line for public viewing.
* To setup a private login area on-line.


=== Effective separation ===
A common goal among experienced web developers is to develop and deploy applications that are flexible and easily maintainable. An important consideration in reaching this goal is the [[separation of presentation and content|separation]] of [[business logic]] from [[presentation logic]].<ref name="Parr000">{{cite book

One difficulty in evaluating this separation is the lack of well-defined formalisms to measure when and how well it is actually met.<ref name="Parr000" /> There are, however, fairly standard heuristics that have been borrowed from the domain of [[software engineering]]. These include '[[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]]' (based on principles of [[object-oriented programming]]); and the '[[Template processor|Templating]] and [[Generative programming]]', (consistent with the principles of [[Model-view-controller|MVC separation]]).<ref name="ParagonCorp">{{cite web

=== Flexible presentation ===

One major rationale behind "effective separation" is the need for maximum flexibility in the code and resources dedicated to the presentation logic.<ref name="ParagonCorp" /> Client demands, changing customer preferences and desire to present a "fresh face" for pre-existing content often result in the need to dramatically modify the public appearance of web content while disrupting the underlying infrastructure as little as possible.

The distinction between "presentation" (front end) and "business logic" (infrastructure) is usually an important one, because:
* the presentation source code language may differ from other code assets;
* the production process for the application may require the work to be done at separate times and locations;
* different workers have different skill sets, and presentation skills do not always coincide with skills for coding business logic;
* code assets are easier to maintain and more readable when disparate components are kept separate and [[Loose coupling|loosely coupled]];<ref name="ParagonCorp" />

=== Reusability ===

Not all potential users of web templates have the willingness and ability to hire developers to design a system for their needs. Additionally, some may wish to use the web but have limited or no technical proficiency. For these reasons, a number of developers and vendors have released web templates specifically for reuse by non-technical people. Although web template reusability is also important for even highly-skilled and technically experienced developers, it is ''especially'' critical to those who rely on simplicity and "ready-made" web solutions.

Such "ready-made" web templates are sometimes free, and easily made by an individual domestically. However, specialized web templates are sometimes sold online. Although there are numerous commercial sites that offer web templates for a licensing fee, there are also free and "open-source" sources as well.

The rise of the [[open source]] design movement has seen a slow but steady rise in the community of open source designers. Some sites offer open source templates in addition to other content.
