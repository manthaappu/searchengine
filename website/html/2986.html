<html> <head> <title>Average CPU power</title></head><body>The '''average CPU power''' ('''ACP'''), is a scheme to characterize power consumption of new [[central processing unit]]s under "average" daily usage, especially [[server computer|server]] processors, the rating scheme is defined by [[Advanced Micro Devices]] (AMD) for use in its line of processors based on the [[AMD K10|K10]] microarchitecture ([[Opteron#Micro-architecture update|Opteron 8300 and 2300 series]] processors). This rating is similar to Intel's [[thermal design power]] (TDP) used with Pentium and Core 2 processors, measuring the energy consumption of high workloads, which in numbers are slightly lower than the TDP value of the same processor.

AMD claims the ACP rating includes the power consumption when running several benchmarks, like [[TPC-C]], [[SPEC#Current|SPECcpu2006]], [[SPEC#Current|SPECjbb2005]] and [http://www.streambench.org/ STREAM Benchmark] (memory bandwidth) <ref>[http://www.anandtech.com/IT/showdoc.aspx?i=3091&p=2 AnandTech report], retrieved September 10, 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.dailytech.com/AMD+Unveils+Barcelona+Architecture/article6299.htm DailyTech report], retrieved September 10, 2007</ref><ref>[http://images.dailytech.com/nimage/5925_large_amd_explains_acp.png DailyTech image] detailing ACP, retrieved September 10, 2007</ref> which AMD said is a better method as a power consumption measurement for [[data center]]s and server intensive workload environments. AMD has said that the ACP and TDP values of the processors will co-exist, and do not replace one another. All server products will see two power figures starting from the codenamed ''Barcelona'' server processor onwards.
