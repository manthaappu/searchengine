[[Continuous function]]s are of utmost importance in [[mathematics]] and applications. However, not all [[function (mathematics)|functions]] are continuous. If a function is not continuous at a point in its [[domain (mathematics)|domain]], one says that it has a '''discontinuity''' there. The set of all points of discontinuity of a function may be a [[discrete set]], a [[dense set]], or even the entire domain of the function.

This article describes the '''classification of discontinuities''' in the simplest case of  functions of a single [[real number|real]] variable taking real values.

==Classification of discontinuities==

Consider a real valued function ''&fnof;'' of a real variable ''x'', defined in a neighborhood of the point ''x''<sub>0</sub> in which ''&fnof;'' is discontinuous. Then three situations may be distinguished:

<ol>
<li>The [[one-sided limit]] from the negative direction
:<math>L^{-}=\lim_{x\rarr x_0^{-}} f(x)</math>
and the one-sided limit from the positive direction
:<math>L^{+}=\lim_{x\rarr x_0^{+}} f(x)</math>
at <math>x_0</math> exist, are finite, and are equal to <math>L=L^{-}=L^{+}</math>. Then, if ''&fnof;''(''x''<sub>0</sub>) is not equal to <math>L</math>, ''x''<sub>0</sub> is called a '''removable discontinuity'''. This discontinuity can be 'removed to make ''&fnof;'' continuous at ''x''<sub>0</sub>', or more precisely, the function
:<math>g(x) = \begin{cases}f(x) & x\ne x_0 \\ L & x = x_0\end{cases}</math>
is continuous at ''x''=''x''<sub>0</sub>.

<li>The limits <math>L^{-}</math> and <math>L^{+}</math> exist and are finite, but not equal. Then, ''x''<sub>0</sub> is called a '''jump discontinuity''' or '''step discontinuity'''. For this type of discontinuity, the function ''&fnof;'' may have any value in ''x''<sub>0</sub>.

<li>One or both of the limits <math>L^{-}</math> and <math>L^{+}</math> does not exist or is infinite. Then, ''x''<sub>0</sub> is called an '''essential discontinuity''', or '''infinite discontinuity'''. (This is distinct from the term ''[[essential singularity]]'' which is used when studying [[complex analysis|functions of complex variables]].)
</ol>

The term ''removable discontinuity'' is sometimes incorrectly used for cases in which the limits in both directions exist and are equal, while the function is [[defined and undefined|undefined]] at the point <math>x_0.</math><ref>See, for example, the last sentence in the definition given at Mathwords.[http://www.mathwords.com/r/removable_discontinuity.htm]</ref> This use is improper because [[Continuous function|continuity]] and discontinuity of a function are concepts defined only for points in the function's domain. Such a point not in the domain, is properly named a [[removable singularity]].

The [[Oscillation (mathematics)|oscillation]] of a function at a point quantifies these discontinuities as follows:
* in a removable discontinuity, the distance that the value of the function is off by is the oscillation;
* in a jump discontinuity, the size of the jump is the oscillation (assuming that the value ''at'' the point lies between these limits from the two sides);
* in an essential discontinuity, oscillation measures the failure of a limit to exist.

==Examples==
[[Image:Discontinuity_removable.eps.png|thumb|left|The function in example 1, a removable discontinuity]]
1. Consider the function 
:<math>f(x)=\begin{cases}x^2 & \mbox{ for } x< 1 \\ 0 & \mbox { for } x=1 \\ 2-x&  \mbox{ for }  x>1\end{cases}</math> 
Then, the point <math>x_0=1</math> is a '''removable discontinuity'''.

[[Image:Discontinuity_jump.eps.png|thumb|left|The function in example 2, a jump discontinuity]]
2. Consider the function  
:<math>f(x)=\begin{cases}x^2 & \mbox{ for } x< 1 \\ 0 & \mbox { for } x=1 \\ 2-(x-1)^2& \mbox{ for } x>1\end{cases}</math> 
Then, the point <math>x_0=1</math> is a '''jump discontinuity'''.

{{clear}}
[[Image:Discontinuity_essential.eps.png|thumb|left|The function in example 3, an essential discontinuity]]
3. Consider the function 
:<math>f(x)=\begin{cases}\sin\frac{5}{x-1} & \mbox{ for } x< 1 \\ 0 & \mbox { for } x=1 \\ \frac{0.1}{x-1}& \mbox{ for } x>1\end{cases}</math> 
Then, the point <math>x_0=1</math> is an '''essential discontinuity (sometimes called infinite discontinuity)'''. For it to be an essential discontinuity, it would have sufficed that only one of the two one-sided limits did not exist or were infinite. However, given this example the discontinuity is also an ''essential discontinuity'' for the extension of the function into complex variables.

==The set of discontinuities of a function==

The set of points at which a function is continuous is always a [[G-delta set|G<sub>δ</sub> set]]. The set of discontinuities is an [[F-sigma set|F<sub>σ</sub> set]].

The set of discontinuities of a [[monotonic function]] is [[countable|at most countable]]. This is [[Froda's theorem]]. 

''[[Thomae's function]]'' is discontinuous at every rational point, but continuous at every irrational point.

The [[indicator function]] of the rationals, also known as the ''[[Dirichlet function]]'', is [[nowhere continuous|discontinuous everywhere]].
