<html> <head> <title>Deep homology</title></head><body>In [[evolutionary developmental biology]], the concept of '''deep homology''' is used to describe cases where [[Cell growth|growth]] and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] processes are governed by genetic mechanisms that are [[Homology (biology)#Homology of sequences in genetics|homologous]] and deeply [[Conserved sequence|conserved]] across a wide range of [[species]].

Textbook examples common to [[metazoa]] include the [[homeotic gene]]s that control differentiation along major [[body axis|body axes]], and [[pax genes]] (especially [[PAX6]]) involved in the development of the [[eye]] and other [[sensory organ]]s.

In early 2010, a team at [[The University of Texas at Austin]] led by [[Edward Marcotte]] developed an [[algorithm]] which identifies deeply homologous genetic modules in unicellular organisms, plants, and non-human animals based on [[phenotype|phenotypes]] (such as traits and developmental defects). The technique aligns phenotypes across organisms based on [[orthology]] (a type of homology) of genes involved in the phenotypes.<ref>Zimmer, Carl.
