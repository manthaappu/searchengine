'''Unity''' is an integrated [[authoring tool]] for creating 3D [[video game]]s or other interactive content such as [[architectural visualization]]s or real-time 3D animations. Unity is similar to [[Macromedia Director|Director]], [[Game Blender|Blender game engine]], [[Virtools]] or [[Torque Game Builder]] in the sense that an integrated graphical environment is the primary method of development.

The editor runs on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]] and can produce games for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Apple Macintosh|Mac]], [[Wii]]<ref name="Wii">{{cite web | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=18840| title=Unity to Support Wii Console as Authorized Middleware Provider | publisher=Gamasutra}}</ref>, [[iPad]], or [[iPhone]]<ref name="iPhone">{{cite web | url=http://www.macworld.com/article/132771/2008/04/unity.html | title=Unity Game Engine Coming to iPhone| publisher=Macworld}}</ref> platforms. It can also produce [[browser game]]s that use the Unity web player [[plug-in (computing)|plugin]], supported on [[Apple Macintosh|Mac]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. The web player is also used for deployment as Mac widgets. Support for [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] have recently been added.

Unity won the [[Wall Street Journal]] 2010 Technology Innovation Award in the software category <ref>{{cite web | url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703904304575497473735761294.html | title=The WSJ Technology Innovation Award Winners, Category by Category | publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>. In 2009, [[Unity Technologies]] was named one of Gamasutra's "Top 5 Game Companies of 2009" <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/26243/Gamasutras_Best_Of_2009_Top_5_Game_Companies.php |title=Gamasutra's Best of 2009: Top 5 Game Companies|publisher=Gamasutra}}</ref> for Unity. Unity was a runner-up in the ''Best OS X Graphics'' category in the [[Apple Design Awards|2006 Apple Design Awards]] <ref name=ada2006>{{cite web | url=http://www.macnn.com/articles/06/08/09/apple.design.awards.2006/| title=Apple Design Awards 2006 winners | publisher=MacNN}}</ref>. 

==Major features==
* [[Integrated development environment]] with hierarchical, visual editing, detailed property inspectors and live game preview.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://tale-of-tales.com/blog/the-graveyard-post-mortem/#chapter2 | title=Tale of Tales: The Graveyard post mortem| publisher=Tale of Tales}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://creativemac.digitalmedianet.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=82608&afterinter=true | title=Unity 1.5.1 review| publisher=Creative Mac}}</ref>
* Deployment  on multiple platforms:
** As a [[Microsoft Windows]] or [[Mac OS X]] executable
** On the web (via the Unity Web Player plugin for [[Internet Explorer]], [[Firefox]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], [[Mozilla]], [[Netscape]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[Google Chrome]] and [[Camino]]) on Windows and OSX.
** As a Mac OS X [[Dashboard (software)|Dashboard]] widget
** For Nintendo [[Wii]] <ref name=Wii /> (requires additional license)
** As an [[iPhone]]/[[iPad]] application <ref name=iPhone /> (requires additional license)
** For Google [[Android (operating system)|Android]] <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=27558 | title=Unity Announces Support for Android | publisher=Gamasutra}}</ref> (requires additional license, currently available for pre-order)
** For Microsoft [[Xbox 360]] (requires additional license)
** For Sony [[PlayStation 3]] (requires additional license)
* [[digital asset|Assets]] loaded into Unity and are automatically imported, and are re-imported if the asset is updated <ref>{{cite web | url=http://unity3d.com/unity/features/asset-importing | title=Features: Asset Importing| publisher=Unity Technologies}}</ref>.  Unity supports integration with [[3ds Max]], [[Maya (software)|Maya]], [[Blender (software)|Blender]], [[Cinema 4D]], and [[Cheetah3D]].
* Graphics engine uses [[Direct3D]] (Windows), [[OpenGL]] (Mac, Windows), [[OpenGL ES]] (iPhone OS), and proprietary APIs (Wii) <ref>{{cite web | url=http://unity3d.com/unity/features/graphics | title=Features: Graphical Fidelity| publisher=Unity Technologies}}</ref>.
* Support for [[Bump mapping]], [[Reflection mapping]], [[Parallax mapping]], [[Screen Space Ambient Occlusion]], dynamic shadows using [[shadow map]]s, render-to-texture and full-screen post processing effects.
* ShaderLab language for using shaders, supporting both declarative "programming" of the fixed-function pipeline and shader programs written in [[Cg programming language|Cg]] or [[GLSL]] <ref>{{cite web | url=http://unity3d.com/unity/features/shaders | title=Features: Shaders| publisher=Unity Technologies}}</ref>. A shader can include multiple variants and a declarative fallback specification, allowing Unity to detect the best variant for the current video card and if none are compatible, fall back to an alternative shader that may sacrifice features for broader compatibility.
* Built-in Support for [[NVIDIA|Nvidia's]] (formerly [[Ageia|Ageia's]]) [[PhysX]] [[physics engine]] <ref>{{cite web | url=http://unity3d.com/unity/features/physics | title=Features: Advanced Physics| publisher=Unity Technologies}}</ref>, version 2.8.3 (as of Unity 3.0) with added support for real time cloth on arbitrary and skinned meshes, thick ray casts, and collision layers.
* Game Scripting via Mono <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mono-project.com/Companies_Using_Mono | title=Companies Using Mono| publisher=Mono Project}}</ref>. Scripting is built on [[Mono (software)|Mono]], the open source implementation of the [[.NET Framework]].  Programmers can use UnityScript (a custom language with [[JavaScript]]-inspired syntax), [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] or [[Boo programming language|Boo]] (which has a [[Python (programming language)|Python]]-inspired syntax).
* The Unity Asset Server - A version control solution for all game assets and scripts, using PostgreSql as a backend.
* Audio system built on [[FMOD]] library, with ability to play back [[Ogg Vorbis]] compressed audio.
* Video playback using [[Theora]] codec <ref>{{cite web | url=http://unity3d.com/unity/features/audio-and-video | title=Features: Audio and Video| publisher=Unity Technologies}}</ref>.
* A terrain and vegetation engine <ref>{{cite web | url=http://unity3d.com/unity/features/terrains | title=Features: Terrains| publisher=Unity Technologies}}</ref>, supporting tree billboarding.
* Occlusion Culling with [[Umbra Software|Umbra]] (only in Unity 3).
* Built-in [[Lightmap]]ping and [[Global illumination]] with [[Beast (software)|Beast]]  (only in Unity 3).
* Multiplayer networking using [[Raknet]].

==Unity Asset Server==
The Unity Asset Server is a [[revision control|version control]] solution for all game assets and scripts <ref name=asset-server>{{cite web | url=http://unity3d.com/unity/features/unity-asset-server| title=Features: Unity Asset Server | publisher=Unity Technologies}}</ref>. The asset server supports multi-gigabyte projects with thousands of multi-megabyte files. Import settings and other metadata are stored and versioned while updates, commits, and graphical version comparisons are all performed inside the Unity Editor. When files are modified, their status is updated instantly. The Unity Asset Server runs on the open source [[PostgreSQL]] database server and is available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.   It lacks support for branches, and obviously for branch merges.

Asset server has an extra cost of $499 per copy of Unity, and requires the user to have a Unity Pro License.

==Licensing==
There are two main licenses: ''Unity'' and ''Unity Pro''  <ref name=licensing>{{cite web | url=http://unity3d.com/unity/licenses| title=Unity License Comparison | publisher=Unity Technologies}}</ref>, with the Pro version being available for a price and the non Pro version being free.  The ''Pro'' version has additional features, like render-to-texture and post-processing effects. The Free version, on the other hand, displays a splash screen (in standalone games) and a watermark (in web games).

Both Unity and Unity Pro include the development environment, tutorials, sample projects and content, support via forum, wiki, and future updates in the same major version (i.e. buying Unity Pro 3.0 gets all future Unity Pro 3.x updates for free).

Unity for iPhone and Unity for Android are add-ons to existing Unity purchase.<ref name=iPhone />

Source code, educational and console ([[Xbox 360]], [[Playstation 3]], and [[Wii]]) licenses are negotiated on a case by case basis.
