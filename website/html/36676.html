<html> <head> <title>TM1</title></head><body>[[IBM]] [[Cognos]] '''TM1''' (formerly [[Applix]] TM1) is enterprise planning software used to implement collaborative planning, budgeting and forecasting solutions, as well as analytical and reporting applications. Data in IBM Cognos TM1 is stored and represented as [[MOLAP|multidimensional OLAP]] [[OLAP cube | cubes]], with data being stored at the "leaf" level. Computations on the leaf data are performed in real-time (for example, to aggregate numbers up a dimensional hierarchy). IBM Cognos TM1 includes a data orchestration environment for accessing external data and systems, as well as capabilities designed for common business planning and budgeting requirements (e.g. workflow, top-down adjustments).

Several new features were added to IBM Cognos TM1 9.5, the most visible being TM1 Contributor, which combines an OLAP engine with the enterprise planning capabilities of IBM Cognos Planning in a Web-based client. Other features include an "Undo/Redo" capability that lets users store a collection of data value changes and walk back through the actions to undo them; pick lists for cells to reduce the amount of data entry performed; sandboxes for creating personal modeling scenarios; and data entry shortcuts.

Another Web client option for IBM Cognos TM1 is ''IBM Cognos TM1 Web,'' which enables business users to develop and publish web-based applications, using [[Microsoft Excel]] as an authoring medium. IBM Cognos TM1 Web is developed in [[ASP.NET]], and is compatible with [[Microsoft Internet Explorer]] and [[Mozilla Firefox]].

With its flagship TM1 product line, Applix was the purest OLAP vendor among publicly traded independent BI vendors prior to OLAP industry consolidation in 2007, and had the greatest growth rate.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bi-verdict.com/fileadmin/FreeAnalyses/consolidations.htm |title= Consolidations in the BI industry |author= Nigel Pendse |date= 2008-03-07 |work=The BI Verdict (The OLAP Report) | accessdate=2010-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bi-verdict.com/fileadmin/FreeAnalyses/Comment_OLAP_revival.htm |title= Commentary: The OLAP Revival |author= Carsten Bange |date= 2008-11-14 |work= The BI Verdict (The OLAP Report) | accessdate=2010-02-20}}</ref>
