This article describes '''sound symbolic''' or '''[[mimetic]] words''' in the [[Japanese language]]. Most languages have such words; for example, "bang", "zap", "ding", "slither", "pop", etc. in [[English language|English]]. Sound symbolic words occur more often in Japanese than in English—they are found in formal as well as vernacular language.

These words cannot all be considered [[onomatopoeia]]. Many mimetic words in Japanese are for things that don't make any noise originally, most clearly demonstrated by しいんと ''shiinto'', meaning "silently".

==Categories==
They can be classified into three main categories:

*Phonomime or [[onomatopoeia]] (擬声語 ''giseigo'' or 擬音語 ''giongo'')
:words that mimic actual sounds. ''Giseigo'' refers to sounds made by living things, while ''Giongo'' refers to sounds made by inanimate objects.
*Phenomime (擬態語 ''gitaigo'')
:mimetic words to represent non-auditory senses.
*Psychomime (also called 擬態語 ''gitaigo'' or 擬情語　''gijōgo'')
:mimetic words that represent psychological states or bodily feelings.

While [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] words abound in every language, phenomimes and psychomimes are much rarer.

In [[Japanese grammar]], sound symbolic words function as [[adverb]]s, often taking the particle と (''to'') because they are seen as quotations. Most sound symbolic words can be applied to only a handful of verbs or adjectives. Japanese learners would be well advised to learn these words together with their possible referents. In the examples below, the classified verb or adjective is placed in square brackets.

==Other types==

In their ''Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar'', Seiichi Makino and Michio Tsutsui point out several other types of sound symbolism in Japanese, that relate [[phoneme]]s and psychological states. For example, the [[nasal consonant|nasal]] sound {{IPA|[n]}} gives a more personal and speaker-oriented impression than the [[velar consonant|velars]] {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[ɡ]}}; this contrast can be easily noticed in pairs of [[synonym]]s such as ので ''node'' and から ''kara'' which both mean ''because'', but with the first being perceived as more subjective. This relationship can be correlated with phenomimes containing nasal and velar sounds: While phenomimes containing [[nasal consonant]]s give the feeling of tactuality and warmth, those containing [[velar consonant]]s tend to represent hardness, sharpness, and suddenness.

Similarly, [[Japanese adjectives|i-type adjective]]s that contain the fricative {{IPAblink|ɕ}} in the group ''shi'' tend to represent human emotive states, such as in the words 悲しい ''kanashii'' (''sad''), 寂しい ''sabishii'' (''lonely''), 嬉しい ''ureshii'' (''happy''), and 楽しい ''tanoshii'' (''enjoyable''). This too is correlated with those phenomimes and psychomimes containing the same fricative sound, for example しとしとと降る ''shitoshito to furu'' (''to rain / snow quietly'') and しゅんとする ''shun to suru'' (''to be dispirited'').

The use of the [[consonant length|gemination]] can create a more emphatic or emotive version of a word, as in the following pairs of words: ぴたり / ぴったり ''pitari / pittari'' (''tightly''), やはり / やっぱり ''yahari / yappari'' (''as expected''), 放し / っ放し ''hanashi / ppanashi'' (''leaving, having left [something] in a particular state''), and many others.
