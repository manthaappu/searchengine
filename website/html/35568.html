<html> <head> <title>StarOffice Basic</title></head><body>'''StarOffice Basic''' (also known as '''StarBasic''' and '''OOoBasic''') is a dialect of [[BASIC]] that is included with the [[OpenOffice.org]] and [[StarOffice]] [[office suite]]s.

Although StarBasic itself is similar to other dialects of Basic, such as [[Microsoft]]'s [[Visual Basic for Applications|VBA]], the [[application programming interface]] (API) is very different, as the example below of a [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] illustrates.

<source lang="QBasic">
 Sub ParaCount
 '
 ' Count number of paragraphs in a text document
 '
   Dim Doc As Object, Enum As Object, Count As Long
   Doc = ThisComponent
 ' Is this a text document?
   If Not Doc.SupportsService("com.sun.star.text.TextDocument") Then
     MsgBox "This macro must be run from a text document", 64, "Error"
     Exit Sub
   End If
   Count = 0
 ' Examine each component - paragraph or table?
   Enum = Doc.Text.CreateEnumeration
   While Enum.HasMoreElements
     TextEl = Enum.NextElement
 ' Is the component a paragraph?
     If TextEl.SupportsService("com.sun.star.text.Paragraph") Then 
     Count = Count + 1
     End If
   Wend
 'Display result
   MsgBox Count, 0, "Paragraph Count"
 End Sub
