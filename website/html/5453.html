<html> <head> <title>Capacitively coupled plasma</title></head><body>A '''capacitively coupled plasma (CCP)''' is one of the most common types of industrial [[plasma source]]s. It essentially consists of two metal [[electrode]]s separated by a small distance, placed in a reactor. The gas pressure in the reactor can be lower than atmosphere or it can be [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheric]]. 

A typical CCP system is driven by a single [[Radio frequency|radio-frequency]] (RF) power supply, typically at 13.56 MHz<ref>UK Wireless Telegraphy (Short Range Devices) (Exemption) Regulations 1993 [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1993/Uksi_19931591_en_2.htm]</ref>. One of two electrodes is connected to the power supply, and the other one is [[Ground (electricity)|grounded]]. As this configuration is similar in principle to a [[capacitor]] in an electric circuit, the plasma formed in this configuration is called a capacitively coupled plasma. 

When an [[electric field]] is generated between electrodes, atoms are ionized and release electrons.  The [[electron]]s in the gas are accelerated by the RF field and can ionize the gas directly or indirectly by [[collision]]s, producing [[secondary electrons]]. When the electric field is strong enough, it can lead to what is known as [[electron avalanche]].  After [[avalanche breakdown]], the gas becomes electrically [[conductive]] due to abundant free electrons. Often it accompanies light emission from excited atoms or molecules in the gas. When visible light is produced, [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] generation can be indirectly observed even with bare eyes.

A variation on capacitively coupled plasma involves isolating one of the electrodes, usually with a [[capacitor]].  The capacitor appears like a [[short circuit]] to the high frequency RF field, but like an [[open circuit]] to [[direct current|DC]] field.  Electrons impinge on the electrode in the [[Debye sheath|sheath]], and the electrode quickly acquires a negative charge (or self-bias) because the capacitor does not allow it to discharge to ground.  This sets up a secondary, DC field across the plasma in addition to the [[alternating current|AC]] field.  Massive [[ion]]s are unable to react to the quickly changing AC field, but the strong, persistent DC field accelerates them toward the self-biased electrode.  These energetic ions are exploited in many [[microfabrication]] processes (see [[Reactive-ion etching|RIE]]) by placing a substrate on the isolated (self-biased) electrode.

CCPs have wide applications in the semiconductor processing industry for [[thin film deposition]] (see [[sputtering]], [[PECVD]]) and [[Etching (microfabrication)#Plasma_etching|etching]].
