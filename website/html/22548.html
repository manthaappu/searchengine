<html> <head> <title>Logical graph</title></head><body>A '''logical [[graph (mathematics)|graph]]''' is a special type of diagramatic structure in any one of several systems of graphical [[syntax (logic)|syntax]] that [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] developed for [[logic]].

In his papers on ''[[qualitative logic]]'', ''[[entitative graph]]s'', and ''[[existential graph]]s'', Peirce developed several versions of a graphical [[formal system|formalism]], or a graph-theoretic [[formal language]], designed to be interpreted for logic.

In the century since Peirce initiated this line of development, a variety of formal systems have branched out from what is abstractly the same formal base of graph-theoretic structures.
