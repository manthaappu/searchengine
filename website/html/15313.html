'''Gizzard''' is an [[open source]] [[sharding]] [[Software framework|framework]] to create custom [[fault-tolerant]], distributed [[databases]]. It was initially used by [[Twitter]] and emerged out of a wide variety of data storage problems. Gizzard operates as a [[middleware]] networking service that runs on the [[Java Virtual Machine]]. It manages [[Partition (database)|partitioning]] data across arbitrary backend datastores, that allows it to be accessed efficiently.<ref>http://engineering.twitter.com/2010/04/introducing-gizzard-framework-for.html</ref><ref>http://www.socialtimes.com/2010/04/twitter-open-sources-new-distributed-database-solution-gizzard/</ref> The partitioning rules are stored in a forwarding table that maps key ranges to partitions. Each partition manages its own [[Replication (computer science)|replication]] through a declarative replication [[tree]]. Gizzard handles both physical and logical shards. Physical shards point to a physical database backend whereas logical shards are trees of other shards.<ref>http://thechangelog.com/post/502232871/gizzard-twitter-just-sharded</ref> In addition Gizzard also supports [[Data migration|migrations]] and gracefully handles failures. The system is made eventually consistent by requiring that all write operations are [[idempotent]] and [[Commutativity|commutative]]. As operations fail they are retried at a later time. Gizzard is available at [[GitHub]] and licensed under the [[Apache License]].
