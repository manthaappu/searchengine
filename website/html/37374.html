'''''The Map Library''''' is a project of '''The Map Maker Trust''' [[Charitable organization|charity]], and supported by '''Map Maker Ltd.''', for the supplying of free [[GIS]] data. The project website also hosts free conversion software for [[raster graphics|raster]] and [[vector graphics|vector]] files. As of November 2008, the only data sets available were for the continents of [[Africa]] and [[Central America]].

== Statement of purpose ==
From the website...

:''The idea behind the Map Library is that the lack of good, simple maps is a serious obstacle to development in all kinds of fields, from health care to urban management, from de-mining to environmental protection. The library's purpose is two fold: to make public domain mapping data more readily available for developing countries, and to provide free, easy to use software to facilitate map making by non-experts. The Map Library delivers data and software both on the internet and by post on CD for those with poor or no internet access.''

== Data format and conversion ==
The project data is managed in part by two pieces of software, each supporting different file formats and conversions.

* '''''Raster Converter''''' handles [[ECW (file format)|ECW]] files: these can be converted to [[BMP file format|BMP]], [[TIFF]], and with external libraries, [[JPEG]], and [[JPEG 2000]].
* '''''Vector Converter''''' handles MLB ("map-library") files: these files can be converted to data files for [[ArcView]], [[AutoCAD]], and several other formats.

== Data sources ==
The project uses data from [[NASA]] mapping projects, [[Famine Early Warning Systems Network]], and the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]].
