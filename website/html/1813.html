'''Analytical mechanics''' is a term used for a refined, highly mathematical form of [[classical mechanics]], constructed from the 18th century onwards as a formulation of the subject as founded by [[Isaac Newton]]. Often the term '''vectorial mechanics''' is applied to the form based on Newton's work, to contrast it with analytical mechanics. This distinction makes sense because analytical mechanics uses two ''scalar'' properties of motion, the kinetic and potential energies, instead of vector forces, to analyze the motion.<ref name=Lanczos>{{cite book |title=The variational principles of mechanics |author=Cornelius Lanczos |page=Introduction, pp. xxi–xxix |edition=4rth Edition |publisher=Dover Publications Inc. |location= New York |isbn=0-486-65067-7 |year=1970 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZWoYYr8wk2IC&pg=PR4&dq=isbn=0486650677&sig=NL35zjprkiKvcdCyu5qa9AWQBLY#PPR21,M1 |nopp=true}}</ref> 

The subject has two parts: [[Lagrangian mechanics]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]. The Lagrangian formulation identifies the actual path followed by the motion as a selection of the path over which the [[time integral]] of [[kinetic energy]] is least, assuming the total energy to be fixed, and imposing no conditions on the time of transit. The Hamiltonian formulation is more general, allowing time-varying energy, identifying the path followed to be the one with least ''[[Principle of least action|action]]'' (the integral over the path of the difference between kinetic and potential energies), holding the departure and arrival times fixed.<ref name=Lanczos/><ref name=note>The term ''action'' has various meanings. This definition is only one, and corresponds specifically to an integral of the system [[Lagrangian]].</ref> These approaches underlie the [[path integral formulation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]. 

It began with [[d'Alembert's principle]]. By analogy with [[Fermat's principle]], which is the [[variational principle]] in [[geometric optics]], [[Maupertuis' principle]] was discovered in classical mechanics.

Using generalized [[coordinate]]s, we obtain [[Lagrange's equations]]. Using the [[Legendre transformation]], we obtain [[generalized momentum]] and the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]]. 

[[Hamilton's canonical equations]] provides [[integral equation|integral]], while [[Lagrange's equation]] provides [[differential equations]]. Finally we may derive the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]].

The study of the solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equations leads naturally to the study of [[symplectic manifold]]s and [[symplectic topology]].<ref name=Arnold>{{cite book |title=Mathematical methods of classical mechanics |author=VI Arnolʹd |year=1989 |publisher=Springer |edition=2nd Edition |page= Chapter 8 |isbn=978-0-387-96890-2 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Pd8-s6rOt_cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn=9780387968902#PPT18,M1 |nopp=true}}</ref><ref name=Doran>{{cite book |title=Geometric algebra for physicists |author=C Doran & A Lasenby |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=§12.3, pp. 432–439 |isbn=978-0-521-71595-9 |year=2003 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9780521715959&qt=owc_search}}</ref>  In this formulation, the solutions of the Hamilton–Jacobi equations are the [[integral curve]]s of [[Hamiltonian vector field]]s.
