The '''Genie Engine''' is a [[game engine]] developed by [[Ensemble Studios]] and used in several popular [[Personal computer game|computer games]], such as ''[[Age of Empires (video game)|Age of Empires]]'', ''[[Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings|Age of Empires II]]'' and its [[Age of Empires II: The Conquerors|expansion]] (but is not used in other Ensemble Studios games) and ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds]]''. Some of those games have been ported to the [[Apple Mac]].

==Development==
The Genie engine was developed as the basis for [[Ensemble Studios]] first game, ''[[Age of Empires]]'' which had the development name of "Dawn of Man".<ref>{{cite book|last=Grossman|first=Austin|title=Postmortems from Game Developer|publisher=Focal Press|year=2003|isbn=1578202140}}</ref> The designers received much of their inspiration from the game ''[[Civilization (computer game)|Civilization]]'', with its proven historical setting; this was noted among reviewers as something positive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/games/empires/behind.htm|title=Behind the Scenes|publisher=Microsoft.com|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> ''Age of Empires''  was designed by [[Bruce Shelley]],.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/games/empires/behind_bruce.htm|title=Behind the Scenes: Bruce Shelly|publisher=Microsoft.com|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> Tony Goodman (in charge of the game's artwork),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/games/empires/behind_tony.htm|title=Behind the Scenes: Tony Goodman|publisher=Microsoft.com|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref>  and [[Dave Pottinger]] (in charge of the game's [[artificial intelligence]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/games/empires/behind_dave.htm|title=Behind the Scenes: Dave Pottinger|publisher=Microsoft.com|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> The game was described as "''[[Civilization II]]'' meets ''[[Warcraft II]]''"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/oldsite/games/pc/strategy/ageofempires.htm |title=Build an Empire to Surpass Microsoft's|publisher=[[Game Revolution]]|author=Daniel Gies|accessdate=2008-02-24|date=November 1997}}</ref> and this shows in the game's engine design. Like ''Warcraft'' it is [[real time strategy]] but unlike ''Warcraft'' and like ''[[Civilization II]]'' it is historical and has an [[Isometric projection|isometric]] perspective.

The sequel's, ''The Age of Kings'', design team intended to complete the game within a year by using [[source code|code]] from the original and reusing the [[Genie (game engine)|Genie]] [[game engine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/gdcarchive/2000/terrano.doc |title=The Art of Empires|format=[[.doc]]|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref> Several months into the process they found they would not be able to complete a game of the quality they sought in that time. Ensemble Studios informed Microsoft they would need another year and instead created ''[[Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome]]'', an easily-developed expansion pack of ''Age of Empires'', as a compromise which could be released for Christmas 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20000307/pritchard_01.htm|title=Postmortem: Ensemble Studios' Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings - Catching Up|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|author=Matt Pritchard |date=2000-03-07|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref> To help meet the next year's deadline, additional [[programmer]]s, artists, and designers were employed.<ref name="Matt Pritchard">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20000307/pritchard_02.htm |title=Postmortem: Ensemble Studios' Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings — What Went Right|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|author=Matt Pritchard|date=2000-03-07|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref>

The original ''Age of Empires'' had been criticized for its [[artificial intelligence]] (AI). Because the original AI did not "[[Cheating in video games|cheat]]"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/games/empires/behind_dave.htm |title=Dave Pottinger|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref> by attributing itself extra resources or using other techniques the human player could not, it was easier to defeat than in many other real-time strategy games. For ''The Age of Kings'', Ensemble Studios attempted to develop a more powerful AI system that did not compromise by cheating. Industry veteran Mario Grimani led Ensemble Studios in the creation of the new system. To overcome another significant objection to ''Age of Empires''—that of path finding—the team completely redesigned the [[game engine]]'s movement system.<ref name="Matt Pritchard"/> The AI will still cheat at higher setting, giving itself extra resources every so many minutes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The team was less successful in resolving other issues; programmer Matt Pritchard complained following the release of ''Age of Empires'' that there was still no process by which [[patch (gaming)|patches]] could be issued. Extensive [[Cheating in video games|cheating]] in multiplayer games of ''Age of Empires'' came as a result of several bugs in the game, which resulted in Microsoft promising Ensemble Studios there would be a patch process for ''The Age of Kings''. On release, there were several bugs that needed immediate attention, but the patch process was not yet ready. The first patch was released 11 months later.<ref name="Gama3">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20000307/pritchard_03.htm |title=Postmortem: Ensemble Studios' Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings — What Went Wrong|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|author=Matt Pritchard|date=2000-03-07|accessdate=2008-09-21}}</ref><ref name="MSDls">{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/games/age2/downloads.htm |title=Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings Downloads|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=2008-09-21}}</ref>

Ensemble Studios developed a new [[terrain rendering|terrain system]] for ''The Age of Kings'', with [[3D graphics|3D]] presentation capabilities that were vastly superior to those of ''Age of Empires''. Pritchard noted an improvement in the team's artistic abilities following their work on the past two games, and he is noted as saying that "''AoK'' became a showcase for their improved talent".<ref name="Matt Pritchard"/> However, he complained about the lack of an art asset management tool, while other departments gained new tools and automated procedures to assist in design and [[play test]]ing.<ref name="Matt Pritchard"/><ref name="Gama3" />

''The Age of Kings'' saw the introduction of a [[event-driven programming|trigger]]s system for its scenario editor. The triggers allow messages to be displayed, or actions to take place, based on pre-set criteria or "events".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/069/069876p1.html |title=Age of Empires II: The Barbarossa Campaign|author=Greg Street|date=1999-08-27|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-09-27}}</ref> The scenario editor was also improved by the new AI system. The AI and trigger systems interacted regularly in the single player campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/070/070268p1.html |title=Age of Empires II: The Genghis Khan Campaign|author=Greg Street|date=1999-09-10|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-09-27}}</ref> Numerous upgrades were added in ''The Conquerors'' but this was mostly in terms of gameplay and not engine advancements.

''Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds'' was developed by [[LucasArts]] by licensing the [[Genie (game engine)|Genie]] game engine from [[Ensemble Studios]].  The game, as well as the Clone Campaigns expansion pack, was designed and directed by [[Garry M. Gaber]].<ref>[http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,26679/ MobyGames - Garry Gaber]</ref>

== Features ==
The Genie Engine has several features that are common across all its games, including a scenario editor, campaigns, LAN, serial and TCP/IP multiplayer, background music amongst others. The engine uses an [[Isometric projection|isometric]] tile set, unlike other [[real-time strategy]] engines such as the one used for [[Warcraft]].

== Usage ==
{{Original research|section|date=October 2009}}
In general, the engine is easy to use. Units can be highlighted by dragging a box around them, or left-clicking. Right-clicking tells a unit to attack another enemy unit or building. Groups of units are remarkably well-disciplined in that they adhere far more rigidly to formations in movement and while stationary than units in other game engines.

The computer's A.I. is usually made up of sending "skirmish" type attacks. These usually are characterized by constantly sending a small (but also easily overwhelmed) number of units (usually 1 or two) that attack from range then run away before being attacked. Computer AI will also do this with melee units, with far less effectiveness, as the melee units must come much closer to opposing forces before being able to do damage and withdraw. While innovative it is nearly impossible for a human to effectively counter with non-ranged (also non-siege explained later) units (unless interceptor units are assembled in advance, as they typically will be after a few of these attacks) due to micromanagement issues.  It is also almost useless in that it does little more than annoy (albeit continuously) a human player.

Enemy A.I. is extremely effective (whatever the problems of individual unit AI) at negating AOE (area of effect) siege units. When fired upon the A.I. will instantly move to a safe location, effectively nullifying the effectiveness of nearly 1/3 of the available units in the game. A single computer controlled cavalry archer is capable of dodging 40 cannons or catapults for an extensive period of time. However, it is also common to see computer units move into the line of fire of active AOE units.

The game lacks an "attack through" command. An attack through command orders the selected unit(s) to move to a selected area attacking all units along the way. Instead on games based on the Genie platform, the player must tell the selected unit(s) to stop, then to attack individual units. This frequently causes a mis-click  causing all units to stop attacking and move to an unneeded area. It severely reduces the effectiveness of melee units, most notably slower moving infantry. This can be somewhat levied by using patrol command, which sends unit back and forth, while attacking units along the way.

The Genie engine was succeeded by the ''[[Age of Mythology]]'' engine used by the games in that series as well as ''[[Age of Empires III]]'' and its expansions. The most significant changes being the updated graphics engine and the inclusion of the [[Havok (software)|Havok physics]] [[middleware]] engine<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/594/594629p1.html |title=Age of Empires III|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=Steve Butts|date=2005-03-09|accessdate=2008-06-17}}</ref> and the introduction of [[Age of Empires III#Home Cities|home cities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ageofempires3.com/age3/GameFeatures/HomeCity.aspx |title=Home City|publisher=[[Ensemble Studios]]|accessdate=2008-01-18}}</ref> Reception towards ''Age of Empires III'' was mixed; [[Game Revolution]] described it as "about as much fun" as a history textbook, while [[GameZone]] argued it was "one of the best looking games, much less an RTS game, that is out on the market currently".<ref name=Age3MC>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/ageofempires3 |title=Age of Empires III (pc: 2005)|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2008-06-17}}</ref>
