The '''[[Cray]] XT5''' is an updated version of the [[Cray XT4]] [[supercomputer]], launched on November 6, 2007. It includes a faster version of the XT4's SeaStar2 interconnect router called [[PowerPC 400#SeaStar|SeaStar2+]], and can be configured either with XT4 compute blades, which have four [[dual-core]] [[AMD Opteron]] processor sockets, or XT5 blades, with eight sockets supporting dual or quad-core Opterons.  The XT5 uses a 3-dimensional torus network topology.

The XT5 family run the [[Cray Linux Environment]], formerly known as [[UNICOS]]/lc.<ref name="xtss2.1">{{cite book|title=Cray XT System Software 2.1 Release Overview (S–2425–21)|publisher=[[Cray|Cray Inc]]|date=2008|url=http://www.nersc.gov/vendor_docs/cray/S-2425-21-OS2.1-Release-Overview.pdf}}</ref> This incorporates [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server]] and Cray's [[Compute Node Linux]].

The '''XT5h''' (''hybrid'') variant also includes support for [[Cray X2]] [[vector processor]] blades, and Cray XR1 blades which combine Opterons with [[FPGA]]-based Reconfigurable Processor Units (RPUs) provided by DRC Computer Corporation.

The '''XT5m''' variant is a mid-ranged supercomputer with most of the features of the XT5, but having a 2-dimensional torus network topology and scalable to 6 cabinets.

In the fall of 2008, Cray delivered a 1.3 petaflops XT5 system to [[National Center for Computational Sciences]] at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratories]].  This system, with over 150,000 processing cores, was dubbed "[[Jaguar (computer)|Jaguar]]" and was the second fastest system in the world for the [[LINPACK]] benchmark,<ref>[http://www.top500.org/lists/2008/11 TOP500 November 2008]</ref> the fastest system available for open science and the first system to exceed a [[FLOPS|petaflops]] sustained performance on a 64-bit scientific application.<ref>[http://www.nccs.gov/jaguar/ National Center for Computational Sciences: Jaguar]</ref>

Jaguar underwent an upgrade to 224,256 cores in 2009, after which its performance jumped to 1.75 petaflops, taking it to the number one position in the 34th edition of the [[TOP500]] list in fall 2009.<ref>[http://www.top500.org/lists/2009/11 TOP500 November 2009]</ref> It remained number one in the June 2010 edition,<ref name=top500-2010-06>[http://www.top500.org/lists/2010/06 TOP500 June 2010]</ref> but in October 2010 was surpassed by the Chinese [[Tianhe-1A]], which achieved a performance of 2.57 petaflops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11644252|title=China claims supercomputer crown|publisher=BBC News Online|date=28 October 2010|accessdate=29 October 2010}}</ref>

Another XT5 system, Kraken, with 99,072 cores and 0.83 petaflops, is currently at position number eight in the [[TOP500]] list as of November 2010.<ref name=top500-2010-06 />
