'''ART''' is a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[image file format]] used mostly by the [[AOL|America Online]] (AOL) [[client (computing)|client]] [[software]]. The ART format ([[file extension]] ".art") holds a single still [[image]] that has been highly [[Image compression|compressed]]. Originally, the compression was developed by the [[Johnson-Grace|Johnson-Grace Company]], which was then acquired by the AOL [[Online service provider|service]].  When an image is converted to the ART format, the image is analyzed and the software decides what compression technique would be best.<ref>[http://www.webreference.com/dev/graphics/compress.html "Optimizing Web Graphics: Compression"]</ref> [[Internet Explorer]] used to be able to display ART images but now is no longer capable.

The AOL service can automatically convert images [[downloading|downloaded]] from the [[Internet]] to the compressed ART format. This conversion, which can be turned off, reduces download time for the image file. Image display problems with the AOL [[web browser]] are addressed at [http://web.archive.org/web/20071026143856/http://webmaster.info.aol.com/faq.html#graphics America Online webmaster FAQ entry]. An art file opened with AOL picture viewer can be saved as another file type. 

ART files can be batch converted to [[BMP file format|BMP]], [[JPG]], and other file formats with rare graphics programs, such as Graphic Workshop Professional [http://www.mindworkshop.com/alchemy/gwspro.html] with an .art plug-in. Old versions of Internet Explorer can open and convert ART files to [[BMP file format|BMP]] files, through the File/[[Save As]] command.
