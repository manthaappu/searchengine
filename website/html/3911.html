'''BioLogue''' is a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Copenhagen]]-based [[Public-Private Partnership]] operating within the field of [[life sciences]]: [[biomedical research]], medicines development, education and training; science collaborations and [[Public-Private Partnership]] strategy. BioLogue is anchored in academia with support from and [[outreach]] to participating hospitals, the Danish Medicines Agency, [[pharma]] and [[biotech]] industry and other relevant organisations. Member companies are from the heart of [[Medicon Valley]] and include [[Novo Nordisk]], [[H. Lundbeck]], [[Nycomed]], [[TopoTarget]], [[Ferring Pharmaceuticals]], [[Capio]]-Unilabs, [[Bio-Rad]] and many more. The consortium provides a neutral platform for students, researchers and professionals to meet and collaborate on research themes of mutual interest. BioLogue's focus areas include [[translational research]], biomarkers, [[Medical imaging|imaging]], [[clinical research]] and [[biobanks]]. The overall aim of activities is to facilitate the development of novel medicines and related health care products, and to make them available to patients. The consortium is integrated with the university collaboration, Danish Pharma Consortium, and it has activities at both national and international levels, e.g. International Science Partnering Missions (e.g. Israel, United Kingdom, The Netherlands, USA) and European Technology Platform Initiatives. BioLogue was founded in 2005, and it is hosted by [[University of Copenhagen]].
