== Need for traffic optimization ==
[[Texas Transportation Institute]] estimates travel delays of 220,000,000 hours all over the U.S.  and between 17â€“55 hours of delay per person (in 2005)<ref>http://mobility.tamu.edu/ums/congestion_data/tables/national/table_6.pdf</ref> relating to congestion on the streets. Traffic device optimization hence becomes a significant aspect of operations.

== Techniques ==
Several techniques exist to reduce delay of traffic. Generally the algorithms attempt to reduce delays (user time), stops, emissions, or some other measure of effectiveness. Many optimization software are geared towards pretimed coordinated systems.

== Real time traffic control ==
Several systems are capable of monitoring the traffic arrivals and adjusting timings based on the detected inputs. Traffic Detectors may range from Metal Detectors to Detectors that use Image Detection. Metal detectors are the most popular in use. Image detection devices exhibit numerous problems including degradation during bad weather and lighting. 

Traffic actuated signal systems use detectors to adjust timing for:
# Only the main street - semi-actuated system
# Both main and cross streets - fully-actuated system.

==Criticism==
It has been suggested that the benefits of traffic optimization have never been scientifically justified. It inherently favors motorized traffic over alternate modes such as pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit users and may promote more auto use.<ref>Michael J. Vandeman, [http://home.pacbell.net/mjvande/synch4 "Is Traffic Signal Synchronization Justifiable?"], April 15, 1994</ref> It is suggested that an alternate approach could involve [[traffic calming]], and a conceptual focus on the movement of people and goods rather than vehicles.
