A '''symlink race''' is a kind of [[Vulnerability (computer science)|software security vulnerability]] that results from a program creating [[computer file|files]] in an insecure manner. A malicious user can create a [[symbolic link]] to a file not otherwise accessible to him or her. When the [[setuid|privileged]] program creates a file of the same name as the symbolic link, it actually creates the linked-to file instead, possibly inserting content provided by the malicious user.

It is called a "[[race condition|race]]" because in its typical manifestation, the program checks to see if a file by that name already exists, then creates the file. An attacker must create the link in the interval between the check and when the file is created.

==Example==
In this naive example, the [[Unix]] program <tt>foo</tt> is <tt>[[setuid]]</tt>. Its function is to retrieve information for the [[account (computing)|account]]s specified by the user. For "efficiency", it sorts the requested accounts into a temporary file (<tt>/tmp/foo</tt> naturally) before making the queries.

The directory <tt>/tmp</tt> is world-writable. Malicious user Mallory creates a symbolic link to the file <tt>/.rhosts</tt> named <tt>/tmp/foo</tt>. Then, he invokes <tt>foo</tt> with <tt>+ +</tt> as the requested account. The program creates the (temporary) file <tt>/tmp/foo</tt> (really creating <tt>/.rhosts</tt>) and puts the requested account (<tt>+ +</tt>) in it. It removes the temporary file (merely removing the symbolic link).

Now the <tt>/.rhosts</tt> contains <tt>+ +</tt>, which is the incantation necessary to allow anyone to use <tt>[[rlogin]]</tt> to log into the computer as the [[superuser]].

==Workaround==
The standard library function ''mkstemp(3)'' can be used to safely create temporary files. For shell scripts, the system utility <tt>mktemp</tt> does the same thing.
