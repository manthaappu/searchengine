<html> <head> <title>Base (group theory)</title></head><body>Let <math>G</math> be a finite [[permutation group]] acting on a set <math>\Omega</math>.  A sequence 

:<math>B = [\beta_1,\beta_2,...,\beta_k]</math> 

of ''k ''distinct elements of <math>\Omega</math> is a '''base''' for G if the only element of <math>G</math> which fixes every <math>\beta_i \in B</math> pointwise is the identity element of <math>G</math>.

We define the concept of a [[strong generating set]] relative to a base.  Bases and strong generating sets are concepts of importance in [[computational group theory]].  A base and a strong generating set (together often called a BSGS) for a group can be obtained using the [[Schreierâ€“Sims algorithm]].

It is often beneficial to deal with bases and strong generating sets as these may be easier to work with than the entire group. A group may have a small base compared to the set it acts on. In the "worst case", the [[symmetric group]]s and [[alternating group]]s have large bases (the symmetric group ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> has base size ''n'' &minus; 1), and there are often specialized algorithms that deal with these cases.
