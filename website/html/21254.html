== Coffee ==
Lavazza imports coffee from around the world.  Countries include Brazil and Colombia in [[South America]], Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Honduras in [[Central America]], Uganda in [[Africa]], Indonesia and Vietnam in [[Asia]] and the United States and Mexico in [[North America]].  Sustainable production concerns have led the company to develop the ¡Tierra! project, a [[sustainable agriculture]] program in Honduras, Colombia, and Peru, that seeks to  improve the quality of coffee as well as the environmental and working conditions of those communities.<ref name ="italtrade" />

Branded as "Italy's Favourite Coffee," the company claims that 16 out of the 20 million coffee purchasing families in Italy choose Lavazza.<ref name="history_0406" /> Among its offerings today are products such as Top Class, Super Crema, Crema e Gusto, Grand'Espresso, and Dek (decaffeinated).

== Retail ==
The company operates a number of retail coffee shops (similar to [[Starbucks]] and [[Caribou Coffee]]). The shops offer traditional coffee drinks as well as whole bean and ground coffee for home use.
