The '''margin''' of a single data point is defined to be the distance from the data point to a decision boundary.  Note that there are many distances and decision boundaries that may be appropriate for certain datasets and goals.  A [[margin classifier]] is a classifier that explicitly utilizes the margin of each example while learning a [[classifier]].  There are theoretical justifications (based on the [[VC dimension]]) as to why maximizing the margin (under some suitable constraints) may be beneficial for machine learning and statistical inferences algorithms.
