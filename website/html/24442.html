'''[[Microsoft]] Customer Care Framework (CCF)''' was a [[.NET Framework|Microsoft .NET]] desktop-based framework which was used to address issues faced by [[service provider]]s caused by multiple [[line of business]] (LOB) systems while interacting with their customers. It was discontinued though many of its core functions were moved to an add-in for the [[Microsoft Dynamics]] CRM product.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/serviceproviders/ccf/default.mspx]</ref>

The Customer Care Framework provided a core set of functions for customer support avenues including voice call via call center agents and Internet portals. The framework leveraged other Microsoft server products including the BizTalk Server, and SharePoint. CCF required the use of [[Microsoft SQL Server]] and [[Internet Information Services|Microsoft IIS]] for the server side, which it uses to provide a base core set of web services.

CCF is targeted at medium to large enterprises. CCF was originally developed for the large [[call center]] requirements of the [[telecommunication]] industry.

CCF is different from most products from Microsoft in that it is not an 'out of the box' solution but requires development and configuration to build a working customer solution. The framework allows for a [[Service-oriented architecture|SOA]] methodology<ref>Microsoft, Customer Care Framework 2005 .NET 2.0 Edition Deployment Guide, (September 2006), 8-9</ref><ref>Microsoft, [https://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?culture=en-US&EventID=1032289121&CountryCode=US MSDN Webcast: Customer Care Framework (Level 300)]. Microsoft Events, 18 February 2006.</ref><ref>Beal, Barney. [http://searchcrm.techtarget.com/news/1160411/Microsoft-expands-its-way-into-the-contact-center Microsoft expands its way into the contact center]. SearchCRM.com, 19 January 2006.</ref> on development on the server and agent desktop side, but this is not mandatory and non-SOA development can be done and is normally the case.

==CCF Components==

===Agent Desktop===
The primary user interface for CCF is the agent desktop. This is a desktop-based [[user interface]] (UI) that presents data aggregated from various [[Line of business]] (LOB) & [[Operations support system|OSS]]/[[Business support system|BSS]] application front ends and presents them in a unified view. CCF does not include an Agent Desktop application, rather samples including source code are provided as part of the framework.

===Application Integration Framework (AIF)===
The AIF manages the loading of the applications, integration and event brokering.  Through the use of adapters (see HAT below) applications can have custom integrations to account for both the technology of the hosted application as well as business processing.

===Hosted Application Toolkit (HAT)===
HAT allows for the separation of the business rules and the method used to integrate with the application. HAT uses Microsoft Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) to manage the business rules, Data Driven Adapters (DDAs) to manage the application directly, and Bindings written in XML to connect the two.  CCF 2009 SP1 ships with 3 DDAs: Win32, Web, and Java (JDK 1.6).  DDAs can be customized or extended for additional application types as needed.

==Similar Products==
There are a number of other products that are similar to CCF.

One is [[Jacada WorkSpace]], which is a [[Java EE]]-based solution which is used to wrap applications and present a web UI to clients.

[[OpenSpan]] produces a product using .Net that can integrate with CCF or operate standalone to integrate applications. OpenSpan also provides an IDE tool to create the integrations.<ref>[http://www.crm2day.com/content/t6_librarynews_1.php?news_id=123950]</ref>

[[Cicero Software]] likewise produces an application integration product with an IDE.

[[Corizon]] provides a platform for Enterprise Mashups that allows Composite applications to be created easily.
    
Microsoft has a free product called [[Composite UI Application Block]] (CAB) which can be used to build composite applications. CAB is used within CCF. CAB does not provide telephone or call center specific integrations, but has tight integration with [[Microsoft Visual Studio|Visual Studio]] and many samples including one for call centers. CAB on its own doesn't offer session management and multi-channel capability although the sample code does have some session features.
