'''Gallium3D''' is a [[software library]] for [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] [[device driver]]s being developed by [[VMware]], after they acquired Tungsten Graphics<ref name=tungsten-vmware /> – the original authors.

The Gallium3D library operates as a layer between the graphics [[Application programming interface|API]] and the [[operating system]] with the primary goal of making driver development easier, bundling otherwise duplicated code of several different drivers at a single point (this is done by providing a better division of labor, for example, leaving memory management to the kernel [[Direct Rendering Infrastructure|DRI]] driver) and to support modern hardware architectures. 

Gallium3D has been a part of [[Mesa 3D (OpenGL)|Mesa]] since 2009<ref>{{Cite web

== Differences from Mesa 3D ==
Gallium3D provides a unified [[Application programming interface|API]] exposing standard hardware functions, such as [[shader]] units found on modern hardware. Thus, 3D APIs such as [[OpenGL]] 1.x/2.x, OpenGL 3.x, [[OpenVG]], [[GPGPU]] infrastructure or even [[Direct3D]] (as found in the [[Wine (software)|Wine]] compatibility layer) will need only a single front-end, called a state tracker, targeting the Gallium3D API. By contrast, [[Mesa 3D]] requires a different back-end for each hardware platform and several other APIs need translation to OpenGL at the expense of added overhead.<ref>{{Cite web

|accessdate = 2008-04-01

Under Gallium3D, [[Direct Rendering Manager]] (DRM) kernel drivers will manage the memory and [[Direct Rendering Infrastructure|Direct Rendering Interface]] (DRI2) drivers will be more GPU processing oriented. This will resolve memory management problems whose solutions are considered unfeasible under Mesa 3D.<ref>{{Cite web

|datepublished = 2007-10-04
|accessdate = 2008-04-01

== LLVM usage==
In addition, using the modular structure of Gallium3D, there are works underway to leverage the [[Low Level Virtual Machine|LLVM]] compiler suite and create a module to optimize [[shader]] code on the fly.<ref>{{Cite web
|url = http://zrusin.blogspot.com/2007/11/gallium3d-llvm.html
|title = Gallium3D LLVM
|author = zrusin
|datepublished = 2007-11-02
|accessdate = 2008-04-01
}}</ref> 

The library represents each shader program using an extensible binary intermediate representation called Tungsten Graphics Shader Infrastructure (TGSI). When Gallium targets LLVM, the TGSI code is converted to the LLVM [[Low_Level_Virtual_Machine#Code_representation|instruction set]].

== Current status ==

The first implemented and already partially working drivers are [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell]] SPU and [[Intel GMA|Intel GPU]] drivers. The r300g driver for ati r300-r500 cards is considered stable at this time. Work is done on ATI Radeon r600-r700, Evergreen and Northern Islands cards to provide gallium support.<ref>{{Cite web

Gallium3D is designed to be platform-independent.<ref>{{cite |author=José Fonseca |date=2008-04-27 |title=Gallium3D: Introduction |url=http://jrfonseca.blogspot.com/2008/04/gallium3d-introduction.html }}</ref> As of February 2009, Gallium3D can run on Linux as well as FreeBSD kernels.<ref>{{cite web |author=[[Michael Larabel]] |date=2009-02-25 |title=Gallium3D, EGL Now Buildable On FreeBSD |publisher=[[Phoronix]] |url=http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NzA5Mg }}</ref>

On 11 February 2009, the gallium-0.2 branch was merged into mainline Master branch of Mesa.<ref>{{Cite web
|url = http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NzA1Ng
|title = Gallium3D Now In Mainline Mesa Code-Base!
|datepublished = 2009-02-11
}}</ref> Development is done in Mesa mainline.

On 1 May 2009, Zack Rusin from Tungsten Graphics added the [[OpenVG]] state tracker to Mesa 3D<ref>{{Cite web
|url = http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=200905011303.10970.zackr@vmware.com&forum_name=mesa3d-dev
|title = OpenVG state tracker is in Mesa 3D
|datepublished = 2009-05-01
}}</ref>, which enables [[Scalable Vector Graphics]] to be hardware-accelerated by any Gallium3D-based driver.

{{As of|2008|07|13}}, Nouveau development is done exclusively for the Gallium framework. The old DRI driver was removed from the master branch of the mesa repository on Freedesktop.org.<ref>{{Cite web

|title = nouveau: say goodbye to the old DRI driver... (cgit on FDO)
|datepublished = 2008-07-13

The first Mesa3D release including Gallium3D was version 7.5 on 17 July 2009.<ref>{{Cite web
|url = http://www.mesa3d.org/relnotes-7.5.html
|title = Mesa 7.5 Release Notes / 17 July 2009
|datepublished = 2009-07-17

{{As of|2010|09|21}}, There are two Gallium3D drivers for ATI hardware known as r300g and r600g for R100-R500 and R600-Evergreen GPUs respectively. Initial support for the Evergreen GPUs was added to the r600g driver on 2010-09-10.<ref>{{Cite web

|title = r600g: add initial evergreen support (cgit on FDO)
|datepublished = 2010-09-10

On 21 September 2010, major commits were made to the code to support Direct3D 10 and 11.<ref>{{Cite web
