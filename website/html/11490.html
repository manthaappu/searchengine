'''ESC/Java''' (and more recently '''ESC/Java2'''), the "Extended Static Checker for Java," is a [[programming tool]] that attempts to find common [[run-time error]]s in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programs at [[compile time]]<ref>C. Flanagan, K.R.M. Leino, M. Lillibridge, G. Nelson, J. B. Saxe and R. Stata.  "Extended static checking for Java".  In ''Proceedings of the Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation'', pages 234--245, 2002.  doi: http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/512529.512558</ref>.  The underlying approach used in ESC/Java is referred to as [[extended static checking]], which is a collective name referring to a range of techniques for [[static code analysis|statically checking]] the correctness of various program constraints.  For example, that an integer variable is greater-than-zero, or lies between the [[bounds checking|bounds of an array]].  This technique was pioneered in ESC/Java (and it's predecessor, ESC/Modula-3) and can be thought of as an extended form of [[type system#Type checking|type checking]].  Extended static checking usually involves the use of an [[automated theorem proving|automated theorem prover]] and, in ESC/Java, the Simplify theorem prover was used.  

ESC/Java is neither [[soundness|sound]] nor [[completeness|complete]].  This was intentional and aims to reduce the number of errors and/or warnings reported to the programmer, in order to make the tool more useful in practice.  However, it does mean that: firstly, there are programs that ESC/Java will erroneously consider to be incorrect (known as ''false-positives''); secondly, there are incorrect programs it will consider to be correct (known as ''false-negatives'').  Examples in the latter category include errors arising from [[modular arithmetic]] and/or [[Thread (computer science)|multithreading]].

ESC/Java was originally developed at the [[DEC Systems Research Center|Compaq Systems Research Center]] (SRC).  SRC launched the project in 1997, after work on their original extended static checker, ESC/Modula-3, ended in 1996.  In 2002, SRC released the [[source code]] for ESC/Java and related tools.  Recent versions of ESC/Java are based around the [[Java Modeling Language]] (JML). Users can control the amount and kinds of checking by annotating their programs with specially formatted comments or ''[[pragma]]s''.

The [[Radboud University Nijmegen|University of Nijmegen]]'s ''Security of Systems'' group released alpha versions of ESC/Java2, an extended version of ESC/Java that processes the [[JML]] specification language through 2004.  Since 2004, ESC/Java2 development has been managed by the KindSoftware Research Group at [[University College Dublin]].  Over the years, ESC/Java2 has gained many new features including the ability to reason with multiple [[theorem prover]]s and integration with [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]].
