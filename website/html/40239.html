'''Windows 2000''' is a line of [[operating system]]s produced by [[Microsoft]] for use on [[personal computers]], business desktops, [[laptop]]s, and [[Server (computing)|servers]]. Released on 17 February 2000,<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2000/Feb00/W2Kgatespr.mspx Gates Ushers in Next Generation of PC Computing With Launch of Windows 2000]</ref> it was the successor to [[Windows NT 4.0]], and is the final release of Microsoft Windows to display the "Windows NT" designation. It was succeeded by [[Windows XP]] for desktop systems in October 2001 and [[Windows Server 2003]] for servers in April 2003. [[Windows Me]] was released seven months after Windows 2000 and one year before Windows XP, but Windows Me was not intended to be, nor did it serve as the successor to Windows 2000. Windows Me was designed for home use, while Windows 2000 was designed for business.

Four editions of Windows 2000 were released: ''Professional'', ''Server'', ''Advanced Server'', and ''Datacenter Server''.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1998/Oct98/NT5.mspx Microsoft Unveils SQL Server 2000, Windows 2000 Integration]</ref> Additionally, Microsoft sold Windows 2000 ''Advanced Server Limited Edition'' and Windows 2000 ''Datacenter Server Limited Edition'', which were released in 2001 and run on [[64-bit]] Intel [[Itanium]] [[microprocessor]]s.<ref name="Win2k64bitItanium">{{cite press release |title=Microsoft and Intel Announce Preview Release of 64-Bit Windows for Intel Itanium Processor |publisher=Microsoft |date=12 July 2000 |url=http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2000/jul00/itaniumpr.mspx |accessdate=2007-10-04}}</ref> While each edition of Windows 2000 was targeted to a different market, they share a core set of features, including many system utilities such as the [[Microsoft Management Console]] and standard [[system administration]] applications.

[[File:Windows2000startup.jpeg|thumb|Windows 2000 Professional [[bootsplash]].]]
Windows 2000 is a continuation of the Microsoft [[Windows NT]] family of operating systems, replacing [[Windows NT 4.0]]. Originally called Windows NT 5.0, then Windows NT 2000, Microsoft changed the name to Windows 2000 on 27 October 1998.<ref name="infoworldnt5">{{cite web

Windows 2000 was first planned to replace both [[Windows 98]] and Windows NT 4.0. However, that changed later. Instead, an updated version of Windows 98 called Windows 98 Second Edition was released in 1999 and [[Windows Me]] was released in late 2000.<ref name="ThurottWin2K" /> Close to the release of Windows 2000 Service Pack 1, Microsoft released Windows 2000 Datacenter Server, targeted at large-scale computing systems with support for 32 processors, on 29 September 2000.

On or shortly before 12 February 2004, "portions of the Microsoft Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0 [[source code]] were illegally made available on the Internet".<ref name="msstmt">{{cite web

<blockquote> ''"Microsoft source code is both copyrighted and protected as a trade secret. As such, it is illegal to post it, make it available to others, download it or use it."'' </blockquote>
Despite the warnings, the archive containing the leaked code spread widely on the [[File sharing|file-sharing]] networks. On 16 February 2004, an [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]] "allegedly discovered by an individual studying the leaked source code"<ref name="msstmt"/> for certain versions of [[Internet Explorer|Microsoft Internet Explorer]] was reported.

== New and updated features ==
Windows 2000 introduced many of the new features of [[Windows 98]] and Windows 98 SE into the NT line,<ref name="Win2KIntro">[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/Windows2000Pro/reskit/part1/proch01.mspx?mfr=true Introducing Windows 2000 Professional]</ref> such as the [[Windows Desktop Update]],<ref name="Win2KIntro" /> [[Internet Explorer 5|Internet Explorer 5]], ([[Internet Explorer 6|Internet Explorer 6]] which came in 2001 is also available for Windows 2000) <ref name="Win2KIntro" /> [[Outlook Express]], [[Microsoft NetMeeting|NetMeeting]], [[FAT32]] support,<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/154997 Description of the FAT32 File System],</ref> [[Windows Driver Model]],<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/wdmoverview.mspx Windows Driver Model (WDM)]</ref> [[Internet Connection Sharing]],<ref name="Win2KIntro" /> [[Windows Media Player]], [[WebDAV]] support<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/195851 Overview of Web Folders in Internet Explorer 5]</ref> etc. Certain new features are common across all editions of Windows 2000, among them NTFS 3.0,<ref name="NTFS3" /> the [[Microsoft Management Console]] (MMC),<ref name="MMC">[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742441.aspx Microsoft Management Console - Overview]</ref> [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] support, the [[Encrypting File System]] (EFS),<ref name="EFS">[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/prodtech/windows2000/w2kccadm/dataprot/w2kadm21.mspx Implementing the Encrypting File System in Windows 2000]</ref> [[Logical Disk Manager]],<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/reskit/deploy/dgbj_sto_csmg.mspx Disk Management]</ref> Image Color Management 2.0,<ref name="ColorsFonts">[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0GZQ/is_34_40/ai_55660669 Windows 2000 To Include New On-Screen And Printed Scalable Color Solution]</ref> support for [[PostScript|PostScript 3]]-based printers,<ref name="ColorsFonts"/> [[OpenType]] <tt>(.OTF)</tt> and [[PostScript fonts#Type 1|Type 1 PostScript]] <tt>(.PFB)</tt> font support,<ref name="ColorsFonts"/> the [[Data protection application programming interface|Data protection API]] (DPAPI),<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/309408 How to troubleshoot the Data Protection API (DPAPI)]</ref> an [[LDAP]]/[[Active Directory]]-enabled [[Windows Address Book|Address Book]],<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/238007 How to Configure the Address Book to Query Users Contained in Active Directory]</ref> usability enhancements and multi-language and locale support.

A new capability designed to protect critical system files called [[Windows File Protection]] was introduced. This protects critical Windows system files by preventing programs other than Microsoft's operating system update mechanisms such as the ''Package Installer'', [[Windows Installer]] and other update components from modifying them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/222193|title=Microsoft KB article 222193: Description of the Windows File Protection Feature}}</ref>  The [[System File Checker]] utility provides users the ability to perform a manual scan the integrity of all protected system files, and optionally repair them, either by restoring from a cache stored in a separate "DLLCACHE" directory, or from the original install media.

Microsoft recognized that a [[Blue Screen of Death|serious error]] or a stop error could cause problems for servers that needed to be constantly running and so provided a system setting that would allow the server to automatically reboot when a stop error occurred.<ref name="RecoveryOptions">[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307973 How to configure system failure and recovery options in Windows]</ref> Also included is an option to [[Core dump|dump]] any of the first 64 [[kilobyte|KB]] of memory to disk (the smallest amount of memory that is useful for [[debugging]] purposes, also known as a minidump), a dump of only the kernel's memory, or a dump of the entire contents of memory to disk, as well as write that this event happened to the Windows 2000 [[Event Viewer|event log]].<ref name="RecoveryOptions" /> In order to improve performance on servers running Windows 2000, Microsoft gave administrators the choice of optimizing the operating system's memory and processor usage patterns for background services or for applications.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/Windows2000Pro/reskit/part6/proch29.mspx Analyzing processor activity: Windows 2000 Professional Resource Kit]</ref> Windows 2000 also introduced core system administration and management features as the [[Windows Installer]],<ref>[http://entmag.com/archives/article.asp?editorialsid=5169 Using Windows Installer in Windows 2000 beta 3]</ref> [[Windows Management Instrumentation]]<ref>[http://www.informit.com/articles/printerfriendly.aspx?p=19489 Programming with Windows Management Instrumentation]</ref> and Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)<ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb968803(VS.85).aspx Event Tracing for Windows (ETW): MSDN]</ref> into the operating system.

=== Plug and Play ===
The most notable improvement from [[Windows NT 4.0]] is the addition of Plug and Play with full [[ACPI]] and [[Windows Driver Model]] support. Similar to [[Windows 9x]], Windows 2000 supports automatic recognition of installed hardware, hardware resource allocation, loading of appropriate drivers, PnP APIs and device notification events. The addition of the kernel PnP Manager along with the Power Manager are two significant subsystems added in Windows 2000.

=== Shell ===
Windows 2000 introduces layered windows that allow for transparency, translucency and various transition effects like shadows, gradient fills and alpha blended GUI elements to top-level windows. <ref> [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms997507.aspx Layered Windows: MSDN] </ref>
[[Image:Windows 2000 Explorer.png|thumb|The integrated media player in [[Windows Explorer]] playing a [[MIDI]] sequence.]]
[[Windows Explorer]] has been enhanced in several ways in Windows 2000. It is the first [[Windows NT]] release to include [[Active Desktop]], first introduced as a part of [[Internet Explorer 4.0]] (specifically [[Windows Desktop Update]]), and only pre-installed in [[Windows 98]] by that time.<ref name="ActiveDesktop">{{Cite document|first=Dino|last=Esposito|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/0600/w2kui2/|title=More Windows 2000 UI Goodies: Extending Explorer Views by Customizing Hypertext Template Files|publisher=MSDN Magazine|date=June 2000|accessdate=2007-08-26|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> It allowed users to customize the way folders look and behave by using [[HTML]] templates, having the [[file extension]] <tt>HTT</tt>.

The "Web-style" folders view, with the left Explorer pane displaying details for the object currently selected, is turned on by default in Windows 2000. For certain file types, such as pictures and media files, the preview is also displayed in the left pane.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/reskit/prork/prde_ffs_sleq.mspx?mfr=true Managing Files, Folders, and Search Methods: Microsoft TechNet]</ref> Until the dedicated interactive preview pane appeared in [[Windows Vista]], Windows 2000 had been the only Windows release to feature an interactive media player as the previewer for sound and video files.

[[File:Htt folder.png|thumb|300px|A HTT file as it appears in Windows 2000]]

The right pane of Windows 2000 Explorer, which usually just lists files and folders, can also be customized. For example, the contents of the system folders aren't displayed by default, instead showing in the right pane a warning to the user that modifying the contents of the system folders could harm their computer. It's possible to define additional Explorer panes by using [[Div (HTML tag)|DIV]] elements in folder template files<ref name="ActiveDesktop"/> Other Explorer UI elements that can be customized include columns in "Details" view, icon overlays, and search providers: the new DHTML-based search pane is integrated into Windows 2000 Explorer, unlike the separate search dialog found in all previous Explorer versions. This degree of customizability is new to Windows 2000; neither Windows 98 nor the Desktop Update could provide it.<ref name="WindowsShellExtensions">{{Cite document|title="Figure 1 Windows Shell Extensions"|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/0300/w2kui/w2kuifigs.asp|publisher=MSDN Magazine|accessdate=2007-08-26|date=June 2000|postscript=<!--None-->|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20040831153932/http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/0300/w2kui/w2kuifigs.asp |archivedate = August 31, 2004}}</ref> The [[Windows Indexing Service|Indexing Service]] has also been integrated into the operating system and the search pane built into Explorer allows searching files indexed by its database.<ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms689718.aspx What is Indexing Service?: MSDN]</ref>

=== NTFS 3.0 ===
[[Image:NT Quota Management.png|thumb|Windows 2000 supports [[disk quota]]s, which can be set via the "Quota" tab found in the hard disk properties [[dialog box]].]]
{{main|NTFS}}
Microsoft released the version 3.0 of NTFS<ref name="NTFS3" /> (sometimes incorrectly called NTFS 5 in relation to the kernel version number) as part of Windows 2000; this introduced [[disk quota]]s (provided by [[QuotaAdvisor]]), [[Encrypting File System|file-system-level encryption]], [[sparse file]]s and [[NTFS reparse point|reparse points]]. Sparse files allow for the efficient storage of data sets that are very large yet contain many areas that only have zeros.<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/231388 Sparse Files Use Quota Equal to Total Allocated Length]</ref> [[NTFS reparse point|Reparse points]] allow the [[Object Manager (Windows)|object manager]] to reset a file namespace lookup and let file system drivers implement changed functionality in a transparent manner.<ref name="NTFS">[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000pro/evaluate/featfunc/bestperf.mspx#EME Improved NTFS File System]</ref> Reparse points are used to implement [[Volume Mount Point|volume mount points]], [[NTFS junction point|junctions]], [[Hierarchical Storage Management]], Native [[Structured storage|Structured Storage]] and [[Single Instance Storage]].<ref name="NTFS" /> Volume mount points and directory junctions allow for a file to be transparently referred from one file or directory location to another.

=== Encrypting File System ===
{{main|Encrypting File System}}
The Encrypting File System (EFS) introduced strong [[file system]]-level [[encryption]] to Windows. It allows any folder or drive on an NTFS volume to be encrypted transparently by the user.<ref name="EFS" /> EFS works together with the EFS service, Microsoft's [[Cryptographic Application Programming Interface|CryptoAPI]] and the EFS File System [[Run time system|Runtime]] Library (FSRTL).<ref name="EFSWorking">[http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/997fdd99-73ec-4041-9cf4-1370739a59201033.mspx?mfr=true How Encrypting File System Works]</ref> To date, its encryption has not been compromised.

EFS works by encrypting a file with a bulk [[symmetric key]] (also known as the File Encryption Key, or FEK), which is used because it takes less time to encrypt and decrypt large amounts of data than if an [[asymmetric key]] [[cipher]] were used.<ref name="EFSWorking" /> The symmetric key used to encrypt the file is then encrypted with a [[public key]] associated with the user who encrypted the file, and this encrypted data is stored in the header of the encrypted file. To decrypt the file, the file system uses the private key of the user to decrypt the symmetric key stored in the file header. It then uses the symmetric key to decrypt the file. Because this is done at the file system level, it is transparent to the user.<ref>"[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/reskit/distrib/dsck_efs_xhkd.mspx?mfr=true Encrypting File System]". ''Microsoft''.</ref>

For a user losing access to their key, support for recovery agents that can decrypt files is built in to EFS. A Recovery Agent is a user who is authorized by a public key recovery certificate to decrypt files belonging to other users using a special ''private key''. By default, local administrators are ''recovery agents'' however they can be customized using [[Group Policy]].

=== Basic and dynamic disk storage ===
{{main|Logical Disk Manager}}

Windows 2000 introduced the [[Logical Disk Manager]] and the [[diskpart]] command line tool for [[Logical Disk Manager|dynamic storage]].<ref name="Storage" /> All versions of Windows 2000 support three types of [[Logical Disk Manager|dynamic]] disk volumes (along with basic disks) : ''simple volumes'', ''spanned volumes'' and ''striped volumes'':
*'''Simple volume''', a volume with disk space from one disk.
*'''Spanned volumes''', where up to 32 disks show up as one, increasing it in size but not enhancing performance. When one disk fails, the array is destroyed. Some data may be recoverable. This corresponds to [[JBOD#Concatenation (JBOD or SPAN)|JBOD]] and not to [[Redundant array of independent disks#RAID 1|RAID-1]].
*'''Striped volumes''', also known as [[Redundant array of independent disks#RAID 0|RAID-0]], store all their data across several disks in ''stripes''. This allows better performance because disk reads and writes are balanced across multiple disks.

=== Accessibility ===
With Windows 2000, Microsoft introduced the Windows 9x accessibility features for people with visual and auditory impairments and other [[disability|disabilities]] into the NT-line of operating systems.<ref name="Accessibility" /> These included:
*'''[[Sticky keys|StickyKeys]]''': makes modifier keys (<tt>ALT</tt>, <tt>CTRL</tt> and <tt>SHIFT</tt>) become "sticky": a user can press the [[modifier key]], and then release it before pressing the combination key. (Activated by pressing Shift five times quickly.)
*'''[[FilterKeys]]''': a group of [[computer keyboard|keyboard]]-related features for people with typing issues, including:
**'''SlowKeys''': Ignore any keystroke not held down for a certain period.
**'''BounceKeys''': Ignore repeated keystrokes pressed in quick succession.
**'''RepeatKeys''': lets users slow down the rate at which keys are repeated via the keyboard's key-repeat feature.
*'''ToggleKeys''': when turned on, Windows will play a sound when the <tt>CAPS LOCK</tt>, <tt>NUM LOCK</tt> or <tt>SCROLL LOCK</tt> key is pressed.
*'''SoundSentry''': designed to help users with auditory impairments, Windows 2000 shows a visual effect when a sound is played through the sound system.
*'''[[Mouse keys|MouseKeys]]''': lets users move the cursor around the screen via the [[Keypad|numeric keypad]].
*'''SerialKeys''': lets Windows 2000 support speech augmentation devices.
*'''High contrast theme''': to assist users with visual impairments.
*'''[[Microsoft Magnifier]]''': A [[screen magnifier]] that enlarges a part of the screen the cursor is over.<ref name="AccessTools">[http://www.student.oulu.fi/~vtatila/ms_access_aids.html A review of Microsoft Magnifier and Narrator]</ref>

Additionally, Windows 2000 introduced the following new accessibility features:
*'''[[On-screen keyboard]]''': displays a [[virtual keyboard]] on the screen and allows users to press its keys using a [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] or a [[joystick]].<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/windows2000/onscreenkeyboard.aspx On-screenk keyboard]</ref>
*'''[[Microsoft Narrator]]''': Introduced in Windows 2000, this is a [[screen reader]] that utilizes the [[Speech Application Programming Interface|Speech API]] 5.<ref name="AccessTools" />

=== Languages and locales ===
{{main|Multilingual User Interface}}
Windows 2000 introduced the [[Multilingual User Interface]] (MUI).<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/handson/dev/muiapp.mspx Writing Win32 Multilingual User Interface Applications]</ref> Besides English, Windows 2000 incorporates support for [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Baltic languages|Baltic]], [[Central Europe]]an, [[Cyrillic]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Indic]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Simplified Chinese]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Traditional Chinese]], [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and [[Western Europe]]an languages.<ref name="Languages" /> It also has support for many different [[locale]]s.<ref name="Locales" />

=== Games ===
Windows 2000 included version 7.0 of the [[DirectX]] [[Applications Programming Interface|API]], commonly used by [[video game developer|game developer]]s on [[Windows 98]].<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/community/columns/askdev/ask1208.mspx?mfr=true Ask the Windows 2000 Dev Team].</ref> The last version of DirectX that Windows 2000 supports is DirectX 9.0c (Shader Model 3.0), that shipped with Windows XP Service Pack 2. Microsoft published quarterly updates to DirectX 9.0c through the February 2010 release after which support was dropped in the June 2010 SDK. These updates contain bug fixes to the core runtime and some additional libraries such as [[D3DX]], [[DirectSound#XAudio 2|XAudio 2]], [[DirectInput#Xinput|XInput]] and [[Managed DirectX]] components. The majority of games written for versions of DirectX 9.0c (up to the February 2010 release) can therefore run on Windows 2000.

===System utilities===
[[Image:Win2kDefrag.png|thumb|right|The Windows 2000 Computer Management console can perform many system tasks. It is pictured here starting a [[disk defragmentation]].]]
Windows 2000 introduced the [[Microsoft Management Console]] (MMC), which is used to create, save, and open administrative tools.<ref name="MMC" /> Each of these is called a ''console'', and most allow an administrator to administer other Windows 2000 computers from one centralised computer. Each console can contain one or many specific administrative tools, called ''snap-ins''.<ref name="MMC" /> These can be either standalone (with one function), or an extension (adding functions to an existing snap-in). In order to provide the ability to control what snap-ins can be seen in a console, the MMC allows consoles to be created in ''author mode'' or ''user mode''.<ref name="MMC" /> Author mode allows snap-ins to be added, new windows to be created, all portions of the console tree to be displayed and consoles to be saved. User mode allows consoles to be distributed with restrictions applied. User mode consoles can grant full access to the user for any change, or they can grant limited access, preventing users from adding snapins to the console though they can view multiple windows in a console. Alternatively users can be granted limited access, preventing them from adding to the console and stopping them from viewing multiple windows in a single console.<ref>''Microsoft Press'' (2000). ''MCSE 70-210, Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional'', pages 58-63.</ref>

The main tools that come with Windows 2000 can be found in the ''Computer Management'' console (in Administrative Tools in the Control Panel).<ref>[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb726960.aspx Managing Microsoft Windows 2000 Workstations and Servers]</ref> This contains the [[Event Viewer]]&mdash;a means of seeing events and the Windows equivalent of a [[log file]],<ref>[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb726966.aspx Event Logging and Viewing]</ref> a system information utility, [[NTBackup|a backup utility]], [[Task Scheduler]] and management consoles to view open shared folders and shared folder sessions, configure and manage [[COM+]] applications, configure [[Group Policy]],<ref>[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742376.aspx Step-by-Step Guide to Understanding the Group Policy Feature Set]</ref> manage all the local users and user groups, and a [[Device Manager|device manager]].<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314747 Description of Device Manager in Windows 2000 and Windows XP]</ref> It contains ''[[Logical Disk Manager|Disk Management]]'' and ''Removable Storage'' snap-ins,<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000pro/reskit/part3/proch18.mspx Windows 2000: Removable Storage and Backup]</ref> a [[Disk Defragmenter (Windows)|disk defragmenter]] as well as a performance diagnostic console, which displays graphs of system performance and configures data logs and alerts. It also contains a [[Windows service|service]] configuration console, which allows users to view all installed services and to stop and start them, as well as configure what those services should do when the computer starts. [[CHKDSK]] has significant performance improvements. <ref> [http://www.microsoft.com/windows/shared/community/docs/Windows%202000%20CHKDSK%20Management.doc Windows 2000 Chkdsk Management] </ref>

Windows 2000 comes with two utilities to edit the [[Windows registry]], ''REGEDIT.EXE'' and ''REGEDT32.EXE''.<ref name="Regedit">[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/141377 Differences between Regedit.exe and Regedt32.exe]</ref> REGEDIT has been directly ported from [[Windows 98]], and therefore does not support editing registry permissions.<ref name="Regedit" /> REGEDT32 has the older multiple document interface (MDI) and can edit registry permissions in the same manner that Windows NT's REGEDT32 program could. REGEDIT has a left-side [[tree view]] of the [[Windows registry]], lists all loaded [[Windows Registry#Hives|hives]] and represents the three components of a value (its name, type, and data) as separate columns of a table. REGEDT32 has a left-side tree view, but each hive has its own window, so the tree displays only keys and it represents values as a list of strings. REGEDIT supports right-clicking of entries in a tree view to adjust properties and other settings. REGEDT32 requires all actions to be performed from the top [[menu bar]]. [[Windows XP]] is the first system to integrate these two programs into a single utility, adopting the REGEDIT behavior with the additional NT features.<ref name="Regedit" />

The [[System File Checker]] (SFC) also comes with Windows 2000. It is a [[command line]] utility that scans system files and verifies whether they were signed by Microsoft and works in conjunction with the [[Windows File Protection]] mechanism. It can also repopulate and repair all the files in the ''Dllcache'' folder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/222471|title=Microsoft KB article 222471: Description of the Windows 2000 System File Checker (Sfc.exe) }}</ref>

=== Recovery Console ===
[[Image:Windows 2000 Recovery Console.png|thumb|The Recovery Console is usually used to recover unbootable systems.]]
{{main|Recovery Console}}
The [[Recovery Console]] is run from outside the installed copy of Windows to perform maintenance tasks that can neither be run from within it nor feasibly be run from another computer or copy of Windows 2000.<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/229716 Description of the Windows 2000 Recovery Console]</ref> It is usually used to recover the system from problems that cause booting to fail, which would render other tools useless.

It has a simple [[command line]] interface, used to check and repair the hard drive(s) , repair boot information (including [[NTLDR]]) , replace corrupted system files with fresh copies from the CD, or enable/disable services and drivers for the next boot.

The console can be accessed in either of the two ways:
#Booting from the Windows 2000 CD, and choosing to start the Recovery Console from the CD itself instead of continuing with setup. The Recovery Console is accessible as long as the installation CD is available.
#Preinstalling the Recovery Console on the hard disk as a startup option in <tt>[[NTLDR#boot.ini|Boot.ini]]</tt>, via WinNT32.exe, with the /cmdcons switch.<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/216417 How to install the Windows Recovery Console]</ref> In this case, it can only be started as long as [[NTLDR]] can boot from the [[System partition and boot partition|system partition]].

=== Server family features ===
The Windows 2000 server family consists of Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Advanced Server, and Windows 2000 Datacenter Server.

All editions of Windows 2000 Server have the following services and features built in:
*Routing and [[Remote Access Service]] (RRAS) support, facilitating [[Dial-up access|dial-up]] and [[Virtual Private Network|VPN]] connections using [[IPsec]], [[L2TP]] or [[L2TP#L2TP/IPsec|L2TP/IPsec]], support for [[RADIUS]] authentication in [[Internet Authentication Service]], network connection sharing, [[Network Address Translation]], [[unicast]] and [[multicast]] [[routing]] schemes.
* Remote access security features: Remote Access Policies for setup, verify Caller ID (IP address for VPNs), callback and Remote access account lockout <ref>[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc958001.aspx Elements of Secure Remote Access]</ref>
* Autodial by location feature using the ''Remote Access Auto Connection Manager'' [[Windows service|service]]
* [[Extensible Authentication Protocol]] support in [[Internet Authentication Service|IAS]] (EAP-MD5 and EAP-TLS) later upgraded to PEAPv0/EAP-MSCHAPv2 and PEAP-EAP-TLS in Windows 2000 SP4
*[[Microsoft DNS|DNS]] server, including support for [[Dynamic DNS]]. [[Active Directory]] relies heavily on DNS.
*[[IPsec]] support and TCP/IP filtering

*[[Fault-tolerant design|Fault tolerant]] volumes, namely [[Redundant array of independent disks#RAID 1|Mirrored]] and [[Redundant array of independent disks#RAID 5|RAID-5]]
*[[Group Policy]] (part of [[Active Directory]])
*''IntelliMirror'', a collection of technologies for fine-grained [[Systems management|management]] of Windows 2000 Professional clients that duplicates users' data, applications, files, and settings in a centralized location on the network. IntelliMirror employs technologies such as [[Group Policy]], [[Windows Installer]], [[Roaming profile]]s, [[Folder redirection|Folder Redirection]], ''Offline Files'' (also known as ''Client Side Caching'' or CSC), [[File Replication Service]] (FRS), Remote Installation Services (RIS) to address desktop management scenarios such as user data management, user settings management, software installation and maintenance.
*[[COM+]], [[Microsoft Transaction Server]] and [[Distributed Transaction Coordinator]]
*[[Microsoft Message Queuing|MSMQ 2.0]]
*[[Telephony Application Programming Interface|TAPI]] 3.0
*[[Integrated Windows Authentication]] (including [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]], Secure channel and [[SPNEGO]] (Negotiate) SSP packages for [[Security Support Provider Interface]] (SSPI)).
*[[MS-CHAP]] v2 protocol
*[[Public Key Infrastructure]] (PKI) and [[Certificate authority|Enterprise Certificate Authority]] support
*[[Terminal Services]] and support for the [[Remote Desktop Protocol]] (RDP)
*[[Internet Information Services]] (IIS) 5.0 and [[Windows Media Services]] 4.1
*Network [[Quality of Service]] features <ref>[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742478.aspx An Overview of Windows 2000 Quality of Service]</ref>
*A new ''Windows Time service'' which is an implementation of [[Simple Network Time Protocol]] (SNTP) as detailed in IETF RFC 1769. The Windows Time service synchronizes the date and time of computers in a domain <ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/224799 Basic Operation of the Windows Time Service]</ref> running on Windows 2000 Server or later. Windows 2000 Professional includes an SNTP client.

[[Image:Windows 2000 Server.png|thumb|right|Screenshot of Windows 2000 Server]]
The Server editions include more features and components, including the Microsoft Distributed File System (DFS) , Active Directory support and fault-tolerant storage.

==== Distributed File System ====
{{main|Distributed File System (Microsoft) }}
The Distributed File System (DFS) allows [[Server Message Block|shares]] in multiple different locations to be logically grouped under one folder, or ''DFS root''. When users try to access a [[Shared resource|network share]] off the DFS root, the user is really looking at a ''DFS link'' and the DFS server transparently redirects them to the correct [[file server]] and share. A DFS root can only exist on a Windows 2000 version that is part of the server family, and only one DFS root can exist on that server.

There can be two ways of implementing a DFS namespace on Windows 2000: either through a standalone DFS root or a domain-based DFS root. Standalone DFS allows for only DFS roots on the local computer, and thus does not use Active Directory. Domain-based DFS roots exist within Active Directory and can have their information distributed to other [[domain controller]]s within the domain — this provides [[Fault-tolerant system|fault tolerance]] to DFS. DFS roots that exist on a domain must be hosted on a domain controller or on a domain member server. The file and root information is replicated via the Microsoft [[File Replication Service]] (FRS).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/812487|title=Microsoft KB article 812487: Overview of DFS in Windows 2000}}</ref>

==== Active Directory ====
{{main|Active Directory}}
A new way of organizing [[Windows Server domain|Windows network domains]], or groups of resources, called Active Directory, is introduced with Windows 2000 to replace Windows NT's earlier domain model. Active Directory's hierarchical nature allowed administrators a built-in way to manage user and computer policies and user accounts, and to automatically deploy programs and updates with a greater degree of scalability and centralization than provided in previous Windows versions. It is one of the main reasons many corporations migrated to Windows 2000.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} User information stored in Active Directory also provided a convenient phone book-like function to end users. Active Directory domains can vary from small installations with a few hundred objects, to large installations with millions. Active Directory can organise and link groups of domains into a contiguous [[domain name]] space to form ''trees''. Groups of trees outside of the same namespace can be linked together to form ''forests''.

Active Directory services could only be installed on a Windows 2000 Server, Advanced Server, or Datacenter Server computer, and cannot be installed on a Windows 2000 Professional computer. However, Windows 2000 Professional is the first client operating system able to exploit Active Directory's new features. As part of an organization's migration, Windows NT clients continued to function until all clients were upgraded to Windows 2000 Professional, at which point the Active Directory domain could be switched to [[native mode]] and maximum functionality achieved.

Active Directory requires a DNS server that supports [[SRV resource record]]s, or that an organization's existing DNS infrastructure be upgraded to support this. There must be one or more [[domain controller]]s to hold the Active Directory database and provide Active Directory [[directory services]].

==== Volume fault tolerance ====
Along with support for simple, spanned and striped volumes, the server family of Windows 2000 also supports fault-tolerant volume types. The types supported are ''mirrored volumes'' and ''RAID-5 volumes'':
*'''Mirrored volumes:''' the volume contains several disks, and when data is written to one it is also written to the other disks. This means that if one disk fails, the data can be totally recovered from the other disk. Mirrored volumes are also known as [[Redundant array of independent disks#RAID 1|RAID-1]].
*'''RAID-5 volumes:''' a [[Standard RAID levels#RAID 5|RAID-5]] volume consists of multiple disks, and it uses [[Block (data storage)|block]]-level striping with parity data distributed across all member disks. Should a disk fail in the array, the parity blocks from the surviving disks are combined mathematically with the data blocks from the surviving disks to reconstruct the data on the failed drive "on-the-fly".

== Deployment ==
Windows 2000 can be [[software deployment|deployed]] to a site via various methods. It can be installed onto servers via traditional media (such as CD) or via distribution folders that reside on a shared folder. Installations can be attended or unattended. During a manual installation, the administrator must specify configuration options. Unattended installations are scripted via an [[answer file]], or a predefined script in the form of an [[initialization file|INI file]] that has all the options filled in. An answer file can be created manually or using the graphical ''Setup manager''. The Winnt.exe or Winnt32.exe program then uses that answer file to automate the installation. Unattended installations can be performed via a bootable CD, using Microsoft [[Systems Management Server]] (SMS) , via the [[Sysprep|System Preparation Tool (Sysprep)]], via the Winnt32.exe program using the /syspart switch or via [[Remote Installation Services]] (RIS). The ability to [[Slipstream (computing)|slipstream]] a [[service pack]] into the original operating system setup files is also introduced in Windows 2000.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000pro/deploy/depopt/easydep.mspx#EKFAC Make deployment easier in Windows 2000]</ref>

The Sysprep method is started on a standardized reference computer — though the hardware need not be similar — and it copies the required installation files from the reference computer to the target computers. The hard drive does not need to be in the target computer and may be swapped out to it at any time, with the hardware configured later. The Winnt.exe program must also be passed a /unattend switch that points to a valid answer file and a /s file that points to one or more valid installation sources.

Sysprep allows the duplication of a [[disk image]] on an existing Windows 2000 Server installation to multiple servers. This means that all applications and system configuration settings will be copied across to the new installations, and thus, the reference and target computers must have the same [[Hardware Abstraction Layer|HALs]], [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|ACPI]] support, and mass storage devices — though Windows 2000 automatically detects "[[plug and play]]" devices. The primary reason for using Sysprep is to quickly deploy Windows 2000 to a site that has multiple computers with standard hardware. (If a system had different HALs, mass storage devices or ACPI support, then multiple images would need to be maintained.)

Systems Management Server can be used to upgrade multiple computers to Windows 2000. These must be running Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 98 or Windows 95 OSR2.x along with the SMS client agent that can receive software installation operations. Using SMS allows installations over a wide area and provides centralised control over upgrades to systems.

[[Remote Installation Services]] (RIS) are a means to automatically install Windows 2000 Professional (and not Windows 2000 Server) to a local computer over a network from a central server. Images do not have to support specific hardware configurations and the security settings can be configured after the computer reboots as the service generates a new unique security ID (SID) for the machine. This is required so that local accounts are given the right identifier and do not clash with other Windows 2000 Professional computers on a network.<ref>Mark Minasi. ''Installing Windows 2000 on Workstations with Remote Installation Services''.</ref>
RIS requires that client computers are able to boot over the network via either a [[network interface card]] that has a [[Pre-Boot Execution Environment]] (PXE) boot [[Read-only memory|ROM]] installed or that the client computer has a network card installed that is supported by the remote [[boot disk]] generator. The [[remote computer]] must also meet the [[Net PC]] specification. The server that RIS runs on must be Windows 2000 Server and it must be able to access a network [[Domain Name System|DNS]] Service, a [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] service and the Active Directory services.<ref>''Microsoft Press'' (2000). ''MCSE 70-210, Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional'', pages 543-551.</ref>

== Editions ==
Microsoft released various editions of Windows 2000 for different markets and business needs: Professional, Server, Advanced Server and Datacenter Server. Each was packaged separately.

'''Windows 2000 Professional''' was designed as the desktop operating system for businesses and [[power user]]s. It is the client version of Windows 2000. It offers greater security and stability than many of the previous Windows desktop operating systems. It supports up to two [[central processing unit|processors]], and can address up to 4 [[Gigabyte|GB]] of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]]. The system requirements are a Pentium processor of 133 MHz or greater, at least 32 MB of RAM, 650 MB of hard drive space, and a [[CD-ROM]] drive (recommended: [[Pentium II]], 128 MB of RAM, 2 GB of hard drive space, and CD-ROM drive).<ref name="SysReq">

</ref>

'''Windows 2000 Server''' [[Stock-keeping unit|SKUs]] share the same [[user interface]] with Windows 2000 Professional, but contain additional components for the computer to perform [[Server (computing)|server]] roles and run infrastructure and [[application software]]. A significant new component introduced in the server SKUs is [[Active Directory]], which is an enterprise-wide directory service based on [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]]. Additionally, Microsoft integrated [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] network authentication, replacing the often-criticised [[NTLM]] authentication system used in previous versions. This also provided a purely [[Active Directory#Trust|transitive-trust]] relationship between Windows 2000 [[Windows Server domain|domains]] in a ''[[Active Directory#Forests.2C trees.2C and domains|forest]]'' (a collection of one or more Windows 2000 domains that share a common [[Active Directory#Objects|schema]], configuration, and [[Active Directory#Forests.2C trees.2C and domains|global catalog]], being linked with two-way [[Active Directory#Trust|transitive trusts]]). Furthermore, Windows 2000 introduced a [[Microsoft DNS|Domain Name Server]] which allows dynamic registration of [[Internet Protocol|IP]] addresses. Windows 2000 Server supports up  to 4 processors, requires 128 MB of RAM and 1 GB hard disk space, however requirements may be higher depending on installed components.<ref name="SysReq"/>

'''Windows 2000 Advanced Server''' is a variant of Windows 2000 Server operating system designed for medium-to-large businesses. It offers [[Computer clustering|clustering]] infrastructure for [[high availability]] and [[scalability]] of applications and services, including main memory support of up to 8 gigabytes (GB) on [[Physical Address Extension]] (PAE) systems and the ability to do 8-way [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]]. It supports [[TCP/IP]] [[Network Load Balancing Services|load balancing]] and enhanced two-node server clusters based on the [[Microsoft Cluster Server]] (MSCS) in Windows NT Server 4.0 Enterprise Edition.<ref>''Microsoft''. Windows 2000 Resource Kit, Chap. 1, "Introducing Windows 2000 Deployment Planning".</ref> Limited number of copies of an [[IA-64]] version, called Windows 2000 Advanced Server, Limited Edition were made available via [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEMs]]. System requirements are similar to those of Windows 2000 Server,<ref name="SysReq"/> however they may need to be higher to scale to larger infrastructure.

'''Windows 2000 Datacenter Server''' is a variant of Windows 2000 Server designed for large businesses that move large quantities of confidential or sensitive data frequently via a central [[Server (computing)|server]].<ref name="Datacenter">[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/265173 The Datacenter Program and Windows 2000 Datacenter Server Product]</ref> Like Advanced Server, it supports [[clustering]], [[High-availability cluster|failover]] and [[load balancing]]. Its minimum [[system requirements]] are normal, but it was designed to be capable of handing advanced, fault-tolerant and [[scalability|scalable]] hardware—for instance computers with up to 32 CPUs and 64 [[gigabyte|GBs]] RAM, with rigorous system testing and qualification, hardware partitioning, coordinated maintenance and [[change control]]. Limited number of copies of an [[IA-64]] version, called Windows 2000 Datacenter Server, Limited Edition were made available via [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEMs]]. System requirements are similar to those of Windows 2000 Advanced Server,<ref name="SysReq"/> however they may need to be higher to scale to larger infrastructure.

== Total cost of ownership ==
{{see also|Studies related to Microsoft}}

In October 2002, Microsoft commissioned [[International Data Corporation|IDC]] to determine the [[total cost of ownership]] (TCO) for [[enterprise application]]s on Windows 2000 versus the TCO of the same applications on [[Linux]]. IDC's report is based on telephone interviews of IT executives and managers of 104 [[North America]]n companies in which they determined what they were using for a specific workload for file, print, security and networking services.
IDC determined that the four areas where Windows 2000 had a better TCO than Linux — over a period of five years for an average organization of 100 employees — were file, print, network infrastructure and security infrastructure. They determined, however, that Linux had a better TCO than Windows 2000 for web serving. The report also found that the greatest cost was not in the procurement of software and hardware, but in staffing costs and downtime. While the report applied a 40% productivity factor during IT infrastructure downtime, recognizing that employees are not entirely unproductive, it did not consider the impact of downtime on the profitability of the business. The report stated that Linux servers had less unplanned downtime than Windows 2000 servers. It found that most Linux servers ran less workload per server than Windows 2000 servers and also that none of the businesses interviewed used 4-way [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]] Linux computers. The report also did not take into account specific [[application server]]s — servers that need low maintenance and are provided by a specific vendor. The report did emphasize that TCO was only one factor in considering whether to use a particular IT platform, and also noted that as management and server software improved and became better packaged the overall picture shown could change.<ref>"[http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/docs/TCO.pdf Windows 2000 Versus Linux in Enterprise Computing]", ''IDC''.</ref>

== Service packs ==
Windows 2000 has received four full [[service pack]]s and one rollup update package following SP4, which is the last service pack. These were: SP1 on 15 August 2000, SP2 on 16 May 2001, SP3 on 29 August 2002 and SP4 on 26 June 2003. Microsoft phased out all development of its [[Java Virtual Machine]] (JVM) from Windows 2000 in SP3. Internet Explorer 5.01 has also been upgraded to the corresponding service pack level. 

Microsoft had originally intended to release a fifth service pack for Windows 2000, but Microsoft cancelled this project early in its development, and instead released Update Rollup 1 for SP4, a collection of all the security-related [[hotfix]]es and some other significant issues.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> The Update Rollup does not include all non-security related hotfixes and is not subjected to the same extensive regression testing as a full service pack. Microsoft states that this update will meet customers' needs better than a whole new service pack, and will still help Windows 2000 customers secure their PCs, reduce support costs, and support existing [[computer hardware]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/server/evaluation/news/bulletins/rollup.mspx |title=Windows 2000 Update Rollup 1 for Service Pack 4|accessdate=2006-09-27|publisher=Microsoft |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060113110336/http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/server/evaluation/news/bulletins/rollup.mspx |archivedate = 2006-01-13}}</ref>

== Support lifecycle ==
Windows 2000 has now been superseded by newer Microsoft operating systems: Windows 2000 Server products by [[Windows Server 2003]], and Windows 2000 Professional by [[Windows XP|Windows XP Professional]].

The Windows 2000 family of operating systems moved from mainstream support to the extended support phase on 30 June 2005. Microsoft says that this marks the progression of Windows 2000 through the Windows lifecycle policy. Under mainstream support, Microsoft freely provides design changes if any, service packs and non-security related updates in addition to security updates, whereas in extended support, service packs are not provided and non-security updates require contacting the support personnel by e-mail or phone. Under the extended support phase, Microsoft continued to provide critical security updates every month for all components of Windows 2000 (including Internet Explorer 5.0 SP4) and paid per-incident support for technical issues. Because of Windows 2000's age, updated versions of components such as [[Windows Media Player 11]] and [[Internet Explorer 7]] have not been released for it. In the case of Internet Explorer, Microsoft said in 2005 that, "some of the security work in IE 7 relies on operating system functionality in XP SP2 that is non-trivial to port back to Windows 2000."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.com.com/Windows+2000+users+to+miss+out+on+IE+7/2100-1032_3-5729544.html|title=Windows 2000 users to miss out on IE 7|accessdate=2007-01-11|publisher=news.com}}</ref>

While users of Windows 2000 Professional and Server are eligible to receive the upgrade license for Windows Vista Business or Windows Server 2008, neither of these operating systems can directly perform an upgrade installation from Windows 2000; a clean installation must be performed instead or a two-step upgrade thru XP/2003. Microsoft has dropped the upgrade path from Windows 2000 (and earlier) to Windows 7. Users of Windows 2000 must buy a full Windows 7 license.

Although Windows 2000 is the last NT-based version of Microsoft Windows which does not include [[Windows Product Activation]], Microsoft has introduced [[Windows Genuine Advantage]] for certain downloads and non-critical updates from the Download Center for Windows 2000.

Windows 2000 reached the end of its lifecycle on 13 July 2010. It will not receive new security updates and new security-related hotfixes after this date.<ref name=Lifecycle>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/search/?sort=PN&alpha=Windows+2000&Filter=FilterNO|title=Microsoft Product Lifecycle for Windows 2000 family}}</ref><ref name=Support>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/server/evaluation/news/bulletins/extendedsupport.mspx|title=Windows 2000 Transitions to Extended Support}}</ref> In Japan over 130,000 servers and 500,000 PCs in local governments are affected; many local governments said that they will not update as they do not have funds to cover a replacement.<ref>"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100820a7.html]."

== Security ==
During the Windows 2000 period, the nature of attacks on Windows servers changed: more attacks came from remote sources via the Internet. This has led to an overwhelming number of malicious programs exploiting the IIS services - specifically a notorious buffer overflow tendency.<ref name="ecommerce-guide.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.ecommerce-guide.com/news/trends/article.php/3065801|title=Worms Wreak Havoc|date=19 August 2003|publisher=ECommerce-Guide|accessdate=25 February 2010}}</ref> A tendency that is not operating system version specific, but rather configuration specific: being dependent on the services that are enabled.<ref name="ecommerce-guide.com"/> Following this, a common complaint is that "by default, Windows 2000 installations contain numerous potential security problems. Many unneeded services are installed and enabled, and there is no active local security policy".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.governmentsecurity.org/articles/Windows2000Security.php|title=governmentsecurity.org}}</ref> In addition to insecure defaults, according to the [[SANS Institute]], the most common flaws discovered are remotely exploitable [[buffer overflow]] vulnerabilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sans.org/top20/|title=SANS Institute}}</ref> Other criticized flaws include the use of vulnerable encryption techniques.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,36336,00.html|first=Declan|last=McCullagh|title=Critics Blast MS Security|date=16 May 2000|publisher=Wired News|accessdate=25 February 2010}}</ref>

[[Code Red (computer worm)|Code Red]] and [[Code Red II (computer worm)|Code Red II]] were famous (and much discussed) worms that exploited vulnerabilities of the [[Windows Indexing Service]] of Windows 2000's [[Internet Information Services]] (IIS).<ref>http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-19.html</ref> In August 2003, two major worms called [[Sobig (computer worm)|Sobig]] and [[Blaster (computer worm)|Blaster]] began to attack millions of Microsoft Windows computers, resulting in the largest downtime and clean-up cost to that date{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}. The 2005 [[Zotob (computer worm)|Zotob]] worm was blamed for security compromises on Windows 2000 machines at the U.S. [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]], the [[New York Times]] Company, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[CNN]].<ref>[http://www.wired.com/news/technology/1,70642-0.html Wired News], 12 April 2006, "Border Security System Left Open"</ref>

===Unpatched critical flaws===
On September 8, 2009, Microsoft skipped patching two of the five security flaws that were addressed in the monthly security update, saying that patching one of the critical security flaws was "infeasible".<ref>[http://news.techworld.com/operating-systems/3201403/microsoft-windows-2000-too-old-to-update/ Techworld], 9 September 2009, "Microsoft: Windows 2000 too old to update"</ref> According to the [http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS09-048.mspx Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-048], "The architecture to properly support TCP/IP protection does not exist on Microsoft Windows 2000 systems, making it infeasible to build the fix for Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 to eliminate the vulnerability. To do so would require re-architecting a very significant amount of the Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 operating system, [...] there would be no assurance that applications designed to run on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 would continue to operate on the updated system."
