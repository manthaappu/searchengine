<html> <head> <title>Seismic attribute</title></head><body>A '''seismic attribute''' is any quantity derived from [[Reflection seismology|seismic data]] using measured time, amplitude, frequency, attenuation or any combination of these. It intends to output a subset of the data that quantifies [[rock physics|rock and fluid properties]] and/or allows the recognition of [[geology|geologic patterns]] and features. Almost all seismic attributes are post-stack but there are a few pre-stack ones. They can be measured along a single seismic trace or throughout various seismic traces.

The first attributes developed were related to the 1D [[seismic trace|complex seismic trace]] and included: envelope amplitude, instantaneous phase, instantaneous frequency, and apparent polarity. Acoustic impedance obtained from [[seismic inversion]] can also be considered an attribute and was among the first developed.<ref name=Sheriff>{{cite book|first=R.E.|last=Sheriff|title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Applied Geophysics|year=2002|edition=4|publisher=[[Society of Exploration Geophysicists]]|isbn=1560801182}}</ref>

Other attributes commonly used include: coherence, azimuth, dip, instantaneous amplitude, response amplitude, response phase, instantaneous bandwidth, [[Amplitude versus offset|AVO]], and spectral decomposition.

==Amplitude attributes==
Amplitude attributes use the seismic signal amplitude as the basis for their computation.

===Mean amplitude===
A post-stack attribute that computes the arithmetic mean of the amplitudes of a trace within a specified window. This can be used to observe the trace bias which could indicate the presence of bright spots.

===Average Energy===
A post-stack attribute that computes the sum of the squared amplitudes divided by the number of samples within the specified window used. This provides a measure of reflectivity and allows one to map direct hydrocarbon indicators within a zone of interest.

===RMS (root mean square) amplitude===
A post-stack attribute that computes the square root of the sum of squared amplitudes divided by the number of samples within the specified window used. With this, one can measure reflectivity in order to map direct hydrocarbon indicators in a zone of interest. However, RMS is sensitive to noise as it squares every value within the window.

===Maximum magnitude===
A post-stack attribute that computes the maximum value of the absolute value of the amplitudes within a window. This can be used to map the strongest direct hydrocarbon indicator within a zone of interest.

===[[Amplitude versus offset|AVO (amplitude versus offset)]] attributes===
These are pre-stack attributes that include: AVO intercept, AVO gradient, intercept multiplied by gradient, far minus near, fluid factor.<ref name=Castagna>{{cite book|first1=J.P.|last1=Castagna|first2=M.M.|last2=Backus|title=Offset Dependent Reflectivity - Theory and Practice of AVO Analysis|year=1993|publisher=[[Society of Exploration Geophysicists]]|isbn=1560800593}}</ref>

==Time attributes==

===Coherence===
A post-stack attribute that measures the continuity between seismic traces in a specified window. It can be used to map the lateral extent of a formation. It can also be used to see faults, channels or other discontinuous features.

===Dip===
A post-stack attribute that computes, for each trace, the best fit plane (3D) or line (2D) between its immediate neighbor traces on a horizon and outputs the magnitude of [[Strike and dip|dip (gradient)]] of said plane or line measured in degrees. This can be used to create a pseudo paleogeologic map on a horizon slice.

===Azimuth===
A post-stack attribute that computes, for each trace, the best fit plane (3D) between its immediate neighbor traces on a horizon and outputs the direction of maximum slope (dip direction) measured in degrees, clockwise from north. This is not to be confused with the geological concept of azimuth, which is equivalent to [[Strike and dip|strike]] and is measured 90Â° counterclockwise from the dip direction.
