<html> <head> <title>Dawning Information Industry</title></head><body>'''Dawning Information Industry''' (Shuguang, 曙光) is a [[supercomputer]] manufacturer in the [[People's Republic of China]]. Its [[Dawning 4000A]] and [[Dawning 5000A]] clusters were both ranked tenth in June 2004 and November 2008 [[TOP500]] lists respectively. Dawning has manufactured some of the fastest supercomputers in the world including [[Nebulae (computer)|Nebulae]], the second fastest computer in the June 2010 TOP500 list.

==Dawning Supercomputers==
===Dawning No.1===
The very first member of Dawning family is Dawning No.1 (Shuguang Yihao, 曙光一号), which received state certification in October 1993.  This supercomputer achieved 640 million [[FLOPS]] and utilizes [[MC88100|Motorola 88100]] CPUs (4 total) and 88200 CPUs (8 total), and over 20 were built.  The operating system is UNIX V.

===Dawning 1000===
Originally named as Dawning No.2 (Shuguang Erhao, 曙光二号) but subsequently renamed as Dawning 1000, this is the second generation of the family, and received state certification on May 11, 1995.  This is the first Chinese built supercomputer that is capable of 1 billion FLOPS.  This series of the Dawning family consists of the Dawning 1000A and 1000L.

===Dawning 2000===
The third member of the Dawning family is Dawning 2000, which passed state certification on Jan 28, 2000.  The number of CPUs used was greatly increased to 164 in comparison to older models, and like earlier models, the operating system is UNIX.  This series consisted of the Dawning 2000-I and II.

===Dawning 3000===
The fourth member of the Dawning family is Dawning 3000, which passed state certification on Mar 9, 2001.  The number of CPU increased to 280, and the system consists of ten 2-meter tall racks, weighing 5 tons total.  Power consumption is 25 kW, and one of the tasks it was used for was the part of human genome mapping that China was responsible for.

===Dawning 4000A===
The fifth member of the Dawning family, Dawning 4000A, debuted as one of the top 10 fastest supercomputers in the world, on the [[TOP500]] list,<ref>[http://www.top500.org/list/2004/06/ TOP500 List - June 2004 (1-100) | TOP500 Supercomputing Sites<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> capable of 806.1 billion FLOPS. The system, at the [[Shanghai Supercomputer Center]], utilizes over 2,560 [[AMD Opteron]] processors, and can reach speeds of 8 teraflops.

===Dawning 5000A===
The newest member of the Dawning family is Dawning 5000A. It integrated 7,680 1.9 GHz AMD Opteron Quad-core processors, resulting in 30,720 cores, and [[Infiniband]] interconnecting network.  Dawning 5000A occupies an area of 75 square meters and the power consumption is 700 kW.  The general designer is Dr. Sun Ninghui (孙凝晖) and the unit price of Dawning 5000A is less than 100 million RMBY (~15 million USD).  The supercomputer is capable of 180 teraflops and received state certification in Jun 2008. Ranked 10th in the November 2008 [[TOP500]] list,<ref>[http://www.top500.org/lists/2008/11 November 2008 TOP500 list]</ref> it's also the largest system at that time, using [[Windows HPC Server 2008]] for this benchmark. This system is also installed at the [[Shanghai Supercomputer Center]].

===Dawning 5000L===
The Dawning 5000 series supercomputer planned to use [[Loongson]] 3 processors which has 16 cores each and 8MB L2 shared cache.<ref>[http://news.sina.com.tw/tech/sinacn/cn/2007-04-04/190438142075.shtml]</ref> However, when the 5000A was revealed in June 2008, it used [[AMD K10]] CPUs instead. It was reported that Shanghai Supercomputer Center required Microsoft Windows support whereas Loongson only ran under [[Linux]]. Dawning claimed that Dawning 5000L may use Loongson 3 processors with petaflop performance, which is expected by 2010.<ref>[http://www.hpcwire.com/blogs/21574739.html China Ditches Home-Grown Chips in New Supercomputer]</ref>

===Dawning 6000===
The high-performance Dawning 6000, which has a projected speed of over 1,000 trillion operations per second, will incorporate the Loongson processor as its core. Dawning 6000 is currently jointly developed by the Institute of Computing Technology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Dawning Information Industry Company. Li Guojie, chairman of Dawning Information Industry Company and director and academician of the Institute of Computing Technology, said research and development of the Dawning 6000 is expected to be completed in two years{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}. By then, Chinese-made high-performance computers will be expected to achieve two major breakthroughs: first, the adoption of domestic-made central processing units (CPUs); second, the existing cluster-based system structure of high-performance computers will be changed once the computing speed reaches 1,000 trillion operations per second.<ref>http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90881/6543567.html</ref><ref>http://www.hpcwire.com/news/Dawning_6000_to_Use_Chinese-Made_Loongson_Processor.html</ref>
