<html> <head> <title>Numerical taxonomy</title></head><body>'''Numerical taxonomy'''  is a [[Biological classification|classification system]] in biological [[systematics]] which deals with the grouping by [[numerical method]]s of [[taxon|taxonomic units]] based on their character states.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=461900&referURL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.accessscience.com%2fcontent.aspx%3fid%3d461900 |title="Numerical Taxonomy" |author= |date= |work=www.accessscience.com |publisher=McGraw Hill Ltd. |accessdate=13 April 2010}}</ref>. It aims to create a [[taxonomy]] using numeric algorithms like [[cluster analysis]] rather than using subjective evaluation of their properties. The concept was first developed by [[Robert R. Sokal]] & Peter H.A. Sneath in 1963<ref>Sokal & Sneath: ''Principles of Numerical Taxonomy'', San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1963</ref> and later elaborated by the same authors<ref>Sneath and Sokal: ''Numerical Taxonomy'', San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1973</ref>. They divided the field into [[phenetics]] in which classifications are formed based on the patterns of overall similarities and [[cladistics]] in which classifications based on the branching patterns of the estimated evolutionary history of the taxa. Note: in recent years many authors treat numerical taxonomy and phenetics as synonyms despite the distinctions made by those authors. 

Although intended as an objective classification method, in practice the choice and implicit weighing of characteristics is, of course, influenced by available data and research interests of the investigator. What was made objective was the introduction of explicit steps to be used to create phenograms and cladograms using numerical methods rather than subjective synthesis of data.
