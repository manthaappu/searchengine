'''HSR''' (High-availability Seamless Redundancy, pronounce: HASAR) is a redundancy protocol for [[Ethernet]] (IEEE 802.3) networks.

It provides zero-time failover in case of failure of one component. It is therefore suited for applications that demand high availability and very short reaction time, such as protection for electrical substation automation and controllers for synchronized drives, for instance in printing machines. 

HSR has been standardized by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]], Geneva, as '''IEC 62439-3 Clause 5'''. It is one of the redundancy protocols selected for substation automation in the IEC 61850 standard. HSR is application-protocol independent and can be used by most Industrial Ethernet of the IEC 61784 suite. 

The nodes (devices) in an HSR network are attached by two Ethernet ports. A source node sends the same frame over both ports. A destination should receive, in the fault-free state, two identical frames within a certain time skew, forward the first frame to the application and discard the second frame when (and if) it comes.

In contrast to [[Parallel Redundancy Protocol|PRP]] (IEC 62439-3- Clause 4), with which it shares the operating principle, HSR nodes can be arranged into a ring, which allows to operate without dedicated switches, since every node is able to forward frames from port to port. HSR originally meant "High-availability Seamless Ring". But its topology is not limited to a single ring, a system of rings with many structures can be built.
