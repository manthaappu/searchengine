The center is part of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]'s [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Computing|College of Computing]] and is headed by [[David A. Bader]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~bader/news/GATech-Compiler-Issue11.pdf| title=Research News: Grants/Gifts Received| work=The Compiler| publisher=Georgia Tech College of Computing| date=2007-03| accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| first=Bob| last=Keefe| url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~bader/news/AustinAmericanStatesman-061114.pdf| title=Georgia, not Austin, gets chip center| work=Austin American Statesman| date=2006-11-14| accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~bader/news/HPCwire-061115.pdf| title=Georgia Tech Establishes Cell BE Center of Competence| work=HPC Wire| date=2006-11-16| accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~bader/news/Verivox-061212.pdf| title=IBM announces winners of shared university research awards| work=Verivox| date=2006-12-12| accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref>

According to IBM, the center is intended to "to build a community of
programmers and broaden industry support for the Cell BE processor."<ref>{{cite pressrelease| url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~bader/news/IBM-061205.pdf| title=College of computing at Georgia tech selected as first Sony-Toshiba-IBM center of competence focused on the cell processor| publisher=IBM| date=2006-11-05| accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref> So far, the program has resulted in two workshops that involved detailed lectures on and training with various basic cell programming concepts, and has deployed a cluster of 28 [[IBM BladeCenter]] [[IBM BladeCenter#QS20|QS20]] Servers (14 blades) for student and faculty use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~bader/CellProgramming.html|title=One-Day IBM Cell Programming Workshop at Georgia Tech|accessdate=2007-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://edageek.com/2007/05/31/georgia-tech-cell-be/|title=Georgia Tech Workshop Drives Cell Broadband Engine Processor Research|work=EDA Geek|date=2007-05-31|accessdate=2007-07-12}}</ref>
