'''Cognitive inertia''' refers the tendency for [[beliefs]] or sets of beliefs to endure once formed. In particular, cognitive inertia describes the [[human behavior|human]] inclination to rely on familiar assumptions and exhibit a reluctance and/or inability to revise those assumptions, even when the evidence supporting them no longer exists or when other evidence would question their accuracy. The term is employed in the [[organizational studies|managerial and organizational sciences]] to describe the commonly observed phenomenon whereby managers fail to update and revise their understanding of a situation when that situation changes, a phenomenon that acts as a psychological barrier to organizational change.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/smj.4250131006 |author=Huff J.O., Huff A.S., Thomas H. |title=Strategic Renewal and the Interaction of Cumulative Stress and Inertia |journal=Strategic Management Journal |volume=13 |issue= |pages=55–75 |year=1992 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-6486.00078 |author=Hodgkinson G.P. |title=Cognitive inertia in a turbulent market: The case of UK residential [[estate agent]]s |journal=Journal of Management Studies |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=921–945 |year=1997 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1287/orsc.7.1.22 |author=Reger R.K., Palmer T.B. |title=Managerial categorization of competitors: Using old maps to navigate new environments |journal=Organization Science |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=22–39 |year=1996 }}</ref> The notion of cognitive inertia is related to similar ideas in the fields of [[social psychology]] and [[behavioral economics|behavioral decision theory]], including [[cognitive dissonance]], [[belief perseverance]], [[confirmation bias]], and [[escalation of commitment]].

One example of cognitive inertia concerns managers at the [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid corporation]], whose belief that the company could not make money on hardware but only on consumables led them to neglect the growth in [[digital imaging]] technologies; because the trend was denied by the prevailing "mental model" of the business, the corporation failed to adapt effectively to market changes.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/1097-0266(200010/11)21:10/11<1147::AID-SMJ128>3.0.CO;2-R |author=Tripsas M., Gavetti G. |title=Capabilities, cognition, and inertia: Evidence from digital imaging |journal=Strategic Management Journal |volume=21 |issue=10-11 |pages=1147–61 |year=2000 }}</ref>

Not all instances of cognitive inertia result in negative outcomes. Cognitive inertia is a key component of [[love]], [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], and [[friendship]]. For instance, if evidence showed that a friend was [[dishonesty|dishonest]], the cognitive inertia of the friendship would demand much more evidence to form an opinion than that required to form an opinion of a stranger. In this fashion, cognitive inertia provides an additional level of trust in a relationship.
