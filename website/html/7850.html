<html> <head> <title>Constraint (mathematics)</title></head><body>In [[mathematics]], a '''constraint''' is a condition that a solution to an [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problem must satisfy. There are two types of constraints: '''equality constraints''' and '''inequality constraints'''. The set of solutions that satisfy all constraints is called the [[candidate solution|feasible set]].

==Example==
The following is a simple optimization problem:

:<math>\min f(\bold x) = x_1^2+x_2^4 </math>

subject to

:<math> x_1 \ge 1 </math>

and

:<math> x_2 = 1, \, </math>

where <math>\bold x</math> denotes the [[Vectorization (mathematics)|vector]] (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>).

In this example, the first line defines the function to be minimized (called the ''objective'' or ''cost function''). The second and third lines define two constraints, the first of which is an inequality constraint and the second is an equality constraint. These two constraints define the feasible set of [[candidate solution]]s.

Without the constraints, the solution would be <math>(0,0)\,</math> where <math>f(\bold x)</math> has the lowest value. But this solution does not satisfy the constraints. The solution of the '''constrained optimization problem''' stated above but <math> \bold x = (1,1)</math>, which is the point with the smallest value of <math>f(\bold x)</math> that satisfies the two constraints.

== Terminology ==
* If a constraint is an ''equality'' at a given point, the constraint is said to be '''{{visible anchor|binding}}''', as the point ''cannot'' be varied in the direction of the constraint.
* If a constraint is an ''inequality'' at a given point, the constraint is said to be '''{{visible anchor|non-binding}}''', as the point ''can'' be varied in the direction of the constraint.
* If a constraint is not satisfied, the point is said to be '''[[Feasible region|infeasible]]'''.
