'''''The Language of the Genes''''' (HarperCollins, ISBN 0-00-255020-2) is a [[popular science]] [[book]] by [[Steve Jones (biologist)|Steve Jones]] about [[genetics]] and [[evolution]].  It followed a 1991 series of [[Reith Lectures]] by Jones with the same title.<ref name=Reith>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/reith/historic_audio/reith_historic.shtml BBC website] Historic Reith Lectures</ref> The book introduces all different aspects of genetics and [[molecular biology]], and the new editions contain information about the frontiers of the field, such as the [[Human Genome Project]].  The first edition was published in 1993 and won the [[Rh√¥ne-Poulenc Prize]]  (now known as the [[Royal Society Prizes for Science Books]])<ref>[http://royalsociety.org/bookspage.asp?id=6372 Prizes for Science Books previous winners and shortlists], The Royal Society website</ref>.

The title of the book is partly the result of Jones' regular use of a [[metaphor]] of [[nucleotide]]s as [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]], [[codon]]s as [[word]]s and [[gene]]s as [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s, but also reflecting Jones' short explanation of [[language]]'s role in [[human]] evolution.

A second revised and expanded edition (ISBN 0-006-55243-9) was published by [[Flamingo (imprint)|Flamingo]] on 18 September 2000.
