Crane started his programming career at [[Atari]], making games for the [[Atari 2600]]. After meeting co-worker [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]] in a tennis game, Miller told Crane about a plan he had to leave Atari and found a company that would give game designers more recognition. From this meeting, Crane left Atari in 1979 and co-founded [[Activision]], along with Miller, [[Jim Levy]], [[Bob Whitehead]], and [[Larry Kaplan]]. His games won many awards while he was at Activision.  At Activision, he was best known as the designer of ''[[Pitfall!]]''.<ref name="wired_article">{{cite news|last=Kohler|first=Chris|title=Pitfall! creator David Crane named videogame pioneer|url=http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-01/27/pitfall!-creator-david-crane-named-videogame-pioneer|accessdate=7 November 2010|newspaper=Wired|date=27 January 2010}}</ref> Pitfall! was a huge hit, and maintained the top slot on the Billboard charts for 64 weeks and was named video game of the year in 1982.<ref name="devry">{{cite web|title=Alumnus Profile|url=http://www.alumni.devry.edu/news-events-alumni/profiles/david-crane.jsp|work=DeVry University|publisher=DeVry University|accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref>

Crane maintained that the Atari policy of relying on mangled adaptations of arcade games would result in a glut of cheap, unappealing games, which became one of the contributing factors to the [[Video Game Crash of 1983]].   He believed instead that tailoring new games to the strengths and weaknesses of the 2600 machine would have yielded positive results.  The reasoning was that while the new games would have lacked the instant-promotion of an already-known name, word of mouth among video gamers, being a young and highly-social group, would have gradually made up for it if the game was good.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In 1986, Crane left Activision to co-found [[Absolute Entertainment]] with [[Garry Kitchen]]. The two of them left mainly because of [[Jim Levy]]'s departure, and the way the newly appointed CEO of Activision, [[Bruce Davis (video game industry)|Bruce Davis]], treated video games more like commodities rather than creative products. Although Crane worked for Absolute, he did all of his programming at his home in California. With Absolute, he was known for ''[[Amazing Tennis]]'' and ''[[A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia]]'', a successful NES title following the adventures of the protagonist and his companion, a shape-shifting ''[[blob]]''.  In 1995, Absolute Entertainment was dissolved.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In 1995, Crane co-founded [[Skyworks Technologies]], and is the organization's [[Chief Technical Officer]].
