An '''Executable Architecture''' ('''EA'''), in general, is the description of a [[system architecture]] (including software and/or otherwise) in a [[formal]] [[notation]] together with the tools (e.g. [[compilers]]/[[Translator (computers)|translators]]) that allow the automatic or semi-automatic generation of artifacts (e.g. Capability Gap Analysis (CGA), [[scientific modelling|Models]], software stubs, [[Military Scenario Definition Language]] (MSDL)) from that notation and which are used in the analysis, refinement, and/or the implementation of the architecture described.<ref>Pawlowski, Tom, "Executable Architecture", [[MITRE]], 2004 [http://www.mitre.org/news/events/tech04/briefings/729.pdf]</ref><ref>Garcia, Johnny, "Executable architecture analysis modeling", ISBN 1-56555-314-4, 2007 [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1404840]</ref><ref>Youssef, R., Kim, B., Pagotto, J., Vallerand, A., Lam, S., Pace, P., Pogue, C., Greenley, A., "Toward an Integrated Executable Architecture and M&S Based Analysis for Counter Terrorism and Homeland Security", RTO-MP-MSG-045, NATO OTAN, February 2007 [http://ftp.rta.nato.int/public//PubFullText/RTO/MP/RTO-MP-MSG-045///MP-MSG-045-07.pdf]</ref><ref>Harrison, Gregory A., Hutt, Russell, Kern, Howard S., Saidi, Salaheddine, Young, Christopher A., "Federated executable architecture technology as an enabling technology for simulation of large systems", 2006 [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006SPIE.6227E..13H]</ref>
