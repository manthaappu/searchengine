Semi-structured data is increasingly occurring since the advent of the [[Internet]] where [[full-text]] [[documents]] and [[databases]] are not the only forms of data anymore. Especially in object-oriented databases you often find semi-structured data.

== Types of Semi-structured data ==

[[XML]]<ref>The Penn database group has semi-structured and XML data project [http://db.cis.upenn.edu/research/SS_XML.html]</ref>, other markup languages, [[email]], [[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]] are all forms of semi-structured data.
