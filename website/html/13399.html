<html> <head> <title>Federation (information technology)</title></head><body>A '''Federation''' is multiple computing and/or network providers agreeing upon standards of operation in a collective fashion. The term may be used when describing the inter-operation of two distinct, formally disconnected, [[telecommunications network]]s that may have different internal structures.  The term may also be used when groups attempt to delegate collective authority of development to prevent [[Fork (software development)|fragmentation]].

In a telecommunication inter-connection, the internal ''[[modus operandi]]'' of the different systems is irrelevant to the existence of a federation.

Joining two distinct networks:
*[[Yahoo!]] and [[Microsoft]] announced that [[Yahoo! Messenger]] and [[MSN Messenger]] would be interoperable.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.betanews.com/article/Microsoft_Yahoo_to_Link_IM_Networks/1129075667|title=Microsoft, Yahoo to Link IM Networks|date=October 12, 2005|author=Nate Mook|publisher=[[Beta News]]}}</ref>

Collective authority:
*The [[MIT X Consortium]] was founded in 1988 to prevent fragmentation in development of the [[X Window System]]. Today every major platform besides Windows is distributed with largely compatible X server implementations.<ref>At least most [[GNU/Linux distribution]]s,<!--non-GNU systems rarely have X11--> [[UNIX]], [[BSD]], and [[Mac OS X|Mac OSX]]</ref>
*[[OpenID]], a form of [[federated identity]]

In networking systems, to be '''federated''' means users are able to send messages from one network to the other. This is not the same as having a client that can operate with both networks, but interacts with both independently. For example [[Google]] allowing [[GMail]] users to log into their [[AOL Instant Messenger]] (AIM) accounts from GMail is not federation. One cannot send messages from [[GTalk]] or [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]] (which Google/GTalk '''is''' federated with) to AIM, and vice versa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=61024|title=About AIM in Gmail|publisher=[[Google]]|date=2009-10-13}}</ref>
