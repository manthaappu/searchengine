A '''distributed [[database management system]]''' ('DDBMS') is a [[software system]] that permits the management of a [[distributed database]] and makes the distribution transparent to the users. A distributed database is a collection of multiple, logically interrelated databases distributed over a computer network. Sometimes "distributed database system" is used to refer jointly to the distributed database and the distributed DBMS.

==Overview==
Distributed database management systems is a software for managing databases stored on multiple computers in a network. A distributed database is a set of databases stored on multiple computers that typically appears to applications on a single database. Consequently, an application can simultaneously access and modify the data in several databases in a network. DDBMS is specially developed for heterogeneous database platforms, focusing mainly on heterogeneous database management systems (HDBMS).
