A '''fill device''' is an electronic module used to load [[key (cryptography)|cryptographic keys]] into electronic [[encryption]] machines.  Fill devices are usually hand held and battery operated. 

Older mechanical encryption systems, such as [[rotor machine]]s, were keyed by setting the positions of wheels and plugs from a printed keying list.  Electronic systems required some way to load the necessary cryptovariable data. In the 1950s and 1960s, systems such as the [[United States|U.S.]] [[National Security Agency]] [[KW-26]] and the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Fialka]] used [[punched card]]s for this purpose. Later [[NSA encryption systems]] incorporated a [[serial port]] fill connector and developed several '''common fill devices''' (CFDs) that could be used with multiple systems. A CFD was plugged in when new keys were to be loaded. Newer [[National Security Agency|NSA]] systems allow "[[Over the Air Rekeying|over the air rekeying]]" (OTAR), but a master key often must still be loaded using a fill device. 

NSA uses two serial protocols for key fill, '''DS-101''' and '''DS-102'''. Both employ the same [[U-229]] 6-pin connector type used for U.S. military audio [[handset]]s, with the DS-101 being the newer of the two serial fill protocols. The DS-101 protocol can also be used to load cryptographic algorithms and software updates for crypto modules.

Besides encryption devices, systems that can require key fill include  [[Identification Friend or Foe|IFF]], [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and [[frequency hopping]] radios such as [[Have Quick]]  and [[SINCGARS]].

Common fill devices employed by NSA include:

*[[AN/CYZ-10]] Data Transfer Device - a small [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]-like unit that can store up to 1000 keys.
*[[Secure DTD2000 System]] (SDS) - Nomenclatured KIK-20 is the next generation common fill device replacement for the DTD.
*[[AN/PYQ-10]] Simple Key Loader (SKL) - a simpler replacement for the DTD.
*[[KOI-18]]  [[paper tape]] reader. The operator pulled 8-level tape through this unit by hand.
*[[KSD-64]] Crypto ignition key (CIK)
*[[KYK-13]] Electronic Transfer Device  
*KYX-15Â Net Control Device 
*MX-10579 ECCM Fill Device ([[SINCGARS]])

Only the KSD-64, CYZ-10, Secure DTD2000, PYQ-10 and KOI-18 can handle modern 128-bit keys. Older units are apparently limited to 90-bit keys. A newer fill device, the [[Secure DTD2000 System]] (or SDS), which employs the [[Windows CE]] operating system, began production in 2006.[http://www.sypriselectronics.com/electronics/content.asp?page_id=34]
