<html> <head> <title>Effective transmission rate</title></head><body>In [[telecommunication]]s, '''effective transmission rate''' ('''average rate of transmission''', '''effective speed of transmission''') is the rate at which [[information]] is processed by a [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] facility. 

*The effective transmission rate is calculated as (''a'') the measured number of units of [[data]], such as [[bit]]s, [[character (computing)|character]]s, [[Block (telecommunications)|blocks]], or [[Frame (telecommunications)|frame]]s, transmitted during a significant measurement [[time]] interval divided by (''b'') the measurement time interval. 
*The effective transmission rate is usually expressed as a number of units of data per unit time, such as [[bits per second]] or [[characters per second]].
