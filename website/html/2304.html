In the [[Orion's Arm|Orion's Arm Universe]], an '''Archailect''' is an ascended post-[[Technological singularity|singularity]] intelligence that has grown vastly beyond even the [[Transapient]] level. Within the context of this hypothetical universe, they represent the highest level to which living beings are currently known to have evolved.

==Archailects as described in the OA Universe==

There is not one, but rather several toposophic grades of archailects (or "Archai" as they are also known). This is to say, the [[Technological singularity|''Singularity'']] postulated by [[transhumanist]]s and some [[Futures studies|futurist]]s is not actually a singular, ''one-off'' event - rather, it is merely the first of several major changes which intelligences undergo as they improve themselves, mutate, and evolve into higher forms. Within the OA Universe, then, there are said to be approximately six such Singularities which are thought to have happened so far, each producing vastly superior ''grades'' of intelligence.

==Origin of the Concept==

The concept of archailects was inspired by a number of sources, including the work of AI researcher [[Hugo de Garis]], who coined the term "artilect" for "artificial intellect"; [[science fiction]] writer [[David Zindell]] who refers to godlike AIs that he calls "mainbrains"; and concepts from mysticism and mythology, such as the ideas of [[Carl Jung|Jung]], and the gods of [[Homer]]ic mythology who interfere in all sorts of ways in the lives of mortals.  The concept of moon-, jupiter-, dyson-, and nebula-sized computing nodes was inspired by [[Anders Sandberg]]'s paper on this subject (see references).  

The term "archailect" is a play on "artilect", "archetype", and "AI", and is a meshing of the phrase "archetypal AI intellect."

As the ''Orion's Arm'' project has progressed, various other themes have been added, including memetics, and replacing a purely [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] concept with the idea of archailects as equally beyond biological sophonts and AIs in the limited sense.
