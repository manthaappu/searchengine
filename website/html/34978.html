A '''software developer''' is a person or organization concerned with facets of the [[software development process]].  They can be involved in aspects wider than design and coding, a somewhat broader scope of [[computer programming]] or a specialty of [[project manager|project managing]] including some aspects of [[software product management]]. This person may contribute to the overview of the project on the application level rather than component level or individual programming tasks. Software developers are often still guided by [[lead programmer]]s but also encompasses the class of [[freelancer|freelance]] software developers.

A person who develops stand-alone software (that is more than just a simple program) and got involved with all phases of the development (design and code) is a software developer.  Many legendary software people including [[Peter Norton]] (developer of ''Norton Utilities''), [[Richard Garriott]] ([[Ultima (series)|Ultima]]-series creator), [[Philippe Kahn]] ([[Borland]] key founder), started as entrepreneurial individual or small-team software developers before they became rich and famous.

Other names which are often used in the same close context are [[software analyst]] and [[software engineer]].

With time and a little luck, differences between system design, [[software development]] and programming are more apparent. Already in the current market place there can be found a segregation between [[programmer]]s and developers, being that one who actually implements is not the same as the one who designs the [[Class (computer science)|class]] structure or hierarchy. Even more so that developers become [[systems architect]]s, those who design the multi-leveled architecture or component interactions of a large software system.<ref name="Sourcegear_2005">{{cite web |url=http://software.ericsink.com/No_Programmers.html |title= Small ISVs: You need Developers, not Programmers |author=[[Eric Sink]] |publisher=[http://www.sourcegear.com/ sourcegear] |accessdate=2008-06-06 |quote=A programmer is someone who does nothing but code new features and (if you're lucky) fix bugs. They don't write specs. They don't write automated test cases. They don't help keep the automated build system up to date.  They don't help customers work out tough problems. They don't help write documentation. They don't help with testing. They don't even read code. All they do is write new code.}}</ref> (see also [[software engineer#Debate over who is a software engineer|Debate over who is a software engineer]])

A '[[programmer]]' is responsible for writing [[source code]],<ref name="Sourcegear_2005" /> but a 'developer' could be involved in wider aspects of the software development process such as:
*Software Design
*Actual core implementation (programming which is often the most important portion of software development)
*Other required implementations (e.g. installation, configuration, customization, integration, data migration)
*Participation in [[Software product management|software product definition]], including [[Business case]] or [[Gap_analysis#Market_gap_analysis|Gap]] analysis
*Specification
*[[Requirements analysis]]
*Development and refinement of throw-away [[Software prototyping|simulations or prototypes]] to confirm requirements
*[[Requirements_management#Feasibility|Feasibility]] and [[Cost-benefit analysis]], including the choice of application [[Application Architecture|architecture]] and [[Application framework|framework]], leading to the [[budget]] and schedule for the project
*Authoring of [[Software documentation#User_documentation|documentation]] needed by users and implementation partners etc.
*Testing, including defining/supporting [[acceptance testing]] and gathering feedback from [[Software_release_life_cycle#Software_release_stages|pre-release testers]]
*Participation in [[Software_product_management#Management_of_aspects_of_software_development|software release and post-release]] activities, including support for product launch [[Technology evangelist|evangelism]] (e.g. developing demonstrations and/or samples) and competitive analysis for subsequent product build/release cycles
*Maintenance

In a large company there may be employees whose sole responsibility may consist of only one of the phases above. In smaller development environments, a few, or even a single individual might handle the complete process.
