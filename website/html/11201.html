'''Dustbot''' is a [[robot]] that can collect garbage from homes. It can be summoned by phone call or [[SMS]], and uses [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] to automatically make its way to the customer, collect the rubbish, and take it to a dustbin. In addition, the Dustbots carry environmental sensors to monitor the pollution levels over, for example, a pedestrian area. Prototypes have been tested in [[Italy]] and [[Sweden]] and [[Ireland]], and it is due for launch in 2009. The Dustbot project is funded by the [[European Commission]].

The Dustbot system, consisting of the DustCart and the DustClean robots, is designed to work in tight urban areas where large trucks find it difficult to operate,<ref name=BBC/> such as old European cities.<ref name=TECH/> It can work in narrow streets which are difficult for large refuse trucks to negotiate.<ref name=TG>{{Cite web

==Technical==
The garbage bin of the Dustcart robot has a capacity of 40 kg.<ref name=TG/>

Dustbot uses different localisation systems and uses [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] navigation<ref name=BBC/> combined with pre-loaded maps.<ref name=TG/> It uses a [[gyroscope]] to keep it upright, and has sensors to avoid collisions with static and dynamic obstacles.<ref name=BBC/>

It is able to monitor [[Air pollution|pollution]] through a number of air quality sensors.,<ref name=TG/> and can warn if the levels are too high.<ref name=STOCK/> The key idea is to exploit robots that are primarily used for something else for pollution monitoring and/or detection of poisonous gases. This is especially important in the case of gases that humans cannot sense or when long-term exposure to slightly increased concentrations needs to be verified.<ref name=Airborne_Chemical_Sensing_Review>{{Cite web
