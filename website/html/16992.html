==Recognition==
In December 2008, [[Apple Inc.]] released a series of lists that showed the top downloads of the year from the [[App Store]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kumparak|first=Greg|authorlink=Greg Kumparak|title=Apple announces Top 10 iPhone App downloads of 2008|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|date=December 2, 2008|url=http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2008/12/02/apple-announces-top-10-iphone-app-downloads-of-2008/|accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref> The lists showed the 10 most-downloaded applications from different categories, in no particular order. The iBeer application from Hottrix appeared in both the "Top Paid Apps (Overall)" and "Top Paid Entertainment" lists.

[[iBeer]] was also called a "must-have" application by [[CNN Money]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Kimes|first=Mina|title=Top 10 must-have iPhone apps|publisher=[[CNN Money]]|date=September 23, 2008|url=http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2008/fortune/0809/gallery.must_have_iphone_apps.fortune/2.html|accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref> Hottrix was praised by [[Condé Nast Portfolio]] for their trick software, with iBeer singled out as "the perfect gift".<ref>{{cite news|title=The Perfect Gift for The Tech Observer: iBeer!!|publisher=[[Condé Nast Portfolio]]|date=July 12, 2007|url=http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/the-tech-observer/2007/07/12/the-perfect-gift-for-the-tech-observer-ibeer|accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref>

In October 2008, Hottrix filed a [[United states dollar|US$]]12.5 million lawsuit against [[Coors Brewing Company]] for developing an application called "iPint" for the iPhone OS.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chen|first=Brian X.|title=Indie iPhone Developer Sues Coors for $12.5M|publisher=[[Wired News]]|date=October 13, 2008|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2008/10/indie-iphone-de/|accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref> The suit alleged that Coors violated copyright law by making a program similar to iBeer. Apple removed iPint from the App Store in the United States after receiving a complaint from Hottrix.<ref>{{cite news|last=Reed|first=Jim|title=Virtual beer war hits the iPhone|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=October 17, 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/low/technology/newsid_7676000/7676081.stm|accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref>

==List of iPhone OS applications==
===App Store apps===
These tricks are available at the App Store.
====HottrixPhone====
This trick gives the appearance of a phone call with a famous celebrity, including real pre-recorded voices of the celebrity. There are multiple celebrities available within the application, including [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Barack Obama]], as well as the ability to add your own.
====iBeer====
[[File:Ibeer icon.png|right|75 px]]
'''iBeer''' is a trick that gives the illusion that the device screen "fills" with many varieties of [[beer]] (including sound). If the device is tilted, the virtual beer swishes around to give the illusion of truly being filled with beer. The beer can be "drained" if the device is tilted enough, and a belch sounds when the beer has been completely drained.  iBeer appeared in both the "Top Paid Apps (Overall)" and "Top Paid Entertainment" lists published by Apple in December 2008.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kumparak|first=Greg|authorlink=Greg Kumparak|title=Apple announces Top 10 iPhone App downloads of 2008|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|date=December 2, 2008|url=http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2008/12/02/apple-announces-top-10-iphone-app-downloads-of-2008/|accessdate=September 3, 2009}}</ref>

====iBug====
'''iBug''' is a trick that gives the appearance of a virtual insect appearing on the screen of the device. It responds to touch and can get fat. The bug laughs when the device is shaken.

====iMilk====
'''iMilk''' is a trick similar to iBeer, but appears as different varieties of [[milk]], such as chocolate milk, strawberry milk, and "martian milk." iMilk has a pay trick and a magic button to perform various tricks with money.

====iMunchies====
'''iMunchies''' is a trick that gives the illusion that the device is filling with many varieties of snacks such as [[candy]], [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], and [[popcorn]]. A person could then pretend to pull snacks out of the device by reaching beneath it and retrieving a previously-hidden snack using [[sleight of hand]]. The snacks can also be poured out of the device.
====iSoda====
'''iSoda''' is a trick similar to iBeer and iMilk, but with various [[soft drink]]s, such as cola, energy drink, and fizzy water.

====Jarheads====
'''Jarhead Bob''', '''Jarhead Tim''', and '''Jarhead Ned''' are tricks that have dungeon lab samples in potent juice. The heads roll their eyes when the device is tilted and the juice turns into blood when shaken. The liquid drains when the device is tilted enough, similar to iBeer.

====Magic Wallet====
'''Magic Wallet''' is a trick similar to iMunchies, but with [[money|coins]] in many currencies instead of snacks.
