'''Bernard Chazelle''' (born November 5, 1955) is the Eugene Higgins Professor of [[Computer Science]] at [[Princeton University]]. Much of his work is in [[computational geometry]], where he has found many of the best-known algorithms, such as [[linear-time]] [[Polygon triangulation|triangulation]] of a [[simple polygon]], as well as many useful complexity results, such as [[lower bound]] techniques based on [[discrepancy theory]]. He is also known for his invention of the [[soft heap]] data structure and the most [[asymptotically]] efficient known algorithm for finding [[minimum spanning tree]]s.

Chazelle originally grew up in [[Paris, France]], where he received his bachelors degree and masters degree in [[applied mathematics]] at the [[Ecole des Mines de Paris]] in 1977. Then, at the age of 22, he came to [[Yale University]] in the United States, where he received his Ph.D. in computer science under the supervision of [[David P. Dobkin]]. He went on to claim important research positions at institutions such as [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon]], [[Brown University|Brown]], [[NEC Research Institute|NEC]], [[Xerox PARC]], and the Paris institutions [[Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure]], [[Ecole Polytechnique]], and [[INRIA]]. As of 2004, he has 191 published articles, 93 of which are journal articles, and published two books. He has received 18 grants, 12 of which are from the [[National Science Foundation]]. He is a fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]], the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]], and [[NEC Research Institute|NEC]], as well as a member of the [[European Academy of Sciences]].

Chazelle has also written a few polemical essays, such as "Bush's Desolate Imperium" [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/politics/bush-article.html] and "Anti-Americanism: A Clinical Study" [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/politics/antiam.html], which draw from his life experience in both [[France]] and the [[United States]].
