In [[coordinate geometry]], using the common convention that the horizontal axis represents a variable ''x'' and the vertical axis represents a variable ''y'', a '''''y''-intercept''' is a point where the [[graph of a function]] or [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] intersects with the ''y''-axis of the [[coordinate system]]<ref>

</ref>.  As such, these points satisfy ''x''=0.

If the curve in question is given as ''y'' = ''f''(''x''), the ''y''-coordinate of the ''y''-intercept is found by calculating ''f''(0). Functions which are undefined at ''x'' = 0 have no ''y''-intercept.

Some 2-dimensional mathematical relationships such as [[circle]]s, [[ellipse]]s, and [[hyperbola]]s can have more than one ''y''-intercept. Because functions associate ''x'' values to no more than one ''y'' value as part of their definition, they can have at most one ''y''-intercept.

Analogously, an [[root (mathematics)|x-intercept]] is a point where the [[graph of a function]] or [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] intersects with the ''x''-axis.  As such, these points satisfy ''y''=0.  The zeros, or roots, of such a function or relation are the ''x''-coordinates of these x-intercepts. <ref>

Unlike ''y''-intercepts, functions of the form ''y'' = ''f''(''x'') may contain multiple ''x''-intercepts. The ''x''-intercepts of functions, if any exist, are often more difficult to locate than the ''y''-intercept, as finding the y intercept involves simply evaluating the function at x=0.

The notion may be extended for 3-dimensional space and higher dimensions, as well as for other coordinate axes, possibly with other names. For example, one may speak of the ''I''-intercept of the [[I/V-characteristic]] of, say, a [[diode]].
