A '''predicative verb''' is a verb that behaves as a grammatical [[adjective]]; that is, it predicates (qualifies or informs about the properties of its argument). It is a special kind of [[stative verb]].

Many languages do not use the present forms of the verb "to be" to separate an adjective from its noun: instead, these forms of the verb "to be" are understood as part of the adjective. <!-- Isn't that zero-copula? Especially if the example is Semitic... --> [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] uses this structure: "my mouth is red" is written as "red my mouth" (/dSr=f r=i/). Other languages to use this structure include the [[Northwest Caucasian languages]], the [[Thai language]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], the [[East Slavic languages]], the [[Semitic languages]], some [[Nilotic languages]] and the [[Athabaskan languages]].

In the [[Akkadian language]]s, the "predicative" (also called the "permansive" or "stative") is a set of pronominal inflections used to convert noun stems into effective sentences, so that the form ''šarrāku'' is a single word more or less equivalent to either of the sentences ''šarrum anāku'' "I am king" or ''šarratum anāku'' "I am queen".<ref>"Akkadian and Eblaite" by  John Huehnergaard and Christopher Woods" in ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the World's Ancient Languages'', edited by Roger D.
