'''Hindawi Programming System''' (hereafter referred to as HPS) is a suite of [[open source]] [[programming languages]]. It allows non-English medium literates  to learn and write [[computer programs]]. It is a scalable system which supports many [[programming paradigms]].<ref>[http://w3.linux-magazine.com/issue/76/Linux_World_News.pdf Review of Hindawi]  Linux Magazine</ref>

Shaili Prathmik or Indic BASIC and Indic LOGO are for beginners who want to start with [[computer programming]].

On the higher end it supports Shaili Guru (Indic C), Shaili Shraeni (Indic C++), Shaili Yantrik (Indic [[Assembly language|Assembly]]), Shaily Shabda (Indic [[Lex programming tool|Lex]]), Shaili Vyaakaran (Shaili Vyaaka/Indic [[Yacc]]), and Shaili Kritrim, which is an Indic [[programming language]] targeting [[JVM]].

==Mechanism and algorithms==
HPS uses Romenagri transliteration to first convert the high level source code into a compiler acceptable format and then uses an existing compiler to produce machine code.

==History==
* The original contributors to HPS were  Abhishek Choudhary  and  Sweta Karwa, who also developed [[APCISR]] and [[Romenagri]]
* Initial public release - 15 August 2004
* Release of version 2 by the ex-[[education minister]] of [[Bihar]], Dr. [[Ram Prakash Mahto]] - 15 August 2005
* Release of Linux port under Sarai fellowship - 16 August 2006
