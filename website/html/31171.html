<html> <head> <title>Raimund Seidel</title></head><body>'''Raimund G. Seidel''' is a professor of [[computer scientist]] at the [[Saarland University|Universität des Saarlandes]] and an expert in [[computational geometry]].

Seidel was born in [[Graz]], [[Austria]], and studied with [[Hermann Maurer]] at the [[Graz University of Technology]].<ref>[http://informatik.tugraz.at/cs/de/sacs/programm/vortraege/seidel_raimund.html Profile] in program for conference on significant advances in computer science, Graz University of Technology, 2007.</ref> He received his Ph.D. in 1987 from [[Cornell University]] under the supervision of John Gilbert.<ref>{{mathgenealogy|id=60193|name=Raimund G. Seidel}}.</ref> After teaching at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], he moved in 1994 to Saarland.<ref>[http://www.mmci.uni-saarland.de/index.php?id=40&L=0 Profile] at the Multimodal Computing and Interaction cluster, Saarland University.</ref> In 1997 he and [[Christoph M. Hoffmann]] were program chairs for the ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry.

Seidel invented backwards analysis of [[randomized algorithm]]s and used it to analyze a simple [[linear programming]] algorithm that runs in linear time for problems of bounded dimension.<ref>{{citation|last=Seidel|first=R.|title= Small-dimensional linear programming and convex hulls made easy|journal=Discrete & Computational Geometry|volume=6|issue=1|year=1991|pages=423–434|doi=10.1007/BF02574699}}.</ref> With his student [[Cecilia R. Aragon]] in 1989 he devised the [[treap]] [[data structure]],<ref name="paper89">
