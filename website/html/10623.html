The '''Dis virtual machine''' is the execution environment for application code in the [[Inferno (operating system)|Inferno]] operating system. Its design is based on a [[register machine]], closely modeling [[complex instruction set computer|CISC]]-like architectures on which it runs.<ref>[http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/papers/dis.html ''Dis Virtual Machine Specification'' 26 February 2009]</ref> Code is [[interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] or is [[just-in-time compilation|just-in-time compiled]] into [[machine code]] for the target architecture.

Dis is the target machine for the [[Limbo (programming language)|Limbo]] programming language.  

Dis has [[memory management]] built in. It uses a hybrid of [[reference counting]] and a [[real-time computing|real-time]] [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collector]] for cyclic data.

The [[instruction set architecture]] is based on a three-operand memory-to-memory machine. It includes instructions for arithmetic, [[control flow]], data motion. There are also instructions for creating new [[process (computing)|process]]es, synchronizing and communicating between processes, loading modules of code, and support for higher-level data-types: strings, arrays, lists, and communication channels. 

Dis instructions operate on operands of byte (8 bits), word (32 bits), float (64 bits), and big integer (64 bits).
