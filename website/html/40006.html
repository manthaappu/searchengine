<html> <head> <title>Weighted random early detection</title></head><body>'''Weighted random early detection''' (WRED) is a [[Queue (data structure)|queue]] management [[algorithm]] with [[Network congestion avoidance|congestion avoidance]] capabilities. It is an extension to '''[[Random early detection]]''' (RED) where a single queue may have several different queue thresholds. Each queue threshold is associated to a particular [[Type of Service|IP precedence]] or [[DSCP]] (for [[DiffServ]]), etc.. 
For example: A queue may have lower thresholds for lower priority packet. A queue buildup will cause the lower priority packets to be dropped, hence protecting the higher priority packets in the same [[Queue (data structure)|queue]].

In this way [[Quality of service|QoS]] prioritization is made possible for important [[packets]] from a pool of packets using the same buffer.<ref>http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/11_2/feature/guide/wred_gs.html Cisco web page explaining WRED</ref>
