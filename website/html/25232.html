A '''mullergraph''' is a [[graphics|graph]] system specifically designed to monitor and map out the functioning capabilities of various [[computer]] components integrated together. These could range from everything from [[personal computers]] to computers operating in a [[Computer networking|network]]. A multitude of variables are considered and graphed out to diagnose the functioning capabilities of the specific computer or computer systems. A scoring system is designed for each specific system, and an over-all gradient score is given to the system being examined.
