'''''Hovertank 3D''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[Video game|computer game]] developed by [[id Software]] and published by [[Softdisk]] in April, 1991. It is claimed to be the first ever first-person shooter and is sometimes inaccurately claimed to be the first 3D game for [[MS-DOS]], although it was preceded at least by ''[[History of Microsoft Flight Simulator|Microsoft Flight Simulator]]'', ''[[Elite (computer game)|Elite]]'', ''[[Alpha Waves]]'', ''[[Starglider]]'', ''[[Starglider 2]]'', and ''[[3-Demon]]''. The game used the same combination of scaled [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s and drawn walls that would later show up in ''[[Catacomb 3D]]'' and ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', but the walls in ''Hovertank 3D'' were in solid color, without any textures.

==Story==
''Hovertank 3D'' is set during a [[Nuclear War]]. In ''Hovertank 3D'', the player controls Brick Sledge, a [[mercenary]] hired by an unknown organization (referred to by the game as the "UFA") to rescue people from cities under the threat of [[nuclear attack]] (largely political activists), both by the government and by large corporations. However, the cities are also full of [[mutated]] humans, strange creatures, armed guards, and enemy hovertanks. 

== Gameplay ==
The player must drive a hovertank through the levels and try and find the people Brick is supposed to rescue. There are also many enemies in the levels, who are hunting down the people as well as the player. The player can keep track of both people and enemies in the radar box at the bottom of the screen. There is also a timer that counts how long until the nuke is dropped. Once all the living people are collected a yellow teleporter appears somewhere in the level, and the player must find it to win. Then the player receives their fee, based on the amount of people safely rescued, and how fast the operation was completed. All damage to the hovertank is repaired at the end of the level.

== Development ==
This title is a landmark in first person game graphics. Other 3D games at the time, such as [[flight simulator]]s and other games that had more detailed environments, were noticeably slower.<ref name="mastersdoom">{{cite book | last=Kushner | first=David | title=[[Masters of Doom|Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created An Empire And Transformed Pop Culture]] | publisher=[[Random House]] | at=89 | date=2003 | isbn=0375505245 }}</ref> [[John D. Carmack|John Carmack]]'s research in the game's engine took six weeks, two weeks longer than any id engine before it. Afterwards, the id staff decided the nuclear Armageddon theme and developed the game. [[Adrian Carmack]] is said to have enjoyed drawing the monsters and other ghoulish touches.<ref name="mastersdoom">{{cite book | last=Kushner | first=David | title=[[Masters of Doom|Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created An Empire And Transformed Pop Culture]] | publisher=[[Random House]] | at=89 | date=2003 | isbn=0375505245 }}</ref> 

The credits are John Carmack and [[John Romero]] (programming), [[Tom Hall]] (game design) and Adrian Carmack (artwork).
