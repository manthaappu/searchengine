<html> <head> <title>Log area ratio</title></head><body>'''Log area ratios (LAR)''' can be used to represent [[reflection coefficient]]s (another form for [[Linear predictive coding|linear prediction coefficients]]) for transmission over a channel. While not as efficient as [[line spectral pairs]] (LSPs), log area ratios are much simpler to compute. Let <math>r_k</math> be the ''k''th reflection coefficient of a filter, the ''k''th LAR is:

: <math>A_k = \log{1+r_k \over 1-r_k}</math>

Use of Log Area Ratios have now been mostly replaced by Line Spectral Pairs, but older codecs, such as GSM-FR use LARs.
