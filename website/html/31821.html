<html> <head> <title>Rendezvous (Plan 9)</title></head><body>'''Rendezvous''' is a [[data synchronization]] mechanism in [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs]]. It is a [[system call]] that allows two [[Process (computing)|processes]] to exchange a single data item while synchronizing. 

The rendezvous call takes a ''tag'' and a ''value'' as its arguments. The tag is typically an address in memory shared by both processes. Calling rendezvous causes a process to sleep until a second rendezvous call with a matching tag occurs. Then, the values are exchanged and both processes are awakened.

More complex synchronization mechanisms can be created from this primitive operation. See also [[mutual exclusion]].
