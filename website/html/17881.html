<html> <head> <title>Identity verification service</title></head><body>'''Identity verification services''' are online services used to establish a mapping from a person's [[online identity]] to their [[Real life (reality)|real life]] identity. These services are used by some [[social networking sites]], [[Internet forum]]s, [[dating site]]s and [[wiki]]s to stop [[sockpuppetry]], underage SignUps, [[spamming]] and illegal activities like harassment and scams.

The identity confirmation process requires the individual who's identity is to be confirmed to provide personal data online, to the identity verification firm. The firm then checks public and private databases for a match and prompts the user to answer questions based on the records. An identity "score" is calculated, and the identity of the online user is either given the "verified" status, or not, based on the score.<ref name="JG">{{cite web|url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/nobody_knows_youre_a_dog.php|title=Nobody Knows You're A Dog 2.0|last=Gupta|first=Jitendra|date=January 29, 2007|publisher=ReadWriteWeb|accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref><ref name="TW">{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/76558/VeriSign_unveils_new_online_identity_verification_services|title=VeriSign unveils new online identity-verification services|last=Weiss|first=Todd|date=December 10, 2002 |publisher=ComputerWorld|accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref>
