<html> <head> <title>Size function</title></head><body>'''Size functions''' are shape descriptors, in a geometrical/topological sense. They are functions from the half-plane <math>x<y\ </math> to the natural numbers, counting certain connected components of a [[topological space]]. They are used in [[pattern recognition]] and [[topology]].

==Formal definition==
In [[size theory]], the '''size function''' <math>\ell_{(M,\varphi)}:\Delta^+=\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2:x<y\}\to \mathbb{N}</math> associated with the [[size pair]] <math>(M,\varphi:M\to \mathbb{R})</math> is defined in the following way. For every <math>(x,y)\in \Delta^+</math>, <math>\ell_{(M,\varphi)}(x,y)</math> is equal to the number of connected components of the set 
<math>\{p\in M:\varphi(p)\le y\}</math> that contain at least one point at which the [[measuring function]] (a [[continuous function]] from a [[topological space]] <math>M\ </math> to <math>\mathbb{R}^k\ </math>.<ref name="FroLa99"> Patrizio Frosini, Claudia Landi, ''Size theory as a topological tool for computer vision'', Pattern Recognition And Image Analysis, 9(4):596-603, [[1999]].</ref> <ref name="FroMu99">Patrizio Frosini, Michele Mulazzani, ''Size homotopy groups for computation of natural size distances'', Bulletin of the Belgian Mathematical Society - Simon Stevin, 6:455-464 [[1999]].</ref>) <math>\varphi</math> takes a value smaller than or equal to <math>x\ </math>

==History and applications==
Size functions were introduced in 
<ref name="Fro90"> Patrizio Frosini, ''A distance for similarity classes of submanifolds of a Euclidean space'', Bulletin of the Australian Mathematical Society, 42(3):407-416, 1990.</ref> 
for the particular case of <math>M\ </math> equal to the topological space of all piecewise <math>C^1\ </math> closed paths in a <math>C^\infty\ </math> [[closed manifold]] embedded in a Euclidean space. Here the topology on <math>M\ </math> is induced by the 
<math>C^0\ </math>-norm, while the [[measuring function]] <math>\varphi\ </math> takes each path <math>\gamma\in M</math> to its length. 
In 
<ref name="Fro91"> Patrizio Frosini, ''Measuring shapes by size functions'', Proc. of SPIE, Intelligent Robots and Computer Vision X: Algorithms and Techniques, Boston, MA, 1607:122-133, 1991.</ref> 
the case of <math>M\ </math> equal to the topological space of all ordered <math>k\ </math>-tuples of points in a submanifold of a Euclidean space is considered.
Here the topology on <math>M\ </math> is induced by the metric <math>d((P_1,\ldots,P_k),(Q_1\ldots,Q_k))=\max_{1\le i\le k}\|P_i-Q_i\|</math>.

An extension of the concept of size function to [[algebraic topology]] was made in 
<ref name="FroMu99">Patrizio Frosini and Michele Mulazzani, ''Size homotopy groups for computation of natural size distances'', Bulletin of the Belgian Mathematical Society - Simon Stevin, 6:455-464 1999.</ref>, 
where the concept of [[size homotopy group]] was introduced. Here [[measuring function]]s taking values in <math>\mathbb{R}^k</math> are allowed.
An extension to [[homology theory]] (the [[size functor]]) was introduced in 
<ref name="CaFePo01">Francesca Cagliari, Massimo Ferri and Paola Pozzi, ''Size functions from a categorical viewpoint'', Acta Applicandae Mathematicae, 67(3):225-235, 2001.</ref>.
The concepts of [[size homotopy group]] and [[size functor]] are strictly related to the concept of [[persistent homology group]]
<ref name="EdLeZo02">Herbert Edelsbrunner, David Letscher and Afra Zomorodian, ''Topological Persistence and Simplification'', [[Discrete and Computational Geometry]], 28(4):511-533, 2002.</ref>, 
studied in [[persistent homology]]. It is worth to point out that the size function is the rank of the <math>0</math>-th persistent homology group, while the relation between the persistent homology group 
and the size homotopy group is analogous to the one existing between [[homology group]]s and [[homotopy group]]s.

Size functions have been initially introduced as a mathematical tool for shape comparison in [[computer vision]] and [[pattern recognition]], and have constituted the seed of [[size theory]]

The main point is that size functions are invariant for every transformation preserving the [[measuring function]]. Hence, they can be adapted to many different applications, by simply changing the [[measuring function]] in order to get the wanted invariance. Moreover, size functions show properties of relative resistance to noise, depending on the fact that they distribute the information all over the half-plane <math>\Delta^+\ </math>.

==Main properties==
Assume that <math>M\ </math> is a compact locally connected Hausdorff space. The following statements hold:

¤ every size function <math>\ell_{(M,\varphi)}(x,y)</math> is a [[non-decreasing function]] in the variable <math>x\ </math> and a [[Nonincreasing function|non-increasing function]] in the variable <math>y\ </math>.

¤ every size function <math>\ell_{(M,\varphi)}(x,y)</math> is locally right-constant in both its variables.

¤ for every <math>x<y\ </math>, <math>\ell_{(M,\varphi)}(x,y)</math> is finite.

¤ for every <math>x<\min \varphi</math> and every <math>y>x\ </math>, <math>\ell_{(M,\varphi)}(x,y)=0</math>.

¤ for every <math>y\ge\max \varphi</math> and every <math>x<y\ </math>, <math>\ell_{(M,\varphi)}(x,y)</math> equals the number of connected components of <math>M\ </math> on which the minimum value of <math>\varphi</math> is smaller than or equal to <math>x\ </math>.


If we also assume that <math>M\ </math> is a smooth [[closed manifold]] and <math>\varphi</math> is a <math>C^1\ </math>-function, the following useful property holds: 

¤ in order that <math>(x,y)\ </math> is a discontinuity point for <math>\ell_{(M,\varphi)}</math> it is necessary that either <math>x\ </math> or <math>y\ </math> or both are critical values for <math>\varphi</math>. 
<ref name="Fro96">Patrizio Frosini, ''Connections between size functions and critical points'', Mathematical Methods In The Applied Sciences, 19:555-569, 1996.</ref>


A strong link between the concept of size function and the concept of [[natural pseudodistance]] 
<math>d((M,\varphi),(N,\psi))</math> between the size pairs <math>(M,\varphi),\  (N,\psi)</math> exists
<ref name="FroLa99">Patrizio Frosini and Claudia Landi, ''Size Theory as a Topological Tool for Computer Vision'', Pattern Recognition And Image Analysis, 9(4):596-603, 1999.</ref>,
<ref name="DoFro04">Pietro Donatini and Patrizio Frosini, ''Lower bounds for natural pseudodistances via size functions'', Archives of Inequalities and Applications, 2(1):1-12, 2004.</ref>:

¤ if <math>\ell_{(N,\psi)}(\bar x,\bar y)>\ell_{(M,\varphi)}(\tilde x,\tilde y)</math> then <math>d((M,\varphi),(N,\psi))\ge \min\{\tilde x-\bar x,\bar y-\tilde y\}</math>.

The previous result gives an easy way to get lower bounds for the [[natural pseudodistance]] and is one of the main motivation to introduce the concept of size function.

==Representation by formal series==

An algebraic representation of size 
functions in terms of collections  of points and lines in the real plane with 
multiplicities, i.e. as particular formal series, was furnished in 
<ref name="LaFro97">Claudia Landi and Patrizio Frosini, ''New pseudodistances for the size function space'', Proc. SPIE Vol. 3168, p. 52-60, Vision Geometry VI, Robert A. Melter, Angela Y. Wu, Longin J. Latecki (eds.), 1997.</ref>,
<ref name="FroLa99">Patrizio Frosini and Claudia Landi, ''Size Theory as a Topological Tool for Computer Vision'', Pattern Recognition And Image Analysis, 9(4):596-603, 1999.</ref>,
<ref name="FroLa01">Patrizio Frosini and Claudia Landi, ''Size functions and formal series'', Appl. Algebra Engrg. Comm. Comput., 12:327-349, 2001.</ref>. 
The points (called ''cornerpoints'') and lines (called ''cornerlines'') of such formal series encode the information about 
discontinuities of the corresponding size functions, while 
their multiplicities contain the information about the values taken by  the 
size function.

Formally:

* ''cornerpoints'' are defined as those points <math>p=(x,y)\ </math>, with  <math>x<y\ </math>, such that the number 
<math>\mu (p){\stackrel{{\rm def}}{=}}\min _{\alpha >0 ,\beta>0} \ell _{({M},\varphi  )}(x+\alpha ,y-
\beta)-\ell _{({ M},\varphi )} (x+\alpha ,y+\beta )-
\ell_{({ M},\varphi )} (x-\alpha ,y-\beta )+\ell _{({ M} 
,\varphi   )} (x-\alpha ,y+\beta )</math> 
is positive.
The number  <math>\mu (p)\ </math> is said to be the ''multiplicity'' of <math>p\ </math>.

* ''cornerlines'' and are defined as those lines <math>r:x=k\ </math> such that
<math>\mu (r){\stackrel{\rm def}{=}}\min  _{\alpha >0 ,k+\alpha <y}\ell _{({ M},\varphi 
)}(k+\alpha ,y)-
\ell _{({ M},\varphi )}(k-\alpha ,y)>0.</math>
The number  <math>\mu (r)\ </math>  is sad to be  the '' multiplicity'' of  <math>r\ </math>.

* ''Representation Theorem'': For every  <math>{\bar x}<{\bar y}</math>, it holds <math>\ell _{({M},\varphi )}({\bar x},{\bar y})=\sum _{p=(x,y)\atop x\le {\bar x}, y>\bar y }\mu\big(p\big)+\sum _{r:x=k\atop k\le {\bar x} }\mu\big(r\big)</math>

This representation contains   the 
same amount of information about the shape under study as the original 
size function does, but is much more concise. 

This algebraic approach to size functions  leads to the definition of new similarity measures 
between shapes, by translating the problem of comparing size functions into 
the problem of comparing formal series. The most studied among these metrics between size function is the [[matching distance]]<ref name="dAFrLa06">Michele d'Amico, Patrizio Frosini and Claudia Landi, ''Using matching distance in Size Theory: a survey'', International Journal of Imaging Systems and Technology, 16(5):154–161, 2006.</ref>.
