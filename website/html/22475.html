<html> <head> <title>Locality preserving hashing</title></head><body>In [[computer science]], a '''locality preserving hashing''' is a [[hash function]] ''f'' that maps a point or points in a multidimensional [[coordinate space]] to a scalar value, such that if we have three points ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' such that 
:<math>|A-B| < |B-C| \Rightarrow |f(A) - f(B)| < |f(B) - f(C)|. \,</math>

In other words, these are hash functions where the relative distance between the input values is preserved in the relative distance between of the output hash values; input values that are closer to each other will produce output hash values that are closer to each other.

This is in contrast to [[cryptography|cryptographic]] hash functions and [[checksum]]s, which are designed to have maximum output difference between adjacent inputs.

Locality preserving hashes are related to [[space-filling curve]]s and [[locality sensitive hashing]].
