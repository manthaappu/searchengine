'''HUBO''' (휴보 KHR-3) is a walking [[humanoid robot]], head mounted on a life-size walking [[bipedal]] frame, developed by the [[KAIST|Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology]] (KAIST) and released on January 6, 2005. Hubo is short form for "'''''hu'''''manoid ro'''''bo'''''t."

Hubo has voice recognition and synthesis faculties, as well as sophisticated vision in which its two eyes move independently of one another.

==Development history==
Korea's history in robotics engineering is relatively short. KAIST only began research in [[2000]], led by professor [[Oh Jun-ho]]. The first prototype [[KHR-1]] was developed without a head or arms released in 2003, followed by KHR-2 in 2004.

==Latest breakthroughs==
In November 5',  KAIST, Korea and Dallas, Texas based Hanson Robotics, Inc (HRI) released the world's first android head mounted on a life-size walking bi-pedal frame at the APEC Summit in Seoul, Korea. The walking frame was the latest in Hubo technology, while the head was an exact recreation of the late physicist, Albert Einstein. The android was able to speak and cover a wide range of natural facial expressions, built upon prior HRI development on the Philip K. Dick android, which made its official debut at the [[Wired Magazine]] [[NextFest]] 05' in Chicago, Illinois. 

The humanoid prototype was officially dubbed "[[Albert Einstein Hubo]]".
