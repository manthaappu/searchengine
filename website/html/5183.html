'''CPU Speed Pro''' is a [[freeware]] [[system profiler]] [[application software|application]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] that detects the type of [[central processing unit]] (CPU) located on a [[motherboard]] and tests the speed of a motherboard's processor in four automated steps. The ability to accurately check a computer system's CPU speed is an important feature for [[overclockers]] who wish to overclock their motherboard and CPU. Processor speed results are displayed in a pop-up window, where users can submit their CPU benchmark results to an online database and compare their processor speed with other users around the world.

CPU speed results are stored in an online database and categorized by CPU manufacturers ([[Intel]], [[AMD]]), CPU types and countries. Users can compare [[Benchmark (computing)]] results for their CPU type and also view the top and bottom 100 processor benchmarks.
