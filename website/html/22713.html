In [[computing]], '''LBX''', or '''Low Bandwidth X''', was a protocol to use the [[X Window System]] over [[computer network|network]] links with low [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] and high [[Lag|latency]]. It was introduced in X11R6.3 ("Broadway") in 1996, but never achieved wide use. It was disabled by default as of [[X.Org Server]] 7.1, and was removed for version 7.2.

X was originally implemented for use with the [[Server (computing)|server]] and [[client (computing)|client]] on the same machine or the same [[local area network]]. By 1996, the [[Internet]] was becoming popular, and X's performance over narrow, slow links was problematic.

LBX ran as a [[proxy server]] ('''<tt>lbxproxy</tt>'''). It cached commonly used information &mdash; connection setup, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps and so on &mdash; and [[data compression|compressed]] data transmission over the network link. 

LBX was never widely deployed as it did not offer significant speed improvements. The slow links it was introduced to help were typically insecure, and [[RFB protocol|RFB]] ([[VNC]]) over a [[secure shell]] connection &mdash; which includes compression &mdash; proved faster than LBX, and also provided session resumption.  

Finally, it was shown that greater speed improvements to X could be obtained for ''all'' networked environments with replacement of X's antiquated font system as part of the new composited graphics system, along with care and attention to application and [[widget toolkit]] design, particularly care to avoid network [[round-trip delay time|round trips]] and hence [[latency (engineering)|latency]].
