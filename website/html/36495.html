<html> <head> <title>System Service Dispatch Table</title></head><body>The '''System Service Dispatch Table''' ('''SSDT''') is an internal [[dispatch table]] within [[Microsoft Windows]].

Hooking SSDT calls is often used as a technique in both Windows [[rootkit]]s and [[antivirus software]].<ref>[http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/windows-rootkits-2005-part-one Windows rootkits of 2005, part one]</ref><ref name="ZDNET2010">[http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/security-threats/2010/05/11/attack-defeats-most-antivirus-software-40088896/ Attack defeats 'most' antivirus software]</ref>

In 2010, many computer security products which relied on hooking SSDT calls were shown to be vulnerable to exploits using [[race condition]]s to attack the products' security checks.<ref name="ZDNET2010"/>
