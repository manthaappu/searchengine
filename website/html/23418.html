'''Mapnik''' is an open source mapping toolkit, written in C++  and useful for both desktop and server based map [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]].  One of its many users is the [[OpenStreetMap]] project (OSM) which uses it in combination with an [[Apache Web Server]] module (mod_tile) to render tiles that make up the OSM 'Slippy Map' Layer<ref name=slippy>[http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapnik OpenStreetMap's main Slippy Map layer]</ref>. An [[XML]] file can also be used to define a collection of mapping objects that determine the appearance of a map, or objects can be constructed programatically in C++ or Python.  Artem Pavlenko, the original developer of Mapnik, set out with the explicit goal of  creating beautiful maps<ref name=beautmaps>[http://www.mapnik.org/faq/ Beautiful Maps as an explicit goal in the Mapnik FAQ]</ref> by employing the subpixel anti-aliasing of the [[Anti-Grain Geometry]] (AGG) library. Mapnik now also has a powerful [[Cairo (graphics)|Cairo]] rendering backend. When it comes to handling common software tasks such as memory management, filesystem access, regular expressions, and XML parsing, Mapnik utilizes the [[Boost C++ Libraries]].

==Data Format==
A number of data formats are supported in Mapnik using a plugin framework. Current plugins exist that utilize [[GDAL|OGR]] and [[GDAL]] to read a range of vector and raster datasets. Mapnik also has custom [[Shapefile]], [[PostGIS]] and [[GeoTIFF]] readers. More data access plug-ins will be available in the future.  There is also an osm2pgsql utility<ref name=osm2pgsql>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osm2pgsql|title=Osm2pgsql}}</ref>, that converts [[OpenStreetMap]] data into a format that can be loaded into [[PostgreSQL]]. Mapnik can then be used to render the OSM data into maps with the appearance you want.

==Platforms==

Mapnik is a cross platform toolkit that runs on Windows, Mac, [[Unix-like]] systems like Linux and Solaris (since release 0.4).

==Usage==
Mapnik is used as the rendering backend of [[OpenStreetMap]]'s default layer<ref>{{cite web|title=Mapnik|url=http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapnik|publisher=OpenStreetMap Wiki}}</ref>, but is also used by [[CloudMade]]<ref>{{cite web|title=CloudMade|url=http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/CloudMade#Technical|publisher=OpenStreetMap Wiki}}</ref>, and [[MapQuest]]<ref>{{cite web|title=MapQuest Mapnik Style|url=https://github.com/MapQuest/MapQuest-Mapnik-Style|publisher=GitHub}}</ref>.

==License==
Mapnik is free software and is released under [[LGPL]] (Lesser General Public Licence).
