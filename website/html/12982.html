'''Extreme Transaction Processing''' ('''XTP''') is an exceptionally demanding form of [[transaction processing]]. Transactions of 10,000 concurrent accesses (500 transaction per second) or more would require this form of processing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

== Description ==

XTP applications are designed, developed, deployed, managed, and maintained on [[computer clusters]] and/or distributed [[grid computing]] networks.  
As a result, XTP applications feature vast improvements in:

* performance
* scalability
* availability
* security
* manageability
* dependability

These applications generate orders of magnitude more transactions than those created by traditional [[transaction processing system]]s because of their wider (often multi-enterprise, national and global) reach.
