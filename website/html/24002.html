'''MemcacheDB''' (pronunciation: mem-cash-dee-bee.) is a persistence enabled variant of [[memcached]], a general-purpose distributed memory caching system often used to speed up dynamic [[database]]-driven websites by caching data and [[Object (computer science)|objects]] in [[Computer storage|memory]]. The main difference between MemcacheDB and memcached is that MemcacheDB has its own key-value database system based on [[Berkeley DB]], so it is meant for persistent storage rather than as a cache solution. MemcacheDB is accessed through the same protocol as memcached, so applications may use any memcached API as a means of accessing a MemcacheDB database <ref>{{cite web|url=http://memcachedb.org/ |title=MemcacheDB official home page }}</ref>.

MemcacheQ is a MemcacheDB variant that provides a simple [[message queue]] service.
