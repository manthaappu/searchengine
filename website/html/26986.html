In computing, the term '''object-based file system''' refers to an architectural blueprint for [[List_of_file_systems#Distributed_file_systems|distributed file systems]]. An object-based [[file system]] splits file [[metadata]] (such as the filename, its size and access times) from file data and stores them on different [[File_server|servers]]. File metadata is stored on metadata servers, the file data is split into so-called ''objects'' and stored on object storage servers. The file system client employs metadata and object storage servers to present a full file system [[Abstraction_(computer_science)|abstraction]] to the [[User_(computing)|users]].

The object-based file system architecture has several advantages:
* The file system [[Client_(computing)|client]] accesses file content directly via object storage servers. Metadata servers are only contacted once when the file is opened, thereby eliminating the metadata bottleneck of block-based distributed file systems.
* The size of these objects can usually be configured on per-file basis. This allows the stripe width to be adapted to the access properties of an individual file when the objects of a file are [[Data_striping|striped]] across multiple object storage servers.

File systems that follow an object-based architecture include [[Lustre (file system)|Lustre]] and [[EXOFS|exofs]].
