Strong Key is a naming convention used in [[computer programming]]. There can be more than one component (eg: DLL) with the same naming, but with different versions. This can lead to many conflicts.

A '''Strong Key''' (also called '''SN Key''' or '''Strong Name''') is used in the [[Microsoft]] [[.NET framework]] to uniquely identify a component. This is done partly with [[Public-key cryptography]].

Strong keys or names provide security of reference from one component to another or from a root key to a component. This is not the same as tamper-resistance of the file containing any given component.<ref>[http://www.codeproject.com/KB/security/NeCoder03.aspx CodeProject: Building Security Awareness in .NET Assemblies : Part 3 - Learn to break Strong Name .NET Assemblies.]</ref>  Strong names also are a counter measure against [[dll hell]].

This key is produced by another computer program as a pair.
