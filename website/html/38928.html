Feynman showed that a classical [[Turing machine]] would presumably experience an exponential slowdown when simulating quantum phenomena, while his hypothetical universal quantum simulator would not. [[David Deutsch]] in 1985, took the ideas further and described a [[universal quantum computer]]. In 1996, [[Seth Lloyd]] showed that a standard [[quantum computer]] can be programmed to simulate any local quantum system efficiently.<ref name=Lloyd1996>{{Cite journal

A [[quantum system]] of many particles is described by a [[Hilbert space]] whose dimension is exponentially large in the number of particles. Therefore, the obvious approach to simulate such a system requires exponential time on a [[computer|classical computer]]. However, it is conceivable that a quantum system of many particles could be simulated by a quantum computer using a number of [[qubit|quantum bits]] similar to the number of particles in the original system. As shown by Lloyd, this is true for a class of quantum systems known as ''local'' quantum systems. This has been extended to much larger classes of quantum systems.<ref>{{cite arxiv|eprint=quant-ph/0301023v2|author1=Dorit Aharonov|author2=Amnon Ta-Shma|title=Adiabatic Quantum State Generation and Statistical Zero Knowledge|class=quant-ph|year=2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite arxiv|eprint=quant-ph/0508139|last1=Berry | first1=Dominic W.|author2=Graeme Ahokas|author3=Richard Cleve|last4=Sanders | first4=Barry C.|title=Efficient quantum algorithms for simulating sparse Hamiltonians|class=quant-ph|year=2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite arxiv|	eprint=0810.0312v2|	last1=Childs | first1=Andrew M.|	title=On the relationship between continuous- and discrete-time quantum walk|	class=quant-ph|	year=2008}}</ref>
