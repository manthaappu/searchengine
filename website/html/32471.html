<html> <head> <title>Rotating calipers</title></head><body>In [[computational geometry]], '''rotating calipers''' is a method used to construct efficient algorithms for a number of problems.

The method was first used by [[Michael Shamos]] in 1978 for determining all [[antipodal point|antipodal]] pairs of points and vertices on a [[convex polygon]]. 
The term "rotating calipers" was later coined in 1983 by the computer scientist [[Godfried Toussaint]],<ref>[http://www-cgrl.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/research/calipers.html "Rotating Calipers"] at Toussaint's home page</ref> who applied this approach to a number of other geometric problems. <ref name=tous83>{{cite_paper

}} </ref> The name comes from the analogy of rotating a spring-loaded [[vernier caliper]] around the outside of a convex polygon.  Every time one blade of the caliper lies flat against an edge of the polygon, it forms an [[antipodal point|antipodal pair]] with the point or edge touching the opposite blade. It turns out that the complete "rotation" of the caliper around the polygon detects all antipodal pairs and may be carried out in [[Linear_time|O(n)]] time. <ref>M.I. Shamos. Computational geometry.
