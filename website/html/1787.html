== Explanation ==

[[Analogy|Analogizing]] is the process of representing information about a particular subject (the analogue or source system) by another particular subject (the target system).  A simple type of analogy is one that is based on shared properties (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy). Analogical models, also called "analog" or "analogue" models, therefore seek the analog systems that share properties with the target system as a means of representing the world. It is often practicable to construct source systems that are smaller and/or faster than the target system so that one can deduce ''[[a priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' [[knowledge]] of target system behaviour. Analog devices are therefore those in which may differ in substance or structure but share properties of dynamic behaviour (Truit and Rogers, p. 1-3).

{{cquote|dynamical analogies establish the analogies between electrical, mechanical, acoustical, magnetic and electronic systems}} (Olson 1958, p. 2). 

For example, in analog electronic circuits, one can use [[voltage]] to represent an arithmetic quantity; [[operational amplifier]]s might then represent the arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).Through the process of [[calibration]] these smaller/bigger, slower/faster systems are scaled up or down so that they match the functioning of the target system, and are therefore called analogs of the target system. Once the calibration has taken place, modellers speak of a ''one-to-one correspondence in behaviour'' between the primary system and its analog. Thus the behaviour of two systems can be determined by experimenting with one. 
<!--This doesn't seem right. Is the "model" the "target system" or the "analogue/source system"? It seems that Stanford encyclopedia and Wikipedia do not mesh!-->

== Creating an analogical model ==

Many different instruments and systems can be used to create an analogical model. A mechanical device can be used to represent mathematical calculations. For instance, the [[Phillips Hydraulic Computer]] used the flow of water to model economic systems (the target system); electronic circuits can be used to represent both physiological and ecological systems. When a model is run on either an analog or digital computer this is known as the process of [[simulation]].

*"The same [[equation]]s have the same [[solution]]s." -- [[Richard Feynman]]
**For example, the inverse-square laws of [[gravitation]] and [[electromagnetism]] can be described by analogous equations on a geometrical basis, almost without regard to the physical details about [[mass]]es and [[charge (physics)|charges]].

*[[Recursion]] requires  a similarity within a situation; for example, [[Archimedes]] used the [[myriad]] to count the [[The Sand Reckoner|number of grains of sand on a beach]] by using the concept of myriad myriads.

== Dynamical analogies ==
Arising from his pioneering work in the field of acoustical engineering research, in 1958 (pp. 27–29) Dr. [[Harry F. Olson]] published a book of [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamical]] analogies that includes a table of equivalent elements in different systems such as electrical, acoustical, and mechanical systems. He claimed that the analogies presented would aid in solving various problems of dynamical systems and would help the analysis describing the performance of such systems.

==Electronic circuit analogies==
=== Hydraulic Analog ===

A fluid or [[Hydraulic analogy]] of an electric circuit attempts to explain circuitry in terms of plumbing, where water represents the mobile sea of charge within metals, where pressure difference is analogy for [[Voltage]], and where water's flow rate is an analogy for [[Electric current]].

=== Analogue computers ===

Electronic circuits were used to model and simulate engineering systems such as aeroplanes and nuclear power plants before digital computers became widely available with fast enough turn over times to be practically useful. Electronic circuit instruments called [[analog computers]] were used to speed up circuit construction time. However analog computers like the [[norden bombsight]] could also consist of  gears and pulleys in calculation.

Examples are Vogel and Ewel who published 'An Electrical Analog of a Trophic Pyramid' (1972, Chpt 11, pp. 105–121), Elmore and Sands (1949) who published circuits devised for research in nuclear physics and the study of fast electrical transients done under the Manhattan Project (however no circuits having application to weapon technology were included for security reasons), and [[Howard T. Odum]] (1994) who published circuits devised to analogically model ecological-economic systems at many scales of the geobiosphere.

==Philosophical conundrum==
The process of analogical modelling has philosophical difficulties. As noted in the [http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/stanford/entries/models-science/#ModLawNat Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy], there is the question of how the physical/biological laws of the target system relate to the analogical models created by humans to represent the target system. We seem to assume that the process of constructing analogical models gives us access to the fundamental laws governing the target system. However strictly speaking we only have empirical knowledge of the laws that hold true for the analogical system, and if the time constant for the target system is larger than the life cycle of human being (as in the case of the geobiosphere) it is therefore very difficult for any single human to empirically verify the validity of the extension of the laws of their model to the target system in their life time.
