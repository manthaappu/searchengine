<html> <head> <title>Kyma (sound design language)</title></head><body>'''Kyma''' is a visual programming language for sound design used by musicians, researchers, and sound designers. In Kyma, a user programs a multiprocessor DSP by graphically connecting modules on the screen of a [[Macintosh]] or [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] computer.

==Background==
Kyma has characteristics of both object-oriented and functional programming languages.  The basic unit in Kyma is the "Sound" object, not the "note" of traditional music notation.  A Sound is defined as: 

i) a Sound atom <br/>
ii) a unary transform T(s) where s is a Sound<br/>
iii) an n-ary transform T(s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>,.., s<sub>n</sub>), where s<sub>1</sub>,s<sub>2</sub>,..s<sub>n</sub> are Sounds<ref>{{cite conference

A Sound atom is a source of audio (like a microphone input or a noise generator), a unary transform modifies its argument (for example, a LowpassFilter might take a running average of its input), and an n-ary transform combines two or more Sounds (a Mixer, for example, is defined as the sum of its inputs).

==History==
The first version of Kyma, which computed digital audio samples on a [[Macintosh 512K]] was written in the [[Smalltalk]] programming language in 1986 by [[Carla Scaletti]] in [[Champaign, Illinois]]. In May 1987, Scaletti had partitioned Kyma into graphics and sound generation engines and ported the sound generation code to a digital signal processor called the Platypus designed by [[Lippold Haken]] and [[Kurt J. Hebel]] of the [[PLATO (computer system)|CERL Sound Group]].  <ref>{{cite book | last = Chadabe | first = Joel | title = Electric Sound: The Past and Promise of Electronic Music | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | date = 1997 | pages = 265–267 | isbn = 0-13-303231-0 }}</ref>

In 1987, Scaletti presented a paper on Kyma and demonstrated live digital sound generation on the Platypus at the [[ICMC|International Computer Music Conference]] where it was identified by electronic synthesis pioneer [[Robert Moog|Bob Moog]] as a technology to watch in his conference report for [[Keyboard Magazine]]:

<blockquote>''One new language that acknowledges no distinction between sound synthesis and composition is Kyma, a music composition language for the Macintosh that views all elements in a piece of music, from the structure of a single sound to the structure of the entire composition, as objects to be composed.''<ref>{{cite news | last = Moog | first = Robert | title = International Computer Music Conference: Platypus, Granules, Kyma, Daton, & the DSP56001 in Your Future | publisher = [[Keyboard Magazine]] | date = 1987 | }}</ref></blockquote>

When the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] eliminated the funding for the [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]] laboratory in 1989, Scaletti and Hebel formed [[Symbolic Sound Corporation]] in order to continue developing Kyma and digital audio signal processing hardware.
