<html> <head> <title>Card image</title></head><body>A '''card image''' is an archaic term for an [[ASCII]] [[string (computer science)|string]], usually 80 [[byte]]s in length.  "Card image" refers to a [[punched card]].  IBM cards were 80 characters in length, UNIVAC cards were 90 characters.  A single card typically held a single line of text, for example a line of [[FORTRAN]] code.  Many data formats, such as the [[FITS]] [[image file]] format, still use card images as basic building blocks -- even though punched cards are now mostly obsolete.
