In [[ADO.NET]], a '''DataAdapter''' functions as a bridge between a data source, and a disconnected data class, such as a DataSet. At the simplest level it will specify [[SQL]] commands that provide elementary [[Create, read, update and delete|CRUD]] functionality. At a more advanced level it offers all the functions required in order to create Strongly Typed DataSets, including DataRelations.
