<html> <head> <title>Time triple modular redundancy</title></head><body>'''Time triple modular redundancy''', also known as TTMR, is a [[patented]] [[single event upset]] mitigation technique that detects and corrects errors in a computer or microprocessor. TTMR allows the use of [[very long instruction word]] ([[VLIW]]) style microprocessors in space or other applications where external sources, such as radiation, would cause an elevated rate of errors. TTMR permits [[triple modular redundancy]] ([[triple modular redundancy|TMR]]) protection in a single processor.

[[Space Micro Inc]] developed and [[patented]] TTMR. It has been implemented in Space Micro's space qualified [[single board computer]]s, such as the [[Proton200k]].
