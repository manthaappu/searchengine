<!-- Please do not change "iPod Touch" to "iPod touch" everywhere. We use the standard rules of English to name products.-->

The '''iPod Touch''' (stylized, [[trademark]]ed, and marketed as '''iPod touch''') is a [[portable media player]], [[personal digital assistant]], and [[Wi-Fi]] mobile platform designed and marketed by [[Apple Inc.]] The product was launched on September 5, 2007, at an event called ''The Beat Goes On''.<ref name="beatgoes">[http://www.engadget.com/2007/09/05/steve-jobs-live-apples-the-heat-is-on-special-event/ Steve Jobs live — Apple's "The heat is on" special event]{{accessdate|2007-09-05}}</ref> The iPod Touch adds the [[multi-touch]] [[graphical user interface]] to the [[iPod]] line. It is the first iPod with wireless access to the [[iTunes Store]], and also has access to Apple's [[App Store]], enabling content to be purchased and downloaded directly on the device. [[Apple Inc.]] has sold over 45 million [[iPod]] Touch units as of September 2009.<ref name="Mac-Life">[http://www.maclife.com/article/news/over_45_million_ipod_touch_units_sold_date_new_model_now_shipping], maclife.com, retrieved on 3 December 2010</ref>

The second generation iPod Touch features external volume controls, a built-in speaker, a contoured back, built-in [[Nike+iPod|Nike+]], [[Bluetooth]] support, and the ability to connect a microphone. It was unveiled on September 9, 2008, at the "Let's Rock" keynote presentation.

The 3rd generation iPod Touch with [[iOS (Apple)|iPhone OS 3.1]] was announced and subsequently released on September 9, 2009.<ref name="late2009pr">{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/09/09touch.html|title=Apple Introduces New iPod touch Lineup|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=March 2, 2010|date=September 9, 2009}}</ref> It is available with 32 GB or 64 GB of [[flash memory]]. Apple also continued offering the 2nd generation 8 GB version.<ref name="ipod8glate2009">{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/SP571|title=iPod touch 8 GB (Late 2009) - Technical Specifications|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=February 22, 2010|date=September 14, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}</ref> The new 3rd generation iPod Touch<ref name="3Gname">{{cite web|url=http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/reviews/entry/apple-inc.-ipod-touch-third-generation|title=Apple Inc. iPod touch (Third-Generation)|date=September 13, 2009|accessdate=February 22, 2010|publisher=iLounge}}</ref> includes faster hardware (the same microprocessors, graphics engine, and RAM as the [[iPhone|iPhone 3GS]]), a slightly lower battery life, [[voice control]], light sensor, and bundled earphones with a remote and microphone. The 2nd and 3rd generation iPod Touch can now be updated to iOS 4.x for free, but cannot take advantage of features using the iPhone's camera or GPS receiver.

Apple unveiled the 4th generation iPod Touch on September 1, 2010. It features Apple's [[IPhone 4#Display|Retina display]] and two cameras; one front-facing camera for [[FaceTime]], [[Skype]], and other video chat applications, photos and high-definition video recording and one rear-facing camera for photos and HD video recording. It also contains Apple's [[Apple A4|A4]] for faster processing, a microphone for communication, voice recognition, and voice memos, which can be useful for recording things, such as an academic tutorial, a voice lesson, or a college lecture, and a three-axis gyroscopic sensor which enables the device to recognize approximately how far, fast, and in which direction it has moved in space. The device originally shipped with [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] [[iOS (Apple) version history|4.1]], which added Game Center to iOS along with the ability to use FaceTime through Wi-Fi.

==Hardware==
The iPod Touch has a slim rectangular shape with rounded edges, with a glass [[multi-touch]] display covering most of the top surface and a physical home button off the touchscreen. The display functions similarly to the [[Multi-touch|multi-touch trackpad]] as implemented in Apple's [[Mac family|current line]] of laptop computers. It is also very similar to the iPad interface and the Apple Magic Trackpad. The touch and gesture features of the iPod Touch are based on technology originally developed by [[FingerWorks]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=iGesture Game Mode Guide|last=Fingerworks, Inc.|year=2003|publisher=www.fingerworks.com|url=http://rwservices.no-ip.info:81/pens/biblio05.html#Fingerworks03|accessdate=2009-04-30}}</ref>

==Software==
{{Prose|section|date=December 2010}}
The home screen, called [[SpringBoard]], has a grid of icons for the available applications. All iPod Touch models include applications such as Music, Videos, and Photos (collectively duplicating the standard functions of the [[iPod Classic]]), [[iTunes]] (providing access to the [[iTunes Store#iTunes Store for iOS|iTunes Music Store]]), [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], [[YouTube]], Calendar, Contacts, Clock, Calculator, and Settings. Later models added [[Mail (application)|Mail]] (accessing [[Post Office Protocol|POP]]/[[Internet Message Access Protocol|IMAP]]/[[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]] e-mail), [[Google Maps#Google Maps for Mobile|Maps]], Stocks, Notes, and Weather, which could also be added to the earlier models with the purchase of a software upgrade. The user can add direct links to Web sites, called "Web Clips", to the home screen. All iPod Touch models are equipped with [[Wi-Fi]] [[IEEE 802.11|802.11b/g]]. The 4th Generation Model is equipped with [[Wi-Fi]] 802.11b/g/n (2.4 GHz only).

On July 11, 2008, the [[iOS (Apple)|iPhone OS 2.0 Software Update]] was released for purchase for the iPod Touch. The update allowed 1st generation iPod Touch devices access to the [[App Store]] to download third-party applications, in addition to a host of minor bug fixes.

On June 17, 2009, the [[iOS (Apple)|iPhone OS 3.0 Software Update]] was released for purchase for the iPod Touch. The update allowed the devices to use new apps, and unlocked the [[Bluetooth]] functionality of the 2nd generation iPod Touch, enabling [[A2DP]] and [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] apps, as well as file transfer to other (non Apple) devices such as Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones or [[Jailbreaking for iOS|jailbroken]] iPods using software such as iBlueNova.

On June 21, 2010, the new [http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/ios4-software-update.html iOS 4.0] software update was released to second and third generation iPod Touch users for free. It includes multitasking, app folders, backgrounds, iAd, and much more. However, second generation iPod Touch devices did not receive multitasking, backgrounds, and Bluetooth keyboard support. iOS 4 is not supported on the first-generation iPod Touch, and further software update support has been discontinued.

On November 25, 2010, the new [http://www.apple.com/ios] iOS 4.2 software was released to second, third, and fourth generations iPod Touch users for free. It includes multitasking, more room for apps, AirPrint, AirPlay, access to Find my iPhone (or iPod, iPad), and much more. However, Find my iPhone is not available for the second and third generation iPod Touch. iOS 4.2 is not supported on the first generation iPod Touch. Software update is still available.

==Comparisons to the iPhone and model comparisons==
{{further|[[iOS (Apple)]]|[[iOS version history]]}}
The iPod Touch and the [[iPhone]], a [[smartphone]] by [[Apple Inc.]], share the same hardware platform and run the same [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] operating system. The iPod Touch lacks some of the iPhone's features and associated apps, such as access to cellular networks (and speaker on older models). As a result, the iPod Touch is slimmer and lighter than the iPhone. [[Steve Jobs]] once referred to the iPod Touch as "training wheels for the iPhone".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/iphone-finally-arrives-but-its-neither-cheap-nor-g3-402835.html |title=iPhone finally arrives but it's neither cheap nor G3. |first=Nic |last=Fildes |work=[[The Independent]] |date=September 19, 2007 |accessdate=2008-10-24}}</ref>

The 2nd generation iPod Touch has an external volume switch and a built-in speaker like the [[iPhone]]. The 2nd generation also comes with the chrome frame seen on the iPhone 3G, making the two almost identical when viewed from the front. However, there are some notable differences, as there is no speaker above the screen, no silent/ringer switch, the back is metal, and the sleep/wake button is on the other side. The 2nd generation also supports audio input when a headphone or earphone with microphone capabilities is plugged into the audio output (headphone) jack. The iPod Touch 2.0 Software Update supports [[WPA2|WPA2 Enterprise]] with 802.1X authentication.<ref name=wifiwpa2>[http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/03/06iphone.html Apple Announces iPhone 2.0 Software Beta]{{accessdate|2008-05-15}}</ref> The iPhone OS 3.0 update unlocked [[Bluetooth]] capability on the 2nd generation iPod Touch, as the included Wi-Fi chip ([[Broadcom]] BCM4325) has Bluetooth support.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcom.com/products/Bluetooth/Bluetooth-RF-Silicon-and-Software-Solutions/BCM4325|title=Broadcom page on wireless chip included in the 2nd generation iPod Touch|publisher=[[Broadcom]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-10198524-1.html?tag=TOCmoreStories.0|title=iPod Touch gets Bluetooth after OS upgrade|publisher=[[CNET Networks#CNET.com|CNET.com]]}}</ref>

The 2nd generation iPod Touch is said to have a yellower cast/tint to the display, as compared to the iPhone or the original iPod Touch.<ref>{{cite web|last=Breen |first=Christopher |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/135484/2008/09/ipodtouchfirstlook.html?lsrc=rss_main |title=First Look: iPod touch &#124; iPod |publisher=Macworld |date= |accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref> The applications processor inside the 2nd generation iPod Touch runs slightly faster than the processor inside the iPhone 3G, but slower than the iPhone 3GS.<ref>[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-10106891-37.html New iPod Touch faster than iPhone 3G] - [[CNET Networks#CNET.com|CNET News]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://toucharcade.com/2008/11/23/2nd-generation-ipod-touch-faster-than-iphone/ |title=2nd Generation iPod Touch Faster than iPhone |publisher=Touch Arcade |date= |accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref> The first generation iPod Touch works with all "Made for iPod" peripherals, but certain changes that Apple made to the 2nd generation iPod Touch prevent some existing peripherals from recharging the updated player.<ref>[http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/8002/ipod-touch-peripheral.htm iPod touch 2G Won't Support Some iPod Peripherals] - [[MP3 Newswire]]</ref> The Google Street View feature added on iPhone firmware version 2.2 is absent from the same version of firmware released on the iPod Touch,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gizmodo.com/5095448/ipod-touch-denied-street-view-other-google-maps-upgrades-in-firmware-22 |title=iPod Touch Denied Street View, Other Google Maps Upgrades in Firmware 2.2 - iPhone |publisher=Gizmodo |date=2008-11-21 |accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref> but is found in the 3.0 update.

Apple has received criticism for charging iPod Touch owners for major updates of iOS that iPhone owners can obtain at no charge, as well as excluding certain features from the iPod Touch software that are included in the iPhone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2008/01/17/ipod-touch-users-if-you-bought-after-jan-1-the-new-apps-are-fre/ |title=iPod touch users: if you bought after Jan 1 the new apps are free - maybe |publisher=Engadget.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Arya |first=Aayush |url=http://www.applematters.com/article/early-adopter-tax-resurfaces-with-the-ipod-touch-january-software-upgrade/ |title=Early Adopter Tax Resurfaces with the iPod Touch January Software Upgrade |publisher=AppleMatters |date=2008-01-24 |accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref> Apple has said that they can add features for free to the iPhone because the revenue from it is accounted for on a subscription basis under accounting rules, rather than as a one time payment.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dalrymple |first=Jim |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/131991/2008/02/ipodtouch.html |title=Accounting rules behind iPod touch update charge &#124; iPod |publisher=Macworld |date= |accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref> At WWDC in June 2010, Jobs announced that Apple had "found a way" to make subsequent OS upgrades available free to iPod Touch owners. However, iOS 4.0 and onwards isn't available for the first generation iPod touch and some features are only available for the 32 and 64 GB third generation iPod touches released in September 2009 and the fourth generation iPod touches in 2010.

==Requirements==
<!-- Do not discuss hacks in this section, such as jailbreaking or other work-arounds to use and program the iPod Touch on a non-Mac OS X/Windows platform. Only Apple official information. Also, do not develop this requirements section into an operations manual. -->
As supplied new, the iPod Touch must be connected to a Macintosh or Windows computer. There is no official Linux support. On either operating system, the iPod Touch must be connected through a [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] port. This will charge the iPod Touch and Sync any songs that you may want on your iPod Touch. Special cables that plug in to a wall can also be bought separately but can only be used to charge the iPod Touch. <ref name=techspecs1>[http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/specs.html Apple - iPod Touch - Technical Specifications], ''[[Apple Inc.]]''{{accessdate|2007-09-05}}</ref>

Starting with the second generation, iPod Touch can only be charged from the 5V pin of the dock connector while most previous iPod models (including the original iPod Touch) could also be charged from the 12V pin for FireWire power.<ref name="applepower"/> This change dropped support for charging in vehicles equipped with a FireWire-based iPod connection. Most aftermarket manufacturers of such equipment offer cables and/or adapters which convert the vehicle's 12 V to 5 V.<!--when citing this might be nice to have something about why FireWire based adapter where used as they charged some traditional iPods faster.-->

The first time the iPod Touch is turned on, a graphic of the iTunes logo and USB cable is displayed continuously until the iPod Touch is connected to a computer running iTunes.<ref name=photos1>[http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/09/13/ipod_touch_unpacking_tour_and_first_look_photos.html iPod touch unpacking tour and first look (photos)], ''[[AppleInsider]]''{{accessdate|2007-12-09}}</ref>

To use the iPod Touch for purchasing content on the [[iTunes Store]] via Wi-Fi, a new or existing iTunes Store account must be associated with the iPod.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Apple states that the following are required for the iPod Touch:<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/specs.html Apple - iPod touch - Technical Specifications], ''[[Apple Inc.]]''{{accessdate|2007-09-05}}</ref>
* iTunes 10 for iOS 4.0 or later, iTunes 9.2.0.61 for iOS 4.0.x or later, iTunes 8.2 for iPhone OS 3.0.x or later, iTunes 8.0 for iPhone OS 2.1.x, iTunes 7.6 for iPhone OS 2.0.x or earlier
* An available USB 2.0 port

==Third-party applications==
[[Image:IPod Touch 2G Remote Mic.jpg|thumb|right|Earphones with an external microphone and controller are compatible with the 2nd generation iPod Touch, and are shipped with the 3rd generation iPod Touch devices.]]
The only official way to obtain third-party applications for the iPod Touch is Apple's [[App Store]], which is a branch of [[iTunes Store]]. The [[App Store]] application, available in all versions of iOS from 2.0 onwards, allows users to browse and download applications from a single online repository (hosted by Apple) with the iTunes Store. To develop such software, a [[software development kit]] (SDK) was officially announced on March 6, 2008, at an Apple Town Hall meeting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2008/03/06/live-from-apples-iphone-press-conference/ |title=Live from Apple's iPhone SDK press conference |publisher=Engadget |date= |accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref> The [[iPhone SDK]] allows developers to make applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch after paying a fee to join the development team. The developer can then set the price for the applications they develop and will receive 70% of money earned. The developer can also opt to release the application for free and will not pay any additional costs.

Shortly after the iPhone (then also the iPod touch) was released, [[hacker (computer security)|hackers]] were able to "[[Jailbreaking for iOS|jailbreak]]" the device through a [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]] exploit. The application installed by this exploit enabled the user to download a selection of unofficial third-party programs. Jailbreaking the iPod Touch was the only way to get third-party programs when running 1.1.x OSes. These third-party programs could use additional functionality not supported by Apple (such as enabling multitasking, applying themes to the home screen or enable battery percentage indicator. All officially released versions of iOS through 3.1.2, and 4.0, as well as 4.2.1 with some bugs, can be jailbroken,<ref name=jailbreak1>{{cite web |url=http://winpwn.com/index.php/Main_Page |title=WinPwn official site |accessdate=2008-07-26 |date=2008-07-25}}</ref><ref name=jailbreak2>{{cite web |url=http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/126908912/redsn0w-in-june |title=Dev-Team Blog, Red Snow |accessdate=2009-06-30 |date=2009-06-30}}</ref> but version 3.1 could not at the time it was released.<ref name="everything">{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/09/iphone31/ |title=Everything You Wanted to Know About iPhone OS 3.1 But Were Afraid to Ask |publisher=Wired.com |date=2009-09-11 |accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref> Servicing an iPod Touch after jailbreaking or other modifications made by unofficial means is not covered by Apple's warranty (however, the jailbreaking process is easily undone by performing a restore through iTunes).<ref>[http://images.apple.com/legal/warranty/docs/ipodisight.pdf iPod and iSight Warranty (PDF)], [[Apple Inc.]], page 1.
