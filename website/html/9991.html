<html> <head> <title>Dependent ML</title></head><body>'''Dependent ML''' is an experimental [[functional programming language]] proposed by Frank Pfenning and Hongwei Xi. Dependent ML extends [[ML programming language|ML]] by a restricted notion of [[dependent types]]: types may be dependent on static indices of type Nat. Dependent ML employs a constraint theorem prover to decide a strong equational theory over the index expressions.

Dependent ML has been superseded by [[ATS (programming language)|ATS]] and is no longer under active development.
