<html> <head> <title>Distortion problem</title></head><body>In [[functional analysis]], a branch of mathematics, the '''distortion problem''' is to determine by how much one can [[distortion (mathematics)|distort]] the unit sphere in a given [[Banach space]] using an equivalent norm.  Specifically, a Banach space ''X'' is called &lambda;-distortable if there exists an equivalent norm |''x''| on ''X'' such that, for all infinite-dimensional subspaces ''Y'' in ''X'',
:<math>\sup_{y_1,y_2\in Y, \|y_i\|=1} \frac{|y_1|}{|y_2|} \ge \lambda</math>
(see [[distortion (mathematics)]]).  Note that every Banach space is trivially 1-distortable.  A Banach space is called distortable if it is &lambda;-distortable for some &lambda; > 1. Distortability first emerged as an important property of Banach spaces in the 1960s, where it was studied by {{harvtxt|James|1964}} and {{harvtxt|Milman|1971}}.

Milman showed that if ''X'' is a Banach space that does not contain an isomorphic copy of ''c''<sub>0</sub> or ℓ<sup>''p''</sup> for some {{nowrap|1 &le; ''p'' < &infin;}} (see [[sequence space]]), then some infinite-dimensional subspace of ''X'' is distortable.  So the distortion problem is now primarily of interest on the spaces ℓ<sup>''p''</sup>, all of which are [[separable metric space|separable]].

In separable spaces, distortability is equivalent to the ostensibly more general question of whether or not every real-valued [[Lipschitz function]] <math> f </math> defined on the sphere in ''X'' stabilizes on the sphere of an infinite dimensional subspace, i.e., whether there is a real number a ∈ R so that for every δ > 0 there is an infinite dimensional subspace ''Y'' of ''X'', so that |a &minus; ''&fnof;''(''y'')| < δ, for all ''y'' ∈ ''Y'', with ||''y''|| = 1.

In a separable [[Hilbert space]], the distortion problem is equivalent to the question of whether there exist subsets of the unit sphere that are separated by a positive distance and yet intersect every infinite-dimensional closed subspace.  Unlike many properties of Banach spaces, the distortion problem seems to be as difficult on Hilbert spacs as on other Banach spaces. On a separable Hilbert space, the distortion problem was solved affirmatively by {{harvtxt|Odell|Schlumprecht|1994}}.
