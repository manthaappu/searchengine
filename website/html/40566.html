<html> <head> <title>Writing process</title></head><body>The '''Writing process''' is both a key concept in the teaching of writing and an important research concept in the field of [[composition studies]].  

Research on the writing process  (sometime called the composing process) focuses on how writers draft, revise, and edit texts.  Composing process research was pioneered by scholars such as Janet Emig in The Composing Processes of Twelfth Graders (1971)<ref>Janet Emig, ''The Composing Processes of Twelfth Graders'', Urbana: NCTE, 1971.</ref>, Sondra Perl in “The Composing Processes of Unskilled College Writers (1979)<ref>Sondra Perl, “The Composing Processes of Unskilled College Writers," ''Research in the Teaching of English'' 13 (1979), pp. 317-36, rpt. in ''Cross-Talk in Comp Theory'', 2nd ed., ed. Victor Villanueva, Urbana: NCTE, 2003. </ref>, and Linda Flower and John R. Hayes in “A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing” (1981).<ref>Linda Flower and John R. Hayes, “A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing,” ''CCC'' 32 (1981, pp. 365-87, rpt. in ''Cross-Talk in Comp Theory'', 2nd ed., ed. Victor Villanueva, Urbana: NCTE, 2003.</ref> 

The rest of this page will focus on the writing process as a term used in teaching. In 1972, Donald M. Murray published a brief manifesto on "Teach Writing as a Process Not Product,"<ref>IDonald M. Murray,"Teach Writing as a Process Not Product," ''The Leaflet'' (November 1972),rpt. in ''Cross-Talk in Comp Theory'', 2nd ed., ed. Victor Villanueva, Urbana: NCTE, 2003. </ref> a phrase which became a rallying cry for many writing teachers. Ten years later, in 1982, Maxine Hairston argued that the teaching of writing had undergone a "paradigm shift" in moving from a focus on written products to writing processes<ref>Maxine Hairston, "The Winds of Change: Thomas Kuhn and the Revolution in the Teaching of Writing," ''CCC'' 33 (1982), pp. 76-88, rpt. in ''The Norton Book of Composition Studies'', ed. Susan Miller, New York: Norton, 2009</ref>.

Generally the writing process is seen as consisting of five stages:

* [[Prewriting]] 
* Drafting (See [[Draft document]])
* Revising (See [[Revision (writing)]])
* Editing: [[proofreading]]
* Publishing 

These stages can be described at increasing levels of complexity for both younger students and more advanced writers. The five stages, however, are seldom described as fixed steps in a straightforward process. Rather, they tend to be viewed as overlapping parts of a complex whole. Thus, for instance, a writer might find that, while editing a text, she needs to go back to draft more prose, or to revise earlier parts of what she has written.

==Editing==
[[Editing]] is the stage in the writing process where the writer makes changes in the text to correct errors (spelling, grammar, or mechanics) and fine-tune his or her style.  Having revised the draft for content, the writer’s task is now to make changes that will improve the actual communication with the reader.  Depending on the genre, the writer may choose to adhere to the conventions of [[Standard English]].  These conventions are still being developed and the rulings on controversial issues may vary depending on the source.  A source like Strunk and White’s [[Elements of Style]], first published in 1918, is a well-established authority on stylistic conventions<ref>Strunk, Jr., William; E.B. White (1972) [1918]. The [[Elements of Style]] (2nd ed.). Plain Label Books. pp. 55–56. ISBN 9781603030502. http://books.google.com/books?id=Hd5o74IehyoC&pg=PA55. </ref>.

[http://bcs.bedfordstmartins.com/writersref6e/Player/Pages/Main.aspx]</ref>.  An electronic resource is the Purdue Online Writing Lab (OWL), where writers may search a specific issue to find an explanation of grammatical and mechanical conventions<ref>"General Writing."
