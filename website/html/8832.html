<html> <head> <title>Cyclic executive</title></head><body>A '''cyclic executive''' is an alternative to a [[real-time operating system]].  It is a form of [[cooperative multitasking]], in which there is only one [[Task (computers)|task]].  The sole task is typically realized as an infinite loop in main(), e.g. in C/C++.

The basic scheme is to cycle through a repeating sequence of activities, at a set frequency.  For example, let us consider the example of an [[embedded system]] designed to monitor a [[temperature sensor]] and update an [[LCD]] display.  The LCD may need to be written ten times a second (i.e., every 100 ms).  If the temperature sensor must be read every 50 ms for other reasons, we might construct a loop of the following appearance:

<pre>
main()
{
   // initialization code here
 
   while (1)
   {
      currTemp = tempRead();
      lcdWrite(currTemp);

      // waste CPU cycles until 50 ms
      currTemp = tempRead();
      // do other stuff

      // waste CPU cycles until 100 ms
   }
}
</pre>

The outer 100 ms cycle is called the major cycle.  In this case, there is also an inner minor cycle of 50 ms.
