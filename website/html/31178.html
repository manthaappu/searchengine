'''Raj Jain''' (born 17 August 1951) is a professor of [[Computer Science]] and [[Engineering]] in the [[Washington University School of Engineering and Applied Science]] at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], [[Missouri]].

==Affiliations==
Until 2005 he was the Chief Technology Officer and Co-Founder of Nayna Networks, Inc. – a next generation telecommunications systems company in San Jose, CA. Prior to that he was a professor of Computer and Information Sciences at the [[Ohio State University]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]] and a Senior Consulting Engineer at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] in Littleton, Massachusetts. He was also a visiting scientist at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1983, 1985, and 1987.

==Research Contributions==
Dr. Jain is the co-inventor of the DEC-bit scheme for [[congestion avoidance]] in computer networks<ref name="refname9">[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5377327.html DEC-bit Patent]</ref> which has been adapted for implementation in Frame Relay networks as forward explicit congestion notification (FECN), [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] Networks as Explicit Forward Congestion Indication ([[EFCI]]), and [[TCP/IP]] networks as [[Explicit Congestion Notification]](ECN).

He is also the co-inventor of the Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease ([[AIMD]]) principle used for traffic management in computer networks and Jain’s fairness Index.<ref name="refname10">[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=70208 Analysis of the increase and decrease algorithms for congestion avoidance in computer networks]</ref><ref name="refname11">[http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/papers/fairness.htm A Quantitative Measure Of Fairness And Discrimination For Resource Allocation In Shared Computer Systems]</ref>

His work on timeout based [[congestion control]] influenced the design of the [[slow start]] algorithm in [[TCP/IP]] networks.<ref name="refname12">[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=59330 A timeout-based congestion control scheme for window flow-controlled networks]</ref>
<ref name="refname13">[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=52356 Congestion avoidance and control]</ref>

==Publications==
He is author of four books. His second book ''The Art of Computer Systems Performance Analysis'' published by [[Wiley Interscience]] won the 1991 ''Best Advanced How-to Book, Systems'' award from [[Computer Press Association]].<ref name="refname15">[http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471503363.html The Art of Computer Systems Performance Analysis: Techniques for Experimental Design, Measurement, Simulation, and Modeling]</ref>

==Education==
Dr. Jain obtained a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics ([[Computer Science]]) from [[Harvard University]], Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1978, an M.E. in Automation from [[Indian Institute of Science]] Bangalore, India in 1974, and a B.E. in Electrical Engineering from [[Awdhesh Pratap Singh University]], Rewa, Madhya Pradesh, India in 1972.
