<html> <head> <title>ChilliSpot</title></head><body>'''ChilliSpot''' is an open source [[captive portal]] or wireless LAN access point controller. It is used for authenticating users of a wireless LAN. It supports web based login, which is today's standard for public [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|HotSpot]]s, [[Wireless Internet service provider|WISP]] "smart-client" authentication, and it supports [[Wi-Fi Protected Access]] (WPA and [[WPA2]]). Authentication, authorization and accounting ([[AAA protocol]]) is handled via [[RADIUS]] (on board or remote).

Development on the original project continues, but slowly for some. The [[CoovaChilli|Coova-Chilli]] is an active project and has since added many new features and is an integral part of the [[CoovaAP]] firmware.

As of mid-2008, ChilliSpot appears to be very dead.  The developer Jens Jacobsen has vanished, and the chillispot.org domain has lapsed.
