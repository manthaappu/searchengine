<html> <head> <title>NScripter</title></head><body>'''NScripter''' is a [[game engine|software engine]] that is used for the creation of [[visual novel]]s, written by Naoki Takahashi. Due to its simplicity and its liberal license (while it is not [[open source]], royalty-free commercial use is permitted), it quickly became popular in Japan, and was used for a number of high-profile commercial and [[dōjinshi|dōjin]] titles, such as ''[[Tsuki wa Higashi ni, Hi wa Nishi ni -Operation Sanctuary-|HaniHani]]'' and ''[[Tsukihime]]''.

==Clones and forks==
The original NScripter is closed-source and only available for [[Microsoft Windows]]. A number of cross-platform [[Clone (computing)|clones]] have been written.

===ONScripter===
The best-known<ref name="ONS-EN Readme">README, ONScripter-EN source code, 20101010 release</ref> NScripter clone is the [[free software]] implementation, ONScripter. Its popularity among the visual novel [[Language localisation|localisation]] community is attributed to the ease of modifying the engine to support languages other than Japanese.<ref name="ONS-EN Readme" /> It strives to maintain compatibility with visual novels designed for NScripter.<ref name="PONS-EN Readme">README, PONScripter source code, 20100502 release</ref>

ONScripter is based on the [[Simple Directmedia Layer]] (SDL) library, and can thus be used to run NScripter games on platforms supported by SDL, such as [[Mac OS X]], [[Linux]], [[Dreamcast]], [[PlayStation Portable]] and the [[Apple iPod]].

====ONScripter-EN====
ONScripter-EN is a [[Branching (software)|branch]] of ONScripter that is maintained separately by the English-language community, for convenience and for ease of introducing enhancements that are suited to the community. For example, ONScripter-EN supports switching between English and Japanese in-game, whilst language support in ONScripter must be determined at [[Compiler|compile-time]]. Also, to better manage the [[Software build|build system]] which was deemed cumbersome, build requirements have been tightened, limiting out-of-the-box building to [[POSIX]]-conformant platforms only.

This engine has been used in a number of translations, such as the English versions of ''[[Narcissu]]'' and ''[[Tsukihime]]''.

===Proportional ONScripter===
'''PONScripter''' (abbreviation for "Proportional-OnScripter") is a [[Fork_(software_development)|fork]] of ONScripter-EN. Its stated goal is to provide an easy porting target for translation projects, with emphasis on Western languages.<ref name="PONS-EN Readme" /> PONScripter has made heavy modifications to the ONScripter-EN base code, and is deliberately backwards-incompatible. 

PONScripter was originally maintained by Peter "Haeleth" Jolly. Since September 2009, it is maintained by Mion of Sonozaki Futago-tachi, the [[Higurashi no Naku Koro ni]] translation group<ref>[http://onscripter.denpa.mobi/?page_id=26 Mion releases first alpha build. Checked 2009/09/26]</ref>.

Unlike ONScripter, PONScripter natively supports [[UTF-8]] encoded script files, as well as a larger set of [[font]] types (such as [[Typeface#Proportion|proportional]] fonts, non-[[TrueType]] fonts, and non-[[Latin_alphabet|Latin]] fonts), which makes it possible to translate most NScripter-based [[visual novel]]s into any language other than English (for example, Cyrillic text is improperly displayed in ONScripter, and may crash the game).

Another feature introduced by PONScripter is text formatting, such as bolding, italicising , underlining, striking out, colouring, size changing, and kerning.

[[WinKiller Studio]], a [[Russia]]n visual novel translation group released ''[[Tokoyo no Hoshizora]]'' and ''[[Natsu no Hi no Resonance]]'' translations powered by PONScripter, and the unofficial ''[[Saya no Uta]]'' port from its original Nitro+ Engine.

Known English-translated visual novels that use PONScripter are:
*''[[Narcissu: Side 2nd]]''<ref>A mini-demo powered by PONScripter was available at Haeleth's Narcissu Side 2nd page, currently removed.</ref>
*''[http://www.mangasos.com/dejavu/vn/projects-butterfly.html Ballad of an Evening Butterfly]''
*''[[Saya no Uta]]''<ref>Unofficial port incorporating TLWiki English localisation</ref>
