<html> <head> <title>Cooperative storage cloud</title></head><body>A '''cooperative storage cloud''' is a decentralized model of networked [[online storage]] where data is stored on multiple computers ([[Node (networking)|nodes]]), hosted by the participants cooperating in the cloud. The total storage contributed in aggregate must be equal to the amount consumed for the viability of the co-operative.  However, some nodes may contribute less and some may contribute more.  There may be reward models to compensate the nodes contributing more.

Unlike a traditional [[Cloud storage|storage cloud]], a cooperative does not employ dedicated servers for the actual storage of the data, thereby eliminating the need for a significant dedicated hardware investment. Each node in the cooperative runs specialized [[software]] which communicates with a centralized control and orchestration server, thereby allowing the node to both consume and contribute storage space to the cloud. The centralized control and orchestration server requires several orders of magnitude less resources (storage, compute and bandwidth) to operate relative to the overall capacity of the cooperative.

== Data security ==
Files which are hosted in the cloud will be fragmented and [[Encryption|encrypted]] before leaving the local machine. They are then distributed randomly using a [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] and [[geo-distribution]] [[algorithm]] to other nodes in the cooperative.<ref name=xconomy>{{cite web|last=Huang|first=Gregory T|title=Symform, Founded by Ex-Microsoft Pair, Offers Cheap, Efficient Data Storage in the Cloud|url=http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2009/02/19/symform-founded-by-ex-microsoft-pair-offers-cheap-efficient-data-storage-in-the-cloud/|work=Xconomy|date=2009-02-19|accessdate=2010-10-14}}</ref> Users can add an additional layer of [[Information security|security]] and reduce storage space by [[Data compression|compressing]] and encrypting files before they are copied to the cloud.

== Data redundancy ==
In order to maintain [[data integrity]] and high availability across a relatively unreliable set of computers over a [[wide area network]] like the [[Internet]], the source node will add some level of [[Data redundancy|redundancy]] to each [[Block (data storage)|data block]]<ref name=computerworld/>. This allows the system to recreate the entire block even if some nodes are temporarily unavailable (due to network connectivity, the machine being powered off or a hardware failure.).  The most storage and [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] efficient forms of redundancy use [[Erasure code|erasure coding]] techniques like [[Reed-Solomon]].  A simple, less [[CPU]] intensive but more expensive form of redundancy is duplicate copies.

== Flexible contribution ==
Due to bandwidth or hardware constraints some nodes may not be able to contribute as much space as they consume in the cloud. On the other hand, nodes with large storage space and limited or no bandwidth constraints may contribute more than they consume, thereby the cooperative can always stay in balance.

== Examples ==
Currently the only commercially operational example of a cooperative storage cloud is operated by [[Symform, Inc.]], a [[Venture capital|venture-funded]] [[Startup company|startup]] based in [[Seattle, WA]].<ref name="computerworld">{{cite web|last=Mearian|first=Lucas|title=Start-up unveils cloud storage co-op|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9138257/Start_up_unveils_cloud_storage_co_op|work=[[Computerworld]]|date=2009-09-21|accessdate=2010-10-14}}</ref> Non-commercial examples include the University of California's OceanStore project and MIT's Chord.<ref name=computerworld/>
