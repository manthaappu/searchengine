<html> <head> <title>Claude Berrou</title></head><body>'''Claude Berrou''' (born September 23, 1951) is a [[France|French]] professor in [[electrical engineering]] at [[École Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications de Bretagne]], now [[Telecom-Bretagne]]. He is the coinventor with [[Alain Glavieux]] in 1991 (and [[Punya Thitimajshima]] that developed later similar methods published in a doctorate thesis when he was a student in the same research lab) of a groundbreaking quasi-optimal error-correcting coding scheme called [[Turbo code]]s.

== Key research activities ==
His current research activities are now concentrated on the application and extension of the ''Turbo'' technology in various domains, including his research on ''Artificial thinking'', because the Turbo-decoding has been recognized as a new instance of the very general principle of [[Belief propagation]]; one application of this principle has been invented for the decoding of [[Low-density parity-check code]]s (LDPC codes also known as ''Gallager codes'', in honor of [[Robert G. Gallager]], who developed the LDPC concept in his doctoral dissertation at [[MIT]] in 1960 as a theoretical model whose practical implementation was not widely developed until recently). The ''Turbo'' principle is generalized now by Claude Berrou and his lab team for the processing of various functions such as the [[demodulation]], the [[detection]] or the [[equalization]] using a network of multiple [[convolution code]]s working in parallel with probabilistic feedback.

Other subjects of interest include all their possible applications in the field of [[artificial intelligence]], for example with a better understanding of natural biological thinking and memory for the implementation of such model using [[neural network]]s for the processing of pulsed signals with software and hardware methods with auto-selected and self-maintained combinations of activation cycles of adjacent neurons.<ref name="pensée artificielle">La pensée artificielle (The Artificial Thinking), research project paper by '''Claude Berrou''', ENST Bretagne (2008).</ref>
