'''Ability Online''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] online community for children and young adults facing any sort of [[disability]] (intellectual or physical), chronic illness, or other social challenge. The site offers a protected and nurturing environment where these children can overcome the social isolation often associated with having such challenges, and connect with friends, mentors, homework tutors and job search coaches. 

The site was founded in 1991 by [[Arlette Lefebvre|Dr. Arlette Lefebvre]] (aka "Dr. Froggie") from the [[Hospital for Sick Children]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], and Brian Hillis with the goal of helping to inspire children to feel good about themselves, to understand that there are others who have faced (and overcome) similar challenges, and to provide the social networks and skills required to help them integrate more fully into their communities.

Membership is open to kids of all ages and their families and caregivers, and is free of charge. Members are manually screened and verified prior to being given access to the site, and all public messages on the site are monitored by police-screened volunteers.
