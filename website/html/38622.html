'''UNSPSC''', the acronym for the '''''U'''nited '''N'''ations '''S'''tandard '''P'''roducts and '''S'''ervices '''C'''ode'', is a coding system to classify both products and services for use in [[eCommerce]]. The UNSPSC was jointly developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and [[Dun & Bradstreet]] Corporation in 1998 and is currently managed by [[GS1 US]], which is responsible for overseeing code change requests, revising the codes and issuing regularly scheduled updates to the code, as well as managing special projects and initiatives.

==History==

The UNSPSC was created upon the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding signed on September 29, 1998 by [[John S. Svendsen]], the director of the [[Inter-agency Procurement Services Office]] (IAPSO) of the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) and on November 1, 1998 by [[Lawrence M. Barth]], a Vice President of the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation. The development of the first version was overseen by [[Peter R. Benson]], who was also responsible for the design and development of the code management procedure as a modification of the [[Delphi statistical forecasting]] method. The process allowed for the rapid development of consensus without dominance or influence.

The [[ECCMA]], a non-profit membership association, was formed in 1999 to manage and promote the UNSPSC until March of 2003, with the release of version 6.0315. The UNDP then appointed [[GS1 US]] as code manager in May 2003 and ECCMA develops the ECCMA [[Open Technical Dictionary]] (eOTD) and the international standards [[ISO 22745]] and [[ISO 8000]].

== Current code ==
The current version consists of more than 18000 terms. The codeset is available in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. [[PDF]] versions of the codeset are available for free download. A version in [[Microsoft Excel]] format is available to members, who can also request changes and suggest additions to the code.

The UNSPSC for a given item is composed of five two-digit identifiers, which together categorize the item into a five-level hierarchy. The five levels of the classification are "Segment", "Family", "Class", "Commodity", and "Business Function".
