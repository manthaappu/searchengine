<html> <head> <title>Five-minute rule</title></head><body>In [[computer science]], the '''five-minute rule''' is a [[rule of thumb]] for deciding whether a data item should be kept in [[Random-access memory|memory]], or [[disk storage|stored on disk]] and read back into memory when required. It was first formulated by [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)|Jim Gray]] and G. F. Putzolu in 1985,<ref>{{citation

The rule is as follows:<blockquote>
The 5-minute random rule: cache randomly accessed disk pages that are re-used every 5 minutes.
