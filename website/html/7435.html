Like [[computational chemistry]] or [[computational biology]], it is, for [[particle physics]] both a specific branch and an interdisciplinary field relying on computer science, theoretical and experimental particle physics, mathematics,...
The main fields of computational particle physics are:
* [[Lattice field theory]] numerical computations
* [[Automatic calculation of particle interaction or decay]]
* [[Event generator]]s

Computing tools
* [[Computer algebra]]: Many of the computer algebra language has been developed initially to help particle physics calculations: [[Reduce (computer algebra system)|Reduce]], [[Mathematica]], [[Schoonschip]], [[Form (computer algebra system)|Form]], ...
* [[Data Grid]]: The largest planned use of the GRID systems will be for the analysis of the [[LHC]] produced data. Large software packages have been developed to support this application like the LHC Computing GRID [[LCG]].
