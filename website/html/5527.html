In the past 15 years, researchers from Carnegie Mellon' School of Computer Science have made developments in the fields of [[algorithm]]s, [[computer network]]s, [[distributed systems]], [[parallel processing]], [[programming language]]s, [[robot]]ics, [[language technologies]], [[human computer interaction]] and [[software engineering]].

==History==
{{Refimprove|section|date=March 2010}}
On July 1965, a group of faculty, including [[Allen Newell]], [[Herbert Simon]], and [[Alan J. Perlis]], as well as the faculty from the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (now called the Tepper School of Business), staff from the newly formed Computation Center, and key administrators created The Department of Computer Science, one of the first such departments in the nation. Their mission statement was "to cultivate a course of study leading to the [[Ph.D.]] degree in [[computer science]], a program that would exploit the new technology and assist in establishing a discipline of [[computer science]]." The educational program, formally accepted in October 1965, drew its first graduate students from several existing academic disciplines: [[mathematics]], [[electrical engineering]], [[psychology]], and the interdisciplinary Systems and Communications Sciences program in the [[Tepper School of Business|Graduate School of Industrial Administration]]. The department was housed within the [[Mellon College of Science]].

With support from Newell, Simon, [[A. Nico Habermann|Nico Haberman]], Provost [[Angel Jordan]] and President [[Richard Cyert]], the department of computer science began a two-year status as a "floating" department in the early months of 1986.  Then, the Department began to grow, both academically and financially. In 1988, the Department was officially elevated to the status of a School of Computer Science, among the first such schools in the country.

==Structure in the 1980s==
During the 1980s, the department offered only a Ph.D. study program, with no master's degree as an intermediate step.  The Ph.D. program required a minimum of six years of residency.  It was called the "do or die" program among the graduate students, because a student could not drop a Ph.D. and receive a master's degree.  It had quickly focused on computer networking, operating systems ([[Mach kernel|Mach]]), and [[robotics]].

== Gates and Hillman Centers ==

[[Image:CMU Gates Hillman Complex.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gates and Hillman Centers]]
The Gates Center for Computer Science and the Hillman Center for Future-Generation Technologies are home to much of the School of Computer Science. The $98 million complex was opened in 2009.<ref name=hill>[http://www.cmu.edu/news/archive/2008/February/feb20_hillmangift.shtml Henry L. Hillman Foundation Gives Carnegie Mellon $10 Million For Research Building in New Computer Science Complex], cmu.edu/news/.</ref>
It has {{convert|217000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} of floor space, including about 310 offices, 11 conference rooms, 32 labs, {{convert|8000|sqft|m2}} of project space and the Planetary Robotics Center. It also houses 12 classrooms, including a 250-seat auditorium.<ref name=gatesblog />

Additionally, the Gates Center connects to the Purnell Center, which houses the School of Drama, via the [[Randy Pausch]] Memorial Footbridge. The bridge represents Professor Pausch's own devotion to linking computer science and entertainment, as he was a co-founder of Carnegie Mellon's Entertainment Technology Center.<ref name=footbridge>[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_528186.html Professor diagnosed with cancer offers his final words for the CMU community], ''Pittsburgh Tribune-Review''.</ref>

Mack Scogin Merril Elam Architects of [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] were the lead architects.<ref name=hill /> The centers were designed to achieve at least a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Silver rating.<ref name=gatesblog>[http://gatescenter.blog.cs.cmu.edu/overview/ SCS Complex Information and Blog » Overview], gatescenter.blog.cs.cmu.edu.</ref>

== Traditions ==
{{Main|Carnegie Mellon University traditions}}
* Carnegie Mellon's '''Mobot Races''', now in their 14th year, are hosted by the School of Computer Science during every [[Carnegie_Mellon_University_traditions#Spring_Carnival|Spring Carnival]] celebration. The Mobots (short for [[mobile robot]]s) follow a slalom course painted in the sidewalk outside of Wean Hall. The Mobot Races used to include a MoboJoust competition, but it has not been held since 2002<ref name=mobot2>[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mobot/winners.shtml Winners Gallery], www.cs.cmu.edu/~mobot/.</ref> to avoid damaging the Mobots.<ref name=mobot>[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mobot/ Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science 14th Annual Mobot Races], www.cs.cmu.edu/~mobot/.</ref>
* '''SCS Day''' is a yearly celebration of computer science that started in 2003. The event features a variety of activities, including exhibits, workshops and games, in addition to an evening talent show.<ref name=scsday>[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scsday/ SCS Day 2008], http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scsday/.</ref>

== Smiley face ==

SCS research professor [[Scott Fahlman]] is credited with the invention of the smiley face [[emoticon]]. He suggested the emoticon on an electronic board in 1982 as a way for board readers know when an author was joking. The text of Fahlman's original post was lost for nearly 20 years but was later recovered from backup tapes:<ref name=smiley>[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/smiley/ SMILEY:25 YEARS OLD AND NEVER LOOKED HAPPIER!], cs.cmu.edu.</ref>

 NOTE: the pre-formatted text below has some "spurious spaces", such as
       between "Scott E" and "Fahlman". This is not sloppy editing on our

I propose that the following character sequence for joke markers:

Read it sideways.  Actually, it is probably more economical to mark
things that are NOT jokes - given current trends.  For this, use

== Tartan Racing ==

Tartan Racing is a collaboration between Carnegie Mellon and [[General Motors|General Motors Corporation]] that competes in the [[DARPA Grand Challenge]]. The Grand Challenge is a competition for [[driverless car]]s sponsored by [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA). Tartan Racing is led by Carnegie Mellon roboticist [[Red Whittaker|William L. "Red" Whittaker]].<ref name=racing>[http://www.tartanracing.org/team.html Tartan Racing @ Carnegie Mellon], tartanracing.org.</ref> 

In 2007, Tartan Racing won the [[DARPA Grand Challenge (2007)|DARPA Urban Challenge]], in which 11 autonomous ground vehicles raced over urban roadways. In the challenge, team vehicles were required to obey all [[California]] driving laws, share the road with other drivers and robotic cars, and complete the course in under six hours. Tartan Racing won the $2 million cash prize with Boss, a reworked 2007 [[Chevy Tahoe]]. Averaging about {{convert|14|mi|km}} an hour for a {{convert|55|mi|km|adj=on}} trip, Boss beat the second-place team, [[Stanford]] Racing, by just under 20 minutes.<ref name=racing2>[http://www.cmu.edu/news/archive/2007/November/nov4_tartanracingwins.shtml Carnegie Mellon Tartan Racing Wins $2 Million DARPA Urban Challenge], cmu.edu.</ref>
