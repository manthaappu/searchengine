'''MCU 8051 IDE''' is a [[free software]] [[integrated development environment]] for microcontrollers based on [[8051]]. MCU 8051 IDE has its own simulator and assembler (support for some external assemblers is also available). This [[Integrated development environment|IDE]] supports 2 programming languages: [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Assembly language]]. For [[C (programming language)|C language]] it uses [[Small Device C Compiler|SDCC]].

== Supported MCUs ==
The current version 1.3 supports many microcontrollers including:
8051, 80C51, 8052, AT89C2051, AT89C4051, AT89C51, AT89C51RC, AT89C52, AT89C55WD,AT89LV51, AT89LV52 AT89LV55, AT89S52, AT89LS51, AT89LS52, AT89S8253, AT89S2051, AT89S4051, T87C5101, T83C5101, T83C5102, TS80C32X2, TS80C52X2, TS87C52X2, AT80C32X2, AT80C52X2, AT87C52X2, AT80C54X2, AT80C58X2, AT87C54X2, AT87C58X2, TS80C54X2, TS80C58X2, TS87C54X2, TS87C58X2, TS80C31X2, AT80C31X2, 8031, 8751, 8032, 8752, 80C31, 87C51, 80C52, 87C52, 80C32, 80C54, 87C54, 80C58, 87C58
