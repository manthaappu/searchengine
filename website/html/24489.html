Hardware requirements for Microsoft Security Essentials differ, depending on the [[operating system]]. For Windows XP, Microsoft Security Essentials requires at least a 500 [[megahertz|MHz]] [[Central processing unit|processor]] and 256 MB of [[Random access memory|RAM]]. On Windows Vista and Windows 7, Microsoft Security Essentials requires a 1 [[gigahertz|GHz]] processor and 1 GB of RAM.

On 19 July 2010 Microsoft released a [[technical preview]] of Microsoft Security Essentials 2.0. On 16 December 2010, Microsoft Security Essentials version 2.0 passed the technical preview stage and was officially released to public. This version includes ''Network Inspection System'', a [[network intrusion detection system]] that works on Windows Vista and Windows 7 as well as a new anti-malware engine that employs [[Heuristics#Computer science|heuristics]] in malware detection.

Small businesses are also allowed to install this product on up to 10 devices.

==Reception==
===Industry response===
On 19 November 2008, after Microsoft publicly announced Microsoft Security Essentials under the code-name "Morro", [[Symantec]] and [[McAfee]] shares fell 9.44 and 6.62 percent respectively. Amy Barzdukas, senior director of product management for the Online Services and Windows Division at Microsoft announced that Microsoft Security Essentials will not directly compete with other paid-for antivirus software; rather it was "focused on the 50 to 60 percent [of PC users] who don't have, or won't pay for, antivirus protection, antimalware protection".<ref>{{cite web

Daniel Ives, an analyst with [[FBR Capital Markets]] said Microsoft Security Essentials would be a "long-term competitive threat", though near-term impact would be negligible.<ref name="Reuters" />

Finally, on 2 October 2009, Avast Software a.s. (developer of [[avast!]]) commented that it has an ambivalent view towards Microsoft Security Essentials.

''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]'' noted its "clear-cut" and "cleanly designed" tabbed [[user interface]]. At the top of the main tab, the security status is clearly shown. The other three tabs allow users to manually update Microsoft Security Essentials, review its history, and change program settings. However, PC World found some of the settings to be cryptic and confusing. Settings, such as what to do when malware is found, default to "Microsoft Security Essentials' recommended action". There is no explanation of the recommended action except in the help file. The editor was also confused because Microsoft Security Essentials does not mention it automatically updates itself within the interface; some may believe they must manually update Microsoft Security Essentials through the "Update" tab.<ref name="PCWorld" /> However, this was included in the final release.

''[[PC Magazine]]'' cited Microsoft Security Essentials's small installation package (about 7 MB, depending on the operating system) and its speedy installation. On the downside, the full installation occupied about 110 MB of disk space, and the initial update took 5 to 15 minutes. The editor also noted the fact Microsoft Security Essentials sets [[Windows Update]] into its fully automatic mode, which automatically downloads and installs updates although it can then be turned off again through the control panel. Installation succeeded on 12 malware-infected systems. Some full scans took over an hour on infected systems; however, a scan on a clean system took 35 minutes.<ref name="PCMag" />

Although the Beta release of Microsoft Security Essentials did poorly in PC Magazine tests, the [[Software release life cycle#General availability|official final release]] did significantly better in AV-Test.org tests. According to Neil Rubenking, a PC Magazine author, in an on-demand scan test that he conducted in June 2009, Microsoft Security Essentials Beta found 89 percent of all malware samples: It found only 30 percent of commercial keyloggers, 67 percent of [[rootkits]] and only half of [[scareware]] samples. The suite's real-time protection found 83 percent of all malware samples and blocked the majority of them: In this test, Microsoft Security Essentials found 40 percent of the commercial keyloggers and 78 percent of the rootkits.<ref name="PCMag" /> Later on October that year, AV-Test.org conducted a series of trials on the officially released version of the product in which Microsoft Security Essentials detected and caught 98.44 percent of 545,034 [[computer virus]]es, [[computer worms]] and [[Trojan horse (computing)|software Trojan horses]] as well as 90.95 percent of 14,222 [[spyware]] and [[adware]] samples. It also detected and eliminated all 25 tested rootkits. Microsoft Security Essentials generated no [[false-positive]] at all.<ref>{{cite news

==Rogue antivirus software==
In February 2010, a [[rogue security software]] package calling itself "Security Essentials 2010" appeared on the Internet. This malware, designated ''TrojanDownloader:Win32/Fakeinit'', bears no resemblance to Microsoft Security Essentials except for the name.<ref>{{cite web

A more dangerous form of these malware rogues however, appeared in October 2010. This malware, designated ''Rogue:Win32/FakePAV'', closely resembles Microsoft Security Essentials in look and uses sophisticated social engineering to compel users into introducing malware to their systems, under the guise of five different fictional anti-malware products. This malware also terminates and prevents the launch of 156 different programs, including but not limited to [[Registry Editor]], [[Command Prompt]], [[Internet Explorer]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Opera browser|Opera]], [[Safari (browser)|Safari]], [[Google Chrome]] and other web browsers, email clients, instant messaging clients, media players and entertainment software.<ref>{{Cite web
