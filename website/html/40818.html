<html> <head> <title>Xuejia Lai</title></head><body>'''Xuejia Lai''' ({{zh|s=来学嘉 |t=來學嘉 |p=Lái Xuéjiā}}) is a cryptographer, currently a professor at [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]]. His notable work includes the design of the [[block cipher]] [[International Data Encryption Algorithm|IDEA]], the theory of [[Markov cipher]]s, and the [[cryptanalysis]] of a number of [[cryptographic hash function]]s. His book ''On the Design and Security of Block Ciphers'' (ISBN 978-3891915738) is frequently cited in cryptography papers.

Lai received a [[B.Sc.]] in [[electrical engineering]] in 1982 and an [[M.Sc.]] in [[mathematics]] in 1984 at [[Xidian University]] (then known as ''Northwest Institute of Telecommunication Engineering''). About 1982 he met [[James Massey]], who was visiting the university to give lectures in cryptography. Lai served as interpreter for these lectures. He later became one of Massey's doctoral students at [[ETH Zurich]], where he received his [[Ph.D.]] in 1992. Together they designed the IDEA cipher.
