The term "Intrinsic cognitive load" was first described by [http://www.leaonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s1532690xci0804_2 Chandler and Sweller (1991)]. According to Chandler and Sweller, all instruction has an inherent difficulty associated with it (e.g., the calculation of 2 + 2, versus solving a differential equation ). This inherent difficulty may not be altered by an instructor.

However, instructional material can be redesigned so complex cognitive tasks (large complex schemas) are broken into individual "subschemas" that can be taught in isolation. Instructional designers can then develop later lessons that bring that material back together to describe it as a combined whole ([http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/113395136/ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 Clark, Nguyen, and Sweller, 2006]).
