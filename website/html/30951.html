'''RAISE''' (''Rigorous Approach to Industrial Software Engineering'') was developed as part of the European [[ESPRIT]] II LaCoS project in the 1990s, led by [[Dines Bjørner]]. It consists of a set of tools based around a [[specification language]] (RSL) for [[software development]]. It is especially espoused by [[UNU-IIST]] in [[Macau]], who run training courses on site and around the world, especially in [[developing countries]].
