A '''de Finetti diagram''' is a [[ternary plot]] used in [[population genetics]]. It is named after the [[Italy|Italian]] [[statistics|statistician]] [[Bruno de Finetti]] (1906â€“1985) and is used to graph the [[genotype frequency|genotype frequencies]] of [[population]]s, where there are two [[allele]]s and the population is [[diploidy|diploid]]. It is based on an [[equilateral triangle]], and [[Viviani's theorem]] concerning any point within the triangle, and the three lines from that point that are perpendicular to the sides of the triangle. The sum of the lengths of the lines is a fixed value, regardless of the position of the point. This value (the sum of the lengths) is set to be 1.

==Applications in genetics==

The de Finetti diagram has been put to extensive use in population genetics by [[A.W.F. Edwards]] in his book ''Foundations of Mathematical Genetics''.  In its simplest form the diagram can be used to show the range of genotype frequencies for which [[Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium]] is satisfied.  [[A.W.F. Edwards]] and [[Chris Cannings]] extended its use to demonstrate the changes that occur in allele frequencies under [[natural selection]].
