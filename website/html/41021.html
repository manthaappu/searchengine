'''''Zendoku''''' is a videogame developed by [[Zoonami]] and published by [[Eidos Interactive]] for the [[Nintendo DS]] and the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] portable video game systems.

''Zendoku'' is a variation of [[Sudoku]], offering a slightly more combative experience than simply lining up numbers. Players must now insert symbols, rather than the standard numbers. Players choose characters and choose to attack or defend against a challenger, which takes place via mini-games started upon filling in a group of numbers. The game is set against [[anime]]-influenced backdrops and has a "light-hearted [[martial arts]]" theme. The game also offers single-player puzzles.

==Reception==
The UK Nintendo Magazine, [[ONM]] praised the DS version of the game for its colourful graphics, but criticized it for the confusing system of using symbols instead of numbers. As well as the minigames feeling tacked on and more of an annoyance, and finished by saying, "One for multiplayer only".

On the other hand, [[NGamer]] praised the multiplayer game highly, saying, "The thrill of using logical reasoning to kick someone's arse is a phenomenal experience."
