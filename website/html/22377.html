A '''literature review''' is a body of text that aims to review the critical points of current knowledge including substantive findings as well as theoretical and methodological contributions to a particular topic.  Literature reviews are [[secondary sources]], and as such, do not report any new or original experimental work.

Most often associated with academic-oriented literature, such as a [[thesis]], a literature review usually precedes a research proposal and results section. Its ultimate goal is to bring the reader up to date with current literature on a topic and forms the basis for another goal, such as future research that may be needed in the area.

A well-structured literature review is characterized by a [[logical]] flow of ideas; current and relevant references with consistent, appropriate [[Citation|referencing style]]; proper use of [[terminology]]; and an unbiased and comprehensive view of the previous research on the topic.
