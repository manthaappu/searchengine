<html> <head> <title>RDF query language</title></head><body>An '''RDF query language''' is a [[computer language]] able to retrieve and manipulate data stored in [[Resource Description Framework]] format.

[[SPARQL]] is emerging as the de-facto RDF query language, and is a [[W3C Recommendation]]<ref>[http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/ SPARQL Query Language for RDF<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. Released as a Candidate Recommendation in April 2006, it returned to Working Draft status in October 2006, due to open issues. It returned to Candidate Recommendation status in June 2007<ref>[http://www.w3.org/blog/SW/2007/06/15/sparql_is_a_candidate_recommendation W3C Semantic Web Activity News - SPARQL is a Candidate Recommendation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. On 12 November 2007 the status of SPARQL changed into Proposed Recommendation. <ref>[http://www.w3.org/News/2007#item247 Archive of W3C News in 2007<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On 15 January 2008, SPARQL was standardized. <ref>[http://www.w3.org/blog/SW/2008/01/15/sparql_is_a_recommendation W3C Semantic Web Activity News - SPARQL is a Recommendation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Other RDF query languages==
* [[DQL]], [[XML]]-based, queries and results expressed in [[DAML+OIL]]
* [[N3QL]], based on [[Notation 3]]
* [[R-DEVICE]]
* [[RDFQ]], XML-based
* [[RDQ]], [[SQL]]-like
* [[RDQL]], SQL-like
* [[RQL/RVL]], SQL-like
* [[SeRQL]], SQL-like, similar to RQL/RVL
* [[Versa (query language)]], compact syntax (non–SQL-like), solely implemented in [[4Suite]] ([[Python (programming language)|Python]])
* [[XUL]] has a [http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XUL:Template_Guide:Introduction template] element in which to declare rules for matching data in RDF. [[XUL]] uses RDF extensively for databinding.
* [[Adenine (programming language)|Adenine]] (programming language written in RDF).
