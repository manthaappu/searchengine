In [[telecommunication]], the term '''automated information systems security''' refers to measures and controls that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and [[availability]] of the [[information]] processed and stored by automated information systems. The unauthorized disclosure, modification, or destruction may be accidental or intentional.

Automated [[information systems security]] includes consideration of all [[hardware]] and [[software]] functions, characteristics and features; operational procedures; accountability procedures; and [[access control]]s at the central [[computer]] facility, remote computer, and [[computer terminal|terminal]] facilities; management constraints; physical structures and devices, such as computers, [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] lines, and [[Electric power|power]] sources; and personnel and [[telecommunication|communications]] controls needed to provide an acceptable level of risk for the [[automated information system]] and for the [[data]] and information contained in the system. Automated information systems security also includes the totality of security safeguards needed to provide an acceptable protection level for an automated information system and for the data handled by an automated information system.

In [[INFOSEC]] automated information systems security is a synonym for [[computer security]].
