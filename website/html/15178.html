===MUD contributions===
Beyond the Nightmare and Dead Souls [[mudlib]]s, noted above, George Reese contributed significantly to the [[MUD]] community by providing hosting for extensive MUD-related content through the Center for Imaginary Environments at imaginary.com (including the influential webzine ''[[Imaginary Realities]]''),{{R|imaginary-home}} as the custodian of the LPMud Timeline{{R|reese-timeline}} and LPMud FAQ,{{R|reese-faq}} and as the lead developer of [[Nightmare LPMud]].  His MUD pseudonym was Descartes of Borg, or simply Descartes, chosen because of his philosophy major in college.{{R|reese-faq}}  In March 2001, Reese withdrew precipitously from the MUD community, citing disillusionment with its adherence to outdated technologies and with the ethics of some of its members, and shut down the Center for Imaginary Environments.
