The '''M32R''' is a 32-bit [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] [[instruction set architecture]] (ISA) developed by [[Mitsubishi]] for embedded [[microprocessor]]s and [[microcontroller]]s. The ISA is now owned by [[Renesas Electronics Corporation]], and the company designs and fabricates M32R implementations. M32R processors are used in [[embedded system]]s such as Engine Control Units, [[digital camera]]s and PDAs. The ISA is supported by [[Linux]] and the [[GNU Compiler Collection]].
