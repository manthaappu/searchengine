A '''tripwire''' is a passive [[trigger]]ing mechanism, usually/originally employed for military purposes, although its principle has been used since prehistory for methods of [[Trapping (Animal)|trapping]] game.

Typically, a [[wire]] or [[cord]] is attached to some device for detecting or reacting to physical movement. From this basic meaning, several extended and metaphorical uses of the term have developed.
For example, the [[Berlin Brigade]] stationed in the divided city of [[Berlin]] during the [[Cold War]] was given the mission to be the "tripwire" for a [[Soviet]] incursion into [[West Germany]].<ref>[http://groups.msn.com/berlintankers/general.msnw?action=get_message&mview=1&ID_Message=162 "...but what a tripwire we were!!!"] posted on the [http://groups.msn.com/berlintankers/ Berlin Tankers] web group 21 August 2005, retrieved June 16, 2008:
<blockquote>To conclude, I will again agree that we were a '''trip wire''' for World War III, but what a great tripwire we were.   If an invasion had ever occurred we would have innevitably lost, but the price that the enemy wold have paid to take Berlin would have crippled them.</blockquote>

Military usage may designate a ''tripwire'' as a wire attached to one or more [[Land mine|mines]] — normally [[bounding mine]]s and the fragmentation type — in order to increase their activation area. Alternatively, tripwires are frequently used in [[boobytrap]]s, whereby a tug on the wire (or release of tension on it) will [[detonate]] the [[explosives]].

Soldiers sometimes detect the presence of tripwires by spraying the area with [[Silly String]]. If the string falls to the ground there are no tripwires. If there is a tripwire, the string will be suspended in the air without pulling the wire.  It is being used by U.S. troops in [[Iraq]] for this purpose.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1561143,00.html | title=Not So Silly String In Iraq | publisher=TIME.com | accessdate=2007-10-16 | date=2006-11-19 | first=Ellin | last=Martens}}</ref><ref name="CBS News October 16"> {{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/12/06/iraq/main2234543.shtml | title=A Serious Use For Silly String | publisher=CBS News | accessdate=2007-10-16 | date=2006-12-06}}</ref><ref name="The Raw Story October 16"> {{cite news | url=http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/FOX_VIDEO_Silly_String_saving_lives_1204.html | title=FOX VIDEO: 'Silly String' is saving lives over in Iraq | publisher=The Raw Story | accessdate=2007-10-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071012184140/http://rawstory.com/news/2006/FOX_VIDEO_Silly_String_saving_lives_1204.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-12}}</ref>
