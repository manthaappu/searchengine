<html> <head> <title>Living graph</title></head><body>Also referred to as a "Lifeline", "Living Timeline"<ref name="history"/> or "Fortune Line".<ref name="NatStrat"/> In terms of '''knowledge representation''', a '''Living Graph''' is similar to a [[chronology]] timeline. However, rather than simply listing events along a horizontal axis to reflect changes over a time, a '''living graph''' also places events high or low on vertical axis to reflect something else: for example, relative importance, degrees of success or failure, danger or safety, happiness or sadness. In this sense they have been described as being "timelines with attitude".<ref name="history"/>
