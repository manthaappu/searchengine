The original [[Motorola 68000 family|Motorola 680x0]] based system was revised in favor of the [[PowerPC G3]] based system, since the future for the Amigas with 680x0 processors was very uncertain. In 1999, the A5000 was cancelled due to delay of hardware components and announcements of the new Amiga system ''Amiga Multimedia Convergence Computer (Amiga MCC)'' by [[Amiga, Inc]].
