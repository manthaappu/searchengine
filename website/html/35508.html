The '''Staden Package''' is a set of open source tools for DNA [[sequence assembly]], editing, and sequence analysis.

== Package Components ==

The Staden package consists of a number of different programs. The main components are:

* pregap4 - base calling with [[Phred]], end clipping, and vector trimming.
* trev - trace viewing and editing
* gap4 - sequence assembly, contig editing, and finishing
* Spin - DNA and protein sequence analysis

== History ==

The Staden Package was developed by [[Rodger Staden]]'s group at the MRC Cambridge in England since 1977<ref name="Staden1979ay">{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/nar/6.7.2601 |author=Staden R|year=1979|title=A strategy of DNA sequencing employing computer programs.|journal=Nucleic Acids Res|volume=6|pages=2601–2610PMID461197}}</ref><ref name="Staden1984to">{{cite journal |author=Staden R|year=1984|title=Computer methods to aid the determination and analysis of DNA sequences.|journal=Biochem Soc Trans|volume=12|pages=1005–1008PMID6397374}}</ref><ref name="Staden2000xp">{{cite journal |author=Staden R, Beal KF, Bonfield JK|year=2000|title=The Staden package, 1998.|journal=Methods Mol Biol|volume=132|pages=115–130PMID10547834}}</ref>. The Staden package was available free to academic users, with 2500 licenses issued in 2003 and an estimated 10,000 users, when funding for further development was cut<ref>http://www.genomeweb.com/informatics/uk-s-mrc-ends-support-staden-package-first-sign-post-hgp-funding-priority-shift</ref>. The Staden Package was converted to [[open source]] in 2004, and new versions were released in 2004, 2005, and 2009.

During the years of active development, the Staden group published a number of widely used file formats and ideas, including the SCF file format<ref name="Dear1992il">{{cite journal |author=Dear S, Staden R|year=1992|title=A standard file format for data from DNA sequencing instruments.|journal=DNA Seq|volume=3|pages=107–110PMID1457811}}</ref>, the use of sequence quality scores to generate accurate consensus sequences<ref name="Bonfield1995jx">{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/nar/23.8.1406 |author=Bonfield JK, Staden R|year=1995|title=The application of numerical estimates of base calling accuracy to DNA sequencing projects.|journal=Nucleic Acids Res|volume=23|pages=1406–1410PMID7753633}}</ref>, and the ZTR file format <ref name="Bonfield2002rf">{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/18.1.3 |author=Bonfield JK, Staden R|year=2002|title=ZTR: a new format for DNA sequence trace data.|journal=Bioinformatics|volume=18|pages=3–10PMID11836205}}</ref>.
