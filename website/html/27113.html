'''Odra''' was a line of [[computer]]s manufactured in [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]]. 

The production started in 1959&ndash;1960. Models 1001, 1002, 1003, 1013, 1103, 1204 were of original Polish construction. Models 1304 and 1305 were functional counterparts of [[International Computers Limited|ICL]] 1905 and 1906 due to software agreement.<ref>http://itpedia.pl/index.php/ODRA_1305</ref> The last model was 1325 based on two models from ICL.

The name comes from the [[Oder river|Odra River]] that flows through the city of Wrocław

The computers were built at the [[Elwro]] manufacturing plant, which was closed in 1989. 

ODRA-1002 were capable of only 100-400 operations per second.<ref>http://www.warmus.com.pl/pdf/tytul_ang.pdf</ref>

The operating system used by the ODRA-1204 is called SODA. It was designed to work on a small computer without magnetic storage and
can run simultaneous loading and execution of programs.<ref>http://comjnl.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/11/2/148</ref>

An [[ALGOL 68]] compiler was produced for the ODRA 1204/IL in 1976.

As for 2008 there is still at least one machine working at railway station in Wrocław Brochów.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wfp.pl/wroclaw-miasto/news.php?id=10004|title=Zabytkowa Odra pracuje na stacji kolejowej|opublikowany=Alert24.pl|date=25 April 2008|accessdate=26 April 2008|language=pl|author=Jacek Bomersbach |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080530115600/http://www.wfp.pl/wroclaw-miasto/news.php?id=10004 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 30 May 2008}}</ref> This machine was shut down on 30 April 2010, 22:00 CEST<ref>{{cite web | title=Wyłączono ostatni komputer Odra w Polsce! | url=http://www.computerworld.pl/news/358487/Wylaczono.ostatni.komputer.Odra.w.Polsce.html}}</ref> and replaced with a contemporary computer system. Few Odras are placed on exhibition in museums and at least one is still operational and maintained by students of electrical school which created a fan club around the machine.

There are several speculations alleging that the only one downed [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk|F-117]] was tracked down using [[Tamara passive sensor|Czechoslovakian passive radiolocation system Tamara]] runned by Rodan 10 (military version of Odra).<ref>http://www.newsweek.pl/artykuly/sekcje/nauka/odra-1305--cud-techniki-po-polsku-,59316,1, pol.</ref><ref>http://www.elwrowcy.republika.pl/final.pdf, pol.</ref> It is hard to ascertain whether it is true due to military secrecies of all countries involved: [[Poland]], [[Czechoslovakia]] (where the system is still developed with the current version called [[VERA passive sensor|VERA]]), [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].
