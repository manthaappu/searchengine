<html> <head> <title>Crossover effects</title></head><body>In [[linguistics]], '''crossover effects''' are restrictions on possible [[Binding (linguistics)|binding]] or [[coreference]] found between certain [[phrase]]s and [[pronoun]]s. Crossover effects are divided into weak crossover or strong crossover.

== Weak crossover ==

In [[syntax]], weak crossover (or WCO) refers to the restriction on possible binding or coreference found between certain phrases and pronouns, as the two below:

: (1) ?Who<sub>''i''</sub> does his<sub>''i''</sub> mother love ''t''<sub>''i''</sub>?
: (2) ?His<sub>''i''</sub> mother loves [each boy]<sub>''i''</sub>.

In (1), the object [[interrogative word|wh]]-phrase ''who'' is said to have 'crossed over' the pronoun 'his' embedded in the subject. The same set of data found with [[Quantification|quantifiers]] has often been claimed to be due to a covert movement of the quantifier phrase at a more abstract level of syntactic representation (such as [[Logical form (linguistics)|Logical Form]] (LF)).

== Strong crossover ==

Strong crossover (SCO) refers to the restriction on possible binding or coreference found between certain phrases and pronouns, as below:

: (3) *Who<sub>''i''</sub> does he<sub>''i''</sub> love ''t''<sub>''i''</sub>?
: (4) *He<sub>''i''</sub> loves each boy<sub>''i''</sub>.

In (3), the object [[interrogative word|wh]]-phrase ''who'' is said to have "crossed over" the subject pronoun ''he''; in this configuration, the individuals picked out by ''he'' cannot covary with those selected by ''who'' (that is, ''he'' cannot be bound by the quantifier associated with ''who''). The same set of data found with quantifiers, as in (4), has often been claimed to be due to a covert movement of the quantifier phrase at a more abstract level of syntactic representation (such as Logical Form (LF)).

Crossover effects were originally discovered by [[Paul Postal]] in 1971;<ref>Postal, Paul. 1971. Crossover phenomena. </ref> the division into 'weak' and 'strong' is due to [[Thomas Wasow]], whose dissertation describes the fact that for many speakers, the restriction on binding is felt to be stronger in cases like (3) and (4) than in Weak Crossover configurations like (1) and (2).<ref>Wasow, Thomas. 1973. MIT dissertation.</ref>
