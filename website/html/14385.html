Functional Abstraction (or Business Logic Abstraction) is the ability to separate business logic implementation code from the service protocol implementation which is calling it.
 
This architectural abstraction allows the user to implement the business logic in a manner 
generic to its execution. This separation may also simplify the code, as no connectivity 
details or other extraneous information need enter the implementation.
