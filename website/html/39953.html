'''Web Storage''' and '''DOM Storage''' ([[Document Object Model]]) are [[web application]] software methods and protocols used for storing data in a [[web browser]]. Web storage supports [[Persistence (computer science)|persistent]] data storage, similar to [[HTTP cookie|cookies]], as well as [[Window (computing)|window]]-local storage.

Web storage is being standardized by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C). It was originally part of the [[HTML 5]] specification, but is now in a separate specification<ref>[http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/ Web Storage]</ref>. It is supported by [[Internet Explorer 8]], [[Mozilla]]-based browsers (e.g., [[Mozilla Firefox 2|Firefox 2+]], officially from [[Mozilla Firefox 3.5|3.5]])<ref>[https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM:Storage#Description Mozilla Developer Center: DOM Storage]</ref>, [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] 4, [[Google Chrome]] 4 (sessionStorage is from 5), and [[Opera 10|Opera 10.50]]. {{As of|2010|7|14}} only Opera supports the storage events<ref>[http://www.diveintojavascript.com/javascript-apis/web-storage-dom-storage Dive Into JavaScript: Web Storage (DOM Storage)]</ref>.

==Features==
Web storage can be viewed simplistically as an improvement on [[HTTP cookie|cookies]], providing much greater storage capacity (5MB per [[Domain name|domain]] in [[Mozilla Firefox]]<ref>[http://ejohn.org/blog/dom-storage/ John Resig: DOM Storage]</ref>, Google Chrome, and [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], 10MB per storage area in [[Internet Explorer]]<ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc197062(VS.85).aspx#_dom MSDN: Introduction to DOM Storage]</ref>) and better programmatic interfaces. However, it differs from cookies in some key ways.

===Client-side interface===
Unlike cookies, which can be accessed by both the server and client side, Web storage falls exclusively under the purview of [[client-side scripting]]. Web storage data is not transmitted to the server in every HTTP request, and a web server can't directly write to Web storage, but can of course issue read and write requests.

===Local and session storage===
Web storage offers two different storage areas—local storage and session storage—which differ in scope and lifetime. Data placed in local storage is per domain (it's available to all scripts from the domain that originally stored the data) and persists after the browser is closed. Session storage is per-page-per-window and is limited to the lifetime of the window. Session storage is intended to allow separate instances of the same web application to run in different windows without interfering with each other, a use case that's not well-supported by cookies.<ref>[http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/#introduction W3C: Web Storage draft standard]</ref>

===Data model===
Web storage currently provides an [[associative array]] [[data model]] where the keys and values are both [[String (computer science)|strings]]. An additional [[Application programming interface|API]] for accessing [[Data model|structured data]], perhaps based on [[SQL]], is being considered by the W3C Web Applications Working Group.<ref>[http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase W3C: Web SQL Database (working draft)]</ref>

==Nomenclature==
The W3C draft is titled "Web Storage", but "DOM storage" is also a commonly used name.<ref>[https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM:Storage Mozilla Developer Center: DOM Storage]</ref><ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc197062(VS.85).aspx MSDN: Introduction to DOM Storage]</ref>

The "DOM" in DOM storage doesn't literally refer to the [[Document Object Model]]. "The term DOM is used to refer to the API set made available to scripts in Web applications, and does not necessarily imply the existence of an actual Document object.."<ref>[http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/#terminology W3C: Web Storage draft standard]</ref>

==Web Storage Management==
Storage of Web Storage Objects is enabled per default in [[Mozilla Firefox]] and [[Seamonkey]], but can be disabled by setting the "about:config" parameter "dom.storage.enabled" to false. <ref>[http://kb.mozillazine.org/Dom.storage.enabled Mozillazine article on disabling Web Storage Objects in about:config]</ref>

Mozilla Firefox stores all Web Storage objects in a single file named webappsstore.sqlite. The sqlite3 command can be used to show the elements stored therein. <ref>http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/site/blog/post/firefoxs-super-cookies CERIAS Blog -- Firefox’s Super Cookies </ref>

There are browser add-ons for [[Mozilla Firefox]] available that let the user deal with web Storage, such as "BetterPrivacy" which can be configured to remove the whole Web Storage automatically on a regular basis.<ref >[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6623?from=%2Fde%2Ffirefox%2Faddon%2F6623 Mozilla add-ons page for "Better Privacy"]</ref> <ref>[http://netticat.ath.cx/extensions.html Homepage of "Better Privacy", with some further references to blogs and articles]</ref>
