<html> <head> <title>Zip bomb</title></head><body>A '''zip bomb''', also known as a '''Zip of Death''' or '''decompression bomb''', is a malicious [[File archiver|archive]] [[computer file|file]] designed to crash or render useless the program or system reading it. It is often employed to disable [[antivirus software]], so that a more traditional virus sent afterwards could get through undetected.

Rather than hijacking the normal operation of the program, a zip bomb allows the program to work as intended, but the archive is carefully crafted so that unpacking it (e.g. by a virus scanner in order to scan for viruses) requires inordinate amounts of time, disk space or memory.

A zip bomb is usually a small file (up to a few hundred [[kilobyte]]s) for ease of transport and to avoid suspicion. However, when the file is unpacked its contents are more than the system can handle.

The technique has been used on dialup [[bulletin board system]]s at least as long as compressing data archive programs have been around.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Today, most antivirus programs can detect whether a file is a zip bomb and so avoid unpacking it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

One example of a Zip bomb was the file "42.zip" which was 42 [[kilobyte]]s of compressed data, containing five layers of nested zip files in sets of 16, each bottom layer archive containing a 4.3 [[gigabyte]] (4 294 967 295 bytes; ~ 3.99 GiB) file for a total of 4.5 [[petabyte]]s (4 503 599 626 321 920 bytes; ~ 3.99 PiB) of uncompressed data. <ref>[http://www.unforgettable.dk/]</ref>
This file is still available for download on various websites across the internet.
