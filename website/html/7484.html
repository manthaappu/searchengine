<html> <head> <title>Computer Aided Verification</title></head><body>'''Computer Aided Verification''' ('''CAV''') is an annual [[academic conference]] on the theory and practice of computer aided formal analysis of software and hardware systems. The conference consists of peer-reviewed research papers and system descriptions. The proceedings are published by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] in the [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science|LNCS]] series. Extended versions of selected papers are regularly published as special issues of international computer science journals.  

The first CAV was held in 1989 in [[Grenoble]], [[France]]; so was the 20th anniversary CAV in 2009.

CAV traditionally attracts attention from the computer industry.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}
