'''Highest Response Ratio Next''' (HRRN) [[scheduling (computing)|scheduling]] is a non-preemptive discipline, similar to [[Shortest Job Next|Shortest Job Next (SJN)]], in which the priority of each job is dependent on its estimated run time, and also the amount of time it has spent waiting. Jobs gain higher priority the longer they wait which prevents indefinite postponement ([[starvation (computing)|process starvation]]). In fact, the jobs that have spent a long time waiting compete against those which are estimated to have short run times.

<math>Priority = \frac{waiting\ time + estimated\ run\ time}{estimated\ run\ time} = 1 + \frac{waiting\ time}{estimated\ run\ time}</math>

Developed by Brinch Hansen to correct certain weaknesses in SJN including the difficulty in estimating run time.
