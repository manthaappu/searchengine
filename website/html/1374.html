'''Alex Martelli''' (born October 5, 1955) is an Italian computer engineer and member of the [[Python Software Foundation]]. Since early 2005, he worked as "Ãœber Tech Lead" for [[Google]], Inc. in [[Mountain View, California]].  He holds a [[Laurea]] in [[Electrical Engineering]] from [[Bologna University]] (1980); he is the author of ''[[Python in a Nutshell]]'', co-editor of the ''[[Python Cookbook]]'', and has written other (mostly Python-related) materials.  Martelli won the 2002 Activators' Choice Award, and the 2006 Frank Willison award for outstanding contributions to the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] community.

Before joining Google, Martelli spent a year designing chips with [[Texas Instruments]]; 8 years with [[IBM Research]], gradually shifting from hardware to software, and winning three Outstanding Technical Achievement Awards; 12 as Senior Software Consultant at [[think3, Inc.]], developing libraries, network protocols, GUI engines, event frameworks, and web access frontends; and 3 more as a freelance consultant, working mostly for [[Open End AB]], a Python-centered software house (formerly known as  [[Strakt AB]]) located in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]].  He has taught courses on programming, development methods, [[object-oriented design]], and numerical computing, at [[University of Ferrara|Ferrara University]] and other schools.  According to Martelli's self-evaluation, his proudest achievement is the articles that appeared in [[The Bridge World]] (January/February 2000), which were hailed as giant steps towards solving issues that had haunted [[Contract bridge|contract-bridge]] theoreticians for decades. Martelli was also the keynote speaker for the 2008 [[SciPy]] Conference.

He is also noted for coining the phrase [[Duck typing]].
