'''Stacheldraht''' ([[German language|German]] for [[barbed wire]]) is a piece of [[software]] written by Random for [[Linux]] and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] systems which acts as a [[distributed denial of service]] (DDoS) agent. The tool detects and automatically enables source address forgery.

Stacheldraht uses a number of different DoS attacks, including: [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] flood, [[Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]] flood, [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] [[SYN flood]] and [[Smurf attack]].

It combines features of [[Trinoo]] with [[Tribe Flood Network|TFN]], and adds encryption.
