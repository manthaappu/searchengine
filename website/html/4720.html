==Functionality==
Bump allows users to send contact information, photos, and other objects between phones.<ref name="PCworld" /> Before bumping phones, each user confirms what he or she wants to send to the other user.<ref name="PCmag" /> To use the application, two people bump their phones together, and within about five to ten seconds, a screen appears on both users' screens allowing them to confirm what they want to send to each other.<ref name="tribune">{{cite web|title=New iPhone app works by bump, not touch|author=Benderoff, Eric|date=April 24, 2009|publisher=''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' |url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/eric2_0/2009/03/new-iphone-app-works-by-bump-not-touch.html|accessdate=August 17, 2010}}</ref> When two users bump their phones, the data is automatically sent through a separate internet server to the other user, which is able to detect when any two phones using the application bump each other.<ref name="PCworld" /> A newer aspect of the application allows two people to bump in order to become [[Facebook]] friends.<ref name="mashable">{{cite web|title=Facebook Friending Made Simple: Just Shake Your iPhone|author=Parr, Ben|publisher=[[Mashable]] |url=http://mashable.com/2010/02/25/bump-facebook/|accessdate=August 17, 2010}}</ref>
