<html> <head> <title>Oakley protocol</title></head><body>The '''Oakley Key Determination Protocol''' is a [[key-agreement protocol]] that allows authenticated parties to exchange keying material across an insecure connection using the [[Diffie-Hellman key exchange]] algorithm. The protocol was proposed by H. Orman in 1998, and formed the basis for the more widely used [[Internet key exchange]] protocol.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid14_gci884946,00.html | title=What is Internet Key Exchange? | publisher=TechTarget| accessdate=2006-11-12}}</ref>

The Oakley protocol has also been implemented in [[Cisco Systems]]' [[ISAKMP]] [[daemon (computer software)|daemon]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk583/tk372/technologies_tech_note09186a0080093c2b.shtml | title=RED ISAKMP and Oakley Information | publisher=Cisco Systems| accessdate=2006-11-12}}</ref>
