<html> <head> <title>HoHoCon</title></head><body>'''HoHoCon''' (or '''XmasCon''') was a conference series which took place shortly before or after [[Christmas]] in [[Houston, Texas]], sponsored by [[Drunkfux]] and the [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] [[underground ezine|ezine]] [[Cult of the Dead Cow|CULT OF THE DEAD COW]]. The fourth and fifth HoHoCons were also sponsored by [[Phrack]] magazine and took place in [[Austin, Texas]]. [[Phreaking]] software [[BlueBEEP]] was released at HoHoCon '93.

HoHoCon is generally credited as being the first "modern" [[hacker con]], although [[SummerCon]] was around before it.  It inspired later conventions such as [[DEF CON]] and [[H.O.P.E.]]

All together, there were five conferences.
