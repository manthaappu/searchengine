The '''Exclusion principle''' is a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] principle that states:

:If an [[event (philosophy)|event]] ''e'' [[causality|causes]] event ''e*'', then there is no event ''e#'' such that ''e#'' is [[supervenience|non-supervenient]] on ''e'' and ''e#'' causes ''e*''.

==In physicalism==
{{Main|physicalism}}
The exclusion principle is most commonly applied when one poses this scenario; One usually considers that the desire to lift oneâ€™s arm as a mental event, and the lifting on one's arm, a physical event. According to the exclusion principle, there must be an event that does not supervene on ''e'' while causing ''e*''. To show this better, substitute "''the desire to lift one's arm''" for "''e''", and "''one to lift their arm''" for "''e*''".

:If ''the desire to lift one's arm'' causes ''one to lift their arm'', then there is no event such that it is non-supervenient on ''the desire to lift one's arm'' and it causes ''one to lift their arm''.

This is interpreted as meaning, mental events supervene upon the physical. However, some philosophers do not accept this principle, and accept [[epiphenomenalism]], which states mental events are caused by physical events, but physical events are not caused by mental events (called ''causal impotence''). However, If ''e#'' does not cause ''e'', then there is no way to verify that ''e*'' exists. Yet, this debate has not been settled in the philosophical community.
