'''Prex''' is a [[Porting|portable]] [[32-bit]] [[embedded operating system|embedded]] [[real-time operating system|real-time]] [[microkernel]] [[operating system]]. The [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] is compact, under 25k [[byte]]s, and provides [[memory management]], [[inter-process communication]] (messages and [[shared memory]]) and [[Thread (computer science)|multithreading]] in the kernel, and leaves more [[Application layer|application]]-specific features like a [[file system]] to be implemented. It is designed to have virtual [[Computer storage|memory]] and memory protection when available. It is currently pre-[[Software release life cycle|beta]], but runs on [[x86 architecture|x86]] PCs and the [[Game Boy Advance]]. It has an [[open source]] [[BSD license]].

It is programmed in the [[C (programming language)|C]] [[programming language]], and has a [[POSIX]] [[Emulator|emulation]] layer. Version 0.9.0 was released on 1 Oct 2009. [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_name=4AC4E531.3080600%40users.sourceforge.net]

Other open source real-time OSs include: [[eCos]], [[FreeRTOS]], [[MenuetOS]], and others.
