'''Flow''' is [[middleware]] software, which allows data integration specialists to connect disparate systems, whether they are on-premise, hosted or in the cloud; transforming and restructuring data as required between environments. Flow functionality can be utilised for [[data integration]] projects, [[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]] and data conversion activities. Flow has been created by Flow Software Ltd in NZ and is available through a variety of partner companies or directly from Flow Software in NZ and Australia.

Integration software allows organisations to continue using existing applications, overcoming the need to customize or upgrade as their requirements change. By using integration software, many businesses benefit from reduced dependence on manual keying of data and the avoidance of costs and delays caused by keying errors.

==Flow Software Features==
Flow enables data management:

* Transformation of data, within and between sets
* Generation and consumption of data, accessioning from specified sets within structures
* Transportation of data files, using various transport formats, including secure
* Specification of task work-flows
* Notification of transactions and formats via reports

===Data Generation===
Flow accesses and generates data in structured formats, from files or databases. 

Flow can access and read from, or write to databases using either the SQL89 or SQL92 specification. Informix provides support for extended SQL use.

*[[Microsoft SQL Server]] 2000 & above
*[[Microsoft Access|Microsoft Access 97]] 97 above
*[[MySQL|MySQL 4.x]]
*[[Oracle Database|Oracle 8i]]
*[[InterBase|InterBase 5.6]]
*[[Informix]]
*[[IBM DB2]]
*[[MYOB (company)#Data Structure of MYOB Small Business Accounting|MYOB]]
*Any [[ODBC]] compliant database as per [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms714177(VS.85).aspx  the Microsoft ODBC specification]
*Any [[ADO.NET|ADO]] compliant data source as per the Microsoft ADO specification

Flow can access and read from, or write to various file types.

*Any [[ASCII]] format file
*Any [[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]] type file based on either [[UN/EDIFACT]] or  [[ANSI X12]] standards
*Any [[XML]] file based on XML standards such as [[SOAP]], [[XHTML]] or [[ebXML]]

===Data Transformation===
A visual mapping engine is used to configure data transformation between data sets. Data can be restructured as it is transformed, thus allowing for dissimilar data structures between source and destination. Flow data access operates independently of the mapping layer. The applied mapping logic uses events containing [[Object Pascal]] code.

===Data Transportation===
Flow transports generated data and files using the following formats:

*Local file access
*[[LAN]]
*[[FTP]]
*[[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP/S]]POST
*[[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP/S]] GET
*[[SMTP]]
*[[Post Office Protocol|POP]]
*[[EbXML Messaging Services|ebMS]]
*[[SOAP]]

===User Interface===
The Flow user interface allows users to create and processes, activate processes and view activity logs.

Email notifications of Flow process activity can also be configured.

===Actions===
Flow uses predefined processing of events that can be executed either on schedule, or event driven. Actions and their results are logged and available via the user interface.

Actions include:

*Transformation of data or files
*Generation of specific reports
*Windows-based shell commands
*Outward-bound transports of data or files
*Selected SQL statements
*Custom plugin actions

===Reports===
Flow includes a report writer based on the software Report Builder. The report writer can create custom notification reports providing users with details related to their transactions. Reports can be created in [[XML]], [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[JPEG]] and [[Microsoft Excel file format#File formats|XLS]]. Reports can be embedded into email messages if required.

==History==
Flow was created and developed by company founder Cameron Hart in North Shore City, New Zealand.
