'''R.A.T.S.''', an [[acronym]] for '''Robot Anti-Terror Squad''' (also sometimes know as '''Battle R.A.T.S.'''), was a short-lived [[robot]] and [[vehicle]] [[toy-line]] created by [[Tomy]] and released in [[Europe]] in the early 1980s. The toyline consisted primarily of recolored robots and vehicles from [[Starriors]], an American toyline also created by Tomy, but also featured additional vehicles not seen in the Starriors line. The primary gimmick of each toy was some example of [[wind-up]] automation, such as a rotating weapon or tool, or an [[electronics|electronic]] automation, such as firing discs or [[locomotion]].

The only backstory for the toys was that which was provided on the packaging itself (in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]):

<blockquote>From the depths of space came the enemy battle squadron...hostile hordes of alien robots.
Earth was the prize they fought for and Earth was their battleground. 
But they were not prepared for Earth's last line of defence...
An army created to crush and destroy any invader.
They're the ultimate weapon â€” the last line of defence of Planet Earth.
'''They're fierce. They're mean. They'll take on anybody ...anything! They're R.A.T.S.! The Robot Anti-Terror Squad.'''</blockquote>

R.A.T.S. toys were manufactured primarily in [[Thailand]] and [[Singapore]], though some were later produced in [[France]]. While only one wave of toys was publicized via the back of each toy's box or card, at least two releases exist that were not depicted in the initial wave, both of which were recolored Starriors toys. Due to the later manufacturer's reference numbers on their packaging, they may have been part of an unpublicized second (or supplementary) wave. There is at least one more possible release, a blue [[redeco]] of another Starriors figure, '''Bolar'''. This figure was pictured on the box of the rarely-seen Combat Command Centre (along with both Squad Reinforcement Personnel figures), but a physical sample has yet to surface.

A related, even ''more'' obscure toyline is known to exist, also called R.A.T.S., this time standing for '''Robot Anti-''Transformation'' Squad'''. This series was also produced by Tomy, but so far little is known about its countries of [[manufacture]] or [[Distribution (business)|distribution]]. Two toys are so far confirmed to have been released: a redeco of the first R.A.T.S. '''Grapplor''', and '''Badfoot''', a battery-powered, [[bipedal]] walking robot.
