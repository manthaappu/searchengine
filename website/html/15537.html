'''Google China''' ({{lang|zh|谷歌}}, [[pinyin]]: {{lang|pny|Gǔgē}}) is a subsidiary of [[Google, Inc.]], the world's largest Internet [[search engine]] company. Google China ranks as the number 2 search engine in the People's Republic of China, after [[Baidu]].

== History ==
Google China was founded in 2005 and was originally headed by [[Kai-Fu Lee]], a former [[Microsoft]] executive and the founder in 1998 of [[Microsoft Research Asia]].<ref name="kaifudeparture">{{cite news|last=Donnelly |first=Laura |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/6143553/China-Google-boss-departure-reignites-debate-over-censorship.html |title=China Google boss departure reignites debate over censorship |publisher=Telegraph |date=2009-09-05 |accessdate=2010-03-30 | location=London}}</ref>  Microsoft sued Google and Kai-Fu Lee for the move, but reached a confidential settlement.<ref>[http://news.com.com/2100-1014_3-6006342.html CNET News.com: Microsoft settles with Google over executive hire] (December 22, 2005)</ref> Google's Beijing based office was initially located at NCI Tower.   

In 2005, a Chinese-language interface was developed for the google.com website. In Jan 2006, Google launched its China-based google.cn search page with results subject to censorship by the Chinese government. 

The Beijing office was moved to [[Zhongguancun|Tsinghua Science Park]] in early 2006. The newest office has been in use since September 2006. It is a 10-floor building located in Tsinghua Science Park, near the south gate of [[Tsinghua University]].

In Mar 2009, [[China]] blocked access to [[Google]]'s [[YouTube]] site; access to other Google online services is denied to users on an ad hoc basis. 

On September 4, 2009, after four years leading Google China, Kai-Fu Lee announced his surprise departure to start a venture fund amid debate about the Chinese government's censorship policies and Google's decreasing share to rival [[Baidu]].<ref name="kaifudeparture" />  

In Jan 2010, Google announced that they and other US tech companies had been hacked and that Google is no longer willing to censor searches in China and may pull out of the country.<ref>{{Cite news   | last = Worthen

On March 23, 2010 at 3 am [[Hong Kong Time]] (UTC+8), Google started to redirect all search queries from Google.cn to Google.com.hk.

David Drummond, senior vice president of Google, stated in the official Google blog that the current circumstances surrounding [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|censorship]] of the Internet in [[Mainland China]] led Google to make such a decision. [[Hong Kong]] is a [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Region in China]] with a comparably higher level of [[freedom of speech]] and expression, and google.com.hk does not censor search results, making it more effective for networking and sharing information with Internet users in mainland China.<ref name=Drummond-update /><ref>[http://www.easyseosolution.com/blog/google-news/google-hk Google.cn has been redirected to google.com.hk], Easy SEO Solution</ref> Google's internet mail service, [[Gmail]], is available to mainland China users.

On March 30, 2010, searching via all Google search sites (not only google.cn but all language versions, e.g. google.co.jp. google.com.au, etc.), including Google Mobile, was banned in [[Mainland China]].

On June 30, 2010, Google ended the automatic redirect of Google China to Google Hong Kong, and instead placed a link to Google Hong Kong to avoid getting their Internet Content Provider (ICP) license revoked.

== Controversies ==
{{See also|Censorship by Google}}
Prior to Google China's establishment, Google.com itself was accessible, even though much of its content was not accessible due to [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|censorship]]. According to official statistics, google.com was accessible 90% of the time, and a number of services were not available at all.<ref>[http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/01/google-in-china.html Official Google Blog: Google in China], January 27, 2006</ref>

Since announcing its intent to comply with [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China#Search engines|Internet censorship laws in the People's Republic of China]], Google China had been the focus of controversy over what critics view as capitulation to the "[[Golden Shield Project]]". Due to its self-imposed censorship, whenever people searched for prohibited Chinese keywords on a blocked list maintained by the PRC government, google.cn displayed the following at the bottom of the page (translated): ''In accordance with local laws, regulations and policies, part of the search result is not shown.'' Some searches, such as (as of June 2009) "[[Tank Man]]" were blocked entirely, with only the message "Search results may not comply with the relevant laws, regulations and policy, and can not be displayed" appearing.

Google argued that it could play a role more useful to the cause of free speech by participating in China's IT industry than by refusing to comply and being denied admission to the mainland Chinese market. "While removing search results is inconsistent with Google's mission, providing no information (or a heavily degraded user experience that amounts to no information) is more inconsistent with our mission," a statement said.<ref>[[BBC News]]  "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4645596.stm Google censors itself for China]."   January 25, 2006</ref>

A [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] analysis reported clear differences between results returned for controversial keywords by the censored and uncensored search engines.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tankman/internet/sidebyside.html FRONTLINE: the tank man: A Sampling of What's Censored/Filtered] [[PBS]]</ref> Google set up computer systems inside China that try to access Web sites outside the country.

In June 2006, [[Sergey Brin]], Google's co-founder, was quoted as saying virtually all of Google's customers in China were using the non-censored version of their website.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2006-06-06-google-china_x.htm|title=Google compromised its principles in China, founder says|last=Bridis|first=Ted|date=June 6, 2006|work=USA Today|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=February 7, 2010}}</ref>

On April 9, 2007, Google China spokesman Cui Jin admitted that the [[pinyin]] Google [[Input Method Editor]] (IME) "was built leveraging some non-Google database resources". This was in response to a request on April 6 from the Chinese search engine company [[Sohu]] that Google stop distributing its pinyin IME software because it allegedly copied portions from Sohu's own software.<ref>{{cite news| first=Sumner |last=Lemon |title=Rival Asks Google to Yank 'Copycat' Application |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,130497-c,google/article.html |work=PC

=== Operation Aurora ===
{{Main|Operation Aurora}}
On January 12, 2010, Google announced that it was "no longer willing to continue censoring" results on Google.cn, citing a breach of [[Gmail]] accounts of [[Human rights in the People's Republic of China|Chinese human rights]] activists. The company found that the [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] had breached two Gmail accounts but were only able to access 'from' and 'to' information and subject headers of emails in these accounts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://video.nytimes.com/video/2010/01/12/business/1247466517265/google-may-close-operations-in-china.html|title=CNBC Video: Interview With Google's Chief Legal Officer | work=The New York Times | accessdate=2010-04-09}}</ref> The company's investigation into the attack showed that at least 34 other companies had been similarly targeted. Among the companies that were attacked were [[Adobe Systems]], [[Symantec]], [[Yahoo]], [[Northrop Grumman]] and [[Dow Chemical]]. Experts claim the aim of the attacks was to gain information on weapon systems, political dissidents, and valuable source code that powers software applications.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/13/AR2010011300359.html |title=Google China cyberattack part of vast espionage campaign, experts say |publisher=washingtonpost.com |accessdate=2010-03-30 | date=2010-01-14}}</ref> Additionally, dozens of Gmail accounts in China, Europe, and the United States had been regularly accessed by third parties, due to [[phishing]] or [[malware]] on the users' computers rather than a security breach at Google. Although Google did not explicitly accuse the Chinese government of the breach, it said it was no longer willing to censor results on google.cn, and that it will discuss over the next few weeks "the basis on which we could run an unfiltered search engine within the law, if at all. We recognize that this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn, and potentially our offices in China."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html|title=Official Google Blog: A new approach to China|publisher=[[Google]]|date=12 January 2010|accessdate=12 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8455712.stm|title=Google 'may end China operations over Gmail breaches'|publisher=BBC|date=12 January 2010|Google 'may pull out of China after Gmail cyber attack'|accessdate=12 January 2010}}</ref> Google.cn transiently turned off its search result filtering. However, the filtering was later re-enabled without any acknowledgment or explanation; search queries in Chinese on the keywords [[Tiananmen]] or [[June 4, 1989]] returned censored results with the standard censorship footnote.<ref>[http://www.google.cn/search?hl=zh-CN&q=%E5%85%AD%E5%9B%9B a Google.CN search]</ref>

On January 13, 2010, the news agency [[All Headline News|AHN]] reported that the [[U.S. Congress]] plans to investigate Google's allegations that the Chinese government used the company's service to spy on human rights activists.<ref>{{cite web|url=

The Chinese government has since made numerous standard and general statements on the matter, but has taken no real actions. It also criticized Google for failing to provide any evidence of its accusation.<ref>{{cite web|url=

Baidu is the market leader in China with about 60% of the market share compared to Google's 31%, Yahoo placing third with less than 10%.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8455712.stm|title=Google 'may pull out of China after Gmail cyber attack'|date=13 January 2010 | work=BBC News}}</ref> [[China Daily]] published a scathing [[op-ed]] on Google which criticized western leaders for politicizing the way in which China controls citizen's access to the Internet, saying "implementing monitoring according to a country's national context is what any government has to do," and that China's need to censor the internet is greater than that of [[developed countries]], "The Chinese society has generally less information bearing capacity than developed countries such as the U.S. ..."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90780/91344/6873383.html |title=Google, do not take Chinese netizens hostage |work=[[People's Daily]], January 19, 2010}}</ref>

The Chinese authority is accused of steering state-run media to bundle Google together with other recent disputes with United States that have stirred nationalist rancour in China. On the website of the Global Times (www.huanqiu.com) such examples are found, one user wrote "''Get the hell out''" while another one wrote "''Ha ha, I'm going to buy firecrackers to celebrate!''".<ref name="reuters" />

According to [[Isaac Mao]], a high profile Chinese Internet expert, maybe 90% of [[Internet in the People's Republic of China|Internet users in China]] don't care whether Google leaves or not. For Chinese users who strongly support Google's stay in China without censorship (or leaving China to keep its neutrality and independence), some are accustomed to use [[Bypass (computing)|circumvention technology]] to access blocked websites.<ref>{{Cite news
