<html> <head> <title>Neuroeconomics</title></head><body>'''Neuroeconomics''' is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to explain human [[decision making]], the ability to process multiple alternatives and to choose an optimal course of action. It studies how economic behavior can shape our understanding of the brain, and how neuroscientific discoveries can constrain and guide models of economics.<ref name="neuroeconomics.duke.edu">Center for Neuroeconomics Study at Duke University http://neuroeconomics.duke.edu/research/research2.html</ref> It combines research methods from [[neuroscience]], [[Experimental economics|experimental]] and [[behavioral economics]], and [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]] and [[Social psychology (psychology)|social]] psychology. As research into decision-making behavior becomes increasingly computational, it has also incorporated new approaches from [[theoretical biology]], [[computer science]], and [[mathematics]]. Neuroeconomics studies decision making by using a combination of tools from these fields to avoid the shortcoming that arise from a single perspective approach. In [[mainstream economics]], expected utility (EU), and the concept of [[rational agents]] are still being used. Many economic behaviors are not fully explained by these models such as [[heuristics]] and [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]].<ref name="annualreviews.org">Loewenstein,G.,  Rick,S., & Cohen, J.

Neuroeconomics adds another layer by using neuroscienific methods in understanding the interplay between economic behavior and neural mechanisms. By using tools from various fields, neuroeconomics offers a more integrative way of understanding decision making.<ref>Center for Neuroeconomics Study at Duke University  http://neuroeconomics.duke.edu/research/research2.html</ref>

== Major research areas in neuroeconomics ==
=== Decision making under risk and uncertainty ===
Most of our decisions are made under some conditions of [[risk]]. Decision sciences such as psychology and economics usually define risk as the uncertainty about several possible outcomes  when the probability of each is known.<ref>Mohr, M.,Biele, G.,& Hauke, R. (2010). Neural Processing of Risk. e Journal of Neuroscience, May 12, 2010, 30(19):6613-6619. Retrieved from: http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/30/19/6613</ref> [[Utility maximization]], first proposed by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738, is used to explain decision making under risk. The theory assumes that humans are [[Rational choice theory|rational]] and will assess options based on the expected utility they will gain from each.<ref name="annualreviews.org"/> Research and experience uncovered a wide range of expected utility anomalies and common patterns of behavior that are inconsistent with the principle of utility maximization. For example, the human tendency to be risk-averse or risk-seeking. Also, the tendency to overweight small probabilities and underweight large ones. [[Kahneman]] and [[Tversky]] proposed the [[prospect theory]] to encompass these observations and offers an alternative model.<ref name="annualreviews.org"/> Risk preference is a central concept in decision sciences, and a useful way for exploring decision making under risk and uncertainty. Neurons participating in the decision process are sensitive to subjective risk preferences, even when available options have the same objective value. Studying this can help in dissociating the subjective value that people assign to uncertain risky events from the objective value. The neural mechanisms underlying the concept of risk preference are not fully examined.<ref name="neuroeconomics.duke.edu"/> This issue is the main goal of this line of research in neuroeconomics which uses [[neuroimaging]] technique to identify regions of the brain implicated in decision making under risk and uncertainty. The [[insular cortex]] has been shown to activate in decisions involving high risk and uncertainty.<ref>Paulus, M., Rogalsky,C., Simmons, A., Feinstein, J., & Stein, M. (21 April 2003). Increased activation in the right insula during risk-taking decision making is related to harm avoidance and neuroticism. NeuroImage 19,1439–1448.</ref> Other areas such as the  [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]],<ref>Clark,L. , Bechara, A., Damasio, H., Aitken, M., Sahakian, B., & Robbins, T. (April 3, 2008).Differential effects of insular and ventromedial prefrontal cortex lesions on risky decision-making. BRAIN, 131 (5). Retrieved from: http://0-brain.oxfordjournals.org.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/content/131/5/1311.full</ref> and [[Inferior frontal gyrus|the inferior frontal gyrus]]<ref>Cox, C., Gotimer, K., Roy, A., Castellanos, X., Milham, M., & Kelly, C. (August 19, 2010). Your Resting Brain CAREs about Your Risky Behavior. PLoS ONE, 5(8). Retrieved from http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0012296</ref> have also been shown to activate when engaging in decisions that involve risk.

=== Intertemporal choice ===
In addition to risk preference, another central concept in economics is [[intertemporal choice]]s which are decisions that involve costs and benefits that are distributed over time. Intertemporal choice research studies the expected utility that humans assign to events occurring at different times. The dominant model in economics which explains it is [[discounted utility]] (DU). DU assumes that humans have consistent time preference and will assign value to events regardless of when they occur.  Similar to  EU in explaining risky decision making, DU is inadequate in explaining intertemporal choice.<ref name="annualreviews.org"/> For example, DU assumes that people will value a bar of candy today more than 2 bars tomorrow, and they will also value 1 bar received 100 days from now more than 2 bars received after 101 days. There is strong evidence against this last part in both humans and animals, and [[hyperbolic discounting]] has been proposed as an alternative model. Under this model, valuations fall very rapidly for small delay periods, but then fall slowly for longer delay periods. This better explains why most people who would choose 1 candy bar now over 2 candy bars tomorrow, would, in fact, choose 2 candy bars received after 101 days rather than the 1 candy bar received after 100 days which EU assumes.<ref name="annualreviews.org"/> Neuroeconomic research on intertemporal choice focuses on whether this behavior can be better explained by the interaction of multiple systems. The central debate is on the role of the [[limbic system]] in intertemporal choice. The limbic system refers to the medial and orbital regions of frontal cortex, the amygdala, the insular cortex, and their subcortical counterparts, and is thought to be critical to emotional processing. Evidence has been found to support the response of these structures to both immediate and delayed rewards .<ref name="annualreviews.org"/> The extent to which intertemporal choice is generated by multiple systems, such as the limbic system, with conflicting priorities is a debated issue within neuroeconomics, and remains an area of active research.<ref name="annualreviews.org"/>

=== Social decision making ===
Social situations offer a useful way for understanding more complex forms of decisions, which may better approximate many of our real-life choices.<ref name="sciencemag.org">Sanfey,A. (2007).  Social Decision-Making: Insights from Game Theory and Neuroscience. Science , 318, 5850. Retrieved from: http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/318/5850/598</ref> The research on social decision making in neuroeconomics aims to answer the question of what does our brains choose to focus on when faced with a social situation. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying social decision making is the central focus of this line of research.<ref name="neuroeconomics.duke.edu"/>  Neuroeconomics uses various tools in examining social decision making. From economics, it uses the models and tasks of [[game theory]] which attempts to mathematically capture behavior in strategic situations in which an individual's success in making choices depends on the choices of others. Psychological findings and tools from cognitive psychology and social psychology are also used. Finally, imaging techniques from neuroscience are used to observe neural activity in different brain structures.  By integrating various tools and fields, theoretical models of how we make decisions in a rich, interactive environment can be advanced.<ref name="sciencemag.org"/>

==Methodology==
[[Behavioral economics]] experiments record the subject's decision over various design parameters and use the data to generate formal models that predict performance. Neuroeconomics extends this approach by adding observation of the nervous system to the set of explanatory variables. The goal of neuroeconomics is to inform the creation and contribute another layer of data to the testable hypotheses of these models{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}.

===Neural recording techniques===
In neuroeconomic experiments, brain scans can be performed using [[fMRI]], [[Positron Emission Tomography|PET]] or other [[functional neuroimaging]] tools in order to compare the roles of the different brain areas that contribute to economic decision-making.<ref name="pmid16216680">{{cite journal

}}</ref>  Other experiments measure ERP ([[event-related potential]]s, or use [[Electroencephalography|EEG]]) and MEG ([[magnetoencephalograms]]) to measure the timecourses of different brain events.<ref name="pmid16216680"/> Direct recordings of neuronal activity and [[neurotransmitter]] concentrations in monkeys and in humans can also be carried out.

In addition, knowledge of brain activity can invite causal experiments in which choices are actually influenced by exogeneous causal manipulations. (This is important from the point of view of standard economic theory, because in standard theory choices only change when preferences, income, prices, or information change; so any other variable which influences choice must be interpreted in those terms.) For example, TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation), lesions to brain areas ("the lesion method"), pharmacological interventions, and simpler exogeneous variations like cognitive load and priming can all potentially influence choices.

==Experiments==
In a typical behavioral economics experiment, a subject is asked to make a series of economic decisions.  For example, a subject may be asked whether they prefer to have 45 cents or a gamble with a 50% chance of one dollar and 50% chance of nothing.  The experimenter will then measure different variables in order to determine what is going on in the subject's brain as they make the decision.
Some authors have demonstrated that Neuroeconomics' tools may be useful not only to describe experiments involving rewarding but may also be applied in order to describe the psychological behavior of common psychiatric syndromes involving addiction as well as delusion.

==Neuroeconomic Programs==
Neuroeconomics has developed into an up and coming field in graduate studies. Several universities are conducting direct research on the field, such as New York University, Duke University, and George Mason University.<ref>[https://files.nyu.edu/avs265/public/whatisneuroeconomics.html  Neuroeconomics]</ref> Furthermore, some programs actually offer a degree in Neuroeconomics. Claremont Graduate University is the first institution to offer a PhD in Neuroeconomics; it is ranked as one of the best Neuroeconomics institutes in the United States.<ref>[https://files.nyu.edu/avs265/public/reviewofneuroeconomicprograms.html Here is a Review of Neuroeconomic Programs in the United States]</ref> Caltech now (c 2007) has a Behavioral and Social Neuroscience (BSN) PhD in either CNS or HSS,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/ss/postdocs |title=Caltech: Humanities and Social Sciences |publisher=Hss.caltech.edu |date=2010-01-29 |accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref>  mixing economic theory, neurobiology, computational neuroscience,dynamic causal modeling and neuroscientific techniques. It is also an active research center.

==Criticism==
Different experts have criticized the emerging field. Example of critics have been that it is "a field that oversells itself";<ref name="isbn0-521-87153-0">{{cite book
