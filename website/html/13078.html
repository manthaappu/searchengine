The '''FISH (FIbonacci SHrinking)''' [[stream cipher]] is a fast [[software]] based stream cipher using [[Lagged Fibonacci generator]]s, plus a concept from the [[shrinking generator]] cipher. It was published by [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] in 1993. FISH is quite fast in software and has a huge [[key length]]. However, in the same paper where he proposed [[Pike (cipher)|Pike]], [[Ross J. Anderson|Ross Anderson]] showed that FISH can be broken with just a few thousand [[bit]]s of known [[plaintext]].
