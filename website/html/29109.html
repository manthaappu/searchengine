The ''Phoenix Engine'' is a [[game engine]] developed by [[Relic Entertainment]]. This engine will be used for their upcoming game, ''[[Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine]]''. <ref>http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/warhammer-40-000-space-marine-preview?page=1</ref>

The ''Phoenix Engine'' is also the name of a [[game engine]] developed by [[Wolfire]] for their upcoming game [[Overgrowth]]. Although Wolfire coined the term "Phoenix Engine" in 2006, well before Relic Entertainment began development on their own Phoenix Engine, they never got the name trademarked; thus, there are no technical legal conflicts as of yet between the two studios concerning the name of the engine. <ref>http://blog.wolfire.com/2006/06/lugaru-2-movement/</ref>
