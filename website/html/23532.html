<html> <head> <title>Markov algorithm</title></head><body>A '''[[Andrey Markov (Soviet mathematician)|Markov]] algorithm''' is a [[string rewriting system]] that uses [[Formal grammar|grammar]]-like rules to operate on [[string (computer science)|strings]] of symbols. Markov algorithms have been shown to be [[Turing-complete]], which means that they are suitable as a general model of [[computation]] and can represent any [[mathematical expression]] from its simple notation.

[[Refal]] is a [[programming language]] based on '''Markov algorithm'''.

==Algorithm==

The ''Rules'' is a sequence of pair of strings, usually presented in the form of ''pattern'' &rarr; ''replacement''. Some rules may be terminating.

Given an ''input'' string: 

#Check the Rules in order from top to bottom to see whether any of the ''patterns'' can be found in the ''input'' string.
#If none is found, the algorithm stops.
#If one (or more) is found, use '''the first''' of them to replace the leftmost matching text in the ''input'' string with its ''replacement''.
#If the applied rule was a terminating one, the algorithm stops.
#Return to step 1 and carry on.

==Example==
The following example shows the basic operation of a Markov algorithm.

===Rules===
#"A" -> "apple"
#"B" -> "bag"
#"S" -> "shop"
#"T" -> "the"
#"the shop" -> "my brother"
#"a never used" -> '''.'''"terminating rule"

===Symbol string===
"I bought a B of As from T S."

===Execution===
If the algorithm is applied to the above example, the Symbol string will change in the following manner.

#"I bought a B of apples from T S."
#"I bought a bag of apples from T S."
#"I bought a bag of apples from T shop."
#"I bought a bag of apples from the shop."
#"I bought a bag of apples from my brother."

The algorithm will then terminate.

==Another Example==

These rules give a more interesting example. They rewrite binary numbers to their unary counterparts. For example: 101 will be rewritten to a string of 5 consecutive bars.

===Rules===
#"|0" -> "0||"
#"1" -> "0|"
#"0" -> ""

===Symbol string===
"101"

===Execution===
If the algorithm is applied to the above example, it will terminate after the following steps.

#"0|01"
#"00||1"
#"00||0|"
#"00|0|||"
#"000|||||"
#"00|||||"
#"0|||||"
#"|||||"
