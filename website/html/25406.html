'''MultiTail''' is a program for monitoring multiple log files,<ref>[http://www.vanheusden.com/multitail/ MultiTail<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in the fashion of the original [[tail (Unix)|tail]] program. The original tail presents the last few lines of a single log file, optionally providing a real-time display of the growing file.
 
MultiTail started as an attempt to provide a program which would display two log files in a split screen. Originally it was a copy of wtail.<ref>[http://www.teaser.fr/~amajorel/wtail/ Index of /~amajorel/wtail<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The difference was that wtail started reading at the start of the file by itself while MultiTail invoked one or more tail processes which only display the last few lines.

MultiTail splits the terminal window or the console of a [[Unix]] system into two or more subwindows into which it can merge log files and command outputs. It can also display (like the original tail) in a single window.

Capabilities include:
* Monitoring of wildcards: if another file matching the wildcard has a more recent modification date, it will automatically switch to that file. This allows monitoring a complete directory of files
* Merging of two or more input sources
* Use of colors when displaying the log files (through [[regular expressions]]), to distinguish important information.
* Filtering of lines (through regular expressions) 
* Interactive menus for editing regular expressions and for deleting and adding windows. 
* Use the output of [[shell scripts]] and other software.
* Mimicking the functionality of tools such as [[Watch (Unix)|watch]] when viewing the output of external software.

Platforms: 
* Multitail runs on all major [[Unix]] platforms ([[IBM AIX (operating system)|AIX]], [[Berkeley Software Distribution#Significant BSD descendants|*BSD]], [[HP-UX]], [[IRIX]], [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], [[SCO OpenServer]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[Tru64]]) and also on [[Cygwin]] 1.5.19-4; Cygwin allows running Unix programs on [[Microsoft Windows]].
