'''Infinity Engine''' is a [[game engine]] which allows the creation of [[Isometric projection|isometric]] [[computer role-playing game]]s. It was originally developed by [[BioWare]] for a prototype [[Real-time strategy|RTS]] game codenamed ''Battleground Infinity'', which was ultimately re-engineered to become the first installment of the [[Baldur's Gate series|''Baldur's Gate'' series]]. BioWare used it again in the subsequent installments of the series, but also licensed the engine to [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]]'s [[Black Isle Studios]].

''Infinity Engine'' features [[Time-keeping systems in games#Pausable real-time|pausable realtime]] gameplay. The engine uses a [[Video games with isometric graphics|three quarters perspective]] with [[pre-rendered]] [[2D computer graphics|2D backgrounds]] and [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]-based characters. Although graphically 2D for the most part, [[Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn|Baldur's Gate II]] added the use of [[OpenGL]] to accelerate drawing. Designed for six-character [[Party (role playing games)|party-based]] adventuring by default, the Infinity Engine was the [[spiritual successor]] to the [[Gold Box]] Engine,{{Fact|date=February 2008}} and provided the basis for five ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' licensed computer role-playing games plus additional [[expansion pack]]s and a number of fanmade [[Mod (computer gaming)#Total conversion|total conversion]] RPGs. It was succeeded by BioWare's [[Aurora Engine]]. 

A [[free software|free]] compatible [[game engine recreation]] is in development under the name of [[GemRB]]. It runs on multiple platforms, including [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[AmigaOS 4]].<ref>{{citeweb
