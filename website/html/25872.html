<html> <head> <title>National Microbial Pathogen Data Resource</title></head><body>{{primarysources|date=December 2008}} The [http://www.nmpdr.org National Microbial Pathogen Data Resource] was one of the eight [[Bioinformatics Resource Centers]] funded by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, [[NIAID]] a component of the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), which is an agency of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]].  
The NMPDR was funded for five years from 2004 through a grant to co-PI's [[Rick Stevens]] from the Computation Institute at the University of Chicago, and [[Ross Overbeek]] at the [http://www.thefig.info Fellowship for the Interpretation of Genomes].

The NMPDR was initially tasked with annotating and curating the genomes of five pathogenic [[species]] of [[Bacteria]], ([[Campylobacter]], [[Listeria]], [[Staphylococcus]], [[Streptococcus]], and [[Vibrio]]). However, after four years, the team were asked to also oversee the curation and annotation of the genomes of seven additional bacterial species ([[Chlamydia (bacterium)|Chlamydia]], [[Chlamydophila]], [[Haemophilus]], [[Mycoplasma]], [[Neisseria]],  [[Treponema]], and [[Ureaplasma]]).

The flagship website, the [http://www.nmpdr.org National Microbial Pathogen Data Resource] provides curated annotations in an environment for comparative analysis of genomes and biological subsystems.

In addition, the NMPDR team have also developed the [http://rast.nmpdr.org Rapid Annotation using Subsystems Technology Server] (RAST) for annotating and curating complete microbial genomes and the [http://metagenomics.nmpdr.org Metagenomics RAST] for annotating metagenomes.

==Note to NMPDR Users==
As of January 2010, the bacterial organism originally covered by NMPDR under the BRC program have been transferred to [[PATRIC]] the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center.
