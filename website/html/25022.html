A '''Monochrome bitmap''' is black and white bitmap file. A monochrome bitmap is a rectangular grid of pixels, but each pixel is represented by a single bit. Eight pixels are in each byte of the bitmap. Monochrome bitmaps are often used for bitmapped text or single-colored images.<ref>[http://fastgraph.com/help/monochrome_bitmaps.html fastgraph.com/help/monochrome_bitmaps.html]</ref>
