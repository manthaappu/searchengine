<html> <head> <title>Common Content</title></head><body>The '''Common Content''' project attempts to gather links to as much [[open content]] as possible under the [[Creative Commons]] [[parametric license]] regime.  This includes both [[Share Alike]] and "NoDerivs" content, under both commercial and "no commercial use" terms, and so is not [[open source]] by the usual definitions.

There is an effort to build an effective interface to this content at [http://wiki.creativecommons.org/ the Creative Commons wiki] which is a [[mediawiki-based service]].
