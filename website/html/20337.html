<html> <head> <title>KDrive</title></head><body>'''KDrive''' (or '''freedesktop.org Xserver''' or just '''Xserver''') is a small [[X Window System]] server implementation created by [[Keith Packard]]. Unlike the [[X.Org Server]], KDrive was not based on [[XFree86]] code. It was used by X.Org developers as a testing ground for new ideas, such as [[EXA]].

It practically superseded [[SmallX]] (also known as TinyX) and is commonly used in [[embedded system]]s with the need for a very thin X server.

A specific feature of KDrive was that it was configured at compile-time, not at run-time. It was often compiled to use the native [[Linux framebuffer]] device as output.

As of X.Org Server version 7.1, the KDrive framework was integrated into the reference implementation and is now part of the generic source code release of the server.
