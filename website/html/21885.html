'''List''' is the northernmost municipality in [[Germany]], located on the North Sea island of [[Sylt]] close to [[Denmark]] in the district of [[Nordfriesland]] in the state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]].

List was originally a Danish settlement, consisting of two farms. List was part of the royal enclaves, which were small areas of the Kingdom of Denmark situated within the duchy of [[Schleswig]], the latter also being governed by the Danish king. After the Danish-German war of 1864, List came to Prussia. The plebiscite of 1920 drew the border just north of List, with the next island (Rømø) being returned to Denmark. After World War I List was turned into a major navy point. Many buildings were built during the Nazi period. Since the 1950s, List's economy is heavily based on the tourist industry.

There is a ferry from List to the Danish island of [[Rømø]]. One single road leads south to the island's main town of [[Westerland, Germany|Westerland]]. List is surrounded by dunes and [[moorland]] and, as the rest of the island, has fine beaches.
