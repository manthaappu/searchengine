''''''Self-concept'''''' (also called '''self-construction''' or '''self-perspective''') is a multi-dimensional construct that refers to an individual's perception of "self" in relation to any number of characteristics, such as academics (and nonacademics),<ref>Bong, M., & Clark, R.

While closely related with [[self-concept clarity]] (which "refers to the extent to which [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]] is clearly and confidently defined, internally consistent, and temporally stable"),<ref>Ayduk, Ozlem, Anett Gyurak, and Anna Luerssen.

It is also more general than [[self-esteem]], which is the purely evaluative element of the self-concept.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.46.2.404 | last1 = Fleming | first1 = J.

The self-concept is composed of self-assessments {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} regarding attributes such as [[Personality psychology|personality]], skills and abilities, occupation(s) and hobbies, and physical characteristics. For example, the statement "I am lazy" is a self-assessment that contributes to the self-concept. In contrast, the statement "I am tired" would not normally be considered part of someone's self-concept, since being tired is a temporary state (and moreover one not reflecting the element of subjective judgement involved in the assessment of perceived laziness). A person's self-concept may change with time, possibly going through turbulent periods of [[identity crisis (psychology)|identity crisis]] and reassessment.

The self-concept is not restricted to the present. It includes past selves and future selves. Future selves or "possible selves" represent individuals' ideas of what they might become, what they would like to become, and what they are afraid of becoming. They correspond to hopes, fears, standards, goals, and threats. Possible selves may function as incentives for future behavior and they also provide an evaluative and interpretive context for the current view of self.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.41.9.954 | last1 = Markus | first1 = H. | last2 = Nurius | first2 = P. | year = 1986 | title = Possible selves | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 954–969 }}</ref>

The psychologists who paved the way for this concept were Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow. Rogers had the idea that everyone is seeking out a positive self-concept. He said that everyone is trying to get from their real self to their ideal self, and the closer someone is to that ideal self the happier that person will be. Rogers also said that one factor in whether or not someone will be happy is the amount of unconditioned positive regard someone gets, or UPR. An example of UPR would possibly be a parent or guardian of a child taking care of them no matter what.<ref> Kass, Michael (1994).

In [[philosophy]], there is the concept of the ipse identity ("who am I?") as introduced by [[Paul Ricoeur]].<ref>{{cite book
