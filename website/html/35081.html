A ''Soma File'' is a  proprietary [[XML]] based language that is used to describe a memory model.
Soma Files include parameters that configure the timing and protocol requirements for a memory model as specified by the memory vendor.  This file format was create by [[Denali Software]]<ref>[https://www.denali.com/en/ememory Soma File]</ref>. This file is typically encrypted.

Soma files are read into a proprietary memory modeling object, called a MMAV, that is used to
in a [[ASIC]] simulation environment.  This allows the simulation to modeling any type of memory provided a corresponding SOMA file exists.<ref>[https://www.denali.com/en/products/mmav.jsp MMAV]</ref>

In contrast to soma, memory models are typically provided in non-proprietary [[verilog]] format from the memory vendors, eg. [http://download.micron.com/downloads/models/verilog/sdram/ddr/256meg/256Mb_ddr.zip micron memory models], and are readily downloadable from the memory vendor's webpage.
