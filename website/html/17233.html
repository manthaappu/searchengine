<html> <head> <title>I/O bound</title></head><body>In [[computer science]], '''I/O bound''' refers to a condition in which the time it takes to complete a [[computation]] is determined principally by the period of time spent waiting for [[input/output]] operations to be completed. This is the opposite of a task being [[CPU bound]]. This circumstance arises when the rate at which [[data]] is requested is slower than the rate it is consumed or, in other words, more time is spent requesting data than processing it.

==I/O bound as an inherent problem in computing==

The I/O bound state has been identified as a problem in computing almost since its inception. The [[Von Neumann architecture]], which is employed by many computing devices ever conceived, is based on a logically-separate [[central processor unit]] which requests data from [[main memory]],{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} <!-- main memory access is not I/O access! --> processes it and writes back the results. Since data must be moved between the CPU and memory along a [[Bus (computing)|bus]] which has a limited [[data transfer rate]], there exists a condition that is known as the [[Von Neumann architecture#von Neumann bottleneck|Von Neumann bottleneck]]. Put simply, this means that the data [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] between the CPU and memory tends to limit the overall speed of computation. In terms of the actual technology that makes up a computer, the Von Neumann Bottleneck predicts that it is easier to make the CPU perform calculations faster than it is to supply it with data at the necessary rate for this to be possible.

In recent history, the Von Neumann bottleneck has become more apparent. The design philosophy of modern computers is based upon a physically-separate CPU and main memory. It is possible to make the CPU run at a high data transfer rate because data is moved between locations inside them across tiny distances. The physical separation between CPU and main memory, however, requires a data bus to move data across
comparatively long distances of centimetres or more. The problem of making this part of the system operate sufficiently fast to keep up with the CPU has been a great challenge to designers.

==I/O bound as a practical problem==

The I/O bound state is considered undesirable because it means that the [[central processing unit|CPU]] must stall its operation while waiting for data to be loaded or unloaded from [[main memory]] or [[secondary storage]]. With faster computation speed being the primary goal of new computer designs and components such as the CPU and memory being expensive, there is a strong imperative to avoid I/O bound states and eliminating them can yield a more economic improvement in performance than upgrading the CPU or memory.
