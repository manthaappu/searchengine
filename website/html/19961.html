'''Joe-E''' is a subset of the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programming language intended to support programming according to [[object-capability model|object-capability discipline]].<ref>[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/papers/joe-e-ndss10.pdf Joe-E: A Security-Oriented Subset of Java], Adrian Mettler, David Wagner, and Tyler Close; January 2010.</ref>

The language is notable for being an early object-capability subset language.  It has influenced later subset languages, such as ADsafe and [[Caja project|Caja/Cajita]], subsets of Javascript.

It is also notable for allowing methods to be verified as [[pure function|functionally pure]], based on their method signatures.<ref>[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/papers/pure-ccs08.pdf Verifiable Functional Purity in Java], Matthew Finifter, Adrian Mettler, Naveen Sastry, David Wagner; October 2008, Conference on Computer and Communications Security.</ref>

The restrictions imposed by the Joe-E verifier include:
* Classes may not have mutable static fields, because these create global state.
* Catching out-of-memory exceptions is prohibited, because doing so allows non-deterministic execution.  For the same reason, <tt>finally</tt> clauses are not allowed.
* Methods in the standard library may be blocked if they are deemed unsafe according to taming rules.  For example, the constructor <tt>new File(filename)</tt> is blocked because it allows unrestricted access to the filesystem.

[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cup_of_joe Cup of Joe] is slang for coffee, and so serves as a trademark-avoiding reference to Java. Thus, the name Joe-E is intended to suggest an adaptation of ideas from the [[E (programming language)|E programming language]] to create a variant of the Java language. 

[http://waterken.sourceforge.net/ Waterken Server] is written in Joe-E.
