<html> <head> <title>HP Time-Shared BASIC</title></head><body>'''HP Time-Shared BASIC''' ('''HP TSB''') was a [[computer]] system sold by the [[Hewlett-Packard|Hewlett-Packard Corporation]] in the late 1960s and 1970s based on their [[HP 2100]] line of [[minicomputer]]s. The system implemented a dialect of the [[BASIC programming language]] and a rudimentary user account and program library system.  The software run on the system was also known by its versioned name such as '''HP 2000C Time-Shared BASIC''' and the operating system came in different varieties &mdash; 2000A, 2000B, 2000C, High-Speed 2000C, 2000E, 2000F, and 2000/Access.

Except for the 2000A and 2000E systems, the system was implemented using a dual-[[Central processing unit|processor]] [[Computer architecture|architecture]]. One fully-configured HP 2100 processor was used for execution of most of the system code and all of the user code and a second, smaller HP 2100 processor was used to handle the [[RS-232]] serial lines through which the time-sharing users connected. Depending on the hardware configuration, the system supported between 16 and 32 simultaneous remote users with the possibility of hundreds of user accounts. The usual terminal for a TSB system was an ASR-33 [[Teletype]] connected directly to the I/O processor or through a [[modem]] or [[acoustic coupler]].   Account names were a combination of one alphabetic character followed by three decimal digits, ''e.g.'', B001.  Privileged accounts started with the letter "A" and had some additional command and program storage capabilities.  [[Superuser]] accounts began with the "@" character, ''e.g.'', @004.

During execution, user programs were swapped to fixed-head [[magnetic drum]] storage. When not executing, user programs were stored on moving-head cartridge- or pack-loaded [[disk storage]]. Privileged users could also store programs on the much-faster drum. Backup was to [[magnetic tape]].

The language was a fairly standard implementation of BASIC, providing an integrated editing and runtime environment. Statements were analyzed for correct syntax as they were entered and then stored in semi-compiled form.  Each BASIC statement had to be on a uniquely numbered line, eg: 10 PRINT "HELLO WORLD" and could only contain one statement, although multiple variable assignments were allowed, ''e.g.'', 20 LET A=B=C=42

The language supported:
* Unconditional program flow-control via [[GOTO]] statements, and [[Subroutine]]s via the [[GOSUB]] and [[Return statement|RETURN]] statements
* Conditional flow-control via IF/THEN statement and simple variable-based block loop [[For loop|FOR]] and NEXT statements
* Calculated flow-control via the GOTO/OF statement
* Numeric variables of the form "A" or "An" (where A is a single letter and n a single, optional digit) stored as 4-byte [[floating-point]] numbers.
* [[String (computer science)|String]] variables of the form "A$" or "A0$" or "A1$". Strings could store up to 255 characters<!-- Got to go check this! -->
* One- or two-dimensional [[Array data structure|matrix]] (array) variables of the form "A[x,y]" or "An[x,y]"
* Matrix operations
* Logical operators
* Simple built-in mathematical functions including trigonometric (SIN,COS,TAN), logarithms (LOG, EXP), square root (SQR), and random number generator (RND) 
* [[Computer file|File]] operations
* [[Punched tape]] operations using a Teletype

Substrings within strings were accessed using a substring notation: "A$[L,R]" where L specified the leftmost byte to be accessed and R specified the rightmost byte to be accessed. This is in sharp contrast to some other BASICs that use functions such as LEFT$(), MID$(), and RIGHT$() to access substrings, although ANSI BASIC continues to use a similar substring syntax to that introduced by Hewlett-Packard.
