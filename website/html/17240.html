The '''IA-32 Execution Layer''' (IA-32 EL) is a software [[emulator]] in the form of a [[software driver]] that improves performance of [[32-bit]] applications running on [[64-bit]] [[Intel]] [[Itanium]]-based systems, particularly those running Linux and Windows Server 2003 (it is included in Windows 2003 SP1 and later<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/64bit/ipf/ia32el.mspx The IA-32 Execution Layer 4.3 Software Driver] (microsoft.com)</ref> and in most [[Linux distribution]]s for Itanium). The IA-32 EL bypasses the slow x86 hardware emulation which is available on pre-Montecito Itanium models.

Part of the software is under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]] and part is under an Intel proprietary license.<ref>[http://www.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/219740.htm Intel Software Development Products] (download page)</ref>
