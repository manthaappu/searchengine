An extract of RFC 1087 follows:

:''The IAB strongly endorses the view of the Division Advisory Panel of the [[National Science Foundation]] Division of Network, Communications Research and Infrastructure which, in paraphrase, characterized as unethical and unacceptable any activity which purposely:''

:* ''Seeks to gain unauthorized access to the resources of the [[Internet]].''
:* ''Disrupts the intended use of the Internet.''
:* ''Wastes resources (people, capacity, computer) through such actions.''
:* ''Destroys the integrity of computer-based information.''
:* ''[[Compromise]]s the privacy of users.''
