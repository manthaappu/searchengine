Kirby''' is a British [[computational linguist]], currently holding the Chair of Language Evolution at the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he is Director of the Graduate School, and Programme Director for the MSc in the Evolution of Language and Cognition. He specializes in [[evolutionary]] computational models of human [[language]] and its development.

He is a creator, together with members of the experimental pop band [[Found|FOUND]], of [[Cybraphon]], an "autonomous emotional robot band" in a wardrobe,<ref>{{Cite web
