It chronicles a year in the laboratories of two prominent cancer biologists during a period where there was a race to discover and characterize some of the first cancer-causing and cancer-suppressing genes.

==Overview==
It chronicles the time, about a year, that she spent in the labs of two very prominent cancer biologists, [[Robert Weinberg]] and Michael Wigler, during a period where there was a race to discover and characterize some of the first cancer causing and cancer-suppressing genes ([[oncogenes]] and [[tumor suppressor genes]], respectively). This book gives insight into the day to day working of a top scientific laboratory with no embellishment - both the excitement and thrill of discovery as well as the drudgery and politics can be found in ''Natural Obsessions''. The story is told by a masterful storyteller as the pressure to find these genes mounts and everyone is scrambling to be the first to announce this major discovery which could have gone to several laboratories.  

Of interest to students thinking of a career in science as well as practicing scientists who will relish in the honest portrayals and may personally know a number of the scientists who are now prominent in their fields.
