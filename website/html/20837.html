The '''Kraakdoos''' (or Cracklebox) is a [[custom-made instrument|custom made]] battery-powered [[noise music|noise]]-making [[electronic device]].

It is a small box with six metal contacts on top, which when pressed by fingers will generate all manner of unusual sounds and tones. The [[human body]] becomes a part of the circuit and determines the range of sounds possible — different people will generate different results.

The concept was first conceived by [[Michel Waisvisz]] and Geert Hamelberg in the 1960s, and developed further in the 1970s when Waisvisz joined the [[STEIM]] foundation in [[Amsterdam, The Netherlands]]. The kraakdoos is a simple device, based around a single [[operational amplifier]] (one of the earliest models to be produced) and a few transistors, and can be easily constructed by someone with a basic understanding of electronics.
