}}'''Carole Anne Goble''' is a  [[Professor#Most_other_English-speaking_countries|professor]] of [[Computer Science]] at the [[University of Manchester]] in the UK. She is [[Principal investigator|Principal Investigator (PI)]] of the [[myGrid]] project and a former editor-in-chief of the ''[[Journal of Web Semantics]]''.

Her academic career has been spent at the [[University of Manchester School of Computer Science|School of Computer Science at the University of Manchester]]. She gained her [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[computing]] and [[information systems]] in 1982, joined the academic  staff in 1985, and became a  professor in 2000.<ref>http://dx.doi.org/10.1147/sj.402.0532 TAMBIS: IBM Systems Journal vol. 40, no. 2, 2001</ref>

Her current research interests include [[Grid computing]], the [[Semantic Grid]], the [[Semantic Web]], [[e-Science]] and [[Bioinformatics]]. She applies advances in knowledge technologies and [[workflow]] systems to solve [[information management]] problems for life scientists and other scientific disciplines. She has successfully secured funding from the [[European Union]], the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)]] in the  USA and most UK funding agencies including the [[EPSRC]], [[BBSRC]], [[Medical Research Council (UK)]], the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)]] and the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]].<ref>http://www.campus.manchester.ac.uk/staffnet/goodresearchpractice/ University of Manchester Good Research Practice</ref>

Carole was recipient of the first [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)|Jim Gray]] [[e-Science]] Award in December 2008. [[Tony Hey]], corporate vice president of [[Microsoft]] External Research who sponsored the award, said Goble was chosen for the award because of her work to help scientists do data-intensive science through the [[Taverna workbench]].
