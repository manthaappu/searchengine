<html> <head> <title>BBN Butterfly</title></head><body>The '''BBN Butterfly''' was a massively [[parallel computer]] built by [[Bolt, Beranek and Newman]] in the 1980s.  It was named for the "butterfly" multi-stage switching network around which it was built.  Each machine had up to 512 [[Central processing unit|CPUs]], each with local memory, which could be connected to allow every CPU access to every other CPU's memory, although with a substantially greater latency (roughly 15:1) than for its own. The CPUs were commodity microprocessors. The memory address space was shared.

The first generation<ref>Rettberg, R„ С Wyman, D. Hunt, M. Hoffman. P. Carvey, B. Hyde. W. Clark, and M. Kraley, August 1979, Development of a Voice Funnel, Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc., Report No. 4098 ,,

The second or third generation, GP-1000 models used Motorola [[68020]]'s and scaled to 256 CPUs. The later, TC-2000 models (called "Monarchs") used Motorola [[MC88100]]'s, and scaled to 512 CPUs.<ref>

The Butterfly was initially developed as the [[Voice Funnel|VoiceFunnel]], a router for the ST-II protocol intended for carrying voice and video over wideband networks.  The Butterfly hardware was later used for the router of DARPA's high-speed descendant of ARPANET, the Satellite Wideband Network.  This network later became the Terrestrial Wideband Network.

The Butterfly began with a proprietary [[operating system]] called Chrysalis, but moved to a [[Mach kernel]] operating system in 1989. While the memory access time was non-uniform, the machine had SMP memory semantics, and could be operated as a symmetric multiprocessor.

The largest configured system with over 123 processors (extras for fault-tolerant redundancy) was delivered to the MPCI facility at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]. Most delivered systems had about 16 processors. No known configurations appear to be in museums. At least one system is thought to be sitting within a [[DARPA]] autonomous vehicle.

[[TotalView]], the parallel program debugger developed for the Butterfly outlived the platform, to be ported to a number of other massively parallel machines.
