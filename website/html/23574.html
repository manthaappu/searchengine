Martin Demaine is the father of MIT Computer Science professor and [[MacArthur Fellowship|MacArthur Fellow]] [[Erik Demaine]]; in 1987 (when Erik was six) they together founded the Erik and Dad Puzzle Company which distributed puzzles throughout Canada.<ref>{{citation|contribution=Algorithms Meet Art, Puzzles and Magic|last=Demaine|first=Erik|title=Proc.

The two Demaines continue to work closely together and have many joint works of both mathematics and art,<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2003/demaine-father-1008.html Father and son share love of art, computer science], MIT Tech Talk, October 8, 2003.</ref> including three pieces of [[mathematical origami]] in the permanent collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[New York City|New York]];<ref>[http://erikdemaine.org/curved/ Curved Origami Sculpture], from the web site of Erik Demaine.
