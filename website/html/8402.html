[[Creative Commons]], a [[non-profit organization]] devoted to expanding the range of [[creativity|creative]] works available for others to build upon legally and to share,<ref>[http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ Creative Commons FAQ]</ref> '''"[[porting|ports]]" (adapts) its [[Creative Commons licenses|licenses]]''' to suit different [[copyright]] legislations around the world.

== Work ==
The original non-localized Creative Commons licenses were written with the US legal system in mind, hence the wording of the licenses could be incompatible within different local legislations and render the licenses unenforceable in various [[jurisdictions]]. To address this issue, Creative Commons International has started to port the various licenses to accommodate local copyright and private law. As of September 2010, there are 53 jurisdiction-specific licenses, with 10 other jurisdictions in the drafting process and more countries joining the worldwide project.<ref>[http://creativecommons.org/worldwide Creative Commons International]</ref>

== Porting process ==
The porting process involves both linguistically translating the licenses and legally adapting them to particular jurisdictions.

== Country teams ==
Country teams introduce Creative Commons to their country and facilitate extensive consultations and discussion with members of the public and key stakeholders in an effort to adapt the licenses to local circumstances, i.e. their jurisdiction. Country teams usually have a Project Lead and may have their own website in addition to their listing on the main Creative Commons website. Country teams may be supported by organisations, for example, CCi Ireland is a collaboration between Creative Commons and [[University College Cork]].<ref>[http://creativecommons.org/international/ie/ Ireland - Creative Commons]</ref>
