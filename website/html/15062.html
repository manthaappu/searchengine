<html> <head> <title>Genome@home</title></head><body>'''Genome@home''' was a [[distributed computing]] project run by [[Stefan Larson]] of [[Stanford University]] until March 8, 2004. The goal of the project was to design new [[gene]]s and [[protein]]s for the purpose of better understanding how [[genome]]s evolve, and how genes and proteins operate. Practical applications of the research included the potential development of new medical treatments.

The project was rolled into the [[Folding@home]] project, and is no longer supported.

==Surprise shut-down==

The long-running project closed down with approximately 2 days' notice, despite recent messages from leaders about 'upcoming work'.  This caused some surprise and disappointment among contributors at the time.  Reasons appear to be financial.  Users were told that results-to-date are available for any scientist who wished to see them.
