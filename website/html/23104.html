'''MVFLEX Expression Language''' (MVEL) is a hybrid dynamic/statically typed, embeddable [[Expression Language]] and [[Run-time system|runtime]] for the [[Java_Platform#Platform|Java Platform]].  Originally started as a utility language for an application framework, the project is now developed completely independently.

MVEL is typically used for exposing basic logic to end-users and programmers through configuration such as [[XML]] files or [[Java annotations|annotations]].  It may also be used to parse simple [[JavaBean]] expressions.

The runtime allows MVEL expressions to be executed either interpretively, or through a pre-compilation process with support for runtime [[bytecode]] generation to remove overhead.

Since MVEL is meant to augment Java-based software, it borrows most of its syntax directly from the Java programming language with some minor differences and additional capabilities. For example: as a side effect of MVEL's typing model, which treats class and method references as regular variables, it is possible to use both class and function pointers (but only for static methods).

<source lang="java">
     millis = System.currentTimeMillis;

     // get millis
     time = millis();
</source>

MVEL also allows collections to be represented as folds (or projections) in a [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]-like syntax.

<source lang="java">
    namesOfParents = (parent.name in (children in employees));
</source>

==Hello world example==
<source lang="java">
     System.out.println("Hello, world!");
</source>

MVEL relies on Java namespaces and classes, but does not possess the ability to declare namespaces or classes.

==Quicksort Example==
Here is an example of the [[Quicksort]] algorithm implemented in MVEL 2.0, demonstrating the scripting capabilities of the language.

<source lang="javascript">
import java.util.*;

// the main quicksort algorithm
def quicksort(list) {
    if (list.size() <= 1) {
         list;
    }
    else {
         pivot = list[0];
         concat(quicksort(($ in list if $ < pivot)), pivot, quicksort(($ in list if $ > pivot)));
    }
}

// define method to concatenate lists.
def concat(list1, pivot, list2) {
    concatList = new ArrayList(list1);
    concatList.add(pivot);
    concatList.addAll(list2);
    concatList;
}

// create a list to sort
list = [5,2,4,1,18,10,15,1,0];

// sort it!
quicksort(list);
</source>
