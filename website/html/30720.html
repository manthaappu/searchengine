<html> <head> <title>Quadratically constrained quadratic program</title></head><body>In mathematics, a '''quadratically constrained quadratic program''' ('''QCQP''') is an [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problem in which both the objective function and the constraints are quadratic functions. It has the form

:<math> \begin{align}
& \text{minimize} && \tfrac12 x^\top P_0 x + q_0^\top x \\
& \text{subject to} && \tfrac12 x^\top P_i x + q_i^\top x + r_i \leq 0 \quad \text{for } i = 1,\dots,m , \\
&&& Ax = b, 
\end{align} </math>

where ''P''<sub>0</sub>, &hellip; ''P''<sub>''m''</sub> are ''n''-by-''n'' matrices and ''x'' &isin; '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> is the optimization variable. 

If ''P''<sub>0</sub>, &hellip; ''P''<sub>''m''</sub> are all [[Positive-definite_matrix | positive semidefinite]] then the problem is [[Convex_set | convex]]. If these matrices are neither positive or negative semidefinite, the problem is non-convex. If these are all zero, then the constraints are in fact [[Linear_map | linear]] and the problem is a [[quadratic program]].

== Hardness ==
Solving the general case is an [[NP-hard]] problem. To see this, note that the two constraints ''x''<sub>1</sub>(''x''<sub>1</sub> − 1) &le; 0 and ''x''<sub>1</sub>(''x''<sub>1</sub> − 1) &ge; 0 are equivalent to the constraint ''x''<sub>1</sub>(''x''<sub>1</sub> − 1) = 0, which is in turn equivalent to the constraint ''x''<sub>1</sub> &isin; {0, 1}. Hence, any [[0–1 integer program]] (in which all variables have to be either 0 or 1) can be formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic program. But 0–1 integer programming is NP-hard, so QCQP is also NP-hard.

== Example ==
[[Cut_(graph_theory)| Max Cut]] is a problem in graph theory, which is NP-hard. Given a graph, the problem is to divide the vertices in two sets, so that as many edges as possible go from one set to the other. Max Cut can be easily formulated as a QCQP, which allows obtaining good lower bounds using SDP realization of the dual.

== Special cases ==
There are two main relaxations of QCQP: using [[semidefinite programming]] (SDP), and using the reformulation- linearization technique (RLT). 

=== Semidefinite programming ===
When ''P''<sub>0</sub>, &hellip; ''P''<sub>''n''</sub> are all [[Positive-definite matrix|positive-definite matrices]], the problem is [[Convex optimization|convex]] and can be readily solved using [[interior point method]]s, as done with [[semidefinite programming]].
