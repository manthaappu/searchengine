'''Drive Setup''' is the default disk formatting tool in [[Mac OS]] 7.5.2-9.2.2. It supports such features as [[partition (computing)|partition]]ing, and [[low-level formatting]]. It could format hard drives in [[Hierarchical File System|HFS]], [[HFS Plus]] [[file systems]], and supported formatting drives for use with [[Linux]] and [[A/UX]].

==History==
In the mid 1990s, when Apple began shipping computers using [[AT Attachment|ATA]] hard drives, the SCSI drive formatting utility, [[Apple HD SC Setup]] was joined by [[Internal HD Format]] which could not format SCSI drives. It was first introduced with the [[PowerBook 150]] and [[Quadra 630]] in July 1994. Eventually, both Internal HD Format and Apple HD SC Setup were superseded with Drive Setup in 1995 and ultimately by [[Disk Utility]], both of which combined resources to format both SCSI and [[AT Attachment|IDE]] drives.
