<html> <head> <title>Monism</title></head><body>'''Monism''' is any philosophical view which holds that there is [[unity]] in a given field of [[inquiry]], where this is not to be expected. Thus, some philosophers may hold that the [[universe]] is really just one thing, despite its many appearances and diversities; or theology may support the view that there is one God, with many manifestations in different religions. [[Hinduism]] is considered to be primary proponent of Monism. In the Hindu religion, [[Brahman]] (Devanāgarī: ब्रह्मन् bráhman) is the eternal, unchanging, infinite, immanent, and transcendent reality which is the Divine Ground of all matter, energy, time, space, being, and everything beyond in this Universe. The nature of Brahman is described as transpersonal, personal and impersonal by different philosophical schools and the Brahman religious belief is just seen as different paths to the one god.  <ref>Brodd, Jefferey (2003).

== Philosophical monism ==
Monism in philosophy can be defined according to three kinds:

# [[Idealism]], phenomenalism, or mentalistic monism which holds that only mind is real.
# [[Neutral monism]], which holds that both the mental and the physical can be reduced to some sort of third substance, or energy.
# [[Physicalism]] or [[materialism]], which holds that only the physical is real, and that the mental or spiritual can be [[reduction (philosophy)|reduced]] to the physical.

: Certain other positions are hard to pigeonhole into the above categories, see links below.

== Ancient Western philosophers ==

The following [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic philosophers]] described reality as being monistic:

* [[Thales]]: Water.
* [[Anaximander]]: Apeiron (meaning 'the undefined infinite'). Reality is some, one thing, but we cannot know what.
* [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]]: Air.
* [[Heraclitus]]: Fire (in that everything is in constant flux).
* [[Parmenides]]: Being. Reality is an unmoving perfect sphere, unchanging, undivided.

And post-Socrates:

* Neopythagorians such as [[Apollonius of Tyana]] centered their cosmologies on the [[Monad (Greek philosophy)|Monad]] or One.
* [[Stoics]], like [[Spinoza]] later, taught that there is only one substance, identified as God.
* Middle Platonism under such works as [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]] express the Universe emanating from the Monad or One.
* [[Neoplatonism]] is Monistic. [[Plotinus]] taught that there was an ineffable transcendent God, 'The One,' of which subsequent realities were emanations. From The One emanates the Divine Mind ([[Nous]]), the Cosmic Soul ([[Psyche (psychology)|Psyche]]), and the World ([[Cosmos]]).

== Monism, pantheism, and panentheism ==

Following a long and still current tradition [[Huw Owen|H.P. Owen]] (1971: 65) claimed that

: "[[Pantheist]]s are ‘monists’...they believe that there is only one Being, and that all other forms of reality are either modes (or appearances) of it or identical with it."

Although almost all pantheists are monists, some pantheists may also be not-monists, but undeniably monists were the most famous pantheisms as that of [[Stoics]], [[Plotinus]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]].  Exclusive Monists believe that the universe, the "God" of naturalistic pantheism, simply does not exist. In addition, monists can be [[Deism|Deists]], [[Pandeism|Pandeists]], [[Theism|Theists]] or [[Panentheism|Panentheists]]; believing in a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] God that is omnipotent and all-pervading, and both transcendent and immanent. There are monist pantheists and panentheists in [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Hinduism]] (particularly in [[Advaita]] and [[Vishistadvaita]] respectively), [[Judaism]] (monistic panentheism is especially found in [[Kabbalah]] and [[Hasidic philosophy]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}), and in [[Islam]] (among the [[Sufis]], especially the [[Bektashi]]).

While pantheism means all things are identical to God, pan''en''theism means ''God is in all things'', neither identical to, nor totally separate from all things. Such a concept, some may argue, is more compatible with God as personal while not barring a bridge between God and creation. Historical figures such as Paul Tillich have argued for such a concept within Christian theology, as has contemporary biblical scholar Marcus Borg and theologian Matthew Fox, an Episcopal priest. [[Creation Spirituality]].

== Monism in religious and spiritual systems ==

=== Hinduism ===

Monism is found in the [[Nasadiya Sukta]] of the [[Rigveda]], which speaks  of the [[Ekam|One]] being-non-being that 'breathed without breath'. The first system in Hinduism that unequivocally explicated [[absolute monism]] was the non-dualist philosophy of [[Advaita]] [[Vedanta]] as expounded by [[Adi Sankara|Shankara]]. In short, Advaita declares - All is [[Brahman]]. It is part of the six [[Hindu]] systems of [[philosophy]], based on the [[Upanishads]], and posits that the ultimate monad is a formless, ineffable divine ground of all being.

[[Vishishtadvaita]], qualified monism, is from the school of [[Ramanuja]]. [[Shuddhadvaita]], in-essence monism, is the school of [[Vallabha]]. [[Dvaitadvaita]], differential monism, is a school founded by [[Nimbarka]]. [[Dvaita]], [[dualism]], is a school founded by [[Madhvacharya]] is probably the only Vedantic System which is opposed to all types of monism. It believes that God is eternally different from souls and matter in both form and essence. All [[Vaishnava]] schools are [[panentheistic]] and view the universe as part of [[Krishna]] or [[Narayana]], but see a plurality of souls and substances within [[Brahman]]. Monistic theism, which includes the concept of a personal God as a [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]], [[omnipotent]] [[Supreme Being]] who is both [[Immanence|immanent]] and [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], is prevalent within many other schools of Hinduism as well.

The concept of [[Brahman]] explains the prevalence of Monism in Hinduism. According to Hinduism, Brahman is the eternal, unchanging, infinite, immanent, and transcendent reality which is the Divine Ground of all matter, energy, time, space, being, and everything beyond in this Universe.[1] The nature of Brahman is described as transpersonal, personal and impersonal by different philosophical schools.<ref>Brodd, Jefferey (2003). World Religions. Winona, MN: Saint Mary's Press. ISBN 978-0-88489-725-5.</ref> And since a Brahman is considered to be anyone irrespective of religious belief, Hinduism is monistic.

=== Buddhism ===

[[Buddhist]] philosophy is generally suspicious of [[ontology]]. [[The Buddha]] himself, and some of his prominent disciples such as [[Nagarjuna]], discouraged ontological theorizing for its own sake.

According to the [[Pali Canon]], both pluralism (naanatta) and monism (ekatta) are speculative [[View (Buddhism)|views]]. A [[Theravada]] commentary notes that the former is similar to or associated with nihilism (ucchedavada), and the latter is similar to or associated with eternalism ([[sassatavada]]).<ref>[[David Kalupahana]], ''Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism.'' The University Press of Hawaii, 1975, page 88. The passage is SN 2.77.</ref> See [[middle way]].

Among the [[Madhyamaka]] school of Mahayana Buddhist philosophy, the ultimate nature of the world is described as [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]], which is indistinguishable from material form. That appears to be a monist position, but the Madhyamaka views - including variations like [[Prasangika]] and [[Yogacara]] and the more modern [[shentong]] Tibetan position - will fail to assert in the ultimate nature any particular point of view. They instead deconstruct any assertions about ultimate existence as resulting in absurd consequences. The doctrine of emptiness is also found in earlier Theravada Buddhist literature.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In [[Soto Zen]] teaching, it is said that "All is One and All is Different." Since non-dualism does not recognize a dualism between Oneness and Difference, or even between dualism and non-dualism, it is difficult to state the meaning of this doctrine. All discussion of this teaching by Soto Zen masters falls under the Buddhist concept of [[skill in means]], which is to say, not literally correct, but suitable for leading others to the Truth. Chinese Soto (Cao-Dong) master Tozan ([[Tung Shan]], Dongshan) wrote the [[Verses of the Five Ranks]] (of the Ideal and the Actual), which is also important as a set of koans in the Rinzai school. Dongshan describes the Fifth Rank in part thus:

Unity Attained:<br>
Who dares to equal him<br>
Who falls into neither being nor non-being!

Shih-t'ou Hsi-ch'ien's poem "The Harmony of Difference and Sameness" [[Sandokai]] is an important early expression of Zen Buddhism and is chanted in Sōtō temples to this day. Another poem of Tung-shan Liang-chieh on these and related themes, "The Song of the Jewel Mirror Awareness", is also chanted in Sōtō temples daily.

Other expressions of this teaching include the [[koan]]:

A disciple asked, "What is the difference between the enlightened and the unenlightened man?"

The Master replied, "The unenlightened man sees a difference, but the enlightened man does not."

and [[Dogen]] Zenji's personal koan, "Why are training and enlightenment differentiated, since the Truth is universal?" (Fukanzazengi, Instructions for Meditation)

=== Christianity ===
{{See also|Christian anthropology}}

[[Christianity]] strongly maintains the Creator-creature distinction as fundamental. Most Christians maintain that God created the universe [[ex nihilo]] and not from himself, nor within himself, so that the creator is not to be confused with creation, but rather [[transcendence (religion)|transcends]] it (metaphysical dualism)(cf. [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]). Even the more immanent concepts and theologies are to be defined together with God's omnipotence, omnipresence and omniscience, due to God's desire for intimate contact with his own creation (cf. Acts 17:27) Another use of the term "monism" is in [[Christian anthropology]] to refer to the innate nature of humankind as being [[holistic]], as usually opposed to [[bipartite (theology)|bipartite]] and [[tripartite (theology)|tripartite]] views.

While the Christian view of reality is dualistic (in regard to metaphysics) in that it holds to the Creator's transcendence of creation, it rejects other types of dualism (or pluralism) such as the idea that God must compete with other equal powers such as [[Satan]] (cf [[Gospel of John]] 14:30). In ''[[On Free Choice of the Will]]'', [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] argued, in the context of [[the problem of evil]], that evil is not the opposite of good, but rather merely the absence of good, something that does not have existence in itself. Likewise, [[C. S. Lewis]] described evil as a "parasite" in ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', as he viewed evil as something that cannot exist without good to provide it with existence. Lewis went on to argue against dualism from the basis of [[moral absolutism]], and rejected the dualistic notion that God and [[Satan]] are  opposites, arguing instead that God has no equal, hence no opposite. Lewis rather viewed Satan as the opposite of [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the archangel]].

In [[Catholic Church|Catholic Christianity]], while human beings are not ontologically identical with the Creator, they are nonetheless capable with uniting with his Divine Nature via [[theosis]]. In addition to this supernatural union, [[St. John of the Cross]] says, "it must be known that God dwells and is present substantially in every soul, even in that of the greatest sinner in the world, and this union is natural." [[St. Julian of Norwich]], while maintaining the orthodox duality of Creator and creature, nonetheless speaks of God as "the true Father and true Mother" of all natures; thus, he indwells them substantially and thus preserves them from annihilation, as without this sustaining indwelling everything would cease to exist.

However, some heterodox theologians are monists, such as [[Paul Tillich]]. Since God is He "in whom we live and move and have our being" ([[Book of Acts]] 17.28), it follows that everything that has being partakes in God. Dualism with regard to God and creation also barred the possibility of a mystical union with God, as [[John Calvin]] rejected{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, according to [[Max Weber]] in ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism''. Such a dualism also leads to the problematic position of positing God as a particular being the existence of which can be argued for or against, failing to recognize God as the ground and origin of being itself, as in Acts 17, or in the [[Hashem]], YHWH, meaning "He causes to come into being." Such a view was called by Tillich pan''en''theism: God is in all things, neither identical to, nor totally separate from, all things. This understanding would be further supported by that understanding of the proclamation of the [[kingdom of God]], in which it is proclaimed "on earth as it is in heaven." ([[Gospel of Matthew]] 6:10)  Such an understanding of the kingdom implies a new reality in which old dichotomies between, for example, the sacred and the profane, the temporal and the eternal, body and soul, absolutism and relativism, are overcome.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} All things are filled with God's Spirit ([[Epistle to the Romans]] 8:11), so that in this new creation God is "all in all" ([[I Corinthians]] 15.28; [[Ephesians]] 1.23).

====Eastern and Western differences over Monism====

[[Monism]] is a form of an [[epistemological idealism]].<ref>The Dictionary of Philosophy
By Dagobert D. Runes Publisher: Kessinger Publishing, LLC (May 26, 2006) Language: English ISBN 978-1-4286-1310-2 [http://books.google.com/books?id=Z5g0FOsGwUwC&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=Monism+is+an+epistemological+idealism&source=bl&ots=mC6yqBtAln&sig=KJX0SxDIWkDyTRdNG4osImb0D1w&hl=en&ei=DgQqTI2ZG4H_8AbU8fXUCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CB8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Monism%20is%20an%20epistemological%20idealism&f=false]</ref> Which from a Hellenic perspective leads to the concept that all is in and of the human mind or consciousness (nous). Therefore in some forms of Hellenic philosophical idealism, God is in the mind, of the mind ([[intrinsic]]) and not a real objective being. This is called a form of subjective or modal interpretation of God like the modal formations contained in Aristotle's [[De Interpretatione]]. Aristotle opposed monism <ref>The philosopher who holds that there is a highest genus with many species would be a monist about the number of highest categories (genus monism) but a pluralist about the number of categories.  Aristotle, in contrast, is a pluralist about both the number of categories and the number of highest categories, since he denies the existence of a unique highest type.[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/monism/]</ref> and idealism with his own concept of reducing everything to a single concept (called [[metaphysics]]). The process of uniting (unity) all to a single 'thing' ([[Henotheism|hen]]) as a form of salvation is called [[henosis]]. Henosis teaches that man is God (in that mankind has the concept of God intrinsic to consciousness and God can be grasp by thought or rational contemplation).<ref>pg 52 The [[Mystery religions]]: A Study in the Religious Background of Early Christianity By [[Samuel Angus]]
Published by Courier Dover Publications, 1975
ISBN 978-0-486-23124-2 [http://books.google.com/books?id=3m61I6Q-dRUC&pg=PA300&lpg=PA300&dq=Theo+Smyrnaeus&source=web&ots=ml_CULK2si&sig=iDH41z1tQBg7lGxTEQplcPVwwHo&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result#PPA52,M1]</ref>

Neoplatonic pagan philosophy teaches [[Henology]] (via [[Plotinus]]) that the first hypostasis or the monad by which all things can reduce their essence, substance or being to is called [[dunamis]] (potentia in Latin) or force which emanated the second hypostasis an [[energeia|energy]] (actus) or [[demiurge]] (mind or nous as the creator) then the creator hypostasis emanated the soul or spirit. This reverses Aristotle's mode from Energy (act or action) first and Dunamis, force or motion second, making his [[Unmoved Mover]] energy or (actus in Latin) static and the second reality potential or motion.<ref>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Aristotle's metaphysics- Aristotle gives priority to Actuality over Potentiality [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-metaphysics/#ActPot]</ref> Each teaching a sequential modalistic manifestation of the material world via a philosophical "concept" called God (theos). Supernatural in the East is that which is uncreated.

Energies are uncreated and therefore it is critical to make a distinction between God and his Energies unlike in Pagan Philosophy. Since in Pagan Philosophy "energies" are Gods ([[Aphrodite|Love]], [[Athena|Wisdom]], [[Hermes|Intuitivism]] and [[Mnemosyne|Memory]]). Gregory Palamas in his defense of Hesychasm accused Barlaam of treating God conceptually this way putting pagan philosophers over the saints and prophets who through revelation and not logical thought came to know God. The knowledge of God by the Eastern Orthodox church is not arrived at by a form of rational theology but rather by illumination ([[theoria]]) as a stage of development in the process of theosis. Which again goes against the Roman Catholic theologians validation of theology using the Pagan philosopher [[Aristotle]]'s [[Metaphysics|Metaphysical]] and [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] arguments such as [[Actus et potentia|actus and potentia]]<ref name=echo>"There was a very faint echo of Hesychasm in the West. Latin theology on the whole was too deeply impregnated with the Aristotelean Scholastic system to tolerate a theory that opposed its very foundation. That all created beings are composed of ''actus'' and ''potentia'', that God alone is ''actus purus'', simple as He is infinite &ndash; this is the root of all Scholastic natural theology. Nevertheless one or two Latins seem to have had ideas similar to Hesychasm. Gilbertus Porretanus (de la Porrée, d. 1154) is quoted as having said that the Divine essence is not God &ndash; implying some kind of real distinction; John of Varennes, a hermit in the Diocese of Reims (c. 1396), said that the Apostles at the Transfiguration had seen the Divine essence as clearly as it is seen in heaven. About the same time John of Brescain made a proposition: ''Creatam lucem infinitam et immensam esse''. But these isolated opinions formed no school. We know of them chiefly through the indignant condemnations they at once provoked. St. Bernard wrote to refute Gilbert de la Porrée; the University of Paris and the legate Odo condemned John of Brescain's proposition. Hesychasm has never had a party among Catholics. In the Orthodox Church the controversy, waged furiously just at the time when the enemies of the empire were finally overturning it and unity among its last defenders was the most crying need, is a significant witness of the decay of a lost cause" ([http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Hesychasm Adrian Fortescue, "Hesychasm" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' 1910).]</ref> to rationalize God.<ref name="Romanides">{{Cite book|title=Franks, Romans, Feudalism, and Doctrine/Empirical Theology versus Speculative Theology |first=John S. |last=Romanides |url=http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.03.en.franks_romans_feudalism_and_doctrine.02.htm |quote=A basic characteristic of the Frankish scholastic method, mislead by Augustinian Platonism and Thomistic Aristotelianism, had been its naive confidence in the objective existence of things rationally speculated about. By following Augustine, the Franks substituted the patristic concern for spiritual observation, (which they had found firmly established in Gaul when they first conquered the area) with a fascination for metaphysics. They did not suspect that such speculations had foundations neither in created nor in spiritual reality. ''No one would today accept as true what is not empirically observable'', or at least verifiable by inference, from an attested effect. So it is with patristic theology. Dialectical speculation about God and the Incarnation as such are rejected. Only those things which can be tested by the experience of the grace of God in the heart are to be accepted. "Be not carried about by divers and strange teachings. For it is good that the heart be confirmed by grace," a passage from Hebrews 13.9, quoted by the Fathers to this effect.}}</ref> The West does this through what the East calls an incompleteness as a form of theology called [[kataphatic theology]]. The East does not use kataphatic statements about God to validate God since to use positive statements about God goes against God's very being (ontology) which is [[apophatic theology|apophatic]] and therefore incomprehensible and not rational.

=== Judaism ===

According to [[Hasidic philosophy|Chasidic Thought]] (particularly as propounded by [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]]) of [[Chabad]], God is held to be [[Immanence|immanent]] within [[Genesis creation myth|creation]] for two interrelated reasons.

* Firstly, a very strong Jewish belief is that "[t]he Divine life-force which brings [the universe] into existence must constantly be present... were this life-force to forsake [the universe] for even one brief moment, it would revert to a state of utter nothingness, as before the creation..." <ref>http://www.chabad.org/library/archive/LibraryArchive2.asp?AID=7988</ref>

* Secondly, and simultaneously, Judaism holds as [[axiom]]atic that [[Jewish principle of faith#God is One|God is an absolute unity]], and that He is [[Divine simplicity#In Jewish thought|Perfectly Simple]] -  thus if His sustaining power is within nature, then His essence is also within nature.

However, the [[Vilna Gaon]] was very much against this philosophy, for he felt that it would lead to pantheism and [[heresy]]. According to some this is the main reason for the Gaon's ban on Chasidism.

Note that, at the same time, Jewish thought considers God as separate from all physical, created things ([[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]]) and as existing outside of time (eternal). For a discussion of the resultant [[paradox]]; see ''[[Tzimtzum]]''.

: See also [[Negative theology#In the Jewish tradition|Negative theology]].

According to Maimonides, (see Foundations of the Law, Chapter 1), God is an incorporeal being that caused all other existence.  In fact, God is defined as the necessary existent that caused all other existence.  According to Maimonides, to admit corporeality to God is tantamount to admitting complexity to God, which is a contradiction to God as the First Cause and constitutes heresy.  While Hasidic mystics considered the existence of the physical world a contradiction to God's simpleness, Maimonides saw no contradiction. See the Guide for the Perplexed, especially chapter I:50.

=== Islam ===
Many followers of Sufism advocated monism. Most notably the 13th-century Persian poet [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Balkhi-Rumi]] (1207–73) in his didactic poem [[Masnavi]] espoused monism.<ref name="nicholson">[http://www.globalwebpost.com/farooqm/study_res/rumi/intro_nicholson.html Reynold Nicholson ''Rumi'']</ref><ref>[http://www.rumi.org.uk/sufism/persian_sufism.htm Cyprian Rice, O.P., (1964) ''The Persian Sufism'' George Allen, London]</ref>  Rumi says in the [[Masnavi]], "in the shop for Unity (wahdat); anything that you see there except the One is an idol."<ref name="nicholson" />

According to Vincent J. Cornell, the Qur'an also provides a monist image of God by describing the reality as a unified whole, with God being a single concept that would describe or ascribe all existing things:"He is the First and the Last, the Outward and the Inward; He is the Knower of everything (Sura {{cite quran|57|3|style=nosup|expand=no}})".<ref>Vincent J. Cornell, Encyclopedia of Religion, Vol 5, pp.3561-3562</ref>

Another verse in the Quran is "To God belongs the East and the West, Wheresoever you look is the face of God.(Sura {{cite quran|2|115|style=nosup|expand=no}})".

There are many other verses such as Quran 15:29, 38:72 etc. which say that God blew spirit into man. It is mistakenly believed that there is an imprint of God in man.There are many verses in the Quran which indicate that He is the only Creator and there is nothing like unto him.

== Theological growth and breadth ==

Many forms of [[Hinduism]] (including [[Vedanta]], some forms of [[Yoga]], and certain schools of [[Shaivism]]), [[Taoism]], [[Pantheism]], [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] and similar systems of thought explore the [[mystical]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]] elements of a monistic philosophy. With increasing awareness of these systems of thought, western spiritual and philosophical climate has seen a growing understanding of monism. Moreover, the [[New Thought]] and [[New Age]] movements embraced many monistic concepts during the twentieth century and continue up to the present day.

Monism can be said to oppose religious philosophy altogether by claiming that the idea of spirituality contradicts the monist principle of an indistinguishable mind and body.

==Materialistic monism==
Materialistic monism (or monistic [[materialism]]) is the philosophical [[concept]] which sees the [[unity]] of [[matter]] in its [[globality]]. For the materialistic monist the [[cosmos]] is “[[one]]” and comprehensive, then a “one-all” made up of parts such as its effects. The [[matter]] is then originary and cause of all [[reality]].
