<html> <head> <title>Geometry of interaction</title></head><body>The '''Geometry of Interaction''' (GoI) was introduced by [[Jean-Yves Girard]] shortly after his work on [[Linear Logic]]. In [[Linear Logic]] proofs can be seen as some kind of networks instead of the flat tree structure of [[Sequent calculus]]. To distinguish the real [[Proof net]]s from all the possible networks, Girard devised a criterium involving trips in the network. Trips can in fact be seen as some kind of [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]]{{Clarify|date=December 2010}} acting on the proof. Drawing from this observation, Girard described directly this operator from the proof and has given a formula, the so-called ''Execution formula'', encoding the process of [[cut elimination]] at the level of operators.

At the same time, Lamping had given a hard to understand algorithm to compute the [[optimal reduction]] strategy for the [[lambda calculus]]. Gonthier, Abadi and Levy have further shown that GoI allows better analysis of Lamping's algorithm. This work on the [[lambda calculus]] has been independently carried by Danos and Regnier, Asperti and Guerrini. GoI work had a strong influence on [[game semantics]] for [[linear logic]] and [[Programming language for Computable Functions|PCF]].
