<html> <head> <title>Network File Control</title></head><body>'''Network File Control''' ('''NFC''') is a common point of "command and control" for file data—delivering a common set of network resident services, centrally defined and managed via policy, then applied across a heterogeneous file storage infrastructure.  NFC's associated services are delivered "within the network" and affects the treatment of file data from its "origination to destination".  NFC plays an integral role in controlling the various aspects of file management for a [[Global Namespace]].

By implementing NFC, it can result in a dramatic reduction of file storage costs, significantly improved data security, and an unprecedented amount of visibility within a file data estate—which enables organizations to better manage and control their file-based data over its life cycle.  Services that can be deployed via policy include (but are not limited to): storage tiering, file balancing, content-based security, active auditing/alerting and single instancing (de-duplication) with a management granularity at the file level.   

==Standards==

NFC has been defined as a functional component within the [[File Area Networking|File Area Network]] (FAN) reference model, which is currently being defined by SNIA's FAN Working Group.  Within the FAN reference model, this particular area of functionality is also referenced and referred to as "File Management and Control Services".

NFC is used to control file data that exists within network-based file shares, through an associated set of management services; i.e. information stores provided by servers using the [[Common Internet File System]] protocol (CIFS) and the [[Network File System (protocol)|Network File System]] (NFS) protocols.  These are standard protocols used by all servers, [[Network Attached Storage]] (NAS) devices and client systems for handling file data.
