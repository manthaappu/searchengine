A '''sememe''' (from the {{lang-el|σημαίνω (sēmaino)}}, "mean, signify") is a [[semantic]] language unit of meaning, correlative to a [[morpheme]].

A sememe is a proposed unit of transmitted or intended meaning; it is atomic or indivisible. A sememe can be the meaning expressed by a morpheme, such as the English pluralizing morpheme ''-s'', which carries the sememic feature [+ plural]. Alternately, a single sememe (for example [go] or [move]) can be conceived as the abstract representation of such verbs as ''skate, roll, jump, slide, turn,'' or ''boogie''. It can be thought of as the semantic counterpart to any of the following: a [[meme]] in a culture, a [[gene]] in a genetic make-up, or an [[atom]] (or, more specifically, an [[elementary particle]]) in a substance.  A [[Seme (semantics)|seme]] is the smallest unit of meaning recognized in semantics, referring to a single characteristic of a sememe.

There are five types of sememes: two [[denotation]]al and three [[connotation]]al, with connotational occurring only in phrase units (they do not reflect the [[Denotation (semiotics)|denotation]]):<ref>[http://www.krsu.edu.kg/vestnik/2003/v2/a04.html Pragmatic and syntagmatic aspects of phraseology, Krassnoff (in russian)]</ref>

# Denotational 1: Primary denotation, for example "head" (body);
# Denotational 2: Secondary denotation by resemblance with other denotation: "head" (ship);
# Connotational 1: High position, as the role or function of "head" in the operation of the human body;
# Connotational 2: Emotive, e.g., meaning in "honey";
# Connotational 3: Evaluative, e.g., meaning in "sneak" – move silently and secretly for a bad purpose

The term was coined by Sydney Lamb of Yale University as part of his theory of [[Stratificational Linguistics]], much of which now appears under the name [[Neuro-Cognitive linguistics]]--><!--sic?--><!--.{{fact|date=November 2010}} The sememe notion was one of the inspirations of Roger Schank's theory of [[Conceptual Dependency]], a methodology for representing language meaning directly within the [[Artificial Intelligence]] movement of the 1960s/1970s.
