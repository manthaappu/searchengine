[[Image:Dollar_bill_goes_here.JPG|right|thumb|[[Vending machine|Slot]] to accept bills in change machine.]]
A '''change machine''' is a [[machine]] that accepts large denominations of [[currency]] and returns an equal amount of currency in smaller [[banknote|bills]] or [[coin]]s.  Typically these machines are used to provide coins in exchange for paper currency, in which case they are also often known as '''bill changers'''.

In the [[United States|US]], these devices are typically seen in the vicinity of machines that will not accept paper currency. This can be in a parking facility that has [[parking meter]]s, in [[laundromat]]s, or near [[vending machine]]s that lack [[bill validator]]s and don't accept paper currency.

Before the advent of ''coinless'' [[slot machine]]s, [[casino]]s would sometimes have change machines that would accept paper currency and return coins or tokens that could be used in the machines.  A similar arrangement has often been found at [[video arcade]]s.

In some cases a machine may subtract a small amount (e.g. 5 cents) as a [[Fee|surcharge]] for the transaction.
