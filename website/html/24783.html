<html> <head> <title>Mobile Computing and Communications Review</title></head><body>'''Mobile Computing and Communications Review''' (MC2R) is the [[peer-reviewed]] [[quarterly]] [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] publication for the [[mobile computing]] and [[mobile network|networking]] community.

==Objectives==

MC2R stated objectives are that it will do the following:

* Place a strong emphasis on quick publication of interesting completed or work-in-progress technical work.
* Publish articles that provide a healthy balance between state-of-the-art research and practice.
* Provide thorough pre-publication reviews of every article by experts in the field.
* Keep the [[SIGMOBILE]] community appraised of relevant happenings in this area, by providing regular features on the status of major international ([[ITU]], [[ISO]], [[IEEE]], etc.) standards in mobile computing and communications.
* Provide a variety of additional services, such as bibliographies of recent publications in other journals, paper and book reviews, workshop and conference reports, calls for papers, information on research groups from throughout the world, bibliographies and locations of technical reports, and general news in the field.
* Help first-time authors who have interesting research ideas get their work into print. 

==Scope==
