<html> <head> <title>Subject-matter expert</title></head><body>A '''subject matter expert (SME)''' or '''domain expert''' is a person who is an expert in a particular area or topic.   When spoken, sometimes the acronym "SME" is spelled out ("S-M-E") and other times voiced as a word ("smee").{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The term ''domain expert'' is frequently used in [[expert systems]] software development, and there the term always refers to the domain other than the software domain. A domain expert is a person with special knowledge or skills in a particular area of endeavor. An [[accountant]] is an expert in the domain of [[accountancy]], for example. The development of [[accounting software]] requires knowledge in two different domains, namely accounting and software. Some of the development workers may be experts in one domain and not the other.

==Function==
In general, the term is used when developing materials (a book, an examination, a manual, etc.) about a topic, and expertise on the topic is needed by the personnel developing the material.  For example, [[Test (student assessment)|tests]] are often created by a team of [[psychometrics|psychometricians]] and a team of subject matter experts.  The psychometricians understand how to engineer a test while the subject matter experts understand the actual content of the exam.  Books, manuals, and technical documentation are developed by [[Technical writer]]s and [[instructional designer]]s in conjunctions with SMEs.  Technical communicators interview SMEs to extract information and convert it into a form suitable for the audience.  SMEs are often required to sign off on the documents or training developed, checking it for accuracy.  SMEs are also necessary for the development of training materials.<ref>[http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/hrd/sme.html Subject matter experts and training]</ref>

===Software===
In [[software engineering]] environments, the term is used to describe professionals with expertise in the field of application but without technical project knowledge.  The term "SME" also has a broader definition in engineering and [[high tech]] as one who has the greatest expertise in a technical topic.  SMEs are often asked to review, improve, and approve technical work; to guide others; and to teach.  According to [[Six Sigma]], a Subject Matter Expert "exhibits the highest level of expertise in performing a specialized job, task, or skill."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://military.isixsigma.com/dictionary/Subject_Matter_Expert_-_SME-396.htm/SME/|title=Subject Matter Expert|publisher=iSixSigma|accessdate=2008-11-24}}</ref>

In software development, as in the development of "complex computer systems" (e.g., [[artificial intelligence]], [[expert system]]s, control, simulation, or business software) a SME is a person who is knowledgeable about the domain being represented (but often not knowledgeable about the programming technology used to represent it in the system).  The SME tells the software developers what needs to be done by the computer system, and how the SME intends to use it.  The SME may interact directly with the system, possibly through a simplified interface, or may codify domain knowledge for use by [[knowledge engineering|knowledge engineers]] or [[Ontology (information science)|ontologists]].  An SME is also involved in validating the resulting system.  SME has formal meaning in certain contexts such as [[Capability Maturity Model|CMMs]].
