<html> <head> <title>Peace gaming</title></head><body>'''Peace gaming''' is a [[neologism]] coined by [[Utsumi Takeshi]] to describe non-military global [[simulation]]s, or simulations that involve both [[military]] and [[civilian]] variables.

Peace gaming is based on the idea that global simulations which are modeled entirely on military actions ([[Wargaming|war gaming]]) can never be more than [[zero-sum]] games. In other words, in order for one side to achieve its objective, all others must lose. Proponents of peace gaming simulations argue that when "civilian" factors which exist in the real world, such as the [[economy]], [[manufacturing]], and [[trade]] are brought into play, the simulation becomes not only more realistic but also ceases to be a zero-sum game. Through collaborative action on the part of the competitors as opposed to purely confrontational, all sides can gain benefit and thus all can [[theoretical]]ly claim victory.
