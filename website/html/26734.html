'''Novell ZENworks''', a suite of [[software]] products developed and maintained by [[Novell, Inc.]] for computer [[systems management]], aims to manage the entire [[product life cycle management|life cycle]] of [[Server (computing)|servers]], of [[desktop computer|desktop]] [[personal computer|PCs]] (both [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based and [[Linux]]-based), of [[laptop]]s, and of [[handheld device]]s (such as [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s).  ZENworks supports multiple server platforms and multiple [[directory service]]s.

== History ==

Novell originally based ZENworks on portions of [[Intel]]'s [[LANDesk | LANdesk Manager]] product, which Novell had licensed from [[Intel]]. After [[directory service|directory]]-enabling the software, Novell renamed the package '''NAL''' ('''Novell Application Launcher'''). The success of NAL led to considerable growth in its functionality, and marketers renamed the product "ZENworks" (for "Zero Effort Networks").<ref>

| quote       = The name ZENworks is short for "Zero Effort Networks." The name is not intended to imply that Novell is able to eliminate the work and effort associated with deploying and maintaining a network on the administrative side.[...]The name ZENworks was chosen to suggest that network administrators can remove the obstacles and frustrations that prevent users from effortlessly accessing the resources on the network. [Theoretically,] zero effort is required from users.

The "Novell Application Launcher" service and executable program-names with the .nal file extension persist.

Damon Janis, a Senior Software Engineer at Novell, first conceived of NAL in 1994. The original concept was to use the NetWare Directory as a central repository for [[user object]]s. Novell presented a prototype named "UserNet" at the Novell Brainshare conference in 1994.

Soon after the idea of expanding UserNet to include application objects was born. A team of software engineers (Damon Janis, Matt Brooks, and Calvin Gaisford) designed and developed the first production version of NAL, released in late 1995. NAL was well received by the network administrator community and its use and adoption quickly grew.

The new name, "ZENworks", first appeared as "Z.E.N.works" in 1998 with ZENworks 1.0<ref>

and with ZENworks Starter Pack - a limited version of ZENworks 1.0 that came bundled with [[NetWare]] 5.0 (1998). Novell added server-management functionality, and the product grew into a suite consisting of:

* "ZENworks for Desktops" (ZfD)
* "ZENworks for Servers" (ZfS)

Novell has continued to add components to the suite, which it sells under the consolidated name "ZENworks Suite".

== Capabilities ==

The ZENworks suite comprises nine packages, available individually.
* '''Desktop Management''' (or '''ZDM''' â€” for "ZENworks Desktop Management") allows administrators to install software on, configure, put a hard-disk image on, inventory and remotely troubleshoot Windows-based workstations and laptops from a central location, through use of policy-driven automation.
** Software packages installed via Desktop Management can have self-healing features and can install themselves on demand.
** Desktop Management also supports [[Microsoft Installer|MSI]] packages and [[Group Policy|Group Policies]], despite the common misconception that systems administrators need [[Active Directory|Microsoft Active Directory]] and a Windows server to gain the full benefit of these technologies.
** The Application Explorer utility (<code>nalview.exe</code>) provides a Novell Application Launcher (NAL) view to link applications into Microsoft Windows desktop displays.
** A Zenworks implementation on a desktop machine may include:
*** <code>nalagent.exe</code>
*** <code>nalntsrv.exe</code> (runs the [[Windows service | NT service]])
*** <code>zenrem32.exe</code> (allows remote users to manage a machine)
** Desktop Management software can operate both inside and outside firewalls.
* '''Personality Migration''' consists of a modified version of the DesktopDNA currently owned by [[Computer Associates]]. Administrators can use it to migrate documents and settings from one Windows-based computer to another, regardless of the version of Windows running on either machine.
* '''Software Packaging''' comprises a special edition of [[Macrovision]]'s AdminStudio software, which allows administrators to create MSI (installer) packages for distribution.
* '''Data Management''', a version of Novell's [[iFolder]] software, allows users to synchronise data in a specified local folder (an iFolder folder on a Windows workstation with iFolder client software installed) with an iFolder server. Users can access iFolder data on the server from within the local network and via the [[Internet]] using iFolder server web interface. (Novell significantly extended iFolder functionality in iFolder 3.0, adding support for Linux workstations and many other features.)
* '''Patch Management''' provides automated patch management, allowing administrators to mitigate patch-related security threats by automating the collection, analysis, and delivery of patches throughout an enterprise network. Patch Management includes a subscription to the world's largest repository {{Fact|date=October 2008}} of fully automated patches spanning Windows and many Linux and Unix platforms. Patch deployment takes place rapidly and accurately with wizard-based tools and the ability to continuously monitor to ensure that computers stay patched over time.
* '''Linux Management''' initially leveraged the [[Red Carpet (software)|Red Carpet]] software package (ZENworks Linux Management versions up to 6.6.2) which manages [[RPM Package Manager|RPM]] packages installed on [[Linux]] workstations and servers. After a complete rewrite (version 7 and upwards), the tool extended its functionality from Software Management to Asset Management, Policy Enforcement, and System Imaging. {{As of|2008}}, Linux Management handles software installation, updates, and rollbacks with varying degrees of reliability.  Novell provides updates with bug-fixes and security patches on [[RPM Package Manager| RPM]]s distributed with its commercial ([[SUSE Linux distributions| SUSE]]) Linux products.
* '''Server Management''' allows remotely-located administrators to update, configure and troubleshoot Windows, NetWare, and Linux servers through the use of policy-driven automation.
* '''Handheld Management''' allows administrators to remotely update, configure, and inventory [[Palm OS|Palm]], [[Windows CE]], [[PocketPC]] and [[Research In Motion|RIM]] [[BlackBerry]] devices.
* '''Asset Management''' handles hardware and software inventories.
