Classical Lounge was the first [[social networking]] site designed solely for [[classical music]] lovers.{{Fact|date=March 2008}} Built to expand the classical music community, the site and its membership are evidence to a modern, tech-savvy fan base that contradicts the stereotype of the "old and stuffy" classical music audience.<ref>BBC. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5388716.stm Classical music fans go digital], 2006-09-28.</ref> 

The site facilitates interaction between [[musicians]], students, presenters, managers, journalists, media, instrument makers and dealers. Classical music enthusiasts and audience members are also encouraged to participate. Members of the site can share their music and generally network with the broad classical music community.

==History==
Classical Lounge was founded in August 2006 by the members of the Miro [[String quartet|Quartet]]. Since then, it has gained several thousand members.
In September 2006, the PalmBeachPost.com called it "essentially a [[MySpace]]-style deal for classical players, composers, critics and enthusiast".<ref>PalmBeachPost.com.
