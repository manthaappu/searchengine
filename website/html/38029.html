[[Image:Traffic camera - Lake Albert Road and Sturt Highway.jpg|thumb|Traffic camera mounted on a traffic light pole at a intersection on the [[Sturt Highway]] in [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales|Wagga Wagga]].]]A '''traffic camera''' is a [[video camera]] which [[observe]]s vehicular [[traffic]] on a [[road]].  Typically, these are put along major roads such as [[highway]]s, [[freeway]]s, [[motorway]]s, [[autoroute]]s and [[expressway]]s, as well as [[arterial road]]s, and are connected with [[optical fiber]]s buried alongside or even under the road.  A [[Surveillance|monitoring]] center receives the live [[video]] in real time, and serves as a [[dispatcher]] if there is an [[traffic collision]] or some other disruptive incident or [[road safety]] issue.  [[Internet]] users can often view [[screenshot|individual frame]]s posted to a [[website]] every few minutes, and can then determine whether an alternate [[road number|route]] should be taken.

Traffic cameras are a major part of most [[intelligent transportation system]]s.  They are especially valuable in [[tunnel]]s, where safety equipment can be activated [[remote control|remote]]ly based upon information provided by the cameras and other [[sensor]]s.  On surface roads, they are typically mounted on high [[Utility pole|pole]]s or [[Radio masts and towers|mast]]s, sometimes along with [[street light]]s.  On arterial roads, they are often mounted on [[traffic light]] poles at [[intersection (road)|intersection]]s, where problems are most likely to occur.

Traffic cameras are distinct from [[road safety camera]]s, which are put in specific places to [[enforce]] [[Traffic#Rules of the road|rules of the road]].  Those cameras take [[still photo]]s in a much higher [[image resolution]] upon a [[Image trigger|trigger]], whereas traffic cameras are simply for observation and constantly take lower-resolution full-motion video.

Online Traffic Cameras are cameras linked to online websites that enable the public to view real time traffic conditions online. These [[webcam]]s usually refresh every minute and can be viewed from official websites.
