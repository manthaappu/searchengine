The '''Hybricon SFF-4 Small Form Factor''' is a baseplate conduction cooled [[chassis]]<ref>http://www.vmecritical.com/articles/id/?4264</ref> designed for rugged environments with airborne and ground mobile applications, extended temperature, as well as extended shock & vibration tolerance. It was developed by [[Hybricon Corporation]] and is the first ever chassis designed to comply to [[OpenVPX]], [[VPX]] and REDI draft specifications.  

At MILCOM 2009, Hybricon along with [[Curtiss-Wright]] Controls released the Hybricon SFF-4 Small Form Factor conduction-cooled chassis integrated with Curtiss-Wright Controls' small form factor 3U OpenVPX-compliant cards, including [[single-board computers]], expansion carrier cards and [[graphics controller]] OpenVPX-compliant boards in the first display of a live OpenVPX system.  The SFF-4 is designed in a supporting role for input/output for airborne and ground vehicle control applications, supporting [[I/O]] for [[Ethernet]], [[Serial communication|serial]], [[video]], [[MIL-STD-1553|1553]] or [[Canbus]].<ref>http://www.mil-embedded.com/news/Technology+Partnerships/19459</ref> The SFF-4 also can be customized to different I/O complements can be supported with a different backplane.  The SFF-4 chassis is designed specifically for use for rugged environment in MIL-STD-704F aircraft and MIL-STD-1275B vehicles for airborne and ground mobile applications.<ref>http://www.defensesystems.com/Articles/2009/10/20/Open-VPX-demonstration.aspx</ref>
