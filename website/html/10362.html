The '''Digital Hybrid Process''' is a process in [[photography]].

This category of Digital [[Photography]] starts where digital
drawing/painting leaves off and can combine all the previous groups.
It also includes digital imagery that takes advantage of [[3D Computer Aided Design|3D]] modeling software, [[fractal mathematics]], "machine art," Algorithmic art, Automatic filters, plus Alternative photo process, silk screen digital etc.

Many are purely mechanical, utilizing the computer to almost any software as in paint by numbers. Almost anyone can do this and become an artist.
