The term '''self-hosting''' was coined to refer to the use of a [[computer program]] as part of the [[toolchain]] or [[operating system]] that produces new versions of that same program—for example, a [[compiler]] that can compile its own [[source code]]. Self-hosting software is commonplace on [[personal computer]]s and larger systems. Other programs that are typically self-hosting include [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]]s, [[Assembly language#Assembler|assemblers]], [[shell (computing)|shell]]s and [[revision control|revision control software]].

If a system is so new that no software has been written for it, then software is developed on another self-hosting system and placed on a [[computer storage|storage]] device that the new system can read. Development continues this way until the new system can reliably host its own development. Development of the [[Linux]] operating system, for example, was initially hosted on a [[Minix]] system. Writing new software development tools "from the metal" (that is, without using another host system) is rare and in many cases impractical.

== History ==
{{Main|History of compiler writing}}

The first self-hosting compiler (excluding assemblers and [[living organisms]]) was written for [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] by Hart and Levin at MIT in 1962.  They wrote a Lisp compiler in Lisp, testing it inside an existing Lisp interpreter. Once they had improved the compiler to the point where it could compile its own source code, it was self-hosting.<ref name="LEVIN"/>

:''The compiler as it exists on the standard compiler tape is a machine language program that was obtained by having the [[S-expression]] definition of the compiler work on itself through the interpreter.'' (AI Memo 39)<ref name="LEVIN">{{cite web | title=AI Memo 39-The new compiler| author=Tim Hart and Mike Levin | url=ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/pdf/AIM-039.pdf | accessdate=2008-05-23}}</ref>

This technique is only possible when an interpreter already exists for the very same language that is to be compiled. It borrows directly from the notion of running a program on itself as input, which is also used in various proofs in [[theoretical computer science]], such as the proof that the [[halting problem]] is undecidable.

== Examples ==
Several [[programming language]]s are self-hosting, in the sense that a compiler for the language can be written in that same language. Self-hosting is an attribute of a particular language implementation and not of the programming language in general. The first compiler for a new programming language can be written in another language (in rare cases, [[Machine code|machine language]]) or can be produced using [[Bootstrapping (compilers)|bootstrapping]]. Programming languages which have been self-hosted include [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[BASIC]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[CoffeeScript]], [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]], [[FASM]], [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Modula-2]], [[OCaml]], [[Oberon (programming language)|Oberon]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[PyPy|Python]], [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] and [[Smalltalk]].

Self-hosting is also a term used for any individual who hosts their own website themselves rather than use the services of an ISP (Internet Service Provider). Self-hosting is gaining popularity as broadband speeds increase and the necessity to retain privacy of information or intellectual property increases. There are several benefits to self-hosting including unlimited file storage space, ease of access to a home network, privacy of information and speed of access when on a local home network.
