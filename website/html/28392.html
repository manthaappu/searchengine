In [[set theory]], a '''paradoxical set''' is a set that has a ''paradoxical decomposition''. A paradoxical decomposition of a set is a [[partition of a set|partitioning]] of the set into exactly two subsets, along with an appropriate [[Group (mathematics)|group]] of functions that operate on some universe (of which the set in question is a subset), such that each partition can be mapped back onto the entire set using only finitely many distinct functions (or compositions thereof) to accomplish the mapping. Since a paradoxical set as defined requires a suitable group <math>G</math>, it is said to be <math>G</math>-paradoxical, or paradoxical with respect to <math>G</math>.

Paradoxical sets exist as a consequence of the [[Axiom of Infinity]]. Admitting infinite classes as sets is sufficient to allow paradoxical sets.

== Examples ==
=== Natural numbers ===

An example of a paradoxical set is the [[natural numbers]].  They are paradoxical with respect to the group of functions <math>G</math> generated by the natural function <math>f</math>:

<math>
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
    n/2, & \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is even} \\
    (n+1)/2, & \mbox{if }n\mbox{ is odd}
\end{cases}
</math>

Split the natural numbers into the odds and the evens. The function <math>f</math> maps both sets onto the whole of <math>\mathbb{N}</math>. Since only finitely many functions were needed, the naturals are <math>G</math>-paradoxical.

=== Banach–Tarski paradox ===

The most famous, and indeed motivational, example of paradoxical sets is the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]], which divides the sphere into paradoxical sets for the [[special orthogonal group]]. This result depends on the [[axiom of choice]].
