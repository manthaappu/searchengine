<html> <head> <title>OpenGL Utility Toolkit</title></head><body>The '''OpenGL Utility Toolkit''' ('''GLUT''') is a [[library (computing)|library]] of utilities for [[OpenGL]] programs, which primarily perform system-level [[input/output|I/O]] with the host [[operating system]]. Functions performed include window definition, window control, and monitoring of [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[Computer mouse|mouse]] input. Routines for drawing a number of geometric primitives (both in solid and wireframe mode) are also provided, including [[cube (geometry)|cubes]], [[sphere]]s, and the [[Utah teapot]]. GLUT even has some limited support for creating pop-up menus.

GLUT was written by [[Mark Kilgard|Mark J. Kilgard]], author of ''OpenGL Programming for the X Window System'' and ''The Cg Tutorial: The Definitive Guide to Programmable Real-Time Graphics'', while he was working for [[Silicon Graphics]] Inc.

The two aims of GLUT are to allow the creation of rather portable code between operating systems (GLUT is [[cross-platform]]) and to make learning OpenGL easier. Getting started with OpenGL programming while using GLUT often takes only a few lines of code and does not require knowledge of operating system–specific windowing [[application programming interface|APIs]].

All GLUT functions start with the <code>glut</code> prefix (for example, <code>glutPostRedisplay</code> marks the current window as needing to be redrawn).

== Implementations ==

The original GLUT library by Mark Kilgard supports the [[X Window System]] ([[GLX]]) and was ported to [[Microsoft Windows]] ([[WGL (software)|WGL]]) by [[Nate Robins]]. Additionally, [[Mac OS X]] ships with a GLUT framework that supports its own NSGL/[[Core OpenGL|CGL]].

Kilgard's GLUT library is no longer maintained, and its license did not permit the redistribution of modified versions of the library. This spurred the need for [[free software]] or [[open source]] reimplementations of the API from scratch. The first such library was [[freeglut]], which aims to be a reasonably close reproduction, though introducing a small number of new functions to deal with GLUT's limitations. [http://sourceforge.net/projects/openglut/ OpenGLUT], a [[fork (software)|fork]] of freeglut, adds a number of new features to the original API, but work on it ceased in May 2005.

== Limitations ==

Some of GLUT's original design decisions made it hard for programmers to perform desired tasks. This led many to create non-canon patches and extensions to GLUT.[http://www.mathies.com/glfaq/GLToolkitFAQ.html#II] Some [[free software]] or [[open source]] reimplementations also include fixes.

Some of the more notable limitations of the original GLUT library include:
* The library requires programmers to call <code>glutMainLoop()</code>, a function which never returns. This makes it hard for programmers to integrate GLUT into a program or library which wishes to have control of its own event loop. A common patch to fix this is to introduce a new function, often called <code>glutCheckLoop()</code>, which runs only a single iteration of the GLUT event loop. Another common workaround is to run GLUT's event loop in a separate [[thread (computing)|thread]], although this may vary by operating system, and also may introduce [[synchronization (computer science)|synchronization]] issues or other problems: for example, the Mac OS X GLUT implementation requires that <code>glutMainLoop()</code> be run in the main thread.
* The fact that <code>glutMainLoop()</code> never returns also means that a GLUT program cannot exit the event loop. [[freeglut]] fixes this by introducing a new function, <code>glutLeaveMainLoop()</code>.
* The library terminates the process when the window is closed; for some applications this may not be desired. Thus, many implementations include an extra callback, such as <code>glutWMCloseFunc()</code>.

Since it is no longer maintained (essentially replaced by the [[OpenSource]] [[freeglut]]) the above design issues are still not resolved in the original GLUT.
