A long term [[experiment]] is an experimental procedure that runs through a long period of time, in order to test a [[hypothesis]] or observe a phenomenon that takes place at an extremely slow rate.

Several agricultural [[field experiment]]s have run for more than 100 years, but much shorter experiments may qualify as "long-term" in other disciplines.  An [[experiment]] is "a set of actions and observations", implying that one or more treatments (fertilizer, subsidized school lunches, etc.) is imposed on the system under study.  Long-term experiments therefore contrast with nonexperimental long-term studies in which manipulation of the system studied is impossible (Jupiter's [[Great Red Spot]]) or undesirable (field observations of [[chimpanzee]] behavior).

==Physics==

Visible sunspot measurements have been made since the 18th century.

The [[Oxford Electric Bell]] has been ringing at [[Oxford University]] since 1840, although there is some reason to believe it may be 15 years older.

The [[Beverly Clock]] at the [[University of Otago]] has been running since 1864.

The [[pitch drop experiment]] has been running at the [[University of Queensland]] since 1927.

[[Arthur Covington]]'s microwave solar observatory has been running since 1947, currently at the [[Dominion Astrophysical Observatory]].

==Long-term agricultural field experiments==
Long-term experiments test the sustainability of different farming practices, as measured by yield trends over decades.  Examples include the [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]] (1843–present), the [[Morrow Plots]] (1876–present), Alabama's [[Old Rotation]] (1896–present), and the [[Haughley Experiment]] (1939-1972?).  

Experiments at Rothamsted showed that "grain yields can be sustained (and even increased) for almost 150 years in monocultures of wheat and barley given organic or inorganic fertilizer annually"<ref>Agronomy Journal 83:2-10</ref>. These results show that practices considered unsustainable by some advocates of [[sustainable agriculture]] may preserve "the ability of a farm to produce perpetually", at least under some circumstances.  But even if [[crop diversity]] in space or time ([[crop rotation]]) and organic inputs are not always essential to sustainability, there is abundant evidence from Rothamsted and elsewhere that they are often beneficial.  

The Haughley Experiment was noteworthy as a rare example of a long-term experiment in organic farming without external inputs of nutrients.  After about 30 years, however, it was decided to start importing manure.  There is some disagreement whether a "decline in relative yields from the organic section" was due to a depletion of soil nutrients<ref>Agriculture Ecosystems and Environment 30:1-26</ref>.    

Various short-term experiments have used legumes (in symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing [[rhizobia]]) as a nitrogen source, but good short-term yields do not prove the system is sustainable.  The problem is that release of nitrogen from soil organic matter can make up any shortfall of nitrogen from legumes for a decade or more. The Old Rotation showed that nitrogen from legumes can balance N removed in a harvested crop over the long term.  A key point is that the N in the legumes was not removed, as it would be with a soybean crop, but was plowed under as a green manure.  In the Old Rotation, the green manure was grown during the winter to supply N to a summer crop (cotton); this would be less practical in colder climates. 

Long-term agricultural experiments that have been started more recently include the Long-Term Research on Agricultural Systems experiments at UC Davis, started in 1993.

==Long-term ecological experiments==

The US National Science Foundation supports a number of long-term ecological experiments, mostly in ecosystems that are less directly impacted by humans than most agricultural ecosystems are.  See [[LTER]].

==Long-term experiments in evolutionary biology==
The experiments of [[Richard Lenski]] on [[E. coli long-term evolution experiment|evolution of E. coli]] have been underway for more than 20,000 generations.<ref>PNAS June 10, 2008 vol.105 no.23  7899-7906</ref> Experiments with the evolution of maize under artificial selection for oil and protein content <ref>Crop Science 9:179-181</ref> represent more years but far fewer generations (only 65).

==Medicine==

The Laboratory of Adult Development in the Department of Psychiatry at [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], a [[Harvard Medical School]] affiliate, is conducting a [[longitudinal study]] of human [[adult development]], by following two groups of individuals (268 [[Harvard University|Harvard]] graduates and 456 males from inner-city [[Boston]]) as they age. The study has been ongoing for 68 years and is currently the longest running study of adult life ever conducted.<ref>http://adultdev.bwh.harvard.edu/research-SAD.html</ref>
