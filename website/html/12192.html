'''Enigform''' is a [[Mozilla Firefox]] extension authored by Arturo '[[Buanzo]]' Busleiman which uses [[GnuPG]] to implement [[OpenPGP]]-signed HTTP requests. As of June/2007, OpenPGP encryption is being implemented. Some people believe it to be an alternative for the [[Secure Sockets Layer]] method for encrypting [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (or ''HTTP'') connections. However, the author never had such an intention in his mind. Guaranteeing the identity of a requester and the integrity of the request is Enigform's primary goal, through the use of [[digital signatures]]. In this instance, requests are [[form (web)|form]] submissions to web servers.  [[Apache HTTP server]] support via the [[mod_openpgp]] module currently supports request verification.

The project got its initial funding from [[OWASP]] in 2007. As of 2010, a secure instant messaging system based on Enigform and HTTPS has been announced during the OWASP Ibero-American Web-Application Security Conference.

[[Vinton Cerf]] said that Enigform and mod_openpgp "[this] strikes me as a really interesting idea and I hope you ([[Buanzo]]) will pursue it with the W3C." (February 18, 2008).

As of September 2, 2008 Enigform was granted the Trusted status on the Addons.Mozilla.Org website. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.buanzo.com.ar/2008/09/enigform-granted-trusted-status-in-addonsmozillaorg.html|title=Enigform granted Trusted Status in addons.mozilla.org|publisher=''[[Buanzo]]''|writer=Buanzo|date=2008-09-02}}</ref>

On March 9, 2009, [[Buanzo]] committed to the mod_openpgp Subversion repository a Wordpress plugin (wp-enigform-authentication) that enables Enigform-based login to a Wordpress blog admin/user interface. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://twitter.com/buanzo/status/1301587617|title=Enigform for Wordpress twit|publisher=''[[Buanzo]]''|writer=Buanzo|date=2009-03-09}}</ref>

On April 23rd, 2009, Enigform was declared Finalist in the Security category of Les Trophees du Libre, and was awarded the second prize.

As of May 13th, 2010, the author has not received the prize money from the Les Trophees du Libre parent company, Cetril, and it seems the company has vanished.
