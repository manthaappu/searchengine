'''Cheetah3d''' is a [[computer graphics]] program for [[3D modelling]], animation and rendering. It is written in [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] for [[Mac OS X]]. The program is aimed at beginning and amateur 3D artists. It offers a number of medium- and high-end features in conjunction with a relatively simple [[GUI|user interface]]. Its simplicity <ref>[http://www.maclife.com/article/cheetah_3d MacLife Review]</ref> is what makes it stand apart from other programs. It was initially released in 2003 <ref>[http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/21398&vid=125105&mode=info Versiontracker.com]</ref>, and is available as a [[Universal binary]] for [[Mac OS X]] <ref>[http://www.macworld.com/article/49508/2006/02/cheetah3d.html MacWorld.com]</ref>. A single user license is $149 [[United States dollar|US]]. A free demo version is available, without the ability to save or export models.

==Features==
Cheetah3D is aimed primarily at amateur artists, and so focuses on providing features for creating simple 3D scenes. Its selection of features is narrow but focused to add in its usefulness and simplicity. For example, it supports a variety of geometric primitives, including [[polygon]] meshes and [[Bezier curve]]s. Its features also allow for [[box modeling]] with [[subdivision surfaces]] In addition, it has some simple animation support, including spline-based camera paths and targeted objects. It also supports skeletal deformations, morph targets, and [[subdivision surfaces]], making its character animation effective. 

The program also has advanced rendering settings, which allow for [[antialiasing]], [[Ray tracing (graphics)|raytraced]] shadows, [[depth of field]], [[High dynamic range imaging|HDRI]], [[ambient occlusion]], [[Caustic (optics)|caustics]] lighting, soft shadowing and photon-mapped caustics.

The program uses many of the common 3D file formats, including 3ds, obj, sia, and FBX. Media produced by the program can also be used in [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]], which is a game development tool.

Cheetah3D 5.0 was released on 8 October 2009<ref>[http://www.cheetah3d.com/news.php cheetah3d.com/news]</ref>. Added features include a node-based material system, an improved render engine, new modelling tools such as a bevel tool and a bend modifier, and  Collada file format support. This version requires at least [[Mac OS X v10.4]], but is also compatible with [[Mac OS X v10.5]] and [[Mac OS X v10.6]]<ref>[http://www.macnn.com/articles/09/09/07/cheetah.3d.update.supports.snow.leopard/ MacNN.com]</ref>.
