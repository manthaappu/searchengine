<html> <head> <title>Robotics Certification Standards Alliance</title></head><body>The '''Robotics Certification Standards Alliance''' (RCSA) is a global company that has been actively providing robotics curriculums, training, online testing systems and certification since 1998.

RCSA first started with partnerships with [[Motoman]] and Private Career Colleges in [[Canada]]. The partnerships grew to have included  [[ABB Group|ABB]], [[Motoman]] and [[Panasonic]]. In 2006 RCSA was invited to join the [[American Welding Society|American Welding Society (AWS)]] D16 committee to provide robotics and testing expertise in the development of Americaâ€™s first robotic welding exam (CRAW). RCSA accepted this challenge and worked alongside [[Lincoln Electric|Lincoln Electric Automation]], [[ABB Group|ABB]] and Wolf Robotics to develop the details and procedures of the CRAW which was launched in June 2008.

In 2009 the RCSA redesigned the [[American Welding Society|AWS]] CRAW course to fit the needs of a
global market. This International Robotic Welding Certification (Certified Robotic Welder - CRW) was developed and launched early 2010.

The RCSA gained recognition in 2009 by the [[Government of Canada]] and the
[[Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities (Ontario)|Ministry of Training Colleges and Universities (MTCU)]] as the robotics subject matter experts in [[North America]].
