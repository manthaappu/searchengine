In this method, the entries that hash to the same slot of the table are organized as separate second-level hash table.  If there are ''k'' entries in this set, the second-level table is allocated with ''k''<sup>2</sup> slots, and its [[hash function]] is selected at random from a [[universal hash function]] set so that it is collision-free (i.e. a [[perfect hash function]]). Therefore, the lookup cost is guaranteed to be constant [[worst-case complexity|in the worst-case]].

Although each second-level table requires quadratic space, if the keys inserted into the first-level hash table are [[uniform random variable|uniformly distributed]], the structure as a whole occupies expected [[big O notation|O(''n'')]] space, since bucket sizes are small with high [[probability]].<ref name="inventor"/>

If a collision occurs during the insertion of a new entry, the bucket's second-level table is rebuilt with a different randomly-selected hash function. Because the [[load factor (hash table)|load factor]] of the second-level table is kept low (1/''k''), rebuilding is infrequent, and the [[amortized analysis|amortized]] cost of insertions is low.
