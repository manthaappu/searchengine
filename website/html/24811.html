A '''mobile office''' is an office built within a truck, [[motorhome]], trailer or purpose built [[intermodal container|shipping container]]. Most common are towable offices built on an axled iron frame for easy relocation. Mobile field offices are often found on [[construction site]]s, or at [[disaster]] scenes where a temporary office space is needed. Typically, mobile offices in North America feature a single phase split (240 volt center-tapped) electric service that is connected to a nearby source of power, to run small window-unit air conditioners, and the like. There are many types of companies that sell, lease, rent new and used [[intermodal container|storage containers]], [[portable building]]s or [[modular building]]s. This type of construction shortens the construction period as the building can be built in a factory in as little as six weeks and the site and utility work can be done in conjunction with the construction of the building.

'''Mobile office''' is also used for the workspace of [[salesperson|salespeople]] or similar, working out of their company office.  They are usually equipped with a [[portable computer]] and connect to the company servers and [[Intranet]] via [[mobile phone]]s, [[WiFi]] or via fixed connections in [[cybercafe]]s, [[hotel]]s and [[airport]]s. They like to use [[Personal information manager|Personal Information Managers]]

Because they must carry their equipment, mobile office workers push for [[miniaturization]] of devices.
