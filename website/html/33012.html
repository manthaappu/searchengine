'''STARAN''' might be the first commercially available computer designed around an [[associative memory]].  The STARAN computer was designed and built by [[Goodyear Aerospace Corporation]].  It is a [[Content Addressable Parallel Processor]](CAPP), a type of [[Parallel computing|parallel processor]] which uses [[Content-addressable memory | content addressable memory]].  STARAN is a [[SIMD | single instruction, multiple data]] array processor with a 4x256 1-bit processing element (PE) computer. The STARAN machines became available in 1972.

Goodyear Aerospace later developed the [[Goodyear MPP | MPP]] based on similar principles but with a larger and wider processor array.
