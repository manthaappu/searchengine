'''Dynamic device mapping''' is a technology for [[USB]] [[KVM switch]]es which is sometimes implemented as an alternative to standard [[USB]] [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] and [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] emulation.

== Design ==
With DDM (Dynamic Device Mapping) Technology, the communication between shared [[peripherals]] and all connected systems are maintained 100% of the time, even as a user switches between the KVM ports.  This makes generic device emulation unnecessary as the DDM allows each connected computer system to believe all connected [[I/O]] devices are remaining connected even as the [[KVM switch]] might move to another port.

==KVM device emulation==
Many USB [[KVM Switch|KVM devices]] provide [[Hardware emulation|peripheral emulation]], sending signals to the computers that are not currently selected to simulate a keyboard, mouse and monitor being connected. The emulation is used to avoid problems with machines which may reboot in unattended operation. [[Hardware emulation|Peripheral emulation]] services embedded in the hardware also provides continuous support where computers require constant communication with the [[peripheral]]s.  In addition, some types of computer systems do not treat [[USB]] devices as [[hot-swappable|hot-pluggable]], which means the keyboard and mouse will not be re-detected when switching back to a particular KVM port.  For these types of systems, it is necessary to implement device emulation.

Standard device emulation has its limitations.  When emulating a [[USB]] keyboard, mouse, and monitor it is impossible for most KVM's to simulate various different types of I/O devices specifically.  As a result, [[KVM switch]]es will sometimes offer inconsistent performance and even sometimes unsolved compatibility issues with the shared keyboard, mouse, and other devices.<ref>[http://forums.microsoft.com/TechNet/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1454220&SiteID=17 Kengsington Expert Mouse Issues. - TechNet Forums<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The intent of Dynamic Device Mapping is to resolve the issues that standard device mapping sometimes faces.

== Applications for USB DDM ==
* Sharing Touchscreen Monitor among connected systems
* Integrated Multi-vendor [[Self-service kiosk|Self-service Kiosk systems]]
* Secured user login by sharing USB [[Smart card]] or fingerprint/[[Biometrics]] scanner/reader''
