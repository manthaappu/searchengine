'''xCAT''' (Extreme Cluster Administration Toolkit) is [[open-source software|open-source]] ''[[distributed computing]] management software'' used for the deployment and administration of clusters. It can:

* create and manage diskless clusters
* install and manage many Linux cluster machines in parallel
* set up a high-performance computing software stack, including software for batch job submission, parallel libraries, and other software that is useful on a cluster
* cloning and imaging Linux and Windows machines

xCAT has specific features designed to take advantage of [[IBM]] hardware including:
* Remote Power Control
* Remote POST/BIOS console
* Serial over LAN functions
* Hardware alerts and vitals provided via SNMP and EMAIL
* Inventory and hardware management

xCAT achieved recognition in June 2008 for having been used with the [[IBM Roadrunner]], which set a [[Instructions per second|computing speed]] record at that time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/US_energy_department_reveals_world%27s_fastest_computer |title=US energy department reveals world's fastest computer |publisher=Wikinews |date=2008-06-10 |accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.doe.gov/news/6321.htm |title=U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s New Supercomputer is Fastest in the World |publisher=US Department of Energy |date=2008-06-09 |accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref>.

xCAT is the default systems management tool of the [[IBM System Cluster 1350|IBM Intelligent Cluster]] solution.
