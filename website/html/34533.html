'''Single machine scheduling''' or '''single resource scheduling''' is the process of assigning a group of tasks to a single machine or resource. The tasks are arranged so that one or many performance measures may be optimized.

==Performance Measures==
The performance measures of the tasks in the single machine scheduling problem include:
*[[Tardiness]] - <math>max(0, receipt\;date - due\;date)</math> 
*[[Earliness]] - <math>max(0, due\;date - receipt\;date)</math>
*[[Lateness]] - <math>receipt\;date - due\;date</math>
*[[Flowtime]] - <math>end\;date - start\;date</math>

==Solution Techniques==
Many solution techniques have been applied to solving single machine scheduling problems. Some of them are listed below.

===Heuristics===
*Shortest Processing Time (SPT)
:The SPT schedule is optimal if the objective is to minimize the average flowtime.

*Earliest Due Date (EDD)
:The EDD schedule is optimal if the objective is to minimize the maximum lateness.

===Computational===
*[[Genetic Algorithm]]s
*[[Neural Network]]s
*Simulated Annealing
*Ant Colonies
