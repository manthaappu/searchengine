'''''The Matrix Reloaded''''' is a 2003 American [[science fiction film]] and the second installment in [[The Matrix (franchise)|''The Matrix'' trilogy]], written and directed by the [[Wachowski brothers]]. It premiered on May 7, 2003, in [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California]], and went on general release by [[Warner Bros.]] in [[North America]]n theaters on May 15, 2003, and around the world during the latter half of that month. It was also screened out of competition at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name="festival-cannes.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4075505/year/2003.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Matrix Reloaded |accessdate=2009-11-10|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> The [[video game]] ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'', which was released on May 15, and a collection of nine animated shorts, ''[[The Animatrix]]'', which was released on June 3, supported and expanded the storyline of the movie. ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', which completes the story, was released six months after ''Reloaded'', in November 2003.

==Plot==
[[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] wakes from a nightmare in which [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]] is shot by an agent of the Matrix while falling from a building. [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] receives a message from Captain [[Niobe (The Matrix)|Niobe]] ([[Jada Pinkett Smith]]) of the ''[[Logos (The Matrix)|Logos]]'' calling an emergency meeting of all of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]]'s hovercraft. Zion has confirmed the last [[Final Flight of the Osiris|transmission]] of the ''Osiris'': an army of Sentinels is tunneling towards Zion and will reach it within 72 hours. [[List of minor characters in the Matrix series#Lock|Commander Lock]] ([[Harry Lennix|Harry J. Lennix]]), the ranking [[military officer]] of Zion, orders all ships to return to Zion to prepare for the onslaught. Morpheus asks a ship to remain in order to contact the Oracle, in defiance of Commander Lock's orders. The ''[[List of ships in the Matrix series#Caduceus|Caduceus]]'' receives a message from the Oracle, and the ''[[List of ships in the Matrix series#Nebuchadnezzar ("Neb")|Nebuchadnezzar]]'' ventures out so Neo can contact her. One of the ''Caduceus''' crew, [[List of minor characters in the Matrix series#Bane|Bane]], encounters [[Agent Smith]], who takes over Bane's avatar. Smith then leaves the Matrix, gaining control of Bane's real body.

In Zion's temple, Morpheus announces the news of the advancing machines to the people. Neo receives a message from the Oracle and returns to the Matrix, meeting her. After realizing that the Oracle is part of the Matrix, Neo asks how he can trust her; she replies that it is his decision. The Oracle explains that she is an exiled program and instructs Neo to reach the Source of the Matrix by finding the [[Keymaker (The Matrix)|Keymaker]], a prisoner in the home of the [[Merovingian (The Matrix)|Merovingian]]. The Keymaker makes keys that can open portals hidden within the Matrix. As the Oracle departs, Smith appears, telling Neo that after being defeated, he knew he was supposed to return to the Source to be deleted, but refused, and is now not bound to remove threats from the Matrix. He demonstrates his ability to clone himself using other people in the Matrix as hosts. He then tries to absorb Neo as a host, but fails, prompting a fight between Neo and Smith's clones. Neo is more than a match for each clone individually, and is able to more than hold his own against the growing army of Smith clones. Unfortunately, Smith's clones keep coming in more and more numbers, until eventually, overwhelmingly outnumbered, Neo flees.

Neo, Morpheus and Trinity visit the Merovingian and ask for the Keymaker, but the Merovingian refuses. His wife [[Persephone (The Matrix)|Persephone]], tired of her husband's attitude, betrays him and leads the trio to the Keymaker, allowing one of the Merovingian's henchmen to escape and notify him of it. The Merovingian soon appears and, while Morpheus, Trinity, and the Keymaker escape, Neo fights the Merovingian's henchmen and ends up in an unknown mountain range. He then heads for town, where Morpheus and Trinity are trying to escape with the Keymaker on the highway, facing several Agents and [[Twins (The Matrix)|The Twins]]. Ultimately, the Twins are destroyed, and Neo saves Morpheus and the Keymaker. 

Zion's remaining ships prepare to battle the machines. Within the Matrix, the crews of the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', ''Vigilant'' and ''Logos'' help the Keymaker and Neo reach the door to the Source. The crew of the ''Logos'' must [[Enter The Matrix|destroy a power plant]] in order to prevent a security system from being triggered by the Keymaker's keys, and the crew of the ''Vigilant'' must destroy a back-up power station. The ''Logos'' is successful, while the ''Vigilant'' is bombed by a Sentinel, killing everyone on board. Although Neo requested that Trinity remain on the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', she destroys the back-up station. However, her escape is compromised by an agent, and they fight. As Neo, Morpheus and the Keymaker reach the Source through a hallway of shortcuts to other doors in the Matrix, the Smiths appear and try to kill them. The Keymaker unlocks the door to the Source, allowing Neo and Morpheus to escape the Smiths, but the Keymaker is killed.

Neo meets an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] program called the [[Architect (The Matrix)|Architect]], the Matrix's creator. The Architect tells Neo that there have been multiple versions of the Matrix and multiple versions of the One, a computer anomaly used as a means of control. As humanity rejected the "perfect" Matrix as well as the dystopian Matrix, the machines realized that humanity needed to be offered the power of choice in order for them to accept it. The current Matrix is flawed and remains an unbalanced equation. The One is the sum of the remainder of that flaw. The One's purpose is to return to the Source, resetting the Matrix to its prime program. Afterwards, he will choose sixteen females and seven males to repopulate Zion and provide another round of humans for the "rebellion". Otherwise, the unresolved error will spiral out of control, destroying the humans connected to the Matrix, which coupled with the battle at Zion, will result in the [[Human extinction|extinction of the human race]]. Neo retorts that the machines need humans to survive and will not allow this; the Architect replies that, "there are levels of survival we are prepared to accept".

The Architect gives Neo a choice of two exits from the room: one door leads to the Source and the resetting of the Matrix, the other will lead to the Matrix's failure and humanity's destruction. Neo notices Trinity's battle with the agent on the viewscreens and returns to the Matrix to save her. Neo's love for Trinity is revealed as a new variable in the repetition of the Matrix – while the previous Ones had no reason to choose humanity's destruction over accepting their function, Neo chooses to save Trinity at the cost of mankind's survival, despite the near certainty that she will die anyway after Zion's destruction. 

Neo races to save Trinity, who is shot by an agent as they fall from a building but is caught by Neo before hitting the ground. He refuses to accept her death, removing the bullet and reviving her. On board the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', Neo reveals that the prophecy is false and Zion will be destroyed in twenty-four hours. Sentinels destroy the ship, whereupon Neo saves his friends by using a previously unknown power to disable the Sentinels, then falls unconscious. The crew is rescued by the hovercraft ''[[Mjolnir (“Hammer”)#Mjolnir (“Hammer”)|Mjolnir]]'' (also known as the ''Hammer''), whose crew explains that they were leading a pre-emptive attack on the Sentinels advancing on Zion. The strategy was to use the ships' [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]]s and stay out of each other's range, but an EMP was detonated by the ''Caduceus'' before the ships were in position. Multiple ships were left without power, with only a handful of survivors escaping, the Sentinels having destroyed any ship that could not escape. Once the machines returned to digging, the ''Mjolnir'' looked for survivors and found only one: the Smith-controlled Bane.

Zee was originally to be played by [[Aaliyah]], who died in a plane crash on August 25, 2001, before filming was complete.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/aaliyah-755377.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Aaliyah | date=August 27, 2001}}</ref><ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/08/27/aaliyah.obit/index.html Aaliyah: A 'beautiful person's' life cut short]</ref>

==Production==
''The Matrix Reloaded'' was largely filmed at [[Fox Studios Australia|Fox Studios]] in [[Australia]], concurrently with filming of the sequel, ''[[The Matrix Revolutions|Revolutions]]''. The [[freeway]] chase scene was filmed at the decommissioned [[Naval Air Station Alameda]] in [[Alameda, California]]. The producers constructed a 1.5-mile freeway on the old runways specifically for the film. Some portions of the chase were also filmed in [[Oakland, California]], and the tunnel shown briefly is the [[Webster Tube]], which connects Oakland and Alameda. Some post-production editing was also done in old aircraft hangars on the base as well.

The city of [[Akron, Ohio]] was willing to give full access to [[Ohio State Route 59|Route 59]], the stretch of freeway known as the "Innerbelt", for filming of the freeway chase when it was under consideration. However, producers decided against this as "the time to reset all the cars in their start position would take too long".<ref name=job>{{cite web |url=http://autos.msn.com/advice/article.aspx?contentid=4021949&src=News |title=Chasing the Stars: Carmakers in Movies |publisher=MSN.com |author=Ann Job |accessdate=2005-01-30 }}</ref> ''[[MythBusters]]'' would later reuse the Alameda location in order to explore the effects of a head-on collision between two semi trucks, and to perform various other experiments.

Around 97% of the materials from the sets of the film were [[recycled]] after production was completed; for example, tons of wood were sent to [[Mexico]] to build [[low-income housing]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/11/14/hollywood.pollution.ap/index.html  |title=Hollywood smog an inconvenient truth |publisher=Associated Press (CNN.com) |date=November 14, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061215051825/http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/11/14/hollywood.pollution.ap/index.html |archivedate = December 15, 2006}}</ref>

Some scenes from the film ''[[Baraka (film)|Baraka]]'' by [[Ron Fricke]] were selected to represent the real world shown by the wallmonitors in the [[Architect (The Matrix)|Architect's]] room.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234215/movieconnections |title=Movie connections for The Matrix Reloaded (2003) |publisher=Internet Movie Database (IMDB.com) |date=February 16, 2010 }}</ref>

===Sound design===
Sound editing on the Matrix Trilogy was completed by Danetracks in [[West Hollywood]], California.

===Music===
{{See also|The Matrix Reloaded: The Album}}
[[Don Davis (composer)|Don Davis]], who composed the music for ''The Matrix'', returned to score ''Reloaded''. For many of the pivotal action sequences, such as the "Burly Brawl", he collaborated with [[Juno Reactor]]. Some of the collaborative cues by Davis and Juno Reactor are extensions of material by Juno Reactor; for example, a version of "Komit" featuring Davis' strings is used during a flying sequence, and "Burly Brawl" is essentially a combination of Davis' unused "Multiple Replication" and a piece similar to Juno Reactor's "Masters of the Universe". One of the collaborations, "Mona Lisa Overdrive", is titled in reference to the [[cyberpunk]] [[Mona Lisa Overdrive|novel of the same name]] by [[William Gibson]], a major influence on the directors.
[[Leitmotif]]s established in ''The Matrix'' return - such as the Matrix main theme, Neo and Trinity's love theme, the Sentinel's theme, Neo's flying theme, and a more frequent use of the four-note Agent Smith theme - and others used in ''Revolutions'' are established.

As with its predecessor, many tracks by external musicians are featured in the movie, its closing credits, and the soundtrack album, some of which were written for the film. Many of the musicians featured, for example [[Rob Zombie]], [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], had also appeared on the soundtrack for ''The Matrix''. [[Rob Dougan]] also re-contributed, licensing the instrumental version of his eponymous "[[Furious Angels]]", as well as being commissioned to provide an original track, ultimately scoring the battle in the Merovingian's chateau. A remixed version of "[[Slap It (Fluke song)|Slap It]]" by electronic artist [[Fluke (band)|Fluke]] - listed on the soundtrack as "Zion" - was used during the rave scene.

[[Linkin Park]] contributed their instrumental song "Session" to the film as well, although it did not appear during the course of the film. [[P.O.D.]] composed a song called "[[Sleeping Awake]]", with a [[music video]] which focused heavily on Neo, as well as many images that were part of the film.

==Reception==
===Box office===

===Other release===
The film was initially banned in [[Egypt]], because of the violent content, and because it put into question issues about human creation "linked to the three monotheistic religions that we respect and which we believe in".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2980432.stm | title=Egypt bans 'too religious' Matrix |publisher=BBC News |date=June 11, 2003 |accessdate=2007-07-12 }}</ref> The Egyptian media claimed the film promoted [[Zionism]], as it talks about Zion and the dark forces that wish to destroy it. However, it was eventually allowed to be shown in theatres, and was later released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]].
