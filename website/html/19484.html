<html> <head> <title>JAL (compiler)</title></head><body>'''JAL (Just Another Language)''' is a [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]]-like [[programming language]] and [[compiler]] that generates executable code for [[PIC microcontroller]]s.  It is a free-format language with a compiler that runs on Linux, MS-Windows and MS-DOS (OSX support). It is configurable and extendable through the use of libraries and can even be combined with PIC assembly language. 

==History==
JAL was originally created by Wouter van Ooijen and released as [[free software]] under the [[GNU General Public License]] in 2003. In 2006, Stef Mientki initiated the development of a new version, JALV2, which was programmed by Kyle York and beta tested by an international user group.<ref>Beta testing by: Bert van Dam, Sunish Isaac, Dave Lagzdin, Javier Martinez, Stef Mientki, Wouter van Ooijen, Michael Reynolds, André Steenveld, Joep Suijs, Vasile Surducan, and Michael Watterson</ref>

==Sample code==
 -- JAL 2.3
 include 16f877_bert—define the variables
 var byte resist—define the pins
 pin_a0_direction = input—variable resistor
 pin_d7_direction = input—switch
 pin_c2_direction = output—pwm led—enable pulse width modulation
 PWM_init_frequency (true, true)
 
 forever loop—convert analog on a0 to digital
    resist = ADC_read_low_res(0)
 
    -- run measurement through flash memory
    program_eeprom_write(2000,resist)
    program_eeprom_read(2000,resist)
 
    -- run measurement through data memory
    data_eeprom_write(10,resist)
    data_eeprom_read(10,resist)
 
    -- if the switch is pressed return random value
    if pin_d7 == high then
       resist = random_byte
    end if—send resistance to PC
    serial_sw_write(resist)
    delay_100ms(1)
    -- set actual PWM duty cycle
    PWM_Set_DutyCycle (resist, resist)
 
 end loop
