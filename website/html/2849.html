'''Autodetection''' is an automatic detection of a thing or situation.

For example, an operating system system probes the [[computer hardware]], automatically determines what is installed in the computer and configures the [[Kernel (software engineering)|kernel]] to support the discovered hardware.

Autodetection is used by the [[Live CD]]s.
