'''Mesa 3D''' is an [[Open source software|open source]] <ref>[http://www.mesa3d.org/license.html mesa3d.org] license</ref><ref>[http://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/ freedesktop.org] Git source code repository</ref> [[3D computer graphics]] [[Library (computer science)|library]] that provides a generic [[OpenGL]] implementation for rendering three-dimensional graphics on multiple [[platform (computing)|platforms]]. It was initially developed by [[Brian Paul]] in August 1993.

As of April 2008, it is the only commonly known, fully [[open source]] implementation of OpenGL which is continually updated to support the latest OpenGL [[specification]]. It is widely used, most importantly by the [[X.Org]] implementation of the [[X Window System]] where it serves as the OpenGL core for the open-source X.Org/DRI OpenGL drivers. X.Org provides the essential functionality used by most graphical [[Application software|applications]] which run on [[Unix-like]] platforms such as [[GNU]]/[[Linux]].

It supports OpenGL version 2.1, along with several extensions from OpenGL 3 and 4.

== History ==
Initially, Mesa 3D started off by rendering all [[3D computer graphics]] on the [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]], but the architecture of Mesa 3D was open to implement [[graphics processing unit|graphics processor]]-accelerated 3D rendering in Mesa 3D. Once 3D [[graphics cards]] became mainstream on PC hardware, companies began working on adding support for hardware-accelerated 3D rendering to Mesa 3D. The library was one of the first drivers to support hardware-acceleration via the 3dfx [[Glide API]] driver for the very popular [[Voodoo Graphics|Voodoo]] I/II [[graphics card]]s and others as well. All rendering was done indirectly in the [[X server]], leaving some overhead and speed lagging behind the theoretical maximum. The [[Direct Rendering Infrastructure]] (DRI) finally succeeded in providing an interface for direct 3D rendering by the OpenGL applications and was officially added to Mesa 3D.

=== Features ===
* In its current form, Mesa 3D is available and can be compiled on virtually all modern platforms.
* Though not an official OpenGL implementation for licensing reasons, the Mesa 3D authors have worked to keep the API in line with the most current OpenGL standards and conformance tests, as set forth by the [[OpenGL Architecture Review Board]].
* Whilst Mesa 3D supports several hardware graphics accelerators, it may also be compiled as a software-only renderer.  Since it is also free/open source software, it is possible to use it to study the internal workings of an [[OpenGL]]-compatible renderer.
* It is sometimes possible to find subtle bugs in OpenGL applications by linking against Mesa 3D and using a conventional debugger to track problems into the lower level library.
* Already supports (at least partially) 3D acceleration managed cards : ATI Mach 64 and r100 to r800 chipsets, Intel chipsets, IBM/Toshiba/Sony Cell chip (in [[Gallium3D]] architecture) used in Sony PlayStation 3, limited Nvidia support, S3 Virge & Savage chipsets, VIA chipsets, Matrox G200 & G400 and more...<ref>[http://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/Status Direct Rendering Infrastructure Status Page] on freedesktop.org</ref>.
