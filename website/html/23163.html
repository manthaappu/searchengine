In order to change into Hyper Mode, the Robo Master gives the voice command '''"'''''(name of Leader Robo (Jet, Police, Drill, etc.))'' '''Robo! Hyper Mode! Gattai Hajime!"''' This translates to '''"'''''(name of Leader Robo (Jet, Police, Drill, etc.))'' '''Robo! Hyper Mode! Begin Fusion!"'''  While working for the Disasters, Jay uses the command '''"Stealth Robo!

With Taiyo's command, Jet Robo can combine with the Sky Robos to form Hyper Jet Robo or Shuttle Robo can combine with the Space Robos to become Hyper Shuttle Robo.

Originally, Stealth Robo is colored purple in all Vehicle, Robo and Hyper Modes and can unleash powerful beam blasts and missiles when he's Hyper Stealth Robo. But after Jay left the Disasters, the MRR remodeled him to become V-Stealth Robo, now colored white with purple accents. He may have the same ability as Stealth Robo but the 4 Tank Robos that combine with it were replaced with a special booster wing pack that combines with V-Stealth Robo to form Hyper V-Stealth Robo. This is because the 4 tank robos were destroyed by BL Hyper Drill Robo while he was holding the almost collapsing tower. Hyper Stealth Robo's special attack is '''Burst Tempest'''.

Pilots: Rin Haruka, Kai Kitazawa

Machine Commander is launched from the Slinger Catapult in the back of the base. If necessary, the launch of Machine Commander, including the Slinger Catapult, can be operated manually, as shown in episode 32. This is very tiring for those operating the catapult. If needed, Machine Commander can change into Machine Commander Robo while it has a Leader Robo loaded in each Commander. The command for this is '''"Machine Commander! Leader Gattai Hajime!"''' (lit. '''"Machine Commander! Leader Combine begin!"'''). Machine Commander Robo can release the leaders contained within itself, although it is unknown how many can be released at a time.
