<html> <head> <title>Don Lancaster</title></head><body>'''Donald E. Lancaster''' is a prolific [[author]], inventor, and microcomputer pioneer best known for his magazine columns. He is also known for his "[[TV Typewriter]]" dumb terminal project, his book on technical entrepreneurship ''The Incredible Secret Money Machine,'' and his work on and advocacy of early [[print-on-demand]] technology. Lancaster's print-on-demand technique, with which he self-published several books, employed hand-tuned [[PostScript]] code sent to a [[laser printer]] through the game port of an [[Apple II]] rather than, as was common at the time, a [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] running [[PageMaker]]. 
He helped design and manufacture the Apple I keyboard. He held a radio amateur license (K3BYG) for a short time. He sells electronic surplus on Ebay and participates regularly in the Ebay seller's forums.
