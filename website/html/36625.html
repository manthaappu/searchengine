<html> <head> <title>TA Luft</title></head><body>Germany has a well known [[air pollution]] control [[regulation]] entitled "Technical Instructions  on Air Quality Control" (Technische Anleitung zur Reinhaltung der Luft) and commonly referred to as the '''TA Luft'''.<ref name="TA Luft">[http://www.bmu.de/files/pdfs/allgemein/application/pdf/taluft_engl.pdf Complete text of the TA Luft]</ref> The first version of the TA Luft was established in 1964. It has subsequently been revised in 1974, 1983, 1988 and 2002.<ref>[http://www.inece.org/1stvol2/Ubing%20&%20Krop.htm History of the TA Luft]</ref> Parts of the TA Luft have been adopted by other countries as well.

In 1974, 10 years after the TA Luft was first established, the [[German government]] enacted the "Federal Air Pollution Control Act" (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz). It also has subsequently been amended a number of times, the last of which was in 2002.<ref>[http://www.bmu.de/files/pdfs/allgemein/application/pdf/bimschengl.pdf Complete text of the Federal Air Pollution Control Act]</ref> Although the first version of the TA Luft existed 10 years before the enactment of the "Federal Air Pollution Control Act", it is often called the "First General Administrative Regulation" pertaining to the "Federal Air Pollution Control Act".

The German government created the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and [[Nuclear safety|Nuclear Safety]] (Bundesministerium für Umwelt, Naturschutz und Reaktorsicherheit) in June, 1986<ref>[http://www.bmu.de/english/the_ministry/tasks/the_ministry/doc/3261.php Web site of the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety]</ref> and it is now responsible for implementing the TA Luft regulation under the "Federal Air Pollution Control Act".

==Overview of the TA Luft==

The TA Luft is a comprehensive air pollution control regulation that includes:

* A discussion of the scope of the TA Luft application which is to review applications for licenses to construct and operate new industrial facilities (or altered existing facilities) and to determine whether the proposed new or altered facilities will comply with the requirements of the TA Luft and the requirements of other air pollutant emission regulations promulgated under the Federal Air Pollution Control Act.

* Air pollutant emission limits  for [[dust]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrogen oxides]], [[hydrofluoric acid]] and other gaseous [[inorganic]] [[fluorine]] compounds, [[arsenic]] and inorganic arsenic compounds, [[lead]] and inorganic lead compounds, [[cadmium]] and inorganic cadmium compounds, [[nickel]] and inorganic nickel compounds, [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and inorganic mercury compounds, [[thallium]] and inorganic thallium compounds, [[ammonia]] from farming and livestock breeding operations, inorganic gases and [[particulates]], [[Organic chemistry|organic]] substances and others.

* Emission limits may also be set for hazardous, toxic, carcinogenic or mutagenic substances as part of the TA Luft review procedures.

* Other limits or requirements related to stack heights (for flue gases or other process vents) and for storing, loading or working with liquid or solid substances. 

* Various requirements for sampling measuring and monitoring emissions.

* Listing of the industries subject to the requirements of the TA Luft, such as [[mining]], [[power plant|electric power generation]], [[glass]] and ceramics, [[steel]], [[aluminum]] and other metals, [[chemical plant]]s, [[oil refinery|oil refining]], plastics, food, and others.

*Annex 3 is devoted to guidelines on: how the [[atmospheric dispersion modeling]] required during the TA Luft review is to be performed, and the acceptable type of dispersion model to be used. In essence, the modeling must be in accordance with the [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|VDI]] Guidelines 3782 Parts 1 and 2, 3783 Part 8, 3784 Part 2, and 3945 Part 3.<ref name="VDI">[http://www.vdi.de/vdi/english/index.php The VDI web site]</ref>

==AUSTAL2000==

[[AUSTAL2000]] is an [[atmospheric dispersion modeling|atmospheric dispersion model]] for simulating the dispersion of air pollutants in the ambient [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. It was developed by Ingenieurbüro Janicke<ref name="Janicke">[http://www.janicke.de/htm/e_home.htm Web site of Ingenieurbüro Janicke]</ref> in Dunum, Germany under contract to the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety.  Although not named in the TA Luft, it is the reference dispersion model accepted as being in compliance with the requirements of Annex 3 of the TA Luft and the pertinent VDI Guidelines.

It simulates the dispersion of air pollutants by utilizing a [[random walk]] process ([[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Lagrangian simulation model]]) and it has capabilities for [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|building effects]], complex terrain, [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|pollutant plume]] depletion by [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|wet or dry deposition]], and first order chemical reactions. It is available for download on the Internet free of cost.<ref name="AustalDownload">[http://www.austal2000.de/ Austal2000 download web site (in German)]</ref>

Austal2000G is a similar model for simulating the dispersion of odours and it was also developed by Ingenieurbüro Janicke. The development of Austal 2000G was financed by three German states: Niedersachsen, Nordrhein-Westfalen and Baden Württenberg.
