'''Minimum mode''' is one of two different [[hardware mode]]s of the [[Intel 8086]] and [[Intel 8088|8088]] processors ([[Central processing unit|CPU]]). The other is [[maximum mode]]. Mode selection is accomplished by how the chip is hard-wired in the circuit.  Specifically, pin #33 (MN/MX) is used to select the mode, depending on whether it is wired to voltage or to ground.  Changing the state of pin #33 changes the function of certain other pins.  Mode cannot be changed by software.
