'''OntoWiki''' is a free, [[open source software|open-source]] [[semantic wiki]] application, meant to serve as an [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]] editor and a [[Knowledge management|knowledge acquisition]] system. It is a web-based application written in [[PHP]] and using either a [[MySQL]] database or a [[Virtuoso Universal Server|Virtuoso triple store]]. In contrast to most semantic wikis, OntoWiki is form-based rather than syntax-based, and thus tries to hide as much of the complexity of knowledge representation formalisms from users as possible. OntoWiki is mainly being developed by the [http://aksw.org Agile Knowledge Engineering and Semantic Web (AKSW) research group] at the [[University of Leipzig]], a group also known for the [[DBpedia]] project among others, in collaboration with volunteers around the world.

In 2009 the AKSW research group got a budget of 425,000€ from the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany]] for the development of the OntoWiki.<ref>[http://idw-online.de/pages/de/news300375 "OntoWiki" hilft Daten im Web zu verknüpfen] (German)</ref>

In 2010 OntoWiki became part of the technology stack supporting the LOD2 (Linked Open Data) project. Leipzig University is one of the consortium members of the project, which is funded by a €6.5m EU grant<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=PROJ_ICT&ACTION=D&CAT=PROJ&RCN=95562 |publisher=European Commission |title=CORDIS FP7 ICT Projects - LOD2 |date=2010-04-20}}</ref>.
