'''Newsqueak''' is a [[concurrent programming|concurrent]] [[programming language]] for writing [[application software]] for [[windowing system]]s. It was designed at [[Bell Labs]] by [[Rob Pike]] in the late 1980s.

Newsqueak's syntax and semantics are influenced by the [[C (programming language)|C language]], but its approach to concurrency was inspired by [[C. A. R. Hoare]]'s [[communicating sequential processes]] (CSP). However, in Newsqueak, [[channel (programming)|channels]] are  [[first-class object]]s, with dynamic process creation and dynamic channel creation.

Newsqueak was developed from an earlier, smaller, language, called Squeak (not to be confused with the [[Smalltalk]] implementation [[Squeak]]). It was developed by [[Luca Cardelli]] and [[Rob Pike]] as a language for implementing [[graphical user interface]]s.

The ideas present in Newsqueak were further developed in the programming languages [[Alef (programming language)|Alef]], [[Limbo (programming language)|Limbo]], and [[Go (programming language)|Go]].
