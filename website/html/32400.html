In [[database]] technologies, a '''rollback''' is an operation which returns the database to some previous state. Rollbacks are important for database [[data integrity|integrity]], because they mean that the database can be restored to a clean copy even after erroneous operations are performed. They are crucial for recovering from database server crashes; by rolling back any [[Database transaction|transaction]] which was active at the time of the crash, the database is restored to a consistent state.

The rollback feature is usually implemented with a [[Database_log|transaction log]], but can also be implemented via [[multiversion concurrency control]].

==Cascading rollback==
A ''cascading rollback'' occurs in database systems when a transaction (T1) causes a failure and a rollback must be performed. Other transactions dependent on T1's actions must also be rollbacked due to T1's failure, thus causing a cascading effect. That is, one transaction's failure causes many to fail.

Practical database recovery techniques guarantee cascadeless rollback, therefore a cascading rollback is not a desirable result.

==SQL==
In [[SQL]], <code>ROLLBACK</code> is a command that causes all data changes since the last <code>[[Begin work (SQL)|BEGIN WORK]]</code>, or <code>[[Start transaction (SQL)|START TRANSACTION]]</code> to be discarded by the [[relational database management system]] (RDBMS), so that the state of the data is "rolled back" to the way it was before those changes were made.

A <code>ROLLBACK</code> statement will also release any existing [[savepoint]]s that may be in use.

In most SQL dialects, <code>ROLLBACK</code>s are connection specific.  This means that if two connections are made to the same database, a <code>ROLLBACK</code> made in one connection will not affect any other connections.  This is vital for proper [[Concurrent programming|concurrency]].
