'''pilot-link''' is a [[library (computing)|library]] of utilities for connecting to and synchronising with [[Palm OS]]-based [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]] on [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like|Unix-based]] [[operating system]]s. It uses a set of 'conduits' for the exchange of information from different Palm applications.

pilot-link provides [[command line]] tools to perform synchronisation tasks, such as the pilot-xfer command, which can install the standard Palm database ([[PDB (Palm OS)|PDB]]) files to the connected device. [[Graphical User Interface]]s for the pilot-link software include [[KPilot]], part of the [[KDE]]'s [[kdepim|Personal Information Management]] applications, and [[JPilot]], a [[GTK+]]-based interface.
