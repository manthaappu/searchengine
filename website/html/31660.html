'''Regional lockout''' is the programming practice, code, chip, or physical barrier used to prevent the playing of media designed for a device from the country where it is marketed on the version of the same device marketed in another country.

== Video games ==
In the [[video game industry]], [[Nintendo]] was the originator of regional lockout. Regional lockout in video games is when a piece of [[hardware]] is designed such that only [[Computer software|software]] for that region is compatible. Most commercially-released [[video game]]s have region encoding.

The main regions are:

* [[Japan]] ([[NTSC-J]])
* [[North America]] ([[NTSC|NTSC U/C]])
* [[Europe]] and [[Oceania]] ([[PAL]], [[PAL|PAL/E]])
* [[China]] ([[NTSC-C]])

The earliest cartridge-based electronic games, such as the [[Speak & Spell (toy)|Speak & Spell]] lacked regional lockout. Some modern consoles targeted at children such as V-Tech's [[V.Smile]] series of consoles are also known to be region free.

Most of Nintendo's handheld systems do not have regional lockout; because of this, [[International trade|import]] games can be played on those systems. In other words, a Japanese game would work on an American unit, although the game would likely not be in the user's native language and might be different from the product as released in other countries. Many people import games if the game is not released in their region or if it was released years or months before in a different region before it is released in the importer's region.

The immediate successor to the Nintendo DS, the [[Nintendo DSi]], is region-locked, but only in terms of its downloadable games. Physical DS game carts will play on it regardless of region of origin (DSi-only and even DSi-enhanced games are region-locked though). All Nintendo 3DS hardware and software is region-locked, however original DS software is not affected.<ref>[http://ds.ign.com/articles/114/1144399p1.html Nintendo Explains Region Locking]</ref>

The [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] has no region locking for [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] games, except for a single title: ''BattleZone''. However, [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] movies are locked by region. Furthermore, the firmware will disable features based on region. For example, Asian region PSPs will not display the "Extras" option on the XMB despite having been upgraded to the US version of Firmware 6.20, preventing owners of such PSPs from installing the Comic Book Viewer and the TV Streaming applications. Sony's states that the "Extra" function will remain disabled on Asian PSPs until the feature is officially launched in the region, and gives no reason for the option being disabled aside from that it isn't yet launched. Nevertheless, this denies Asian PSP owners from using the above mentioned applications on Asian PSPs, as the applications are installed through a PC and users from the region are not blocked from downloading the application, allowing installation on non-Asian PSPs that have been imported into the region.

Two of the [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh generation of video game consoles]] have regional lockout, so games imported from other countries cannot be played on foreign versions of those [[Video game console|consoles]] without some form of alteration to bypass the lockout. However, a number of games for the [[Xbox 360]] have been confirmed as region free and will play on a unit from any region, although it is up to the publisher if a game is region free or not. Like the [[CD-i]] and the [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|Panasonic 3DO]], the [[PlayStation 3]] is one of the few home consoles to be advertised as region-free.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.wired.com/games/2006/09/sony_execs_talk.html?entry_id=1561160 |title=Sony Execs Talk PS3 |accessdate=2008-11-03 |date=2006-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1034649/playstation-region-free |title=Playstation 3 will be region free |accessdate=2008-11-03 |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> However, while region free for PS3 games, there is region locking for backwards compatible PS2 and PS1 games, as well as DVD and Blu-ray Disc movies. Additionally, some games separate online players per region, such as Metal Gear Solid 4 Online. A PSN store only contains content for its own country, for example the UK store will not supply usable map packs for an imported US copy of Call of Duty 4. The PS3 actually supports hardware region locking for PS3 games as well, based on Blu-ray regions<ref name="ps3lockoutproof">[http://edepot.com/playstation3.html#PS3_Model_Differences PlayStation 3 Secrets] - ...but there exists the possibility to region lock (based on Blu-ray game region) games if the publisher decides to do so.</ref>, but as of current it is unused and all current region lockouts and separations are about online services. The PS3 also restricts the access to [[PlayStation Network]] by region, such as the online store, news and upcoming releases.

Amongst [[personal computer game]]s, regional lockout is more difficult to enforce because both the game application and the operating system can be easily modified. Subscription-based online games often enforce a regional lock by blocking [[IP address]]es (which can often be circumvented through an [[open proxy]]) or by requiring the user to enter a [[Identity document|national ID]] number (which may be impossible to verify). A number of other games using regional lockout are rare but do exist. One of the examples of this is the Windows version of ''[[The Orange Box]]'', which uses [[Steam (software)|Steam content delivery service]] to enforce the regional lockout.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.ars/2007/10/25/valve-locking-out-user-accounts-for-incorrect-territory |title=Valve locking out user accounts for "incorrect territory" |accessdate=2008-03-15 |author=Frank Caron |date=2007-10-25}}</ref>

== Printers ==

HP print cartridges (since 2004) are regionalised and will not work in printers with a different RC.
