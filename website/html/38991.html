'''Unreal Engine 3''' is a computer [[game engine]] developed by [[Epic Games]]. It is the third generation of [[Unreal Engine]] (UE3), designed for [[DirectX]] 9/10 [[Personal computer|PC]]s, the [[Xbox 360]], and the [[PlayStation 3]].<ref>[http://www.unrealtechnology.com/html/technology/ue30.shtml Unreal Technology]</ref> Its renderer supports many advanced techniques including [[High dynamic range rendering|HDRR]], [[per-pixel lighting]], and dynamic shadows, and builds upon the tools available in previous versions of the engine.

Epic has used this version of the engine for their in-house games ''[[Unreal Tournament 3]]'', ''[[Gears of War]]'', and an improved version for ''[[Gears of War 2]]''. Due to aggressive licensing, this current iteration has garnered a great deal of support from several big licensees, including [[Atari]], [[Activision]], [[Capcom]], [[Disney Interactive Studios|Disney]], [[Konami]], [[Koei]], [[2K Games]], [[Midway Games]], [[THQ]], [[Ubisoft]], [[Sega]], [[Sony]], [[Electronic Arts]], [[Square Enix]], [[3D Realms]], and more.
