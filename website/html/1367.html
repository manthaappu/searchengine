It has been questioned whether this modality should be considered distinct from [[epistemic modality]] which denotes the speaker's evaluation or judgment of the truth. The criticism states that there is no real difference between "the truth in the world" (alethic) and "the truth in an individual's mind" (epistemic).<ref>{{cite book|last=Eschenroeder|first=Erin|coauthors=Sarah Mills; Thao Nguyen|title=The Expression of Modality|editor=William Frawley|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|date=2006-09-30|series=The Expression of Cognitive Categories|pages=8â€“9|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=72URszHq2SEC&pg=PT18|isbn=3110184362|accessdate=2010-01-03}}</ref> An investigation has not found a single language in which alethic and epistemic modalities are formally distinguished, as by the means of a [[grammatical mood]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Nuyts|first=Jan|title=Epimestic Modality, Language, and Conceptualization: A Cognitive-pragmatic Perspective|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Co|date=November 2000|series=Human Cognitive Processing|page=28|isbn=9027223572}}</ref>
