According to event organizers, "The intention of the RoboCup Rescue project is to promote research and development in this socially significant domain at various levels involving multi-agent team work coordination, physical robotic agents for search and rescue, information infrastructures, personal digital assistants, a standard simulator and decision support systems, evaluation benchmarks for rescue strategies and robotic systems that [can] all [be] integrated into comprehensive systems in future."<ref name=RoboRescue/>

The RoboCup Rescue Simulation Project challenges teams of researchers to design virtual robots to solve various challenges, or to build real, autonomous robots, which are evaluated in specially designed rescue simulations.<ref name=RoboRescue/>

The project is one of several competitions operated by [[RoboCup]], which is best known for the Robot Soccer World Cup.<ref name=RoboSoccer>{{cite web |title=RoboCup Rescue |url=http://www.robocup2009.org/21-0-robocup-rescue.html |date=2009 |work=RoboCup 2009 |publisher=RoboCup |accessdate=2009-06-26}}</ref>
