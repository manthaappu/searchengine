'''Tweetie''' is a client for [[Twitter]], the [[social networking]] website. Its mobile version runs on [[iPhone]] and [[iPod touch]], while its desktop version runs on [[Mac OS X]] Leopard and Snow Leopard (respectively 10.5 and 10.6).

On April 9, 2010, Twitter acquired Tweetie, the mobile version of which was renamed '''Twitter''' (originally to be called 'Twitter for iPhone'<ref name="twitter1">{{cite web|url=http://blog.twitter.com/2010/04/twitter-for-iphone.html |title=Twitter Blog: Twitter for iPhone |publisher=Blog.twitter.com |date=2010-04-09 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref>) and released on May 17, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271?mt=8 |title=Twitter for iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad on the iTunes App Store |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=2010-05-18 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref> 

==Added value==
It is one of the few iPhone clients that allow users to manage multiple accounts. Tweetie features a "native" iPhone look and feel, and aims to be lightweight and full-featured.  The design has changed a fair bit in the second inception of the iPhone app; however, it retains a high amount of [[usability]].

The vast majority of the Twitter [[REST]] [[API]] is supported in Tweetie, and it also supports the new search API.

==History==
Similar applications include [[Seesmic]], [[Twitterrific]] and [[TweetDeck]]. 
The Mac OS X version of Tweetie has many of the same features as its portable sibling. It has a free ad supported version. The registered version costs $19.95. The beta of the Mac version was leaked to the popular torrent site [[Demonoid]] a week before the official release. 

Tweetie 2 is currently available for the [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twitter.com/atebits_support/status/3408549558|title=Atebits Support reply to user on twitter|publisher=[[Twitter]]}}</ref>

==Acquisition by Twitter==
On April 9, 2010, Twitter announced through a blog post that the company had acquired Tweetie.  Twitter stated that the acquisition stemmed from the lack of an official, Twitter-branded app. The blog post also stated that the app would be rebranded as "Twitter for iPhone" and would be released in the coming weeks.  Loren Brichter will be given a position on the Twitter Mobile team and will also assist  in launching the "Twitter for iPad" application.<ref name="twitter1"/>

On January 6, 2011, Twitter announced through a blog post that the company had also acquired the desktop version of Tweetie, changing the name to "Twitter for Mac". "Twitter for Mac" was launched on the new [[Mac App Store]] the same day.
