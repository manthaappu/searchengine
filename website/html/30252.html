Hart]], it is the oldest [[digital library]].<ref name=USINFO/> Most of the items in its collection are the full texts of [[public domain]] [[book]]s. The project tries to make these as free as possible, in long-lasting, [[open format]]s that can be used on almost any computer. {{As of|2010|11}}, Project Gutenberg claimed over {{Num PG books}} items in its collection. Project Gutenberg is affiliated with many projects that are independent organizations which share the same ideals, and have been given permission to use the ''Project Gutenberg'' trademark.

Wherever possible, the releases are available in [[text file|plain text]], but other formats are included, such as [[HTML]], [[PDF]], [[EPUB]], [[Mobipocket|MOBI]], and [[Plucker]]. Most releases are in the [[English language]], but many non-English works are also available. There are multiple affiliated projects that are providing additional content, including regional and language-specific works. Project Gutenberg is also closely affiliated with [[Distributed Proofreaders]], an internet-based community for proofreading scanned texts.

== History ==
[[Image:Michael Hart and Gregory Newby at HOPE Conference.jpg|right|thumb|Michael Hart (left) and Gregory Newby (right) of Project Gutenberg, 2006]]
Project Gutenberg was started by [[Michael S. Hart|Michael Hart]] in 1971 with the digitization of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].<ref name="GP_history">{{Cite web
 | url=http://www.zakon.org/robert/internet/timeline/
 | title=Hobbes' Internet Timeline
 | accessdate=17 February 2009}}</ref> Hart, a student at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], obtained access to a [[Xerox Sigma V]] [[mainframe computer]] in the university's Materials Research Lab. Through friendly operators, he received an account with a virtually unlimited amount of computer time; its value at that time has since been variously estimated at $100,000 or $100,000,000.<ref name="GP_history">{{Cite web

 | month=August | year=1992
 | accessdate=5 December 2006}}</ref> Hart has said he wanted to "give back" this gift by doing something that could be considered to be of great value. His initial goal was to make the 10,000 most consulted books available to the public at little or no charge, and to do so by the end of the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite book

This particular computer was one of the 15 [[Node (networking)|nodes]] on the [[computer network]] that would become the [[Internet]]. Hart believed that computers would one day be accessible to the general public and decided to make works of literature available in electronic form for free. He used a copy of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in his backpack, and this became the first Project Gutenberg [[e-text]].
He named the project after [[Johannes Gutenberg]], the fifteenth century German printer who propelled the [[movable type]] [[printing press]] revolution.

By the mid-1990s, Hart was running Project Gutenberg from [[Illinois Benedictine College]]. More volunteers had joined the effort. All of the text was entered manually up until 1989 when [[image scanner]]s and [[optical character recognition]] software improved and became more widely available, which made [[book scanning]] more feasible.<ref>{{Cite news

 | accessdate=15 August 2007 }}</ref> Hart later came to an arrangement with [[Carnegie Mellon University]], which agreed to administer Project Gutenberg's finances. As the volume of e-texts increased, volunteers began to take over the project's day-to-day operations that Hart had run.

[[Pietro Di Miceli]], an Italian volunteer, developed and administered the first Project Gutenberg website and started the development of the Project online Catalog. In his ten years in this role (1994–2004), the Project web pages won a number of awards, often being featured in "best of the Web" listings, and contributing to the project's popularity.<ref>{{Cite web

=== Recent developments ===
In 2000, a [[non-profit organization|non-profit corporation]], the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, Inc. was chartered in [[Mississippi]] to handle the project's legal needs. Donations to it are [[tax deduction|tax-deductible]]. Long-time Project Gutenberg volunteer [[Gregory Newby]] became the foundation's first [[chief executive officer|CEO]].<ref name="it21"/>

[[Charles Franks]] also founded [[Distributed Proofreaders]] (DP) in 2000, which allowed the proofreading of scanned texts to be distributed among many volunteers over the Internet. This effort greatly increased the number and variety of texts being added to Project Gutenberg, as well as making it easier for new volunteers to start contributing. DP became officially affiliated with Project Gutenberg in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web

 | accessdate=10 August 2007 }}</ref> {{As of|2007}}, the 10,000+ DP-contributed books comprised almost a third of the nearly {{Num PG books}} books in Project Gutenberg.

Starting in 2004, an improved online catalog made Project Gutenberg content easier to browse, access and [[hyperlink]]. Project Gutenberg is now hosted by [[ibiblio]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].

== CD and DVD Project ==
In August 2003, Project Gutenberg created a [[CD]] containing approximately 600 of the "best" e-books from the collection.  The CD is available for download as an [[ISO image]].  When users are unable to download the CD, they can request to have a copy sent to them, free of charge.

In December of that same year, a [[DVD]] was created containing nearly 10,000 items.  At the time, this almost represented the entire collection.  In early 2004, the DVD also became available by mail.

In July 2007 a new edition of the DVD was released containing over 17,000 books, and in April 2010, a dual-layer DVD was released, containing nearly 30,000 items.

The majority of the DVDs, and all of the CDs mailed by the project were recorded on recordable media by volunteers.  However, the new dual layer DVDs were manufactured, as it proved more economical than having volunteers burn them.  {{As of|October 2010}} the project has mailed approximately 40,000 discs.

== Scope of collection ==
[[Image:Project Gutenberg total books.svg|right|400px|thumb|Growth of Project Gutenberg publications from 1994 until 2008.]]
{{As of|December 2009}}, Project Gutenberg claimed over {{Num PG books}} items in its collection, with an average of over fifty new [[e-book]]s being added each week.<ref>According to
[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/GUTINDEX-2006.txt gutindex-2006], there were 1,653 new Project Gutenberg items posted in the first 33 weeks of 2006. This averages out to 50.09 per week. This does not include additions to affiliated projects.</ref> These are primarily works of [[literature]] from the [[western culture|Western cultural tradition]]. In addition to literature such as novels, poetry, short stories and drama, Project Gutenberg also has [[cookbook]]s, [[reference work]]s and issues of periodicals.<ref>For a listing of the categorized books, see: {{Cite web

 | title=Category:Bookshelf | publisher=Project Gutenberg
 | accessdate=18 August 2007 }}</ref> The Project Gutenberg collection also has a few non-text items such as audio files and music notation files.

Most releases are in English, but there are also significant numbers in many other languages. {{As of|November 2010}}, the non-English languages most represented are: French, German, Finnish, [[Dutch language|Dutch]], Portuguese, and Chinese.<ref name=USINFO>{{Cite web

Whenever possible, Gutenberg releases are available in [[text file|plain text]], mainly using [[US-ASCII]] [[character encoding]] but frequently extended to [[ISO-8859-1]] (needed to represent accented characters in French and [[Scharfes s]] in German, for example). Besides being copyright-free, the requirement for a [[ISO 8859|Latin]] ([[character set]]) text version of the release has been a criterion of Michael Hart's since the founding of Project Gutenberg, as he believes this is the format most likely to be readable in the extended future. Out of necessity, this criterion has had to be extended further for the sizeable collection of texts in East Asian languages such as Chinese and Japanese now in the collection, where [[UTF-8]] is used instead. The text is wrapped at 65-70 characters and paragraphs are separated by a double-line break. Although this makes the release available to anybody with a text-reader, a drawback of this format is the lack of markup and the resulting relatively bland appearance.<ref>{{Cite web

Other formats may be released as well when submitted by volunteers. The most common non-ASCII format is [[HTML]], which allows markup and illustrations to be included. Some project members and users have requested more advanced formats, believing them to be much easier to read. But some formats that are not easily editable, such as [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], are generally not considered to fit in with the goals of Project Gutenberg, although many are being introduced to the collection in [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] format so that illustrations can be added to downloadable documents. For years, there has been discussion of using some type of [[XML]], although progress on that has been slow.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

== Ideals ==
[[Image:Bouquin électronique iLiad sur une pile de livre dehors au soleil.jpg|thumb|[[iLiad]] e-book reader equipped with e-paper display]]

Michael Hart said in 2004, "The mission of Project Gutenberg is simple: 'To encourage the creation and distribution of ebooks.'"<ref name="hart1" /> His goal is, "to provide as many e-books in as many formats as possible for the entire world to read in as many languages as possible."<ref name=USINFO /> Likewise, a project slogan is to "break down the bars of ignorance and illiteracy",<ref>{{Cite web

Project Gutenberg is intentionally decentralized. For example, there is no selection policy dictating what texts to add. Instead, individual volunteers work on what they are interested in, or have available. The Project Gutenberg collection is intended to preserve items for the long term, so they cannot be lost by any one localized accident. In an effort to ensure this, the entire collection is backed-up regularly and mirrored on servers in many different locations.

== Copyright ==

Project Gutenberg is careful to verify the status of its ebooks according to [[United States Copyright Law|U.S. copyright law]]. Material is added to the Project Gutenberg archive only after it has received a copyright clearance, and records of these clearances are saved for future reference. Unlike some other digital library projects, Project Gutenberg does not claim new copyright on titles it publishes. Instead, it encourages their free reproduction and distribution.<ref name=USINFO/>

Most books in the Project Gutenberg collection are distributed as [[public domain]] under U.S. copyright law. The [[licensing]] included with each ebook puts some restrictions on what can be done with the texts (such as distributing them in modified form, or for commercial purposes) as long as the Project Gutenberg [[trademark]] is used. If the header is stripped and the trademark not used, then the public domain texts can be reused without any restrictions.

There are also a few copyrighted texts that Project Gutenberg distributes with permission. These are subject to further restrictions as specified by the copyright holder.

==Criticism ==

Some people{{Who|September 2010|date=September 2010}} have criticized Project Gutenberg for lack of scholarly rigor in its e-texts: for example, there is usually inadequate information about the edition used and often omission of original prefaces. However, [[John Mark Ockerbloom]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] noted that Project Gutenberg is responsive about addressing errors once they are identified, and the texts now include specific source edition citations.<ref>{{Cite book| author = Martha L. Brogan, Daphnée Rentfrow | year = 2005 | title = A Kaleidoscope of Digital American Literature | publisher = Digital Library Federation | location = New York | isbn = 1933645288 | oclc = 61247191 }}</ref> In many cases the editions also are not the most current scholarly editions, for these later editions are not usually in the public domain.

While the works in Project Gutenberg represent a valuable sample of publications that span several centuries, there are some issues of concern for linguistic analysis. Some content may have been modified by the transcriber because of editorial changes or corrections (such as to correct for obvious proofsetting or printing errors). The spelling may also have been modified to conform with current practices (although the intent by Project Gutenberg,<ref name="volfaq">{{Cite web| url = http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Volunteers%27_FAQ | title = Gutenberg Volunteers FAQ — See V.54 | date = 18 January 2009 | publisher = [http://www.gutenberg.org]}}</ref> and by [[Distributed Proofreaders]],<ref name="gut1">{{Cite web| url = http://www.pgdp.net/wiki/Beginning_Proofreaders%27_FAQs#What_do_I_do_with_mistakes_in_the_text.3F | title = Proofreaders FAQ — What do i do with mistakes in the text ? | date = 18 January 2009 | publisher = pgdp.net }}</ref> is to preserve the original text and where possible the formatting). This can mean that the works ''may'' be problematic when searching for older grammatical usage. Finally, the collected works can be weighted heavily towards certain authors (such as [[Charles Dickens]]), while others are barely represented.<ref>{{Cite book| first = Sebastian | last = Hoffmann | year = 2005 | title = Grammaticalization And English Complex Prepositions: A Corpus-based Study | edition = 1st | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 0415360498 | oclc = 156424479 }}</ref>

How Project Gutenberg recognizes volunteers' efforts in making classic literary works available to the public has also engendered criticism. Those who do the time-consuming work of producing and donating the initial etext files are typically credited within the introduction. But they may feel that others who later process their donated files are being unrealistically credited as "co-producers." Transforming the utilitarian plain text files that have been the Project Gutenberg staple into an HTML format, for instance, typically requires only a very small fraction of the effort needed to produce the original text file.

In March 2004, a new initiative was begun by Michael Hart and John S. Guagliardo<ref>Executive director of the World eBook Library.</ref> to provide low-cost intellectual properties. The initial name for this project was ''Project Gutenberg 2'' (PG II), which created controversy among PG volunteers because of the re-use of the project's trademarked name for a commercial venture.<ref name="it21">{{Cite journal| last = Hane | first = Paula | title = Project Gutenberg Progresses | journal = Information Today | year = 2004 | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | url = http://www.infotoday.com/it/may04/hane1.shtml | accessdate = 20 August 2007 }}</ref>
