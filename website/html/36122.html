A '''summary''', '''[[synopsis]]''', or '''recap''' is a shorter version of the original. Such a simplification highlights the major points from the much longer subject, such as a text, speech, film, or event. The purpose is to help the audience get the gist in a short period of time.

==Written summary==
{{Howto|date=November 2009}}
A written summary starts with a lead, including title, author, text type, and the main idea of the text. It has a clearly arranged structure and is written in a logical, chronological, and traceable manner. In contrast to a résumé or a [[review]], a summary contains neither interpretation nor rating. Only the opinion of the original writer is reflected – paraphrased with new words without quotations from the text. Unlike a [[retelling]], a summary has no [[dramatic structure]] and is written in present tense or historic present. In summaries only [[indirect speech]] is used and depictions are avoided. Summaries of books or dissertations present the major facts in common scientific language.

==Summary in nonfiction==

Nonfiction summaries serve to familiarize the reader with the subject matter of an entire work in a short space of time. They are written in a balanced and objective way, mirroring the genre’s aim to portray actual events from the author’s point of view. Generally, nonfiction summaries do not offer analysis or assessment.

Summarizers use their own words to write the shortened versions and draw on the original make-up of the pieces to structure the distillations. They exclude superfluous examples, descriptions and digressions. The opening sentence should introduce the topic, and the final sentence should sum up the theme, taking into account the knowledge gained from the body of the text. 

In recent years, a summarizing industry has sprung up. Leading firms focus mainly on business literature. They adhere to the nonfiction guidelines mentioned above, but also provide numerical ratings and evaluations of the titles covered. Shorter, more concise nonfiction summaries are called [[abstracts]]. They are approximately five pages, thus longer than scientific abstracts.
