'''Judith Arlene Resnik''' (April 5, 1949 – January 28, 1986) was an [[United States|American]] [[engineer]] and a [[NASA]] [[astronaut]] who died in the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|destruction]] of the [[Space Shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']] during the launch of mission [[STS-51-L]].

Resnik was the second American woman and the second Jewish person in space, logging 145 hours in orbit. She was a graduate of [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and had a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the [[University of Maryland]].  The IEEE Judith Resnik Award for space engineering is named in her honor.

==Life==
Resnik was born in [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], [[Ohio]] and attended Hebrew school. Judith A. Resnik has one brother, Charles, four years younger. Her parents were Marvin, an [[optometrist]], and Sara Resnik. A graduate of [[Firestone High School]] in 1966, she excelled in math and played classical piano. While at Firestone she achieved a perfect [[SAT]] score, the sole female to do so that year. She received a B.S. in [[electrical engineering]] from [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh's]] [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in 1970, the year she married fellow student [[Michael Oldak]]. They divorced in 1974 because Michael wanted children; Judith wanted to focus on her career. Resnik then earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering in 1977 at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]. After graduation from Carnegie Mellon, she was employed at [[RCA]] as a design engineer, and later worked with various NASA projects contracted to the company.

While working toward her doctorate, Resnik was affiliated with the [[National Institutes of Health]] as a biomedical engineer. Later, she was a systems engineer with [[Xerox Corporation]].

===Astronaut===
Resnik was recruited into the astronaut program January [[1978 in spaceflight|1978]] by actress [[Nichelle Nichols]], who was working as a recruiter for NASA.<ref name="Nichols">{{cite web |title=Nichelle Nichols, NASA Recruiter | url=http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2004-00017.html | work=[[NASA]] | accessdate=2009-11-20}}</ref>  Resnik's first space flight was as a mission specialist on the [[STS-41-D|maiden voyage]] of [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']], from August to September [[1984 in spaceflight|1984]]. She was likewise a mission specialist aboard ''Challenger'' for STS-51-L.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/resnik.html |title=Biographical Data - Judith A.

For people accustomed to seeing images of astronauts in space, Dr. Resnik's first space mission still caused some notoriety.  Not only was she one of the first women in space, but in [[weightlessness]], she displayed a halo of flowing locks, a startling sight to many viewers who were accustomed to seeing closely cropped men.  During the flight, she was acclaimed for her weightless acrobatics and a playful sense of humor, once holding a sign reading "Hi Dad" up to the camera, and displaying a sticker on her flight locker that advertised her crush on actor [[Tom Selleck]].<ref>{{Cite web

Since her death, Resnik has been awarded many posthumous honors.  Numerous public buildings and facilities have been named after her, mostly schools and educational facilities, including a dormitory at her [[alma mater]], Carnegie Mellon, and the main engineering lecture hall at the University of Maryland.

The [[IEEE Judith A. Resnik Award]] was established in 1986 by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] and is presented annually to an individual or team in recognition of outstanding contributions to space engineering in areas of relevance to the IEEE.<ref name="IEEE">{{cite web |title=IEEE Judith A. Resnik Award | url=http://www.ieee.org/portal/pages/about/awards/sums/resnik.html | work=[[IEEE]] | accessdate=2009-12-27}}</ref>

She was also honored by the naming of lunar crater [[Resnik (crater)|Resnik]], located within the [[Apollo (crater)|Apollo impact basin]] on the [[Far side (Moon)|far side]] of the [[Moon]].

Resnik has been portrayed in numerous works of nonfiction and fiction, including the 1990 [[made for TV movie]] ''[[Challenger (1990 film)|Challenger]]'' where [[Julie Fulton]] played as her.

On February 23, 2010, she was named one of ten finalists to represent Ohio in the [[National Statuary Hall]] in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.<ref name=CDSiegel>{{cite web |url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2010/02/24/10-ohioans-proposed-to-represent-our-state.html?sid=101 |title=10 Ohioans proposed to represent state in U.S. Capitol |author=Jim Siegel |date=February 24, 2010 |work= |publisher=[[The Columbus Dispatch]] |accessdate=February 27, 2010}}</ref>

Resnik also has several elementary schools named in her honor:
<ul>
<li>Gaithersburg, Maryland: Judith A. Resnik Elementary School.<ref>http://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/schools/resnikes</ref></li>
<li>Akron, Ohio: [http://www.akronschools.com/schools/home/index.dot?schId=10740 Judith A. Resnik Community Learning Center], a K-5th primary school in the Firestone Cluster of Akron Public Schools. Resnik C.L.C. was built on the grounds of the original Fairlawn Elementary School, where Judith Resnik was a student.</li>
