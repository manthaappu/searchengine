The language went through several revisions from DYNAMO II up to DYNAMO IV in 1983,<ref>''DYNAMO User's Manual'', Sixth Edition, ISBN 0262660520</ref> but has since fallen into disuse.

==Beginnings==

In 1958, Forrester unwittingly instigated DYNAMO's development when he asked an MIT staff programmer to compute needed solutions to some equations, for a [[Harvard Business Review]] paper he was writing about industrial dynamics.<ref>Forrester, J.W., ''Industrial Dynamics'', The MIT Press, Cambridge MA, 1961 ISBN 1883823366</ref><ref>[http://sysdyn.clexchange.org/sdep/papers/D-4165-1.pdf "The Beginning of System Dynamics," Jay W. Forrester]</ref>  The programmer, Richard Bennett, chose to implement a system (SIMPLE - "Simulation of Industrial Management Problems with Lots of
Equations") that took coded equations as symbolic input and computed solutions.  SIMPLE became the proof-of-concept for DYNAMO: rather than have a specialist programmer "hard-code" a special-purpose solver in a general purpose programming language, users could specify a system's equations in a special simulation language and get simulation output from one program execution.

==Design goals==

DYNAMO was designed to emphasize the following:

* ease-of-use for the industrial dynamics modeling community (who were not assumed to be expert programmers);

* immediate execution of the compiled model, without producing an intermediate object file; and

* providing graphical output, with [[line printer]] and [[pen plotter]] graphics.

Among the ways in which DYNAMO was above the standard of the time, it featured [[Dimensional analysis|units checking]] of numerical types and relatively clear error messages.

==Impact and Issues==

Apart from its (indirectly-felt) public impact in environmental issues raised by the controversy over ''Limits to Growth'', DYNAMO was influential in the history of discrete-event simulation even though it was essentially a package for continuous simulation specified through [[difference equations]].<ref>"A History of Discrete Event Simulation Programming Languages", Richard E. Nance, TR 93-21, Dept. of Comp. Sci., Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (cross-listed as Systems Research Center report SRC 93-003), June 11, 1993 [http://eprints.cs.vt.edu/archive/00000363/01/TR-93-21.pdf]</ref>  It has been said by some to have opened opportunities for computer modelling even for users of relatively low mathematical sophistication.<ref>''The electronic oracle: computer models and social decisions'' (1985), [[Donella Meadows|Donella H. Meadows]], Jenny M. Robinson, John Wiley & Sons Inc, ISBN 0471905585</ref>  On the other hand, it has also been criticized as weak precisely where mathematical sophistication should be required<ref name=picardi /><ref>"An interview with
Phyllis A. Fox", SIAM website oral history, p.26 [http://history.siam.org/pdfs2/Fox_final.pdf]: "Besides the servo-mechanism approach, [Forrester] used extrapolation, which is notoriously problematic, and unstable. You know yourself that you can’t extrapolate forever. It doesn’t work."</ref> and for relying only on Euler integration.<ref name=karayanakis/>
