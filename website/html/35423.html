<html> <head> <title>Sprinter (computer)</title></head><body>The '''Sprinter''' (also called ZX-Sprinter) is a [[microcomputer]] made by Russian [[Peters Plus, Ltd.]]; it is the last model of [[ZX Spectrum]] being produced in a factory. It's built using what the company calls a "Flex architecture". This uses an [[Altera]] [[Programmable logic device | PLD]] as part of the core logic, allowing the machine's hardware to be reconfigured on the fly for several ZX-Spectrum models' compatibility or its own enhanced native mode (hardly used). This is comparable to the design of [[Jeri Ellsworth]]'s [[C-One]] reprogrammable computer.

The Sprinter in one of its modes runs the Estex [[operating system]] but mainly it works in many modes of the [[Sinclair Research|Sinclair]] [[ZX Spectrum]] [[home computer]] of the 1980s (with TR-DOS Spectrum system on-board).
