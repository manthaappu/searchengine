'''FlockDB''' is an [[open source]] distributed, [[fault-tolerant]] [[graph database]] for managing data at webscale.<ref>http://gigaom.com/2010/04/12/twitter-open-sources-the-home-of-its-social-graph/</ref> It was initially used by [[Twitter]] to build its [[database]] of users and manage their relationships to one another. The developers claim that it is much simpler than other graph databases since it scales horizontally and is designed for on-line, low-latency, high throughput environments such as websites.<ref>http://github.com/twitter/flockdb#readme</ref> Since it is still in the process of being packaged for outside of Twitter use, the code is still very rough and hence there is no stable release available yet. FlockDB was posted on [[GitHub]] shortly after [[Twitter]] released its Gizzard framework, which it uses to [[query]] the FlockDB distributed [[datastore]]. The database is licensed under the [[Apache License]].
