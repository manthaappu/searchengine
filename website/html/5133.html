'''COMIT''' was the first string processing language (compare [[SNOBOL]], [[TRAC programming language|TRAC]], and [[Perl]]), developed on the [[IBM 700/7000 series]] computers by Dr. [[Victor Yngve]] and collaborators at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] from 1957-1965.  Yngve created the language for supporting computerized research in the field of [[linguistics]], and more specifically, the area of [[machine translation]] for [[natural language processing]]. The creation of COMIT led to the creation of [[SNOBOL]].
