<html> <head> <title>Full employment theorem</title></head><body>In [[computer science]] and [[mathematics]], the term '''full employment theorem''' has been used to refer to a theorem showing that no algorithm can optimally perform a particular task done by some class of professionals. The name arises because such a theorem ensures that there is endless scope to keep discovering new techniques to improve the way a specific task is done. For example, the ''full employment theorem for compiler writers'' states that there is no such thing as a perfect size-optimizing compiler, as such a compiler would have to [[halting problem|detect non-terminating computations]] and reduce them to a one-instruction [[infinite loop]]. Thus, the existence of a perfect size-optimizing compiler would imply a solution to the [[halting problem]], which cannot exist, making it an [[undecidable problem]]. Similarly, [[GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems]] have been called full employment theorems for mathematicians. In [[theoretical computer science]] this field of study is known as [[Kolmogorov complexity]], or the smallest program which outputs a given string.

Less formally, combative tasks such as virus writing and detection, and spam filtering and filter-breaking appear to be candidates for full employment.
