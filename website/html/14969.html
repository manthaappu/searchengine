The '''generalized entropy index''' is a [[general formula]] for measuring redundancy in data. The redundancy can be viewed as inequality, lack of diversity, non-randomness, compressibility, or segregation in the data.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}  The primary use is for [[Economic inequality|income inequality]].<ref>Ullah, Aman ; Giles, David E. A. (1998) ''Handbook of Applied Economic Statistics'', CRC Press. ISBN 0824701291 {{Page needed|date=December 2010}}</ref>  It is equal to the definition of [[Redundancy (information theory)|redundancy in information theory]] that is based on [[Entropy (information theory)|Shannon entropy]] when α = 1 which is also called the  [[Theil index]] (T<sub>T</sub>) in income inequality research.  Completely "diverse" data has no redundancy so that GE=0, so that it increases in the opposite direction of a [[Diversity index]].  It increases with order rather than disorder, so it is a negated measure of entropy.

== Formula ==
The formula is

:<math>GE(\alpha) = \frac{1}{N \alpha ( \alpha - 1 )} \sum_{i=1}^N\left[ \left(\frac{y_i}{\overline{y}} \right)^\alpha - 1 \right], \quad \text{ for real values }  \alpha \ne 0,1</math>
:<math>GE(\alpha) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N\left[ \frac{y_i}{\overline{y}} \ln\left(\frac{y_i}{\overline{y}} \right)\right], \quad\quad \text{ for }  \alpha =1</math>
:<math>GE(\alpha) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \ln\left(\frac{\overline{y}}{y_i} \right), \quad \quad\quad \text{ for }  \alpha = 0,</math>

where <math>y_i</math> is the income for individual i that is part of N and α is the weight given to distances between incomes at different parts of the income distribution. Sometimes a different notation is used where α  = β + 1.

For lower values of α close to 0, GE is more sensitive to changes in the lower incomes and vice versa for values closer to 1. Theil's ''T<sub>T</sub>'' is α  = 1 and Theil's ''T<sub>L</sub>'' (also called mean log deviation) is α  = 0. When α  = 2 the value is half the square of the [[coefficient of variation]]:
:<math>GE(\alpha) = 1/2 (\sigma/\mu)^2 \quad \quad\quad \text{ for }  \alpha = 2.</math>

The generalized entropy index is a transformation of the [[Atkinson index]] where <math>\epsilon=1-\alpha</math>. The transformation is A=1-e^(-GE), so that the Atkinson index is a probability instead of entropy.

When the <math>y_i</math> of <math>\alpha=1</math> is replaced with <math>1/y_i</math> (for example, income/person becomes persons/income) then <math>\alpha=1</math> is equivalent to <math>\alpha=0</math>.
