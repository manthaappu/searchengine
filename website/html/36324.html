'''Symantec Corporation''' ({{NASDAQ|SYMC}}) is the largest maker of [[security software]] for [[computer]]s. The company is headquartered in [[Mountain View, California]], and is a [[Fortune 500]] company and a member of the [[S&P 500]] stock market index.

==History==
Founded in 1982 by [[Gary Hendrix]] with a [[National Science Foundation]] grant, Symantec was originally focused on [[artificial intelligence]]-related projects, including a database program. Hendrix hired several [[Stanford University]] [[natural language processing]] researchers as the company's first employees, among them [[Barry Greenstein]] (professional poker player and developer of [[Q&A (software)|Q&A]]). In 1984 Symantec was acquired by another, even smaller computer software startup company, C&E Software, founded by Denis Coleman and [[Gordon Eubanks]] and headed by Eubanks. The merged company retained the name Symantec, and Eubanks became its [[chief executive officer]]. Its first product, [[Q&A (software)|Q&A]], was released in 1985. Q&A provided [[Database management system|database management]] and bundled a word processor. In August 1990, Symantec purchased [[Peter Norton Computing]], a developer of various applications for [[DOS]]. Symantec's consumer antivirus and data management utilities are still marketed under the Norton name. 
At one time Symantec was also known for its development tools, particularly the '''THINK Pascal''', [[THINK C]], '''Symantec C++''', and [[Visual Cafe]] packages that were popular on the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] and [[IBM PC compatible]] platforms; they exited this business in the late-1990s as competitors such as [[Metrowerks]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Borland]] gained significant market share.

In 1985, [[Gordon Eubanks|Gordon E. Eubanks, Jr.]], then president and CEO of Symantec Corporation and Tom Byers and Ted Schlein, formed Turner Hall Publishing, a division of Symantec devoted to publishing third-party software<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:GaxdaUdMgCIJ:www.cwhonors.org/archives/histories/Eubanks.pdf+%22Turner+Hall+Publishing%22&hl=en&gl=ca&sig=AHIEtbQhf3lmxre17qqPIDDtN8oTAMA5Hw |title=Gordon Eubanks Oral History, COMPUTERWORLD HONORS PROGRAM, Daniel S.

The popularity of these products created the cash flow that allowed the 1990s acquisitions Symantec grew from to happen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:GaxdaUdMgCIJ:www.cwhonors.org/archives/histories/Eubanks.pdf+%22Turner+Hall+Publishing%22&hl=en&gl=ca&sig=AHIEtbQhf3lmxre17qqPIDDtN8oTAMA5Hw |title=Gordon Eubanks Oral History, COMPUTERWORLD HONORS PROGRAM, Daniel S.

==Norton products==
Symantec's consumer division, Norton, accounts for about one third of the company's revenue{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. The 2009 line-up includes [[Norton 360]], [[Norton AntiVirus]] (for Windows and Mac), [[Norton Internet Security]] (for Windows and Mac), [[Norton SystemWorks]] (which now contains [[Norton Utilities]]), Norton Save & Restore, [[Norton Ghost]], Norton pcAnywhere, Norton Smartphone Security, Norton Partition Magic, [[Remote backup service|Norton Online Backup]], and [[OnlineFamily.Norton]].

The Symantec Security Response organization (formerly Symantec Antivirus Research Center) is one of the foremost antivirus and computer security research groups in the industry with over 400 full-time employees.

===Enterprise software===
Approximately two-thirds of the company's revenue is derived from software designed for companies and large organizations—i.e., enterprise software.
