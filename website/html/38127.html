	A '''Translator''' is a computer program that translates one programming language instruction(s) into another
programming language instruction(s) without the loss of original meaning. OR, the translator will translate X 
language and produce X’ language. Where X is the MEANING and ‘(DASH) is the language. In some advanced translator
will even change the logic (not meaning) or will simplify the logic without losing the essence.

==Types==
If the translator translates a [[high level language]] into an [[assembly language|assembly]] or [[machine language]] it is called a [[compiler]]. Examples include [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[ALGOL]], [[BASIC]], [[COBOL]], [[FORTRAN]], [[PL/I]], [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]].

If the translator translates a high level language into an intermediate code which will be immediately executed it is called [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].  Examples include [[APL (programming language)|APL]], [[Active Server Pages|ASP]], [[CYBOL]], [[LISP]], [[Smalltalk]], [[PHP]] and [[PERL]].

If the translator translates target/machine code to source language it is called a [[Decompiler]].  Example: [[DCC]], [[Boomerang Decompilers]] and [[Reverse Engineering Compiler]] (REC).

If the translator translates assembly language to machine code such kind of translator is called [[assembly language|assembler]]. Examples include [[MASM]], [[TASM]], [[Netwide Assembler|NASM]] and [[FASM]].

If the translator translates machine code into assembly language such kind of translator is called [[Disassembler]]. Examples include [[gdb]], [[IDA Pro]] and [[OllyDbg]].
