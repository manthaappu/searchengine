<html> <head> <title>CDXL</title></head><body>'''CDXL''' is an obsolete motion video [[file format]] developed by [[Commodore International|Commodore]] in the late 1980s and early 1990s for the [[Amiga]] computer platform. It is notable for being one of the earliest formats created for motion video playback from [[CD-ROM]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sassenrath.com/carl.html|title=Former Commodore Engineer, Carl Sassenrath's home page}}</ref>.

==Background==
In an era shortly after the introduction of CD-ROM drives and before low cost [[MPEG]] decoding hardware became available the CDXL format was created primarily for the [[Amiga CDTV]] to permit playback of video from CD-ROM. CDXL was tailored for the [[Amiga Original chipset|Amiga chipset]] and took advantage of [[Direct memory access|DMA]] transfers and relied little on the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5293606.html|title=Free Patents Online}}</ref>. As a result CDXL could only support weak [[video compression]] and therefore relatively low video resolutions and moderate [[frame rate]]s.

The CDXL format initially allowed playback of up to 24 frames per second with up to 4096 colors encoded in [[Hold And Modify#HAM6 operation|HAM-6]]. Audio support allowed for 8-bit mono or stereo sound. When the [[Amiga CD32]] was released the format was able to support [[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] color modes (up to 262,144 on-screen colors from a 24-bit color palette) and higher display resolutions.

Designed as a streaming format CDXL consists of linear concatenated chunks (packets), each with an uncompressed frame and associated audio data. There is no overall file header, just the header of each chunk. The FPS rate is constant but not stored in the file, so it is necessary to set the playback speed in the player software manually.

CDXL is not related to [[ANIM]] file format (a subset of [[Interchange File Format]]) It is supported by [[AmigaOS]] through '''CDXL.datatype''' which allows playback of CDXL files on compatible Amiga computers through standard universal, datatype-loader based, multimedia tool of AmigaOS called [[Amiga_support_and_maintenance_software#MultiView|Multiview]].

==Usage==
A number of Amiga CD-ROM games and entertainment software from the era used CDXL for motion video.

==Performance==
Playback was moderately impressive at the time of release given the CDTV's [[Motorola 68000]] processor, [[Amiga Original chipset|OCS]] chipset and single-speed CD-ROM drive. A single-speed (150 [[KiloByte|kB]]/s) CD-ROM drive permitted resolutions equivalent to 160×100 with 4,096 colors at 12 [[Frame rate|FPS]] with 11025 Hz 8-bit mono audio. At these settings audio and visual quality would be perceived as considerably worse than [[VHS]].

A CDXL stream at 300 kB/s (equivalent to 256×128 at 12 FPS) allows approximately 36 minutes of video to fit on CD-ROM. In comparison, a [[Video CD]] encoded in [[MPEG-1]] format allows approximately 72 minutes of 384×280 24-bit color video at 25 FPS [http://ninjaw.ifrance.com/cd32/_docs/cdxl/cdxl.html].
