In [[mathematics]], '''general topology''' or '''point-set topology''' is the branch of [[topology]] which studies properties of [[topological space]]s and structures defined on them. It is distinct from other branches of topology in that the topological spaces may be very general, and do not have to be at all similar to [[manifold]]s.

== Definition ==

A '''topology''' is a pair (''X'',Σ) consisting of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' and a collection Σ of [[subset]]s of ''X'', called open sets, satisfying the following three [[axiom]]s:  
#The [[union (mathematics)|union]] of open sets is an open set.
#The finite [[intersection (mathematics)|intersection]] of open sets is an open set.
# ''X'' and the [[empty set]] ∅ are open sets.

== History ==
General topology grew out of a number of areas, most importantly the following:

*the detailed study of subsets of the [[real line]] (once known as the ''topology of point sets'', this usage is now obsolete)
*the introduction of the [[manifold]] concept
*the study of [[metric space]]s, esp. [[normed linear space]]s, in the early days of [[functional analysis]].

General topology assumed its present form around 1940. It captures, one might say, almost everything in the intuition of [[continuous function|continuity]], in a technically adequate form that can be applied in any area of mathematics.

== Scope ==
More specifically, it is in general topology that basic notions are defined and theorems about them proved. This includes the following:

* [[open set|open]] and [[closed set]]s;
* [[interior (topology)|interior]] and [[closure (topology)|closure]];
* [[neighbourhood (topology)|neighbourhood]] and [[closeness (topology)|closeness]];
* [[compact space|compactness]] and [[connected space|connectedness]];
* [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]s;
* [[limit of a sequence|convergence]] of [[sequence]]s, [[net (mathematics)|net]]s, and [[filter (mathematics)|filter]]s;
* [[separation axiom]]s
* [[axiom of countability|countability axiom]].

Other more advanced notions also appear, but are usually related directly to these fundamental concepts, without reference to other branches of mathematics. [[Set-theoretic topology]] examines such questions when they have substantial relations to [[set theory]], as is often the case.

Other main branches of topology are [[algebraic topology]], [[geometric topology]], and [[differential topology]]. As the name implies, general topology provides the common foundation for these areas.

An important variant of general topology is [[pointless topology]], which, rather than using sets of points as its foundation, builds up topological concepts through the study of [[lattice (order)|lattices]], and, in particular, the [[category-theoretic]] study of [[frames and locales]].
