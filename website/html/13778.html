<html> <head> <title>Flexible Direct Memory Access</title></head><body>The '''Flexible Direct Memory Access''' (FDMA) is a general purpose [[direct memory access]] controller, capable of supporting 16 independent DMA channels. It can be used to perform block moves while manipulating the data to reduce the load on the host [[CPU]] and the hardware block complexity. Moves may be from [[Random access memory|memory]] to memory or between memory and paced latency critical real time targets.
