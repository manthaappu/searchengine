The '''Newton platform''' was an early [[personal digital assistant]] and the first tablet [[platform (computing)|platform]] developed by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], the second platform being [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], used in the [[iPhone]], [[iPod Touch]] and [[iPad]]. Development of the Newton platform started in 1987<!-- See Apple confidential 2.0 by O. Linzmayer --> and officially ended on February 27, 1998. Some electronic engineering and the manufacture of Apple's Newton devices was done in Japan by [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]]. Most Newton devices were based on the [[ARM architecture|ARM]] 610 RISC processor and all featured [[handwriting recognition]] software. Most Newton devices were developed and marketed by Apple (this includes the whole [[MessagePad]] line and the [[eMate 300]]), but other companies, notably Sharp, [[Motorola]], and [[Digital Ocean]], also released devices that ran the [[Newton OS]]. None were as successful as Apple's devices.

== Development ==
The Newton project was a PDA platform. The PDA category did not exist for most of Newton's genesis, and the phrase "[[personal digital assistant]]" was coined relatively late in the development cycle by Apple's CEO [[John Sculley]],<ref>[http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/john-sculley-newton-origin.html The Story Behind Apple's Newton], Tom Hormby - 2006.02.07, Low End Mac</ref> the driving force behind the project. Newton was intended to be a complete reinvention of personal computing.  For most of its design lifecycle Newton had a large-format screen, more internal memory, and an object-oriented graphics kernel. One of the original motivating [[use case]]s for the design was known as the "Architect Scenario", in which Newton's designers imagined a residential [[architect]] working quickly with a client to sketch, clean up, and interactively modify a simple two-dimensional home plan.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

There is however an extensive history of [[pen computing]] that predates the Newton, though not generally in the form factor of what would now be called a PDA.

For a portion of the Newton's development cycle (roughly the middle third<!--exact dates?-->), the project's intended programming language was [[Dylan programming language|Dylan]] though in fact the language and environment never matured enough for any applications to be successfully written.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Dylan was a small, efficient [[object-oriented]] [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] variant that still retains some interest.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Although it was efficient (for its day, and considering its substantial run-time [[dynamic programming language|dynamism]]),{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Dylan never lived up to its developers' performance expectations and was a tough sell for a development team unaccustomed to Lisp programming.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} When the move was made to a smaller form factor (designed by [[Jonathan Ive]]),<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_39/b4002414.htm "Who Is Jonathan Ive?"], BusinessWeek</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/digital/cyberelite/44.html "cyber elite: Jonathan Ive"], Time</ref> Dylan was relegated to experimental status in the "Bauhaus Project" and eventually canceled outright. Its replacement, NewtonScript, had garbage collection, tight integration with the "soup" storage and user-interface toolkit, and was specifically designed to run in small RAM/large ROM environments. It was mostly developed by Walter Smith from 1992 to 1993.

The project missed its original goals to reinvent personal computing,{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} and then to [[Rewrite (programming)|rewrite]] contemporary application programming.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} The Newton project fell victim to project slippage, [[scope creep]], and a growing fear that it would interfere with Macintosh sales. It was reinvented as a PDA platform which would be a complementary Macintosh peripheral instead of a stand-alone computer which might compete with the Macintosh.

Although [[PDA]]s had been developing since the original [[Psion Organiser]] in 1984,<ref>[http://www.authorstream.com/Presentation/aSGuest22971-219207-pda-enter-tags-rohith-girish-shyamprasad-entertainment-ppt-powerpoint/ ISAS seminar on PDAs]</ref><ref name="PDA history blog">[http://www.bloggersbase.com/gadgets-and-Mobile/history-of-pdas-part-1/ History of PDAs blog]</ref> the Newton has left one particular lasting impression: the term ''personal digital assistant'' was first coined to refer to the Newton.<ref name="PDA history blog"/>

John Sculley says Apple invested approximately US$100M to develop Newton.<ref>[http://news.cnet.com/2008-7351-5085423.html] [[Cnet]]</ref>

=== Application software ===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Controlpanelnewton.png|thumb|right|''The [[Newton OS]] GUI'']] -->
Most Newton devices were pre-loaded with a variety of software to help in personal data organization and management.  This included such applications as Notes, Names, and Dates, as well as a variety of productivity tools such as a calculator, conversion calculators (metric conversions, currency conversions, etc), time-zone maps, etc.  In later/2.x versions of the [[Newton OS]] these applications were refined, and new ones were added, such as the Works word processor and the Newton Internet Enabler, as well as the inclusion of bundled [[Third-party developer|3rd party]] applications, such as the QuickFigure Works spreadsheet (a "lite" version of Pelicanware's QuickFigure Pro), Pocket [[Quicken]], the NetHopper web browser, and the EnRoute email client.  Various Newton applications had full import/export capabilities with popular desktop office suite and [[Personal information manager|PIM (Personal Information Manager)]] application file formats, primarily by making use of Apple's bundled [[Apple Newton Software|Newton Connection Utilities]] and also the Newton Connection Kit, which was sold separately and only worked for Newton devices that used the 1.x versions of the Newton OS.

====Notes====
The Notes application allowed users to create small documents that could contain text that had been typed, or that had been recognized from handwriting, as well as free-hand sketches, [[Apple Newton#User interface|"Shapes", and "ink text"]].

[[Image:Apple newton messagepad checklist jk.jpg|left|thumbnail|Photograph of screen displaying Checklist, some bullet points [[Tick (checkmark)|checked]] and/or "collapsed"]] In version 2.0 of the [[Newton OS]], the Notes application (as well as Names) could accept what Apple termed "stationery", 3rd-party created plug-in modules that could extend the functionality of the basic applications.

One of the new types of Notes stationery added to Newton OS 2.0 was a [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]], [[Bullet point|bullet-ed]], collapsible, multi-line "[[Checklist]]", an implementation of [[outliner]] software.  This could be used for organizing thoughts, priorities, [[Time management|"to do" lists]], planning steps and sub-tasks, etc.  Each bullet point could contain as many lines of text as desired.  A bullet point could be dragged and placed underneath another bullet point, thus forming a hierarchical [[outline]]/[[Tree structure|tree]].  When a bullet point was dragged, the entire sub-[[Tree structure|tree]] of child bullet points underneath it (if any) would be dragged along as well.  If a bullet point had child bullet points, tapping the hollow parent bullet point once would "roll up" or collapse all the children ([[WindowShade|"windowshade" effect]]).  The parent bullet point would become a solid black circle and all the children would disappear.  Tapping the parent bullet point again would make the children re-appear. Because this functionality arrived in Newton OS 2.0, several third parties made similar software before for OS 1.x Newton machines, the most notable of which was Dyno Notepad, released in 1993.

====Names====
The Names application was used for storing contacts. Contacts created either on the Newton device or on a Windows or Macintosh desktop [[Personal information manager|PIM]] could be synchronized to each other.<ref>Apple Computer. [http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=38006 "Newton Connection Utilities ReadMe"], Apple, July 24, 1997</ref><ref>Apple Computer. [http://www.oldschool.net/newton/papers/ncu.html#NCU "Newton Connection Utilities Features"], Newton Source</ref>  Entering a date in Names for fields such as birthday or anniversary automatically created corresponding repeating events in the Dates application.  Each contact had an attached free-form notes field available to it, that could contain any mix of interleaved text, ink text, Shapes, or Sketches.  Like Notes, Names could be extended by developers, to create special new categories of contacts with specialized pre-defined fields.  Names shipped with 3 types of contacts, "people", "companies", and "groups", but a developer could define new types, for instance "client", "patient", etc. [http://standalone.com/|Stand Alone Software, Inc.] also created a Newton software package called the Stationery Construction Kit, which allowed users to make stationery themselves without aid of any other tools.

====Dates====
Dates supplied calendar, events, meeting, and alarms functions, including an integrated [[Time management|"to do" list]] manager.  It offered many different display and navigation styles, including a list view, graphical day "time blocking" view, or a week, month, or year grid.  As with Names and Notes, Dates items created either on the Newton or on a Windows or Macintosh desktop [[Personal information manager|PIM]] could be synchronized to each other.

=== Operating system and programming environment ===
The [[Newton OS]] consists of three layers. At the lowest level, a [[microkernel]] handles resources like [[Task (computers)|tasks]] and memory. On top of the microkernel, the bulk of the operating system is implemented in [[C++]], including the communications layer, handwriting recognition, and the [[NewtonScript]] environment. The top layer consists of built-in and user installed applications written in NewtonScript.

NewtonScript is an advanced [[object-oriented programming]] language, developed by Apple employee [[Walter Smith (programmer)|Walter Smith]].<ref>[http://waltersmith.us/ Walter Smith’s home page]</ref>  Some programmers complained at the $1000 cost of the Toolbox programming environment. Additionally, it required learning a new way of programming.

The Newton Toolkit (NTK), an integrated environment tailored to the graphical nature of the Newton platform, was developed specifically for developing applications for the Newton platform and included a graphical view editor, a template browser, and an interactive inspector window for debugging. Initially, it was only available for [[Macintosh]] computers, and later a [[Microsoft Windows]] version was developed. The Technical Lead for the Newton Toolkit was Norberto Menendez; other engineers on the team were Ben Sharpe and Peter Potrebic.

=== Data storage ===
Data in Newton is stored in object-oriented databases known as [[Soup (Apple Newton)|soups]]. One of the innovative aspects of Newton is that soups are available to all programs; and programs can operate cross-soup; meaning that the calendar can refer to names in the address book; a note in the notepad can be converted to an appointment, and so forth; and the soups can be programmer-extended&mdash;a new address book enhancement can be built on the data from the existing address book. The soup system also made it easy to synchronize data, and the Newton Connection tools could be used for importing and exporting data. Among many file formats are the [[Rich Text Format]], Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Works, and many more.

Another consequence of the data-object soup is that objects can extend built-in applications such as the address book so seamlessly that Newton users can sometimes not distinguish which program or add-on object is responsible for the various features on their own system, because the advanced nature of Newton devices makes it easy to accept such add-ons. A user rebuilding their system after extended usage might find themselves unable to manually restore their system to the same functionality because some long-forgotten downloaded extension was missing. Data owned and used by applications and extensions themselves is tossed in the "Storage" area of the "Extras" drawer in 2.x Newton devices; on 1.x systems, they can only be found or removed in the Memory section of the built-in Prefs application, in the Card slip (also built-in), or with third-party tools such as NewtCase. There is no built-in distinction between types of data in that area. For example, an installed application's icon could be sitting right next to a database of addresses used by another installed extension further down the list.

Finally, the data soup concept works well for data like addresses, which benefit from being shared cross-functionally, but it works poorly for discrete data sets like files and documents. Later, the 2.0 release of the [[Newton OS]] introduced Virtual Binary Objects to alleviate the problem of handling large data objects.

===Package installation, capacity planning, and disaster recovery===
Several software utilities which accommodate data transfer to and from a host system exist for the following platforms:

* Mac OS
* Mac OS X
* UNIX
* Linux
* Microsoft Windows

== Newton technology after cancellation ==
Before the Newton project was canceled, it was "spun off" into an Apple wholly owned subsidiary  company, ''Newton Inc.'', but was reabsorbed several months later when Apple CEO [[Gil Amelio]] was fired by the board and  [[Steve Jobs]] took over as then interim CEO. Two ex-Apple Newton developers founded [[Pixo]], the company that created the operating system for the original [[iPod]].

Speculation continued for several years that Apple might release a new PDA with some Newton technology or collaborate with Palm. Feeding a bit of speculation, Apple put the "Print Recognizer" part of the Newton 2.1 handwriting recognition system into [[Mac OS X]] version 10.2 (known as "Jaguar"). It can be used with graphics tablets to seamlessly input handwritten printed text anywhere there was an insertion point on the screen. This technology, known as "[[Inkwell (Macintosh)|Inkwell]]", appears in the System Preferences whenever a tablet input device is plugged in. An [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter egg]] in Print Recognizer on the Newton (write "ROSETTA! ROSETTA! ROSETTA!", and the Newton will insert "ROSETTA! ROSETTA! Hey, that's me!" instead) was present in Inkwell in Mac OS 10.2 and 10.3, but seems to have been removed in 10.4. Larry Yaeger was the author of the original Rosetta recognizer on the Newton, and was also responsible for porting it to Mac OS X.<ref>http://wwnc.newtontalk.net/2004/program/larryyaeger/slides-larryyaeger.pdf</ref> The [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]] name was later used for Apple's [[PowerPC]] emulation layer for [[Intel]]-based Macs.

At an All Things Digital conference in 2004, Steve Jobs made reference to a new "Apple PDA" (perhaps a successor to the Newton) which the company had developed but had decided not to bring to market.<ref>[http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/04/06/07/jobs_apple_developed_but_did_not_ship_apple_pda.html AppleInsider | Jobs: Apple developed, but did not ship Apple PDA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The tablet eventually evolved into the iOS product family{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.

=== Newton emulation ===
Since 2004, the Einstein Project<ref>[http://www.kallisys.com/newton/einstein/ Kallisys | Newton | Einstein Project<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> has been working on emulating the Newton for use as an alternate OS on other platforms. It is currently available for the Sharp [[Zaurus]], Apple's [[Mac OS X]], Nokia [[Nokia 770|770]] and [[Nokia N800|N800]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and the [[Pepper Pad|PepperPad]] 3. The emulator is an open source project, but requires an original Newton ROM to be installed in order to function. Since September 2010 Einstein also runs on iPhones and iPads.

===Future===
Since the release of [[iPhone|Apple's iPhone]] in 2007, many people{{Who|date=March 2010}} consider that the Newton was influential in its development. Some refer to the Newton as the iPhone's grandfather.

A possible Newton revival has been a common source of speculation among the Macintosh user base; when patents for a tablet based Macintosh were applied for,<ref>[http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=600 Appleinsider, ''Euro filing reveals Apple handheld design images'', August 13, 2004]</ref> rumor sites jumped at the possibility of a new [[Tablet PC]] style Macintosh.

In September 2009, Michael Tchao, one of the Newton's marketing product champions, returned to Apple.<ref>[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/28/apple-rehires-newton-and-nike-marketing-whiz/ ''Apple Rehires a Developer of Its Newton Tablet'',September 28, 2009]</ref>

On January 27, 2010, Apple announced the [[iPad]]. The iPad is Apple's second [[Tablet Computer]].
