In [[engineering]], '''redundancy''' is the duplication of critical [[wikt:Component|component]]s of a system with the intention of increasing reliability of the [[system]], usually in the case of a backup or [[fail-safe]]. 

In many [[safety-critical system]]s, such as [[fly-by-wire]] and [[hydraulic]] systems in [[aircraft]], some parts of the control system may be triplicated,{{ref|spaceshuttle}} which is formally termed [[triple modular redundancy]] (TMR). An error in one component may then be out-voted by the other two. In a triply redundant system, the system has three sub components, all three of which must fail before the system fails. Since each one rarely fails, and the sub components are expected to fail independently, the probability of all three failing is calculated to be extremely small. Redundancy may also be known by the terms "'''majority voting systems'''"{{ref|votinglogic1}} or "'''voting logic'''".{{ref|votinglogic2}}

== Forms of redundancy ==
There are four major forms of redundancy, these are:
* Hardware redundancy, such as [[Dual modular redundant|DMR]] and [[Triple modular redundancy|TMR]]
* Information redundancy, such as [[Error detection and correction]] methods
* Time redundancy, including transient fault detection methods such as '''Alternate Logic'''
* Software redundancy such as [[N-version programming]]

== Calculating the probability of system failure ==
Each duplicate component added to the system decreases the probability of system failure according to the formula:

:<math>{p}=  \prod_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} </math>
where:
* <math>n</math> - number of components
* <math> p_{i} </math> - probability of component i failing
* <math>p</math> - the probability of all components failing (system failure)

This formula assumes independence of failure events. That means that the probability of a component B failing given that a component A has already failed is the same as that of B failing when A has not failed. There are situations where this is unreasonable, such as using two power supplies connected to the same socket, whereby if one socket failed, the other would too.

It also assumes that at only one component is needed to keep the system running. If <math>m</math> components are needed for the system to survive, out of <math>n</math>, the probability of failure is{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

<math>{P}=  1 - ((1 - p)^{(n-m)} C^m_n ) </math> , Assuming all components have equal probability, <math>p</math>, of failure

This model is probably unrealistic in that it assumes that components are not replaced in time when they fail.
