<html> <head> <title>Spatiotemporal database</title></head><body>A '''spatiotemporal database''' is a system that manages both space and time information, such as biological Databases, wireless communication networks, and processing of objects with uncertainty. 

Basically, spatiotemporal databases are a generalization of [[spatial database]]s, which include features of variating coordinates in space, as e.g. with [[plate tectonics]], or of otherwise temporal variation of spatial data, e.g. of moving objects, residing temporally in spatially defined locations.

A spatiotemporal database embodies spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal database concepts, and captures spatial and temporal aspects of data and deals with 
* geometry changing over time.<ref>[http://wis.cs.ucla.edu/~cchen/thesis.ps Data Models and Query Languages of Spatio-Temporal Information <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

or
* location of objects moving over invariant geometry. <ref>[[RTLS]]</ref>

Topics of research are the Analysis & Retrieval of spatial and spatiotemporal data.
