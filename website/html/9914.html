'''Demand optimization''' is the application of processes and tools to maximize [[return on sales]]. This usually involves the application of mathematical modeling techniques using computer software.

It has particular '''applications''' in [[retail]], where merchants wish to identify the best combination of [[price]] and [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]] to achieve desired sales, [[gross margin]], inventory or [[market share]] objectives.

The '''methods used''' are similar to those applied in the related field of [[supply chain optimization]], where mathematical algorithms are applied to large databases of sales data to help [[Forecasting|predict future outcomes]]. In the case of demand optimization, as well as in house sales history, there may be competitive pricing information.

Because it is still a new field, authoritative data on the '''benefits of demand optimization''' is not widely available, although suppliers offer [[case studies]] of early adopters which claim rapid [[return on investment]], especially in the optimization of the timing and level of [[price markdown]]s.
