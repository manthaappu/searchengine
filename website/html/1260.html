The '''Air Quality Modeling Group''' (AQMG) is in the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. EPA's]] Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) and provides leadership and direction on the full range of air quality models, [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|air pollution dispersion models]] and other mathematical simulation techniques used in assessing pollution control strategies and the impacts of air pollution sources. 

The AQMG serves as the focal point on air pollution modeling techniques for other EPA headquarters staff, EPA regional Offices, and State and local environmental agencies. It coordinates with the EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) on the development of new models and techniques, as well as wider issues of atmospheric research. Finally, the AQMG conducts modeling analyses to support the policy and regulatory decisions of the EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS).

The AQMG is located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.
