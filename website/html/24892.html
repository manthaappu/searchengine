'''Modelur''' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] parametric [[urban design]] [[software]], implemented as a [[Google SketchUp]] plugin.

In contrast to common [[CAD]] applications, where the user designs buildings with usual dimensions such as width, depth and height, Modelur offers design of [[built environment]] through key urban parameters such as number of storeys and gross floor area of a building. In addition, urban control values (i.e. [[Floor Space Index]], Built Area, etc ) and requirements (i.e. number of parking lots or green areas) based on [[land use]] normatives are calculated in real-time.
