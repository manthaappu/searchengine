<html> <head> <title>Rambutan (cryptography)</title></head><body>'''Rambutan''' is a family of [[encryption]] technologies <!-- they seem to use "rambutan" to describe the whole package, not just a cipher--> designed by the Communications-Electronics Security Group (CESG), the technical division of the [[Her Majesty's Government|United Kingdom government's]] secret communications agency, [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]].

It includes a range of encryption products designed by CESG for use in handling confidential (not secret) communications between parts of the British government, government agencies, and related bodies such as [[NHS Trust]]s. Unlike CESG's [[Red Pike (cipher)|Red Pike]] system, Rambutan is not available as software: it is distributed only as a self-contained electronic device (an [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]]) which implements the entire cryptosystem and handles the related key distribution and storage tasks.<ref name="zergo">[http://cryptome.sabotage.org/zergo-aba.htm "The use of encryption and related services with the NHSnet"], report by Zergo Ltd., mirrored on [[Cryptome]]</ref>  Rambutan is not sold outside the government sector.<ref name="schneier">Schneier, Bruce ''Applied Cryptography'' (2nd ed), John Wiley & Sons, 1996</ref>

Technical details of the Rambutan algorithm are secret. Security researcher [[Bruce Schneier]] describes it as being a [[stream cipher]] ([[linear feedback shift register]]) based cryptosystem with 5 [[shift register]]s each of around 80 bits, and a [[key size]] of 112 bits.<ref name="schneier"/> RAMBUTAN-I communications chips (which implement a secure [[X.25]] based communications system) are made by approved contractors [[Racal]] and Baltimore Technologies/Zergo Ltd.<ref name="racal"> [http://www.governmentsecurity.org/articles/articles2/Certified-Product-List.pdf_fl/Certified-Product-List-53.html Racal Rambutan SAFE X25 and Rambutan SAFE 2M product descriptions]</ref><ref name="baltimore">[http://www.governmentsecurity.org/articles/articles2/Certified-Product-List.pdf_fl/Certified-Product-List-56.html Baltimore Technologies (UK) approved Rambutan devices]</ref> CESG later specified RAMBUTAN-II, an enhanced system with backward compatibility with existing RAMBUTAN-I infrastructure.<ref name="cesg">[http://www.cesg.gov.uk/site/crypto/index.cfm?menuSelected=15&displayPage=15 "RAMBUTAN-II"], CESG website, URL retrieved 17th December 2006</ref> The RAMBUTAN-II chip is a 64-pin [[QFP|quad ceramic pack]] chip, which implements the electronic codebook, cipher block chaining, and output feedback [[block cipher modes of operation|operating modes]] (each in 64 bits) and the cipher feedback mode in 1 or 8 bits.<ref name="brochure">[http://www.cesg.gov.uk/site/crypto/media/RambutanII.pdf "RAMBUTAN II cryptographic chip], CESG brochure ([[PDF]])</ref> Schneier suggests that these modes may indicate Rambutan is a [[block cipher]] rather than a stream.<ref name="schneier"/> The three 64 bit modes operate at 88 megabits/second.<ref name="brochure"/>
