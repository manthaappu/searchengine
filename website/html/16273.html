<html> <head> <title>Hardened Gentoo</title></head><body>'''Hardened Gentoo''' is a project of [[Gentoo Linux]] that is enhancing the distribution with security addons. Current security enhancements to Gentoo Linux can be:

*[[SELinux]]
**A system of mandatory access controls. [[SELinux]] can enforce the security policy over all processes and objects in the system, and is an optional feature in all 2.6 kernel source packages.
*[[RSBAC]]
**A mandatory access control security system based on Generalized Framework for Access Control (GFAC). It provides several standard and custom (and mixables) access control models. It can enforce [[operating system]] access rules.
*[[PaX]]/[[grsecurity]]
**[[grsecurity]] is a complete security solution providing such features as a [[mandatory access control|MAC]] or [[RBAC]] system, [[chroot]] restrictions, address space modification protection (via [[PaX]]), auditing features, randomization features, linking restrictions to prevent file race conditions, ipc protections and much more.
*Hardened Toolchain
**Transparent implementation of [[PaX]] [[address space layout randomization]]s and stack smashing protections using [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF]] shared objects as executables.
*sys-kernel/hardened-sources
**A kernel source package which includes patches for hardened subprojects, and stability/security-oriented patches, including [[Grsecurity]].
*[[Bastille Linux]]
**[[Bastille Linux]] is an interactive application which gives the user suggestions on securing their machine. It will be customized to make suggestions about other Hardened Gentoo subprojects.

The Mandatory Access Control (MAC) parts of SELinux, RSBAC and grsecurity are usually incompatible to each other.
However, the chroot and network restrictions of grsecurity and the memory protection of PaX can be used with the SELinux MAC model for example.
