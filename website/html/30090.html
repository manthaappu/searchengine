Process Supervision is a form of [[Operating system service management]] in which some master process remains the parent of the service processes.

==Benefits==
Benefits include:

* Ability to restart services which have failed
* The fact that it does not require the use of "pidfiles"
* [http://smarden.org/runit/benefits.html#state Clean process state]
* Reliable logging, because the master process can capture the stdout/stderr of the service process and route it to a log
* Faster (concurrent) and ability to start up and stop

==Implementations==
* [[runit]]
* [[Initng]]
