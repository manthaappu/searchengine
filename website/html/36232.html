<html> <head> <title>Surface-to-surface intersection problem</title></head><body>The '''surface-to-surface intersection (SSI) problem'''. is a basic problem in [[computer-aided geometric design]]: Given two intersecting surfaces in R<sup>3</sup>, compute all parts of the intersection curve. If two surfaces intersect, the result will be a set of isolated points, a set of curves, a set of overlapping surfaces, or any combination of these cases<ref>R. Barnhill, G. Farin, M. Jordan, and B. Piper. Surface/Surface Intersection. Computer Aided Geometric Design, 4:3-16,1987.</ref>. Because exact solutions can be found only for some special surface classes, approximation methods must be used for the general case.
