'''Crossdisciplinarity''' describes any method, project and research activity that examines a subject outside the scope of its own [[discipline]] without cooperation or integration from other relevant disciplines. In crossdisciplinarity, topics are studied using foreign methodologies of unrelated disciplines.

Crossdisciplinarity is distinctly different from [[Interdisciplinarity]] because of the relationship that the disciplines share. Within a crossdisciplinary relationship disciplinary boundaries are crossed but no techniques or ideals are exchanged while Interdisciplinary relationships blend the practices and assumptions of each discipline involved.

[[Multidisciplinarity]] is very closely related to crossdisciplinarity because there is no transfer of methodologies or cooperation between the disciplines but different in that 'more than one' other outside discipline examines a specific topic.
