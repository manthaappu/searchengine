'''Negative Priming''' refers to a slowed response identification time to a target [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] that has been previously ignored. In previous [[Clinical trial|trials]] of the experiment this target stimulus or {{dn|Probe|probe}} was a distractor stimulus. It is widely assumed negative priming occurs as a result of the selection that occurs in the first display.<ref name=Tip>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3690/is_199612/ai_n8755301] Miliken, B. & Joordens, S (1996) Negative priming without overt prime selection Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology.
