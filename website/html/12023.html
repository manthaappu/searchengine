<html> <head> <title>Embedded middleware</title></head><body>Analogous to [[middleware]] , embedded '''middleware''' is a software layer that sits "in the middle" between the embedded application and the real time operating system (RTOS). Examples include protocol stack software, [[Operating System Abstraction Layer]] and possibly memory management modules.

Like operating system and middleware, the distinction between real time operating system and embedded middleware functionality is also to some extent, arbitrary. While core kernel functionality can only be provided by the real time operating system itself, some functionality previously provided by separately sold middleware is now integrated in operating systems. Conversely some functionality provided by RTOS may be advantageous to place into the middleware layer to provide consistency across different real time operating system platforms.

==Requirements==
*Limited resources: Smaller footprint (requires less code-bloat)
*Real-time support (available in Real-Time CORBA specification)
*Full CORBA implementation: 150 Kbytes â€“ 5 Mbytes

==Options==
*Minimal CORBA: Throw out some of the heavyweight CORBA mechanisms (~ 30-60 Kbytes)
*IIOP Engine: Use a library that keeps only the IIOP protocol part             (~ 15 Kbytes)
*CORBA Gateways: TCP bridge from the embedded processors to a CORBA gateway that talks to the rest of the world
