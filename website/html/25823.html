The '''National Core for Neuroethics''' at the [[University of British Columbia]] was established in August 2007, with generous support from the [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]], Institute of Mental Health and Addiction, [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]], the British Columbia Knowledge Development Fund, the [[Canada Research Chair]]s program, the UBC Brain Research Centre and the UBC Institute of Mental Health<ref name="neuroethics.ubc.ca">http://www.neuroethics.ubc.ca/index.html</ref>. Led by Dr. [[Judy Illes]], the Core has asserted itself on both the national and international stage as a forerunner in the field of [[neuroethics]], with particular focus on ethics in [[neurodegenerative disease]] and [[regenerative medicine]], international and cross cultural challenges in brain research, [[neuroimaging]] and [[ethics]], the neuroethics of [[enhancement]], and [[personalized medicine]]<ref>http://www.neuroethics.ubc.ca/research.html</ref>.

The Core's major research projects are focused on high impact, high visibility areas including the use of drugs and devices for neuroenhancement, ethics in neurodegenerative disease and regenerative medicine research, international and cross-cultural challenges in brain research, neuroimaging in the private sector, and the ethics of personalized medicine, among others.  Members of the Core also lead initiatives aside from their research projects.

Considerable attention has been given to the Core by both the scholarly and non-academic media, with the Core featured in the ''[[New York Times]]''<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/world/asia/15brainscan.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all "India’s novel use of brain scans in courts is debated]. New York Times, September 2008.</ref>{{Dubious|date=October 2009}}, the ''[[Vancouver Sun]]''<ref>Illes, J. [http://www2.canada.com/vancouversun/news/editorial/story.html?id=b663ac5e-c773-4d64-afd5-9c9c8ecbb7ec "The perilous pursuit of perfection: Neuroscience has been used to provide athletes a mental edge, but it raises ethical issues." The Vancouver Sun, 8 September 2008. [an editorial by the Core's leader]</ref>, on the ''[[Canwest]] Global Newshour''<ref>Post-traumatic stress drug. The News Hour, Global BC, November 2008.</ref>, and in the journal ''[[Science]]''<ref>Retention's the thing. Science, August 2008.</ref>, amongst many others. As an effort to engage the public in neuroethics discussion, the Core has recently started an online blog.<ref>http://neuroethicscanada.wordpress.com</ref> With the rapid pace of technological advance in the field of neuroscience, the National Core for Neuroethics is poised for continued expansion and success.

== Mission ==

The National Core for Neuroethics strives to ''tackle the ethical, legal, policy and social implications of frontier [[neuroscience]] through high impact research, education and outreach to ensure the close alignment of innovation and human values''<ref name="Lau P. 2008">Lau P., Chahal, N. Lombera, S. National Core for Neuroethics Annual Report 2007-2008. 2008, Vancouver, BC.</ref>.

== Vision ==

[[Image:National Core for Neuroethics Plaque.JPG|right|thumb|300px|National Core for Neuroethics]]

The Core has a vision ''that neuroscience is applied for maximum knowledge, health and well-being through the early integration of ethics and research, a collective  understanding of neuroethics, and the development of policies as the science unfolds''<ref name="Lau P. 2008"/>. To this end, the Core holds six key values that it uses to guide its research, education, and outreach activities:

'''[[Integrity]]''': Uphold high moral and ethics principles in all aspects of neuroethics research, education and outreach

'''[[Innovation]]''': Pursue creative and novel approaches to long-standing and nascent issues in neuroethics

'''[[Leadership]]''': Inspire and motivate high impact neuroethics research, education and outreach

'''[[Teamwork]]''': Respect the diversity and individuality of thoughts, ideals and beliefs

'''[[Partnership]]''': Actively engage collaborators and stakeholders

'''[[Responsiveness]]''': Promote sensitivity to research, education and outreach needs of the external environment

== People ==

The Core is led by '''[[Judy Illes]]''', PhD, Canada Research Chair in Neuroethics and Professor of Neurology at the University of British Columbia<ref name="neuroethics.ubc.ca">http://www.neuroethics.ubc.ca/people.html</ref>.

'''Peter Reiner''', PhD, Professor of Psychiatry at the University of British Columbia, is a Senior Faculty Member with the Core<ref name="neuroethics.ubc.ca"/>.

== Funding ==
