==Technical Information==

[[Image:GemstoneIV Wizard Screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|The Wizard Front End for ''GemStone IV.'']]
''GemStone IV'' is a text-based game built on Simutronics' proprietary engine, the IFE (Interactive Fiction Engine).  This engine is capable of changing nearly any aspect of the game [[on the fly]] which allows updates without the necessity for [[downtime]], a problem of many graphical RPGs.  Due to the use of the IFE, ''GemStone'' is rarely taken offline, giving a 24-hour uptime cycle aside from the occasional game [[Crash (computing)|crash]].

The ''GemStone'' interface is simply a text stream, and the game can be played with a [[Telnet]] interface after authentication.  There are several official interfaces to the game, as well as several unofficial ones.  The oldest interface for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] is called the "Wizard Front End" and offers several useful features such as status readouts, macros, and limited scripting abilities.  The Wizard has since been superseded with the "StormFront" Front End introduced in 2003.  StormFront offers several additional extensions to the game, including a "point and click" interface that allows one to click on text within the game and bring up action menus applicable to that portion of text.  The Java FE and a browser-based version named "eScape" are less popular alternatives.  A Wizard (similar to the Windows version) also exists for [[Macintosh Classic]], while a Front End named "Avalon" is available for [[Mac OS X]].  No official [[Linux]] client exists.

==History==

''GemStone'' was first demonstrated to GEnie in 1987 before Simutronics was officially incorporated.  It was only used as a demonstration model and was never available to the general subscribers.  ''GemStone ]['' was released in April 1988 to GEnie customers.  However, ''GemStone ]['' was very short-lived, and ''GemStone III'' went into open beta testing in December 1989, officially launching on February 1, 1990. <ref>[http://www.washingtontechnology.com/print/12_23/13829-1.html Online Gaming Firm Attracts Fans<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The transition from "II" to "III" maintained significant portions of the environment, but not all, and character records were not maintained over the transition, requiring all players to begin anew.  ''GemStone III'' evolved into ''GemStone IV'' in November 2003, but the game world and character records were maintained over the transition. ''GemStone III'' was promoted on GEnie by promising players the opportunity to receive real-life versions of gems found in-game, something that persisted for many years.

''GemStone'' originally operated with a license to use the Rolemaster game mechanics and [[Shadow World]] environment from [[Iron Crown Enterprises]] (ICE).  In 1995, Simutronics and ICE agreed to let the business relationship expire, necessitating the removal of all ICE intellectual property from ''GemStone''.  Many of the game changes were simply renaming ICE names, such as changing the world name from [[Kulthea]] to [[Elanthia]], and renaming the deities while keeping their previous characteristics.

Game mechanics were greatly changed with the de-ICEing (as the period is colloquially named), which required every game character to undergo significant changes.  Character racial and class choices were also changed, making any direct translation between the two systems difficult.  The end result was that every character was required to "re-roll" their character with the option to change race and skills, but maintaining their old experience level, class, and equipment. 

''GemStone'' became available on [[AOL]]<ref>{{cite book

When AOL switched to flat-rate pricing, ''GemStone'' did over 1.4 million customer-hours in a single month<ref>[http://www.netpreneur.org/tsarch/arch0206.html#5 NPNEWS archives - 1997/02/06<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and was attracting 2,000-2,500 simultaneous players.<ref>{{cite book

The number of subscribers has slowly been declining since the move to the web.  However, ''GemStone'' still maintains a healthy playerbase, with a large group of players remaining active for years.  There is at least one remaining player from ''GemStone ]['' and many others who have been playing for more than ten years.

==GemStone IV - Shattered==

In May of 2010, ''GemStone IV - Shattered'' was released by Simutronics. The new server is free of rules and any GM enforcement of policy besides bug abuse. Many players in this instance run scripts to advance their characters, and it provides a new and innovative approach to the game and player versus player (PvP) combat. Players enjoy an atmosphere of complete freedom, often highlighted by chaos due to the lack of PvP moderation by GameMasters.
