'''Ori Allon''' ({{lang-he|אורי אלון}}) is the person behind the [[Orion Search Engine]] that earned praise from [[Bill Gates]] among others for its ability to return pages on not just the [[Index term|keyword]] entered in, but also pages with content that is strongly related to the keyword.<ref>[http://www.physorg.com/news6255.html New search engine 'revolutionary'<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Allon, a [[computer scientist]], was born in [[Israel]] but came to study at [[Melbourne]]'s [[Monash University]] in 2002. After completing his Bachelor and Masters degrees, he moved to the [[University of New South Wales]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] to further his studies and research. His PhD was awarded from [[UNSW]] in April 2009.<ref>http://www.unsw.edu.au/news/pad/articles/2009/mar/Ori_Allon.html</ref>

The [[algorithm]] is a problem-solving computational procedure similar to those used by search engines such as [[Google]] and [[Yahoo!]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/breaking/aussies-formula-for-a-fortune/2006/04/10/1144521239582.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Google wins rights to Aussie algorithm | date=2006-04-10}}</ref>

Google bought the exclusive rights to use the search algorithm in April 2006.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-22|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/04/10/google_buys_orion/|title=Google buys Orion algorithm |publisher=[[The Register]]|date=2006-04-10|author=Oates, John }}</ref> The University earlier held talks with Google, Yahoo and MSN but finally Google managed to clinch the deal. Google also hired Allon.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2006/04/11/1144521270227.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Search for secret millions + Google | date=2006-04-11}}</ref>

In 2009, Google announced that it incorporated the Orion Search technology and algorithm.<ref>http://searchengineland.com/google-implements-orion-technology-improving-search-refinements-adds-longer-snippets-17038</ref><ref>http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/03/two-new-improvements-to-google-results.html</ref>

In 2010 Allon left Google and became CEO of Julpan.
