A '''remote manipulator''', also known as a '''telefactor''', '''telemanipulator''', or '''waldo''' (after the short story "[[Waldo (short story)|Waldo]]" by [[Robert A. Heinlein]] which features a man who invents and uses such devices),<ref>[http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=23 Technovelgy telemanipulator page]</ref> is a device which, through [[Electronics|electronic]], [[hydraulic]], or [[Machine|mechanical]] linkages, allows a [[hand]]-like mechanism to be controlled by a [[human]] operator. The purpose of such a device is usually to move or manipulate hazardous materials for reasons of [[safety]].

==History==
In 1945, the company Central Research Laboratories<ref>[http://www.centres.com/nuclear/manip/maniphis.htm CRL history]</ref> was given the [[contract]] to develop a remote manipulator for the [[Argonne National Laboratory]].  The intent was to replace devices which manipulated highly [[radioactivity|radioactive]] materials from above a sealed chamber or [[hot cell]], with a mechanism which operated through the side wall of the chamber, allowing a researcher to stand normally while working.

The result was the '''Master-Slave Manipulator Mk. 8''', or MSM-8, which became the iconic remote manipulator<ref>[http://www.centres.com/nuclear/manip/manip.htm Telemanipulator page]</ref> seen in newsreels and movies, such as the ''[[The Andromeda Strain (film)|Andromeda Strain]]'' or ''[[THX 1138]]''.

[[Robert A. Heinlein]] claims a much earlier origin for remote manipulators.<ref name="CMK">{{Citation | last=Heinlein | first=Robert A. | author-link=Robert A.

 }}</ref> He wrote that he got the idea for "waldos" after reading a 1918 article in ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' about "a poor fellow afflicted with [[myasthenia gravis]] ... [who] devised complicated lever arrangements to enable him to use what little strength he had."
