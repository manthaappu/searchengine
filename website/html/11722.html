'''Edward (‘Ted’) Hance Shortliffe''', MD, PhD (born 1947, Edmonton, Alberta) is a Canadian-born American biomedical informatician, physician and computer scientist.  Dr. Shortliffe is a pioneer in the use of artificial intelligence in medicine. He was the principal developer of the clinical expert system [[MYCIN]], one of the first rule-based [[artificial intelligence]] expert systems, which obtained clinical data interactively from a physician user and was used to diagnose and recommend treatment for severe infections.  While never used in practice (because it preceded the era of local-area networking and could not be integrated with patient records and physician workflow), its performance was shown to be comparable to and sometimes more accurate than that of Stanford infectious disease faculty.<ref>1. Rule-Based Expert Systems: The MYCIN Experiments of the Stanford Heuristic Programming Project -(edited by Bruce G. Buchanan and Edward H. Shortliffe; ebook version http://www.aaaipress.org/Classic/Buchanan/buchanan.html )</ref>  This spurred the development of a wide range of activity in the development of rule-based expert systems, knowledge representation, belief nets and other areas, and its design greatly influenced the subsequent development of computing in medicine.   

He is also regarded as a founder of the field of [[biomedical informatics]], and in 2006 received one of its highest honors, the [[Morris Collen Award]] given by the [[American College of Medical Informatics]] (ACMI). 

He has held administrative positions in academic medicine, research and national bodies including the Institute of Medicine, American College of Physicians (ACP), the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and National Library of Medicine (NLM), and been influential in the development of medicine, computing and biomedical informatics nationally and internationally.  His interests include the broad range of issues related to integrated medical decision-support systems and their implementation, biomedical informatics and medical education and training, and the Internet in medicine.

In March 2007, he became founding Dean of the University of Arizona's new College of Medicine campus in Phoenix.  He stepped down from this position in May 2008 and in January 2009 transferred his primary academic appointment to Arizona State University where he became Professor of Biomedical Informatics.  He maintained a secondary appointment as Professor of Basic Medical Sciences and of Medicine at the University of Arizona College of Medicine (Phoenix Campus).  Since November 2009 he has transferred his academic home to a part-time appointment as Professor, Biomedical Informatics, School of Health Information Sciences, University of Texas Health Science Center at the Texas Medical Center in Houston, where he now lives.

In July 2009 Dr. Shortliffe assumed a position as President and Chief Executive Officer of the [[American Medical Informatics Association]] in Bethesda, MD. an organization that he helped to form between 1988 and 1990 when he was President of SCAMC (the Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care).

== Biography and career ==

Dr. Shortliffe grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, until his family moved to Connecticut when he was 6.  He attended the Loomis School in Connecticut and later Gresham’s School in the UK.  His father was a physician and hospital administrator; his mother, an English teacher.  He has one brother and one sister.

As an undergraduate at [[Harvard]], he started working in the computer laboratory of G. Octo Barnett at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] and realized that he could have a career spanning both medicine and computing.  

After receiving an AB in applied mathematics ''magna cum laude'' from Harvard College in 1970, he received an MD (1976) and PhD in Medical Information Systems (1975) from [[Stanford University]], with a dissertation on the MYCIN system, for which he also won the [http://awards.acm.org/hopper/citation.cfm?id=4764071&srt=all&aw=145&ao=GMHOPPER 1976 Grace Murray Hopper award] for outstanding young computer scientist.   He completed internal medicine house-staff training from 1976-1979 at Massachusetts General Hospital and Stanford Hospital.  In 1979 he joined the Stanford faculty of medicine and computer science, where he directed the Stanford University Medical EXpertimental computer resource (SUMEX) and subsequently the Center for Advanced Medical Informatics at Stanford (CAMIS), continuing his work on expert systems, including ONCOCIN (an oncology decision support program), T-HELPER, and other projects in the Stanford Heuristic Programming Project.<ref>Clancey WJ, Shortliffe EH, eds.  Readings in medical artificial intelligence:the first decade. Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1984</ref>  He also simultaneously served as Chief of General Internal Medicine and Associate Chair of Medicine for Primary Care, and was principal investigator of the [http://www.smi.stanford.edu/projects/intermed-web/Home.htm InterMed Collaboratory], which developed the science of computable guidelines for medical decision support.

In 1980 he founded one of the earliest formal degree programs in biomedical informatics at Stanford University, emphasizing a rigorous and experimentalist approach. He is known for his administrative ability, dedication to teaching and ability to create scientific and educational environments where (in the words of NLM director [[Donald A. B. Lindberg]]) 'smart people want to come’.  He has been widely influential in the development and public awareness of biomedical informatics as a field and trained many students who went on to be leaders in the study of uncertainty and AI, and other areas.  He is also much in demand as a speaker and advisor to government and industry.  Since 2003 he has served on the Board of Directors of Medco Health Solutions, a large pharmacy benefits manager headquartered in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey.

In 2000 he moved to [[Columbia University]] as chair of the department of [http://www.dbmi.columbia.edu Biomedical Informatics], Deputy Vice President (Columbia University Medical Center), Senior Associate Dean (College of Physicians and Surgeons) for Strategic Information Resources, Professor of Medicine, Professor of Computer Science, and Director of Medical Informatics Services for the New York-Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH).  He continued work on decision support guidelines including the development of the Guideline Interchange Format (GLIF3).<ref>Boxwala AA, Peleg M, Tu S, Ogunyemi O, Zeng QT, Wang D, Patel VL, Greenes RA, Shortliffe EH. `GLIF3: a representation format for sharable computer-interpretable clinical practice guidelines.’ Journal of Biomedical Informatics 2004;37(3):147-161.</ref>  He greatly expanded the faculty and scope of department activities, including overseeing the development of patient care systems at NYPH, basic science research, and expanded training programs in biomedical informatics, including public health informatics, the integration of bioinformatics and clinical informatics, and the introduction of informatics training for medical students.

== Advisory Activities ==

At age 39, Dr. Shortliffe was elected to the [[Institute of Medicine]] of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (where he has served on the IOM executive council).  He is also a member of the [[American Association for Artificial Intelligence]], [[American Society for Clinical Investigation]], the [[Association of American Physicians]], and the American Clinical and Climatological Association. 

He is a founding member of the [[American Medical Informatics Association]] and was one of five founding fellows of the [[American College of Medical Informatics]].  He is a Master of the [[American College of Physicians]] (ACP) and was a member of that organization’s Board of Regents from 1996-2002. He is Editor-in-Chief of the [[Journal of Biomedical Informatics]], and serves on the editorial boards for several other biomedical informatics publications. 

He has served on the oversight committee for the Division of Engineering and Physical Sciences (National Academy of Sciences) and the Biomedical Informatics Expert Panel (National Center for Research Resources at the [[National Institutes of Health]]).  He also recently served on the National Committee for Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS) and on the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee (PITAC). Earlier he served on the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (National Research Council), the Biomedical Library Review Committee ([[National Library of Medicine]]), and was recipient of a research career development award from the latter agency.

He is the author of more than 300 publications including seven books, one of which (Biomedical Informatics, now in its third edition) is considered the leading textbook in the field.
