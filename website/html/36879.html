A '''tax-benefit model''' is a form of static [[microsimulation]] model. It is usually based on a representative or administrative [[data set]] and certain policy rules. These models are used to ''cost'' certain policy [[reform]]s and to determine the winners and losers of [[reform]]. One example is [[Euromod]] which models taxes and benefits for fifteen [[EU]] states.
