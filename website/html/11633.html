<html> <head> <title>EcoCyc</title></head><body>'''EcoCyc''' is a bioinformatics database for the [[bacterium]] [[Escherichia coli]] K-12. The EcoCyc project performs literature-based curation of the ''E. coli'' genome, and of ''E. coli'' transcriptional regulation, transporters, and metabolic pathways.

EcoCyc is a regularly updated electronic encyclopedia that contains written summaries of ''E. coli'' genes, distilled from more than 16,000 scientific articles. 

EcoCyc is also a computable description of the genome and cellular networks of ''E. coli'' that supports data mining and computational analyses.  

Objects in the EcoCyc database describe each ''E. coli'' gene and gene product.  Database objects also describe molecular interactions, including metabolic pathways, transport events, and the regulation of gene expression.

EcoCyc provides several genome-scale visualization tools to aid in the analysis
of omics data, such as by painting gene expression or metabolomics data onto
the full regulatory network of E. coli.

EcoCyc can be accessed through the EcoCyc web site, as a set of downloadable files,
and in conjunction with the Pathway Tools software that can be installed locally
on Macintosh, PC/Windows, and PC/Linux computers.  The downloadable software
provides capabilities that go well beyond the web version of EcoCyc.
