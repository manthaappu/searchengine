{{Refimprove|date=June 2008}}
A '''password''' is a secret [[word]] or string of [[character (computing)|characters]] that is used for [[authentication]], to prove identity or gain access to a resource (example: an [[access code]] is a type of password). The password should be kept [[secrecy|secret]] from those not allowed access.

The use of passwords is known to be ancient. Sentries would challenge those wishing to enter an area or approaching it to supply a password or ''watchword.'' Sentries would only allow a person or group to pass if they knew the password. In modern times, [[user (computing)|user name]]s and passwords are commonly used by people during a [[logging (computer security)|log in]] process that [[access control|controls access]] to protected computer [[operating system]]s, [[mobile phone]]s, [[cable TV]] decoders, [[Automated Teller Machine|automated teller machines]] (ATMs), etc. A typical [[computer user]] may require passwords for many purposes: logging in to computer accounts, retrieving [[e-mail]] from servers, accessing programs, databases, networks, web sites, and even reading the morning newspaper online.

Despite the name, there is no need for passwords to be actual words; indeed passwords which are not actual words may be harder to guess, a desirable property. Some passwords are formed from multiple words and may more accurately be called a [[passphrase]]. The term  '''passcode''' is sometimes used when the secret information is purely numeric, such as the [[personal identification number]] (PIN) commonly used for ATM access. Passwords are generally short enough to be easily [[memory|memorized]] and typed.

For the purposes of more compellingly authenticating the identity of one computing device to another, passwords have significant disadvantages (they may be stolen, spoofed, forgotten, etc.) over authentications systems relying on [[cryptographic protocol]]s, which are more difficult to circumvent.

==Easy to remember, hard to guess==
The easier a password is for the owner to remember generally means it will be easier for an [[hacker (computer security)|attacker]] to guess.<ref>{{Cite news|title=If Your Password Is 123456, Just Make It HackMe |work=The New York Times |first=Ashlee |last=Vance |date=January 20, 2010 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/technology/21password.html }}</ref> Passwords which are difficult to remember will reduce the security of a system because (a) users might need to write down or electronically store the password, (b) users will need frequent password resets and (c) users are more likely to re-use the same password. Similarly, the more stringent requirements for password strength, e.g. "have a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters and digits" or "change it monthly", the greater the degree to which users will subvert the system.<ref>http://all.net/journal/netsec/1997-09.html Fred Cohen and Associates</ref>

In ''The Memorability and Security of Passwords'',<ref>[http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/jeff.yan/jyan_ieee_pwd.pdf The Memorability and Security of Passwords]</ref>  Jeff Yan et al. examine the effect of advice given to users about a good choice of password.  They found that passwords based on thinking of a phrase and taking the first letter of each word are just as memorable as naively selected passwords, and just as hard to crack as randomly generated passwords.  Combining two ''unrelated'' words is another good method. Having a personally designed "[[algorithm]]" for generating obscure passwords is another good method.

However, asking users to remember a password consisting of a “mix of uppercase and lowercase characters” is similar to asking them to remember a sequence of bits: hard to remember, and only a little bit harder to crack (e.g. only 128 times harder to crack for 7-letter passwords, less if the user simply capitalises one of the letters). Asking users to use "both letters and digits" will often lead to easy-to-guess substitutions such as 'E' --> '3' and 'I' --> '1', substitutions which are well known to attackers. Similarly typing the password one keyboard row higher is a common trick known to attackers.

==Factors in the security of a password system==
The security of a password-protected system depends on several factors. The overall system must, of course, be designed for sound security, with protection against [[computer virus]]es, [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s and the like. Physical security issues are also a concern, from deterring [[shoulder surfing (computer security)|shoulder surfing]] to more sophisticated physical threats such as video cameras and keyboard sniffers. And, of course, passwords should be chosen so that they are hard for an attacker to guess and hard for an attacker to discover using any (and all) of the available automatic attack schemes. See [[password strength]], [[computer security]], and [[computer insecurity]].

Nowadays it is a common practice for computer systems to hide passwords as they are typed. The purpose of this measure is to avoid bystanders reading the password. However, some argue that such practice may lead to mistakes and stress, encouraging users to choose weak passwords. As an alternative, users should have the option to show or hide passwords as they type them.<ref>[http://www.lyquix.com/blog/92-do-we-need-to-hide-passwords Lyquix Blog: Do We Need to Hide Passwords?]</ref>

Effective access control provisions may force extreme measures on criminals seeking to acquire a password or biometric token.<ref>[[news.bbc.co.uk]]: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4396831.stm Malaysia car thieves steal finger]</ref> Less extreme measures include [[extortion]], [[rubber hose cryptanalysis]], and [[side channel attack]].

Here are some specific password management issues that must be considered in thinking about, choosing, and handling, a password.

===Rate at which an attacker can try guessed passwords===
The rate at which an attacker can submit guessed passwords to the system is a key factor in determining system security. Some systems impose a time-out of several seconds after a small number (e.g., three) of failed password entry attempts. In the absence of other vulnerabilities, such systems can be effectively secure with relatively simple passwords, if they have been well chosen and are not easily guessed.<ref>[http://www.modernlifeisrubbish.co.uk/top-10-most-common-passwords.asp Top ten passwords used in the United Kingdom]</ref>

Many systems store or transmit a [[cryptographic hash]] of the password in a manner that makes the hash value accessible to an attacker. When this is done, and it is very common, an attacker can work off-line, rapidly testing candidate passwords against the true password's hash value. Passwords that are used to generate cryptographic keys (e.g., for [[disk encryption]] or [[Wi-Fi]] security) can also be subjected to high rate guessing. Lists of common passwords are widely available and can make password attacks very efficient. (See [[Password cracking]].) Security in such situations depends on using passwords or passphrases of adequate complexity, making such an attack computationally infeasible for the attacker. Some systems, such as [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] and [[Wi-Fi Protected Access|Wi-Fi WPA]], apply a computation-intensive hash to the password to slow such attacks. See [[key strengthening]].

===Form of stored passwords===
Some computer systems store user passwords as [[cleartext]], against which to compare user log on attempts. If an attacker gains access to such an internal password store, all passwords—and so all user accounts—will be compromised. If some users employ the same password for accounts on different systems, those will be compromised as well.

More secure systems store each password in a cryptographically protected form, so access to the actual password will still be difficult for a snooper who gains internal access to the system, while validation of user access attempts remains possible.

A common approach stores only a "hashed" form of the plaintext password. When a user types in a password on such a system, the password handling software runs through a [[cryptographic hash]] algorithm, and if the hash value generated from the user's entry matches the hash stored in the password database, the user is permitted access. The hash value is created by applying a hash function (for maximum resistance to attack this should be a [[cryptographic hash function]]) to a string consisting of the submitted password and, usually, another value known as a [[salt (cryptography)|salt]]. The salt prevents attackers from easily building a list of hash values for common passwords. [[MD5]] and [[SHA1]] are frequently used cryptographic hash functions.

A modified version of the [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] algorithm was used for this purpose in early [[Unix]] systems. The UNIX DES function was iterated to make the hash function equivalent slow, further frustrating automated guessing attacks, and used the password candidate as a key to encrypt a fixed value, thus blocking yet another attack on the password shrouding system. More recent Unix or Unix like systems (e.g., [[Linux]] or the various [[BSD]] systems) use what most believe to be still more effective protective mechanisms based on [[MD5]], [[SHA1]], [[Blowfish (cipher)|Blowfish]], [[Twofish]], or any of several other algorithms to prevent or frustrate attacks on stored password files.<ref>[http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2004-06/pdfs/alexander.pdf Password Protection for Modern Operating Systems]</ref>

If the hash function is well designed, it will be computationally infeasible to reverse it to directly find a [[plaintext]] password. However, many systems do not protect their hashed passwords adequately, and if an attacker can gain access to the hashed values he can use widely available tools which compare the encrypted outcome of every word from some list, such as a dictionary (many are available on the Internet). Large lists of possible passwords in many languages are widely available on the Internet, as are software programs to try common variations. The existence of these [[dictionary attack]] tools constrains user password choices which are intended to resist easy attacks; they must not be findable on such lists. Obviously, words on such lists should be avoided as passwords. Use of a [[key stretching]] hash such as [[PBKDF2]] is designed to reduce this risk.

A poorly designed hash function can make attacks feasible even if a strong password is chosen. See [[LM hash]] for a widely deployed, and insecure, example.<ref>http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;q299656</ref>

===Methods of verifying a password over a network===
Various methods have been used to verify submitted passwords in a network setting:

====Simple transmission of the password====
Passwords are vulnerable to interception (i.e., "snooping") while being transmitted to the authenticating machine or person. If the password is carried as electrical signals on unsecured physical wiring between the user access point and the central system controlling the password database, it is subject to snooping by [[Telephone tapping|wiretapping]] methods. If it is carried as packetized data over the Internet, anyone able to watch the [[packet (information technology)|packets]] containing the logon information can snoop with a very low probability of detection.

Email is sometimes used to distribute passwords. Since most email is sent as [[cleartext]], it is available without effort during transport to any eavesdropper.  Further, the email will be stored on at least two computers as cleartext—the sender's and the recipient's. If it passes through intermediate systems during its travels, it will probably be stored on those as well, at least for some time. Attempts to delete an email from all these vulnerabilities may, or may not, succeed; [[backup]]s or history files or [[cache]]s on any of several systems may still contain the email. Indeed merely identifying every one of those systems may be difficult. Emailed passwords are generally an insecure method of distribution.

An example of [[cleartext]] transmission of passwords is the original [[Wikipedia]] website. When you logged into your Wikipedia account, your [[username]] and password are sent from your computer's browser through the Internet as cleartext. In principle, anyone could read them in transit and thereafter log into your account as you; Wikipedia's servers have no way of distinguishing such an attacker from you. In practice, an unknowably larger number could do so as well (e.g., employees at your Internet Service Provider, at any of the systems through which the traffic passes, etc.). More recently, Wikipedia has offered a secure login option, which, like many e-commerce sites, uses the [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] / ([[Transport Layer Security|TLS]]) cryptographically based protocol to eliminate the cleartext transmission. But, because anyone can gain access to Wikipedia (without logging in at all), and then edit essentially all articles, it can be argued that there is little need to encrypt these transmissions as there's little being protected. Other websites (e.g., banks and financial institutions) have quite different security requirements, and cleartext transmission of anything is clearly insecure in those contexts.

Using client-side encryption will only protect transmission from the mail handling system server to the client machine. Previous or subsequent relays of the email will not be protected and the email will probably be stored on multiple computers, certainly on the originating and receiving computers, most often in cleartext.

====Transmission through encrypted channels====
The risk of interception of passwords sent over the Internet can be reduced by, among other approaches, using [[cryptography|cryptographic]] protection. The most widely used is the [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS, previously called [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]]) feature built into most current Internet [[Web browser|browsers]]. Most browsers alert the user of a TLS/SSL protected exchange with a server by displaying a closed lock icon, or some other sign, when TLS is in use. There are several other techniques in use; see [[cryptography]].

====Hash-based challenge-response methods====
Unfortunately, there is a conflict between stored hashed-passwords and hash-based [[challenge-response authentication]]; the latter requires a client to prove to a server that he knows what the [[shared secret]] (i.e., password) is, and to do this, the server must be able to obtain the shared secret from its stored form. On many systems (including [[Unix]]-type systems) doing remote authentication, the shared secret usually becomes the hashed form and has the serious limitation of exposing passwords to offline guessing attacks. In addition, when the hash is used as a shared secret, an attacker does not need the original password to authenticate remotely; he only needs the hash.

====Zero-knowledge password proofs====
Rather than transmitting a password, or transmitting the hash of the password, [[password-authenticated key agreement]] systems can perform a [[zero-knowledge password proof]], which proves knowledge of the password without exposing it.

Moving a step further, augmented systems for [[password-authenticated key agreement]] (e.g., [[Authentication and key agreement via Memorable Passwords|AMP]], [[SPEKE|B-SPEKE]], [[PAK-Z]], [[Secure remote password protocol|SRP-6]]) avoid both the conflict and limitation of hash-based methods. An augmented system allows a client to prove knowledge of the password to a server, where the server knows only a (not exactly) hashed password, and where the unhashed password is required to gain access.

===Procedures for changing passwords===
Usually, a system must provide a way to change a password, either because a user believes the current password has been (or might have been) compromised, or as a precautionary measure. If a new password is passed to the system in unencrypted form, security can be lost (e.g., via wiretapping) even before the new password can even be installed in the password database. And, of course, if the new password is given to a compromised employee, little is gained. Some web sites include the user-selected password in an unencrypted confirmation e-mail message, with the obvious increased vulnerability.

[[Identity management]] systems are increasingly used to automate issuance of replacements for lost passwords, a feature called [[self service password reset]]. The user's identity is verified by asking questions and comparing the answers to ones previously stored (i.e., when the account was opened). Typical questions include: "Where were you born?," "What is your favorite movie?" or "What is the name of your pet?" In many cases the answers to these questions can be relatively easily guessed by an attacker, determined by low effort research, or obtained through [[social engineering (computer security)|social engineering]], and so this is less than fully satisfactory as a verification technique. While many users have been trained never to reveal a password, few consider the name of their pet or favorite movie to require similar care.

===Password longevity===
"Password aging" is a feature of some operating systems which forces users to change passwords frequently (e.g., quarterly, monthly or even more often), with the intent that a stolen password will become unusable more or less quickly. Such policies usually provoke user protest and foot-dragging at best and hostility at worst. Users may develop simple variation patterns to keep their passwords memorable. In any case, the security benefits are distinctly limited, if worthwhile, because attackers often exploit a password as soon as it is compromised, which will probably be some time before change is required. In many cases, particularly with administrative or "root" accounts, once an attacker has gained access, he can make alterations to the operating system that will allow him future access even after the initial password he used expires. (see [[rootkit]]). Implementing such a policy requires careful consideration of the relevant human factors. It may be required because of the nature of IT systems the password allows access to; if personal data is involved the EU [[Data Protection Directive]] is in force.

===Number of users per password===
Sometimes a single password controls access to a device, for example, for a network router, or password-protected mobile phone. However, in the case of a [[computer security|computer system]], a password is usually stored for each user account, thus making all access traceable (save, of course, in the case of users sharing passwords).
A would-be user on most systems must supply a username as well as a password, almost always at account set up time, and periodically thereafter. If the user supplies a password matching the one stored for the supplied username, he or she is permitted further access into the computer system. This is also the case for a cash machine, except that the 'user name' is typically the account number stored on the bank customer's card, and the PIN is usually quite short (4 to 6 digits).

Allotting separate passwords to each user of a system is preferable to having a single password shared by legitimate users of the system, certainly from a security viewpoint. This is partly because users are more willing to tell another person (who may not be authorized) a shared password than one exclusively for their use. Single passwords are also much less convenient to change because many people need to be told at the same time, and they make removal of a particular user's access more difficult, as for instance on graduation or resignation. Per-user passwords are also essential if users are to be held accountable for their activities, such as making financial transactions or viewing medical records.

===Design of the protected software===
Common techniques used to improve the security of software systems protected by a password include:

*Not displaying the password on the display screen as it is being entered or obscuring it as it is typed by using asterisks (*) or bullets (•).
*Allowing passwords of adequate length. (Some [[legacy system|legacy]] operating systems, including early versions{{Which?|date=September 2010}} of Unix and Windows, limited passwords to an 8 character maximum,<ref>

</ref><ref>
[http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/REDBACK-87 "You must provide a password between 1 and 8 characters in length"]
</ref> reducing security.)
*Requiring users to re-enter their password after a period of inactivity (a semi log-off policy).
*Enforcing a [[password policy]] to increase [[password strength]] and security.
**Requiring periodic password changes.
**Assigning randomly chosen passwords.
**Requiring minimum password lengths.
**Some systems require characters from various character classes in a password—for example, "must have at least one uppercase and at least one lowercase letter". However, all-lowercase passwords are more secure per keystroke than mixed capitalization passwords.<ref>[http://world.std.com/~reinhold/dicewarefaq.html#capitalize "To Capitalize or Not to Capitalize?"]</ref>
**Providing an alternative to keyboard entry (e.g., spoken passwords, or [[biometrics|biometric]] passwords).
*Using encrypted tunnels or [[password-authenticated key agreement]] to prevent access to transmitted passwords via network attacks
*Limiting the number of allowed failures within a given time period (to prevent repeated password guessing).  After the limit is reached, further attempts will fail (including correct password attempts) until the beginning of the next time period. However, this is vulnerable to a form of [[denial-of-service attack|denial of service attack]].
*Introducing a delay between password submission attempts to slow down automated password guessing programs.

Some of the more stringent policy enforcement measures can pose a risk of alienating users, possibly decreasing security as a result.

=== Write down passwords on paper ===

Historically, many security experts asked people to memorize their passwords and "Never write down a password".
More recently, many security experts such as [[Bruce Schneier]] recommend that people use passwords that are too complicated to memorize, write them down on paper, and keep them in a wallet.<ref>

==Password cracking==
{{Main|Password cracking}}
Attempting to crack passwords by trying as many possibilities as time and money permit is a [[brute force attack]]. A related method, rather more efficient in most cases, is a [[dictionary attack]]. In a dictionary attack, all words in one or more dictionaries are tested. Lists of common passwords are also typically tested.

[[Password strength]] is the likelihood that a password cannot be guessed or discovered, and varies with the attack algorithm used. Passwords easily discovered are termed ''weak'' or ''vulnerable''; passwords very difficult or impossible to discover are considered ''strong''. There are several programs available for password attack (or even auditing and recovery by systems personnel) such as [[L0phtCrack]], [[John the Ripper]], and [[Cain (software)|Cain]]; some of which use password design vulnerabilities (as found in the Microsoft LANManager system) to increase efficiency. These programs are sometimes used by system administrators to detect weak passwords proposed by users.

Studies of production computer systems have consistently shown that a large fraction of all user-chosen passwords are readily guessed automatically. For example, Columbia University found 22% of user passwords could be recovered with little effort.<ref>[http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~crf/howto/password-howto.html Password<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
According to [[Bruce Schneier]], examining data from a 2006 [[phishing]] attack, 55% of MySpace passwords would be crackable in 8 hours using a commercially available Password Recovery Toolkit capable of testing 200,000 passwords per second in 2006.<ref>[http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/12/realworld_passw.html Schneier, Real-World Passwords]</ref> He also reported that the single most common password was ''password1'', confirming yet again the general lack of informed care in choosing passwords among users.  (He nevertheless maintained, based on these data, that the general quality of passwords has improved over the years—for example, average length was up to eight characters from under seven in previous surveys, and less than 4% were dictionary words.<ref>[http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2006/12/72300 MySpace Passwords Aren't So Dumb]</ref>)

==Alternatives to passwords for access control==
The numerous ways in which permanent or semi-permanent passwords can be compromised has prompted the development of other techniques. Unfortunately, some are inadequate in practice, and in any case few  have become universally available for users seeking a more secure alternative.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

*[[One-time password|Single-use passwords]]. Having passwords which are only valid once makes many potential attacks ineffective. Most users find single use passwords extremely inconvenient. They have, however, been widely implemented in personal [[online banking]], where they are known as [[TAN (banking)|Transaction Authentication Numbers]] (TANs). As most home users only perform a small number of transactions each week, the single use issue has not led to intolerable customer dissatisfaction in this case.
*[[Time-synchronized one-time passwords]] are similar in some ways to single-use passwords, but the value to be entered is displayed on a small (generally pocketable) item and changes every minute or so.
*[[PassWindow]] one-time passwords are used as single-use passwords, but the dynamic characters to be entered are visible only when a user superimposes a unique printed visual key over a server generated challenge image shown on the user's screen.
*Access controls based on [[public key cryptography]] e.g. [[Secure Shell|ssh]]. The necessary keys are usually too large to memorize (but see proposal [http://eprint.iacr.org/2005/434 Passmaze]) and must be stored on a local computer, [[security token]] or portable memory device, such as a [[USB flash drive]] or even [[floppy disk]].
*[[Biometric]] methods promise authentication based on unalterable personal characteristics, but currently (2008) have high error rates and require additional hardware to scan, for example, [[fingerprint]]s, [[iris (anatomy)|iris]]es, etc. They have proven easy to spoof in some famous incidents testing commercially available systems, for example,  the gummie fingerprint spoof demonstration,<ref>T Matsumoto. H Matsumotot, K Yamada, and S Hoshino, Impact of artificial 'Gummy' Fingers on Fingerprint Systems. Proc SPIE, vol 4677, Optical Security and Counterfeit Deterrence Techniques IV or itu.int/itudoc/itu-t/workshop/security/resent/s5p4.pdf pg 356</ref> and, because these characteristics are unalterable, they cannot be changed if compromised; this is a highly important consideration in access control as a compromised access token is necessarily insecure.
*[[Single sign-on]] technology is claimed to eliminate the need for having multiple passwords. Such schemes do not relieve user and administrators from choosing reasonable single passwords, nor system designers or administrators from ensuring that private access control information passed among systems enabling single sign-on is secure against attack. As yet, no satisfactory standard has been developed.
*Envaulting technology is a password-free way to secure data on e.g. removable storage devices such as USB flash drives. Instead of user passwords, access control is based on the user's access to a network resource.
*Non-text-based passwords, such as graphical passwords or mouse-movement based passwords.<ref>http://waelchatila.com/2005/09/18/1127075317148.html</ref> [[File:Image-based Authentication.jpg|thumb |alt=Pictures as one-time passcodes|A randomly-generated grid of images used to create one-time passwords]] Graphical passwords are an alternative means of [[authentication]] for log-in intended to be used in place of conventional password; they use [[image]]s, [[graphics]] or [[colours]] instead of [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]], [[digit (math)|digit]]s or [[special characters]].

Each time the user is required to authenticate, they look for the images that fit their pre-chosen categories and enter the randomly-generated alphanumeric character that appears in the image to form the one-time password. <ref name=“Images Could Change the Authentication Picture”>{{cite web |url=http://www.darkreading.com/authentication/security/client/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=228200140 |title=Images Could Change the Authentication Picture |author=Ericka Chickowski |publisher=Dark Reading |date=2010-11-03}}</ref>  <ref name=“Confident Technologies Delivers Image-Based, Multifactor Authentication to Strengthen Passwords on Public-Facing Websites”>{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Confident-Technologies-Delivers-Image-Based-Multifactor-Authentication-Strengthen-Passwords-1342854.htm |title=Confident Technologies Delivers Image-Based, Multifactor Authentication to Strengthen Passwords on Public-Facing Websites|date=2010-10-28}}</ref> So far, graphical passwords are promising, but are not widely used.

While some believe that graphical passwords would be harder to [[Password cracking|crack]], others suggest that people will be just as likely to pick common images or sequences as they are to pick common passwords.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Website password systems==
Passwords are used on websites to authenticate users and are usually maintained on the Web server, meaning the browser on a remote system sends a password to the server (by HTTP POST), the server checks the password and sends back the relevant content (or an access denied message). This process eliminates the possibility of local reverse engineering as the code used to authenticate the password does not reside on the local machine.

Transmission of the password, via the browser, in plaintext means it can be intercepted along its journey to the server. Many web authentication systems use SSL to establish an encrypted session between the browser and the server, and is usually the underlying meaning of claims to have a "secure Web site". This is done automatically by the browser and increases integrity of the session, assuming neither end has been compromised and that the [[Transport Layer Security|SSL/TLS]] implementations used are high quality ones.

==History of passwords==
Passwords or ''watchwords'' have been used since ancient times.  [[Polybius]] describes the system for distribution watchwords in the [[Military of ancient Rome|Roman military]] as follows:
:The way in which they secure the passing round of the watchword for the night is as follows: from the tenth [[maniple (military unit)|maniple]] of each class of infantry and cavalry, the maniple which is encamped at the lower end of the street, a man is chosen who is relieved from guard duty, and he attends every day at sunset at the tent of the [[tribune]], and receiving from him the watchword - that is a wooden tablet with the word inscribed on it - takes his leave, and on returning to his quarters passes on the watchword and tablet before witnesses to the commander of the next maniple, who in turn passes it to the one next him. All do the same until it reaches the first maniples, those encamped near the tents of the tribunes. These latter are obliged to deliver the tablet to the tribunes before dark. So that if all those issued are returned, the tribune knows that the watchword has been given to all the maniples, and has passed through all on its way back to him. If any one of them is missing, he makes inquiry at once, as he knows by the marks from what quarter the tablet has not returned, and whoever is responsible for the stoppage meets with the punishment he merits.<ref>[http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_text_polybius6.htm Polybius on the Roman Military<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Passwords in military use evolved to include not just a password, but a password and a counterpassword; for example in the opening days of the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]], paratroopers of the U.S. 101st Airborne Division used a password - "thunder" - which was presented as a challenge, and answered with the correct response - "flash". The challenge and response were changed periodically. American paratroopers also famously used a device known as a "cricket" on [[D-Day]] in place of a password system as a temporarily unique method of identification; one metallic click given by the device in lieu of a password was to be met by two clicks in reply.<ref>Bando, Mark ''Screaming Eagles: Tales of the 101st Airborne Division in World War II''</ref>

Passwords have been used with computers since the earliest days of computing. [[MIT]]'s [[Compatible Time-Sharing System|CTSS]], one of the first time sharing systems, was introduced in 1961. It had a LOGIN command that requested a user password. "After typing PASSWORD, the system turns off the printing mechanism, if possible, so that the user may type in his password with privacy."<ref>CTSS Programmers Guide, 2nd Ed., MIT Press, 1965</ref> [[Robert Morris (cryptographer)|Robert Morris]] invented the idea of storing login passwords in a hashed form as part of the [[Unix]] operating system. His algorithm, known as [[crypt (Unix)|crypt(3)]], used a 12-bit [[salt (cryptography)|salt]] and invoked a modified form of the [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] algorithm 25 times to reduce the risk of pre-computed [[dictionary attack]]s.
