'''GEO-LEO''' ('''G'''EO '''L'''ibrary '''E'''xperts Online) is a [[virtual library]] for the specialty fields of [[mining]], [[geography]], [[maps]] and [[astronomy]]. This is a free [[Web portal|Internet portal]] to search for, find and obtain books, periodicals, articles, websites and maps in the context of geosciences. Free or licensed full texts, e.g. from e-journals, are directly accessible. Furthermore you can publish your own papers in '''GEO-LEOe-docs'''. 

GEO-LEO is a service provided by the university library “Georgius Agricola” of the TU [[Freiberg University of Mining and Technology|Bergakademie Freiberg]] and the [[Göttingen State and University Library]] (Niedersächsische Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Göttingen, SUB) of the [[University of Göttingen]]. This cooperation is based on the [http://www.dfg.de/en/index.html DFG]´s ([[Germany]]'s Research Foundation) “national [[distributed library]] plan”, which shares the [[scientific literature]] provision between selected university libraries, each with special scientific priorities. Both libraries have a similar focus on the geosciences aspects of this library plan and therefore they cooperate closely. This is the background of their partnership and of the project GEO-LEO, funded by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|DFG]] since 2002.
