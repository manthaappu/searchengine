A '''systems engineering process''' is a [[process (engineering)|process]] for applying [[systems engineering]] techniques to the development of all kinds of systems. Systems engineering processes are related to the stages in a [[System Development Life Cycle|system life cycle]]. The systems engineering process usually begins at an early stage of the system life cycle and at the very beginning of a project, but as stated by Bahill and Briggs (2001), systems engineering can also start at the middle. A variety of systems engineering processes have been proposed by different organizations. 

== History ==
Several systems engineering methods and process guidelines have been developed since 1969. These methods describe all the activities and deliverables of a systems engineering project.

The first, Mil-Std-499 is a military standard of the U.S. Department of Defense and was used to create complex systems, for example, a nuclear submarine or missiles. The build up body of knowledge has become known as systems engineering. Since IEEE has developed 1220, the systems engineering standard has become commercial.

The early systems engineering methods, such as Mil-Std-499B (see figure 1), are focused on the verification and development life cycle functions, but the later methods cover almost the whole system life cycle. Systems engineering and software engineering have evolved as independent processes, but recent process guidelines and standards emphasize the need for integrating both these processes. (Boehm, 2005)

== Process description ==
The [[meta-model]] in figure 2 shows a systems engineering method. The activities in the model can be somewhat different in a specific project. This is derived from several existing standards, marked in figure 1. ANSI/EIA 632 serves as the basis for this method, since many current systems engineering methods are based on this standard. Further, ISO/IEC 15288 and the [[INCOSE]] [http://www.incose.org/ProductsPubs/products/sehandbook.aspx Systems Engineering Handbook], which are more recent, serve as source for this method. The final source is an older standard, Mil-Std-499B. The activities and concepts in the model are explained [[#activities|here]]. The model is separated in four main processes. The Agreement, Project, Technical and Evaluation processes. These will be explained in further detail below.
=== Agreement processes===
The first step in the systems engineering process is to establish an agreement with the customer, in order to build a new system. This order is set when the outcome of the [[feasibility study]] is positive: there is a need for a new system and there is no other system that can be used or it will be more cost effective to create a new system. When the outcome is negative, the project will end here. The input of the feasibility study is an acquisition phase and a problem definition. A well known way to acquire knowledge is the structured or unstructured [[interview]]. This technique and several other acquisition techniques can be used to define the needs of the customer, user and other stake holders.

=== Project processes ===
After an agreement is made, the planning of the project will begin and this results in a [[project plan]], which can be modified during the technical processes. In fact, the project processes are not sequential processes and go in parallel with the whole project, because at each moment a project needs planning, assessment and control. The design loop indicates that during the technical processes, after each step the project-management will assess whether changes have to be made in for example the schedule, which falls under project management. 
To ensure that a project will be successful the project management takes care that objectives are met within time, costs and a certain performance level, to help the project-management with this a [[work breakdown structure]] is made. [[Software configuration management|Configuration management]] records the changes that are made in the design or requirements. This enables stakeholders to comment on a certain change proposal. But very important for a project success is [[Risk management|risk control]]. Identifying risks and think about solutions in an early stage will save a lot of work and money in a later stage.

=== Technical processes ===
The technical processes cover the design, development and implementation phase of a system life cycle. In the earlier agreement phase top level (or customer) [[requirements]] have been established. This set of top level requirements are translated into software requirements which will define the functionalities of the software product. These software requirements can lead to a few alternate designs for the product. Each requirement is periodically examined for validity, consistency, desirability and attainability (see evaluation processes). With these examinations, or evaluations a decision can be made on the design. With the chosen design a [[requirements analysis]] will be performed and a functional design can be made. This functional design is a description of the product in the form of a model: the [[Functional Software Architecture|functional architecture]]. This model describes what the product does and of which items it consists of (allocation and synthesis). Thereafter, the product can actually be developed, integrated and implemented in the user environment.

=== Evaluation processes ===
Another loop in the model is the evaluation loop. During and after the creation of a software product the following questions have to be answered: Does the product do what it is intended to do? Are the requirements met? and as mentioned in the previous paragraph: Are the requirements valid and consistent? How is the [[requirements prioritization]]? This requires that the requirements are testable. For example a usability requirement, such as “the software product must be easy to use” can be tested through a [[heuristic evaluation]].
During the lifetime of a software product it will be continuously revised, updated and re-evaluated until the product is not used anymore and is disposed of.

== Example ==
To clarify the systems engineering process, figure 3 contains an example of such a process. It is a quite simple example and not every step of the process is mentioned. Furthermore, systems engineering might be more appropriate for a more complex system, but the example gives a slight idea of the practical use of systems engineering. 
The CEO of a software company encounters a problem: a (systems engineering) method has been made, but now he wants to share this method with his employees. To acquire all their needs, interviews with stake holders, including the CEO are performed. This results in a list with initial requirements. The feasibility study points out that there is no such system already available that would be appropriate and less expensive than creating a new framework to display the method. There are three possible solutions to the problem: A book that describes the method, a CD-ROM or some XML pages that can be used over an intranet. The Requirement that one has to be able to quickly search through the processes can be met by creating a CD-ROM or the XML pages. But during the project another requirement is added to the list: the content must be reusable. This rules out the CD-ROM, because with each update a new CD-ROM has to be given to the employees. This would also object the low-cost requirement. So, only the last alternative, the XML pages, is sufficient. Even when the requirements and solution are re-evaluated this alternative is the best design. Then, a functional architecture is made and the product is divided in sub functionalities. After creating the sub products, it is integrated and implemented in the organization. Because of all the evaluation and the involvement of the user the intranet is commonly used. The project is successful.

|rowspan=3| System control includes technical management activities required to measure progress, evaluate and select alternatives, and document data and decisions. Control activities include risk management, configuration management and data management. These are closed concepts, because they are processes on their own and not in the scope of the high level systems engineering process.

This is a closed concept and out of the scope of systems engineering. If adjustments to the product have been made, the product should be evaluated again.
|-
| ||Dispose of the product || When the product isn’t been used anymore the product is disposed.
This is a closed concept and out of the scope of systems engineering.

|- 
| Project Management/ Project Plan||Project management is the planning, organizing, directing and controlling of company resources to meet specific goals and objectives within time, within cost and at the desired performance level. This results in a project which is actually a collection of all documents created within the agreement processes and project processes and will change over time. ( ANSI/EIA 632; ISO/IEC 15288; SIMILAR; Bahill, & Dean, 2005)
|-

| Configuration Management||Configuration management ensures that any changes in requirements, design or implementation are controlled. ( ANSI/EIA 632;  Mil-Std-499B; ISO/IEC 15288; SIMILAR; Bahill, & Dean, 2005). Configuration management involves Configuration Identification, Control, Status Accounting, Audit and Planning.
|- 
| Requirement List||Customer needs/requirements are translated into a set of requirements that define what the system must do and how well it must perform.
Requirements analysis must clarify and define functional requirements and design constraints. (Mil-Std-499B; US department of defense, 2001)

| Requirement || A single requirement. It consists of a number, type, description and evaluation method that can be used to test the requirement.
|-
| Functional Architecture || Functions are analyzed by decomposing higher-level functions identified through requirements. (Mil-Std-499B; US department of defense, 2001) 
|-
| Software Product||Definition of Systems Engineering according to INCOSE: 
''“Systems Engineering is an engineering discipline whose responsibility is creating and executing an interdisciplinary process to ensure that the customer’s and stake-holder's needs are satisfied throughout a system's entire life cycle.”'' (INCOSE SE handbook; Vasquez, 2003)
The outcome of the Systems Engineering process is a SOFTWARE PRODUCT which satisfies the needs of the customer and stakeholders.
|- 
| Evaluation||Each requirement must be verified and validated to determine whether the software product fulfils the requirements and if the final as-built software product fulfills its specific intended use. ( ANSI/EIA 632;  Mil-Std-499B; ISO/IEC 15288)
