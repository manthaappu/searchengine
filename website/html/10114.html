<html> <head> <title>Deuterium arc lamp</title></head><body>A '''deuterium arc lamp''' (or simply '''deuterium lamp''') is a low-pressure [[gas-discharge light source]] often used in [[spectroscopy]] when a [[continuous spectrum]] in the [[ultraviolet]] region is needed.

==Principle of operation==
[[Image:Deuterium lamp 1.png|thumb|right|450px|Emission [[spectrum]] of an ultraviolet deuterium arc lamp showing characteristic hydrogen [[Balmer lines]] (sharp peaks at 486 nm and 656 nm labeled D<sub>β</sub> and D<sub>α</sub> from left to right respectively), continuum emission in the ~160-400 nm region and [[Fulcher band]] emission between around 560 to 640 nm.  The emission spectrum of deuterium differs slightly from that of [[hydrogen-1|protium]] due to the influence of [[hyperfine]] interactions, though these effects alter the wavelength of the lines by mere fractions of a [[nanometer]] and are too fine to be discerned by the [[spectrometer]] used here.]]
A deuterium lamp uses a [[tungsten]] [[electrical filament|filament]] and anode placed on opposite sides of a [[nickel]] box structure designed to produce the best output spectrum. Unlike an incandescent bulb, the filament is not the source of light in deuterium lamps. Instead an arc is created from the filament to the anode, a similar process to [[arc lamps]]. Because the filament must be very hot before it can operate, it is heated for approximately twenty seconds before use. Because the discharge process produces its own heat, the heater is turned down after discharge begins. Although firing voltages are 300 to 500 volts, once the arc is created voltages drop to around 100 to 200 volts.<ref>{{cite web

The arc created excites the molecular deuterium contained within the bulb to a higher energy state. The deuterium then emits light as it transitions back to its initial state.  This continuous cycle is the origin of the continuous ultraviolet radiation. This process is not the same as the process of decay of atomic [[energy level|excited states]] ([[atomic emission]]), where electrons are excited and then emit radiation. Instead from the [[molecular emission]] process, where radiative decay of excited [[quantum state|states]], in this case of molecular deuterium (D<sub>2</sub>), causes the effect.

Because the lamp operates at high temperatures,  normal glass housings cannot be used for a casing (which would also block UV radiation).  Instead, a [[fused quartz]], UV glass, or [[magnesium fluoride]] envelope is used depending on the specific function of the lamp.<ref>{{cite web

The typical lifetime of a deuterium lamp is approximately 2000 hours (Most manufacturers guarantee 2000 hours, but newer lamps are consistently performing well out to 5000 hours and more).

==Deuterium lamp spectra==
The deuterium lamp emits radiation extending from 112 nm to 900 nm, although its continuous spectrum is only from 180 nm to 370 nm. The spectrum intensity does not actually decrease from 250nm to 300nm as shown in the spectrum plot above. The decrease in the plot is due to decreased efficiency at low wavelengths of the photo detector used to measure the lamp intensity. Deuterium Lamp's continuous spectrum is useful as both a reference in UV radiometric work and to generate a signal in various photometric devices.

==Safety==
Due to the high intensity of UV radiation emitted by the bulb, eye protection is suggested when using a deuterium bulb.  Care must also be taken to avoid touching the bulb directly to avoid burns due to high [[operating temperature]]s.  Touching the bulb directly even when cool can smudge the casing and therefore reduce output intensity.
