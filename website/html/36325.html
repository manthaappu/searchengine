'''Symantec Endpoint Protection''', developed by [[Symantec Corporation]], is an [[antivirus]] and [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] product leveled at centrally managed corporate environments security for [[Server (computing)|servers]] and [[workstations]].

==Version history==
Endpoint 11 is the successor to '''Symantec AntiVirus Corporate Edition'''. Endpoint 11 adds handling of spyware and support for endpoint security health verification, among other features.  The last version of Symantec AntiVirus was version 10, and Endpoint Protection begins at version 11.

In April 2009, Symantec Endpoint Protection Small Business Edition was released, catering towards businesses smaller than the enterprise, but featuring the same underlying protection technologies.

==System  requirements==
Endpoint 11 supports [[Windows 7]], [[Windows Server 2008]], [[Windows Server 2003]], [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows XP]], and [[Windows 2000]]. Windows 7 is officially supported in the 11.0.5 release.  There is an antivirus [[client (computing)|client]] for various distributions of [[Linux]] as well. Endpoint Security 11 no longer supports [[Itanium]] processors. Client computers require at least 256 megabytes of [[RAM]] and 600 megabytes of hard disk. Management servers require at least 1 gigabyte of RAM and 2 gigabytes of hard disk space. Computers running Management console require 512 megabytes of RAM and 15 megabytes of hard disk space.<ref>http://www.symantec.com/business/products/sysreq.jsp?pcid=pcat_security&pvid=endpt_prot_1</ref><ref>http://www.symantec.com/business/products/sysreq.jsp?pcid=pcat_security&pvid=endpt_prot_sbe_1</ref> The console also installs an [[Apache Tomcat]] 4.x HTTPS service, listening on port 8443, requiring special consideration when simultaneously installed with products such as [[VMware]].

==Features==
;Firewall: Endpoint 11 incorporates a rules-based firewall, as well as an anti-malware technique that Symantec calls "generic exploit blocking".  The firewall is based on technology developed by [[Sygate Technologies]], who were purchased by Symantec. Generic exploit blocking is a technique that proactively blocks [[malware]] from exploiting unpatched [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]].<ref>http://www.symantecbigdraw.com/DocumentsSEP/12645930_SEP_migration%20guide.pdf</ref>

;Proactive protection: Endpoint 11 uses Symantec's TruScan technologies to facilitate detection of unknown malware. It analyzes both "safe" and "negative" behaviors of unknown applications.<ref>http://smallbiztechnology.com/archive/2007/12/how-symantec-is-changing-to-be.html</ref> It also integrates Symantec's Deepsight [[honeypot (computing)|honeypot]] sensors to warn of emerging threats and provide threat advisories.<ref>http://www.federalnewsradio.com/pdfs/EndpointSecurity-White%20Paper.pdf</ref> Proactive Threat Protection feature is currently unsupported on server operating systems.<ref>http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/ent-security.nsf/docid/2007091713544248</ref>

;Intrusion prevention: Endpoint 11 is able to create and enforce rules on client computers. For example, it can prevent clients from writing files to a [[USB flash drive]]. Intrusion prevention also work as IDS. Policies are enforced by TruScan.<ref>http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2234130,00.asp</ref>
