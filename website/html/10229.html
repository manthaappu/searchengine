'''Dictation''' is the transcription of spoken text: one person who is "dictating" speaks and another who is "taking dictation" writes down the words as they are spoken.

==La dictée==

For speakers of [[French language|French]], '''''la dictée''''' is a school exercise that aims at testing the mastery of [[orthography]] and [[grammar]]. Since many features of [[French grammar]] are distinguished in writing but not in speech, this can be a challenging task.

Certain ''dictées'' became famous for their difficulty or their interest, like those of [[Prosper Mérimée]] and [[Bernard Pivot]]. In several countries of the world (including [[Switzerland]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], and [[Canada]]), the dictations are the subject of structured championships, similar to English [[spelling bee]]s.

==Badasseugi==

In [[South Korea]], '''badasseugi''' ([[Hangul]]: 받아쓰기) is a school exercise for children in the lower grades of [[Primary education|elementary school]]s. The [[Korean language]] is written using [[Hangul]], which is basically a [[Phoneme|phonemic]] alphabet; however, Hangul writing is also [[morphophonemic]], so [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] knowledge (in addition to familiarity with Hangul) is necessary for correct dictation. Also, [[Phonology|phonological]] rules such as [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], [[palatalization]], and deletion can cause pronunciation to be different from what the written form may suggest. Badasseugi may take form of a word, a phrase, or a sentence, and is similar to spelling tests.
