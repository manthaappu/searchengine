<html> <head> <title>Spurious-free dynamic range</title></head><body>'''Spurious-Free Dynamic Range''' ('''SFDR''') is the strength ratio of the fundamental signal to the strongest spurious signal in the output. It
is also defined as a measure used to specify [[Analog-to-digital converter|analog-to-digital]] and [[digital-to-analog converter]]s (ADCs and DACs, respectively) and radio receivers.

SFDR is defined as the ratio of the [[Root Mean Square|RMS]] value of the [[Carrier wave|carrier]] frequency (maximum signal component) at the input of the ADC or DAC to the RMS value of the next largest [[Electronic noise|noise]] or [[harmonic distortion]] component (which is referred to as a “'''spurious'''” or a “'''spur'''”) at its output. SFDR is usually measured in [[dBc]] (i.e. with respect to the carrier frequency amplitude) or in [[dBFS]] (i.e. with respect to the ADC's [[Full scale|full-scale range]]). Depending on the test condition, SFDR is observed within a pre-defined frequency window or from [[Direct current|DC]] up to [[Nyquist frequency]] of the converter (ADC or DAC).

In case of a radio receiver application, the definition is slightly different. The reference is the [[minimum detectable signal]] level at the input of a receiver, which can be calculated through a knowledge of the [[noise figure]] and the input signal [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the receiver or the system.  The difference between this value and the input level which will produce distortion products equal to the minimum detectable signal referred to the input of the system is the SFDR of the system.
