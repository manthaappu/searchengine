where '''Y''' is a matrix with series of multivariate measurements, '''X''' is a matrix that might be a [[design matrix]], '''B''' is a matrix containing parameters that are usually to be estimated and '''U''' is a matrix containing [[errors and residuals in statistics|errors or noise]]. 
The errors are usually assumed to follow a [[multivariate normal distribution]].  If the errors do not follow a multivariate normal distribution, [[generalized linear models]] may be used to relax assumptions about '''Y''' and '''U'''.

The general linear model incorporates a number of different statistical models: [[ANOVA]], [[ANCOVA]], [[MANOVA]], [[MANCOVA]], ordinary [[linear regression]], [[t-test]] and [[F-test]]. If there is only one column in '''Y''' (i.e., one dependent variable) then the model can also be referred to as the [[multiple regression]] model (multiple linear regression).

Hypothesis tests with the general linear model can be made in two ways: [[multivariate]] or as several independent [[univariate]] tests.
In multivariate tests the columns of '''Y''' are tested together, whereas in univariate tests the columns of '''Y''' are tested independently, i.e., as multiple univariate tests with the same design matrix.

== Applications == 
An application of the general linear model appears in the analysis of multiple [[brain scan]]s in scientific experiments where '''Y''' contains data from brain scanners, '''X''' contains experimental design variables and confounds. It is usually tested in a univariate way (usually referred to a ''mass-univariate'' in this setting) and is often referred to as [[statistical parametric mapping]].<ref>{{Cite journal
