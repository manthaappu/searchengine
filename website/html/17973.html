<html> <head> <title>Imaging spectrometer</title></head><body>An '''imaging spectrometer''' is an instrument used in the field of [[imaging spectroscopy]] to acquire a spectrally-resolved image of an object or scene, often referred to as a [[datacube]] due to the three-dimensional representation of the data. Namely, two axes of the image corresponds to distance and the third to [[wavelength]]. The principle of operation is the same as that of the simple [[spectrometer]], but special care is taken to avoid [[optical aberration]]s for better image quality.

Example imaging spectrometer types include: filtered camera, whiskbroom scanner, pushbroom scanner, integral field spectrograph (or related dimensional reformatting techniques), wedge imaging spectrometer, Fourier transform imaging spectrometer, [[computed tomography imaging spectrometer]] (CTIS), image replicating imaging spectrometer (IRIS), coded aperture snapshot spectral imager (CASSI), and image mapping spectrometer (IMS).
