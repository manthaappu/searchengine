<html> <head> <title>Impact Nominal Index</title></head><body>The '''Impact Nominal Index''' or '''INI''' is a computer system that enables UK police forces to establish whether any other force holds information on a person of interest.  It was created by the IMPACT Programme led by the [[Home Office]] in 2006.
The system was built by the [[Web Technology Group]], a former subsidiary of [[Cable & Wireless]].

The INI is the first system to be delivered by the IMPACT Programme, set up to deliver improvements in the management and sharing of police operational information following Sir Michael Bichardâ€™s report on the [[Soham Murders]].
