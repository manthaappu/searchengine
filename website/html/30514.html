A '''public transport timetable''' is a listing of the times that [[public transport]] services arrive and depart specified locations. Timetables are published in various formats, and also various physical forms such as electronically, a physical book or leaflet, or a poster or dynamic display at the stop.

== General ==

In the [[United States of America|U.S.]], timetables for [[bus]] lines and some [[mass transit]] operations are called ''schedules'' instead.

In some large cities, such as [[London]] and [[New York]], some [[rapid transit]] and urban bus services that run to a timetable are so frequent that consulting the timetable is unnecessary. In some cases [[public transport]] operators do not even publish public timetables for the times of day that their services are very frequent, or they may simply state "services run every 3–5 minutes" (or words to that effect)

The first railway timetable compilation was published in [[1839]] by [[George Bradshaw]].

In many modern [[public transport]] systems, timetables and rostering are designed by computer, with the operators specifying operating span, minimum frequencies, route length/time and other such factors. Design of the schedule may also aim to keep times memorable for customers, through the use of [[clock-face scheduling]] &mdash; services departing at regular intervals, at the same times every hour.

=== Tables with services in columns ===

Many timetables comprise [[table (information)|table]]s with services shown in columns of a table, and stations or stops on the rows of the table.

There will generally be tables for each direction, and often separate (pairs of) tables for  weekdays, Saturdays and Sundays.

Generally the times for each station or stop will be the departure time, except for the last stop of the service which will be the arrival time.  At some stops if the service stops for some time, both arrival and departure times might be shown on consecutive rows.

As well as the times, the columns might include other information, often at the top of the columns, such as day(s) of operation, availability of on-board facilities such as refreshments, and a service number.

=== Tables with services in rows ===

Timetables with services arranged in rows of tables and stops or stations in columns are less common but otherwise similar to timetables with services in columns.

=== Times listed for a given stop ===
[[Image:FahrplanTiefenbrunnen.JPG|thumb|lright|Train departures list in the form of a yellow poster, common in Europe.]]
Some timetables, particularly posted on [[train station|railway stations]] and [[bus stop]]s, list times that services depart that location, sometimes along with other information such as destinations and stopping conditions.

As with other forms, there may be separate lists for different days of the week. There may be a separate list for each line/direction (this applies e.g. for train departures in the Netherlands), or a combined chronological list (as in the picture).

In [[mainland Europe]] train departures are listed on a yellow poster, and arrivals on a white poster. These posters are placed at entrances to stations and on platforms.

=== Dynamic displays ===
[[Image:BordUtrecht.jpg|thumb|lright|Dynamic display in the central hall at [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] central station, listing the departures for the next hour or so.]]
Dynamic displays in stations may be at a central place and list the next few departures for each line, or all departures for the next hour.  Displays on platforms just show the next departure (or perhaps the next few) from that platform.

=== Journey planners ===
Internet-based programs allow one to enter departure and destination locations, as well as date, and departure or arrival time.  These [[Intermodal Journey Planner|journey planners]] then give suitable departure times, with details for the whole journey.  These may comprise more than one service or mode. For an example, see below "Europe".

It is a widespread design pattern in the country.]]

The first regularly published timetable appeared in 1894, published by a private company. By the time of the nationalization of Japanese railways in 1906, three competing timetables were being published and it was decided that only one official timetable should be offered to the public. Five thousand copies of the first official timetable were published in January 1915.<ref>Aoki, E. et al ''A History of  Japanese Railways 1872-1999''. Tokyo: East Japan Railway Culture Foundation, 2000.</ref>

In 2010, two printed national timetables were available:  the Japan Tourist Bureau (JTB) Timetable  (JTB時刻表) and the Japan Railways (JR) Timetable (JR時刻表）. These thick books - the February 2009 edition of the JTB timetable, for example, contains 1152 pages -  are published every month and cover all stations and trains of [[Japan Railways Group|JR]] and private railways, as well as long distance bus, ferry and air services in Japan. For frequent JR urban lines, subway trains, private railways and urban buses, only summary timetables are shown. In 2009, a book was published to mark the 1000th edition of the JTB timetable, containing reproductions of  all one thousand covers, selected timetables and maps, and articles on the way the timetable is produced.<ref>時刻表1000号物語  ISBN 978-4533075254</ref>

There is also many searchable online timetables, covering all forms of transport in Japan, for example http://www.hyperdia.com/. Timetables for PDA's and PC's are also produced.

====Netherlands====
=====Train=====
The timetable book ''Spoorboekje'' is published yearly in December, and costs €5,50. It covers all operators of [[rail transport in the Netherlands]], except those of [[heritage railway]]s; it gives the departure times (and sometimes arrival times), but not the tracks. For international trains to and from the Netherlands, for the data for the parts abroad only a summary is given.

It provides ''tables with services in columns'' (see above), arranged by [[Train_routes_in_the_Netherlands#Train_routes_by_timetable_number|timetable number]] and direction (''a'' and ''b''). A [[Train routes in the Netherlands|train route]] can involve multiple timetable numbers; in addition to providing full information (all stations and all trains) for the railway stretch belonging to the timetable number, tables often provide selected information about the continuation of trains into stretches of other timetable numbers.

For train services which do not operate daily throughout the year there are indications for a few common restrictions such as "weekdays only" and "not on Sundays", and footnotes for other limitations.

=====Bus=====
Timetable booklets are published yearly. They come with a separate map, and cost money. Each covers one region of one bus company. They are arranged similarly to the ''spoorboekje'', except that for each line and direction there are three separate tables: for Monday-Friday, for Saturday, and for Sunday. Also, they show the times for selected stops only. 

In addition or instead, leaflets or smaller booklets with the timetable of a single line or a few lines are available free of charge.

===Recent trends===
Due to the development of the internet and electronic memory systems, conventional thick paper timetables are gradually being replaced by website searching or CD-ROM style timetables and the publishing of comprehensive printed timetables is generally decreasing. France's [[SNCF]], for example, publishes timetables only for the [[RER]] and [[Transilien]] [[commuter rail]] services that operate in the outskirts of [[Paris]]; the rest of the timetables must be accessed indirectly by means of a search engine.

== Formats ==

Timetables are published as books, booklets, folded or plain cards or [[paper]], [[poster]]s, on-line in [[HTML]], [[Portable Document Format|pdf]], and other formats, printed, hand-written on posters or [[chalkboard|blackboard]]s, back-lit displays, and [[Short Message Service|SMS]] messages.<ref>For an example of an SMS timetable, see [http://www.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/using_public_transport/sms_services Connex Melbourne's SMS timetable service]</ref>

[[Thomas Cook Group|Thomas Cook Publishing]] has published timetable books showing the schedules of major European railway services since 1873 (appearing monthly since 1883) and also produces a similar bi-monthly volume covering [[public transport]] services in the rest of the world.<ref>According to the [http://www.thomascookpublishing.com/series.htm?series=Timetables Thomas Cook web-site] (retrieved 6 March 2007)</ref>

== On-time performance==
On-time performance is the proportion of the time that a transit system adheres to its published schedule times within state tolerances.
