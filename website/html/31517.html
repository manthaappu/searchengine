'''Recreational mathematics''' is an umbrella term, referring to [[mathematical puzzle]]s and [[mathematical games]].

Not all problems in this field require a knowledge of advanced mathematics, and thus, recreational mathematics often attracts the curiosity of non-mathematicians, and inspires their further study of mathematics.

== Topics ==
This genre of mathematics includes [[logic puzzle]]s and other puzzles that require [[deductive]] reasoning, the [[aesthetics]] of mathematics, and peculiar or amusing stories and [[mathematical coincidence|coincidences about mathematics]] and mathematicians. Some of the more well-known topics in recreational mathematics are [[magic squares]] and [[fractals]].

=== Mathematical games ===
[[Mathematical games]] are [[multiplayer game]]s whose rules, strategies, and outcomes can be studied and explained by [[mathematics]]. The players of the game may not need to use mathematics in order to play mathematical games. For example, [[Mancala]] is a mathematical game, because mathematicians can study it using [[combinatorial game theory]], even though no mathematics is necessary in order to play it.

=== Mathematical puzzles ===
[[Mathematical puzzles]] require mathematics in order to solve them. They have specific rules, as do [[multiplayer games]], but mathematical puzzles don't usually involve competition between two or more players. Instead, in order to solve such a [[puzzle]], the solver must find a solution that satisfies the given conditions.

[[Logic puzzle]]s are a common type of mathematical puzzle. [[Conway's Game of Life]] and [[fractals]] are also considered mathematical puzzles, even though the solver only interacts with them by providing a set of initial conditions.

Sometimes, [[mathematical puzzles]] are referred to as mathematical games as well.

=== Others ===
Other curiosities and pastimes of non-trivial mathematical interest:
* [[Juggling]] (juggling patterns)
* [[Origami]] (many mathematical results, some deep)
* [[Cat's cradle]] and other [[string figure]]s

== Publications ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Mathematical game]] -->
* The ''[[Journal of Recreational Mathematics]]'' is the largest publication on this topic.
* ''Mathematical Games'' was the title of a long-running column on the subject by [[Martin Gardner]], in [[Scientific American]].  He inspired several new generations of mathematicians and scientists, through his interest in mathematical recreations. ''Mathematical Games'' was succeeded by ''[[Metamagical Themas]]'', a similarly distinguished, but shorter-running, column by [[Douglas Hofstadter]], then by ''Mathematical Recreations'', a column by [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]], and most recently ''Puzzling Adventures'' by Dennis Shasha.

;In popular culture
* In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[42 (Doctor Who)|42]]", [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] completes a sequence of [[happy number|happy primes]], then complains that schools no longer teach recreational mathematics.
* ''[[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime]]'', a book about a young boy with [[Asperger syndrome]], discusses many mathematical games and puzzles.

*[[Lewis Carroll]], author, mathematician and puzzlist
*[[John Horton Conway]], mathematician and inventor of [[Conway's Game of life]]
*[[Henry Dudeney]], regarded as England's greatest puzzlist

*[[Sam Loyd]], regarded as America's greatest puzzlist
*[[Clifford A. Pickover]], author of numerous books on recreational mathematics
*[[Marilyn vos Savant]], author of "Ask Marilyn", a long running column in ''[[Parade (magazine)|PARADE]]''
*[[Malba Tahan]], pseudonym of [[Júlio César de Mello e Souza]], author of several books figuring recreational mathematics, including ''[[The Man Who Counted]]''
*[[Yakov Perelman]], Russian author of many popular science books, including ''Mathematics Can Be Fun''
