The '''Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education''' is a framework for classifying, or grouping, colleges and universities in the United States. The primary purpose of the framework is for educational research and analysis, where it is often important to identify groups of roughly comparable institutions.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education | publisher = Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching | date=  no date | url = http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/ | accessdate = 3 January 2010 }}</ref> The classification includes all [[School accreditation|accredited]], [[academic degree|degree]]-granting colleges and universities in the United States that are represented in the [[National Center for Education Statistics]] [[Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System]] (IPEDS).

The Carnegie Classification was created by the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] (hereafter referred to as "The Carnegie Foundation") in 1973; reports were issued in that year, 1976, 1987, 1994, and 2000.  The latest report, issued in 2005, has substantially reworked the classification system. It is based on data from the 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 school years.<ref> {{cite web | title = Basic Classification Technical Details | publisher = Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching | date=  2005 | url = http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=805 | accessdate = 24 September 2008 }}

===Special Focus Institutions===
Special Focus Institutions were classified "based on the concentration of degrees in a single field or set of related fields, at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Institutions were determined to have a special focus with concentrations of at least 80 percent of undergraduate and graduate degrees. In some cases this percentage criterion was relaxed if an institution identified a special focus on the College Board’s Annual Survey of Colleges, or if an institution’s only accreditation was from a body related to the special focus categories." <ref name=BasicTechnical />

[http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=796 Technical Details > Undergraduate Profile].</ref>

===Enrollment status===
Enrollment status is classified according the ratio of part-time to full-time students (degree seeking students in the case of 4-year institutions).<ref name=UPFlowchart>The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/dynamic/downloads/file_1_338.pdf Undergraduate Profile] classification flow chart.</ref>
*PT2: Higher part-time two-year: More than 60 percent of students at this 2-year institution are part-time.

*Lower transfer-in (LTI): Less than 20 percent of students transfer into the institution.
*Higher transfer-in (HTI): More than 19 percent of students transfer into the institution.

==Size and setting==
The Size and Setting classification classifies institutions according to (a) the size of their student body and (b) the percentage of student who reside on campus. Exclusively graduate and professional institutions and special-focus institutions are not classified by their size and setting.<ref name=SSTechnical>The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=797 Technical Details > Size & Setting].</ref>

===Size===
The size of institutions is based on their Full-time Equivalent (FTE) enrollment. FTEs are calculated by adding the number of full-time students to one-third the number of part-time students.  2-year colleges are classified using a different scale than 4-year and higher colleges.<ref name=SSTechnical />

*Very small two-year (VS2): Fewer than 500 FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*Small two-year (S2): At least 500 but fewer than 2000 FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*Medium two-year (M2): At least 2000 but fewer than 5000 FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*Large two-year (L2): At least 5000 but fewer than 10000 FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*Very large two-year (VL2): 10000 or more FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*Very small four-year (VS4): Fewer than 1000 FTEs attend this four-year institution.
*Small four-year (S4): At least 1000 but fewer than 3000 FTEs attend this four-year institution.

The setting of institutions is based on the percentage of full-time undergraduates who live in institutionally-managed housing.<ref name=SSTechnical /> Two-year institutions are not classified by their setting. <ref name=SSFlowchart>The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/dynamic/downloads/file_1_373.pdf Size and Setting] classification flow chart.</ref>
*Primarily nonresidential (NR): "[F]ewer than 25 percent of degree-seeking undergraduates living on campus or fewer than 50 percent enrolled full-time were classified as primarily nonresidential."<ref name=SSTechnical />
*Primarily residential (R): (a) At least 25 percent of degree-seeking undergraduates live on campus and (b) at least 50 percent but less than 80 percent attend full-time are classified as primarily residential.
*Highly residential (HR): "[A]t least half of degree-seeking undergraduates live on campus and where at least 80 percent attend full-time were classified as highly residential."<ref name=SSTechnical />

==2005 edition==
In contrast to previous classifications, the 2005 classification scheme is a "set of multiple, parallel classifications." <ref name=MainWebsite>The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005).  [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/ The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education website].</ref>  According to Alexander C. McCormick, Senior Scholar at The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and director of the classifications project, "The five new classifications are organized around three central questions: 1) What is taught, 2) to whom, and 3) in what setting?"<ref name=McCormickPerspective>McCormick, Alexander C. (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/perspectives/sub.asp?key=245&subkey=882 A New Set of Lenses for Looking at Colleges and Universities], [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/perspectives/index.asp?key=532 Carnegie Perspectives], November 2005.</ref> In addition to the new classification categories, the previously used classification scheme ("Basic classification") has been revised.

The Carnegie Foundation is also developing one or more voluntary classification schemes that will rely on data submitted by institutions. <ref name=MainWebsite /> The first will focus on outreach and community engagement and the second on "how institutions seek to analyze, understand, and improve undergraduate education."<ref name=McCormickPerspective />

The Carnegie Foundation has no plans to issue printed editions of the classifications.  Their [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/ website] has several tools allowing researchers and administrators to view classifications.<ref name=PrintFAQ>The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/about/sub.asp?key=18&subkey=405#13 Carnegie Classification FAQs: Will the classifications be available in print?].</ref>

===Revisions in the basic classification===
The "basic classification" is an update of the original classification scheme.  In addition to changing the names of some categories, the 2005 revision differs from previous editions in that it:<ref name=BasicTechnical />

# Splits Associates colleges into subcategories.  This is based on the work of Stephen Katsinas, Vincent Lacey, and David Hardy at the [[University of Alabama]] and is an update of work funded in the 1990s by the [[Ford Foundation]].
# Categorizes doctorate-granting institutions according to their level of research activity.  This level is calculated using multiple measures, financial and otherwise.
# Simplifies the measurement of doctorate degrees awarded.
# Divides Master’s colleges and universities into three categories based on the number of [[Master's degrees]] awarded.
# Deprecates "[[Liberal Arts]]" terminology.
# Modified the criteria separating Master's and Baccalaureate institutions.  Institutions formerly classified as Master’s Colleges and Universities are now classified as Baccalaureate Colleges.
# Requires institutions to have higher levels of single-field or related-field concentration for designation as special-focus institutions and utilizes more sources of information to identify special-focus institutions.
# Splits the "Schools of engineering and technology" category into two categories and eliminates the "Teacher’s colleges" category.
# Measures and classifies service academies using to the same criteria as other institutions.

==Previous editions==

Prior to the 2000 edition, the Carnegie Foundation categorized doctorate-granting institutions according to the amount of [[Federal Government of the United States|Federal]] funding they received.  The 2005 edition categorizes doctoral-institutions according to their research support but uses a more complex formula than used in previous editions.  Despite the fact that it is no longer used by the Carnegie Foundation, the descriptor ''[[Research I university|Research I]]'' is still commonly used in reference to universities with the largest research budgets, often by the institutions themselves in their promotional materials.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}
