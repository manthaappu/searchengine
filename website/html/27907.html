'''OverDrive Media Console''' is a bare-bones proprietary media player software developed by [[OverDrive, Inc.]] for use with its download services for library, schools, and retailers.  The [[Windows Media Player]]-based software allows users to download, organize, and listen to [[audiobooks]], music, and video either borrowed from an OverDrive subscribing [[Digital_Library_Reserve|library]] or purchased from an OverDrive subscribing online retailer.   The software supports only a few formats: MP3, and [[Windows Media DRM]] protected [[Windows Media Audio|audio]] & [[Windows Media Video|video]]. <ref group="footnote">For [[eBook]]s, OverDrive Inc, utilizes [[Adobe Digital Editions]] ([[EPUB]] & [[PDF]]), [[Mobipocket]] and [[Microsoft Reader]].</ref>

On November 19, 2008, OverDrive released OverDrive Media Console for [[Mac OS X|Mac]], which allows Mac owners to download and listen to MP3 audiobooks from a public library.<ref>{{cite web
