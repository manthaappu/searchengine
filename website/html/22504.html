<html> <head> <title>Locks with ordered sharing</title></head><body>In [[databases]] and [[transaction processing]] the term '''Locks with ordered sharing''' comprises several variants of the ''[[Two phase locking]]'' (2PL) [[concurrency control]] protocol generated by changing the blocking semantics of locks upon [[Serializability#View and conflict serializability|conflicts]]. One variant is identical to [[Commitment ordering#Strict CO (SCO)|Strict commitment ordering (SCO)]].
