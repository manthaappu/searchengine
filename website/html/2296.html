'''''Arcade''''' is the title of a [[B-movie|B-]][[science fiction]]/horror film released in [[1993 in film|1993]]. Produced by [[Full Moon Features|Full Moon Entertainment]], the film features a heavy use of [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]], which was fully redone after the film was completed due to producer [[Charles Band]] and director [[Albert Pyun]] not being satisfied with the end result. The VideoZone video magazine (a staple of Full Moon films during the 1990s) as well as some trailers showed footage from the original version of the film. As a rarity, the VideoZone featured on the Full Moon Classics DVD release of the film contains no footage of the released film's CGI, but only of the original, unreleased film's version.

==Plot==
Alex Manning (Megan Ward) is a troubled suburban teenager. Her mother committed suicide and the school counselor feels that she has not dealt with her feelings properly.  Manning and her friends decide to visit the local [[video arcade]] known as "Dante's Inferno" where a new [[virtual reality]] arcade game called "Arcade" is being test marketed by a computer company CEO who is more than willing to hand out free samples of the home console version and hype up the game as if his job is depending on it, and it is.   

However, it soon becomes clear that the teenagers who play the game and lose are being imprisoned inside the virtual reality world by the central villain: "Arcade". It would seem that "Arcade" was once a little boy who was beaten to death by his mother, and the computer company felt it would be a good idea to use some of the boy's brain cells in order to make the game's villain more realistic. Instead, it made the game deadly.   

Nick and Alex enlist the help of the game's programmer and head to the video arcade for a final showdown with "Arcade" and his deadly virtual world. While Alex is able to release her friends from a virtual prison, she also ended up freeing the evil little boy, who taunts Alex in the final moments of the film.
