'''Copperplate''', or '''English round hand''', is a style of [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] writing, using a sharp pointed [[pen nib|nib]] instead of the flat nib used in most calligraphic writing.  Its name comes from the fact that the copybooks from which students learned it were printed from etched copper plates.<ref>[http://www.yourdictionary.com/copperplate copperplates] (definition 4)</ref> Copperplate script was prevalent in the 19th century, but was used as early as in the 16th century in Europe. As a result, the term "copperplate" is mostly used to refer to any old-fashioned, tidy handwriting.

This style of calligraphy is different from that produced by angled nibs in that the thickness of the stroke is determined by the pressure applied when writing, instead of nib angle in relation to the writing surface. All copperplate forms (minuscules, majuscules, numbers, and punctuation) are written at a letter slant of 55 degrees from the horizontal.<ref>Winters, Eleanor: Mastering Copperplate â€“ A Step-by-Step Manual for Calligraphers.

In Australia in the 1980s, the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] prescribed a new form of handwriting which lacked the loops and curious capital letter forms that appear in standard [[cursive]] to be taught to children in government schools. This "copperplate" is sometimes understood to mean the old-fashioned cursive.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Americans are familiar with Copperplate chiefly because it is the style in which the body of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] is printed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-formation-of-character|title=The Formation of Character|author=David Skinner|work=[[The New Atlantis]]|accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref>
