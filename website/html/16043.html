<html> <head> <title>HOLAP</title></head><body>HOLAP ('''H'''ybrid '''O'''n'''l'''ine '''A'''nalytical '''P'''rocessing) is a combination of [[ROLAP]] (Relational OLAP) and [[MOLAP]] (Multidimensional OLAP) which are other possible implementations of [[OLAP]]. HOLAP allows storing part of the data in a [[MOLAP]] store and another part of the data in a [[ROLAP]] store, allowing a tradeoff of the advantages of each. The degree of control that the cube designer has over this partitioning varies from product to product.

== Vertical partitioning ==

In this mode HOLAP stores ''aggregations'' in [[MOLAP]] for fast query performance, and detailed data in [[ROLAP]] to optimize time of cube ''processing''.

== Horizontal partitioning ==

In this mode HOLAP stores some slice of data, usually the more recent one (i.e. sliced by Time dimension) in [[MOLAP]] for fast query performance, and older data in [[ROLAP]]. Moreover, we can store some dices in [[MOLAP]] and others in [[ROLAP]], leveraging the fact that in a large cuboid, there will be dense and sparse subregions.<ref>Owen Kaser and Daniel Lemire, [http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.DB/0702143 Attribute Value Reordering for Efficient Hybrid OLAP], Information Sciences, Volume 176, Issue 16, pages 2279-2438, 2006.</ref>

== Products ==
Examples of commercial products which support HOLAP storage mode are [[Microsoft Analysis Services]], [[Oracle OLAP|Oracle Database OLAP Option]], [[MicroStrategy]] and [[SAP AG]] BI Accelerator.The hybrid OLAP approach combines ROLAP and MOLAP technology,
benefiting from the greater scalability of ROLAP and the faster computation of MOLAP. For example, a
HOLAP server may allow large volumes of detail data to be stored in a relational database, while aggregations
are kept in a separate MOLAP store. The Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 OLAP Services supports a hybrid OLAP
server
