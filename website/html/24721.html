<blockquote>
Let us do justice to that intrepid spirit, whose leaps have
sometimes led to truth and whose very excesses, like popular
rebellions, have struck salutary fears in the heart of the despot.
Let our thoughts be filled with all that we owe to the geometric
spirit; but let us search for the spirit of philosophy, which is at
once wiser than the one and more universal than the other.

The English historian [[Edward Gibbon]] (1737–1794) is known primarily as the author of the magisterial ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (6 vols., 1776–1789).  Both the imposing length of and awesome erudition displayed in that work have understandably overshadowed his other literary achievements, many of which deserve to be noted in their own valuable capacities.

==Description==
Shortly following Gibbon's death, his good friend and literary executor, [[John Holroyd, 1st Earl of Sheffield|John Lord Sheffield]] undertook to edit and in 1796 published the first (of three) edition(s) of the '''''Miscellaneous Works of Edward Gibbon''''' (''MW'')<ref>the full title of 1796 (and in square brackets, that of 1814) is, ''[The] Miscellaneous Works of Edward Gibbon, Esquire; [Esq.] with Memoirs of his Life and Writings, composed by himself.[:] Illustrated from his Letters, with occasional notes and narrative, by [the Right Honourable] John, Lord Sheffield. in Two Volumes [a New Edition, with Considerable Additions in Five Volumes]''.</ref> in order that the reading public have an opportunity to gain a broader insight into the historian and his overall body of work.  Various elements of the ''MW'', as well as other Gibbon writings not contained therein, are listed below along with their pertinent bibliographical detail and descriptive text where available. Notes and letters from Sheffield were also included in the ''MW'', but only Gibbon's writings follow here.  Listed contents are exactly those from each volume's table as they appear in the ''Google''[тм] ''Books'' [http://books.google.com online] digitized copies.  Links to those copies are provided below. Where publisher and year follows a work the reference is to the year of its first publication apart from the ''MW''. A year following alone (with or without a scholar's name) refers to the year of Gibbon's composition.<ref>sources for this data are Sheffield's tables of contents; Norton, ''Biblio''; Craddock, ''EEEG''; and Ghosh, "Gibbon's Dark Ages."</ref> An asterisk [*] denotes that the work can be found in Craddock, ''EEEG''. ('''[[#References|see References]]''', -ed.)

==''The Miscellaneous Works''==
* '''FIRST edition''': 2 vols. quarto (London: A. Strahan, T. Cadell, Jr. & W. Davies, March 31, 1796<ref>precise days of publication in all cases from Norton, ''Biblio''.</ref>).
** '''Volume I''':
*** ''Memoirs of my Life and Writings''. independently, and likely pirated<ref>Norton, ''Biblio'', p. 197.</ref> as, ''Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Edward Gibbon, Esq.'', 2 vols. duodecimo (London: Hunt & Clarke, 1827).<br> [http://books.google.com/books?vid=0aVInUFhbCZWc1520bmseOF&id=VWcNAAAAIAAJ&pg=PR9&lpg=PR9&dq=%22edward+gibbon%22#PPR3,M1 online: 1898 edition, O.F. Emerson, ed.] incomplete portions of six "drafts" lettered A-F. Sheffield aggressively edited both the ''Memoirs'' and the ''MW'' in order to reflect Gibbon's anti-French Revolutionary sentiment while also downplaying his connection with [[Edmund Burke]]'s eschatological interpretation; to prevent any further enlargement of Gibbon's reputation for harboring "irreligion" or atheism; and for other purposes of a more personal nature.<ref>Womersley, ''Watchmen'', at 235-236, 240, and 346-349.</ref> In 1966, Georges Bonnard published a composite collection chronologically arranged, "built on the same general lines" as Sheffield's, along with a thoroughly informative account of the historical background.<ref>Bonnard, ''Memoirs'', "Preface," vii-xxxiii, at xxxi. The manuscript originals are all contained, with one small exception, in the British Museum, Gibbon Papers, ''Add. MSS 34874'' (p. xiii). As to why Gibbon exercised six attempts to recount his life on paper, Bonnard opines that he was repeatedly dissatisfied with subject order and length.  But from draft to draft, where Gibbon met with self-approval, he "very often contented himself with simply copying what he had already written." (p. xxiv.)</ref> The drafts were not printed in their unedited entireties until 1896.<ref>Murray, ''Autobiographies''.</ref>
***Letters from Gibbon to Sheffield et al.;
***Letters to and from Edward Gibbon.  Letter No. IX is Gibbon's "Lettre sur le gouvernement de Berne."  see '''SECOND edition''', Vol. II below.

Gibbon's first published work, an invaluable introduction to the ''Decline and Fall'', defends the ''érudits'' (antiquarian scholars) against French ''philosophes'' (especially [[Jean le Rond D'Alembert|D'Alembert]] in his ''Discours préliminaire à l'Encyclopédie'' [1751]) who had "contemptuously" assailed the ''érudits''<nowiki>'</nowiki> work as inferior, parochial, and effete. Gibbon recoiled at the charges, and strove to reconcile the two groups by "proving...that all the faculties of the mind may be exercised and displayed by [the] study of ancient litterature [sic]." The ''Essai'' was reviewed with "cold indifference" in England,<ref>Gibbon, ''Memoirs'', ¶"The design of my first work;"  ¶"Two years elapsed in silence."</ref> but on the continent, it was met enthusiastically. In Paris, Gibbon was recognized as a man of letters. Sheffield opted not to provide an English translation because the Becket & De Hondt (1764) already existed.<ref>Womersley, ''ODNB'', p. 11; Norton, ''Biblio'', p. 3. additional background in: Peter Ghosh, "Gibbon's First Thoughts: Rome, Christianity and the ''Essai sur l'Étude de la Littérature'' 1758–61," ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 85(1995), 148–164; Pocock, ''EEG'', chapter 9, "The <nowiki>'</nowiki>''Essai sur l'Étude de la Littérature''<nowiki>'</nowiki>: imagination, irony and history," 208-239; Brian Norman, chapter 4 in "The Influence of Switzerland on the Life and Writings of Edward Gibbon," ''Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century'' [SVEC] v.2002:03, (Oxford: Voltaire Foundation, 2002), 44-61.</ref>

*** ''An Address, &c. [recommending Mr. John Pinkerton [to publish] the 'Scriptores Rerum Anglicarum', our Latin Memorials of the Middle Ages''] (1793)* as ''An Address &c.'' a well-conceived, persuasive plan to publish what Gibbon saw as a glaring deficiency in the English archives, i.e., the collected works of all English historians from 500 to 1500 A.D., including "the most ancient of our national writers" through the onset of [[David Hume]]'s "true and perfect Æra of modern history." The deficiency grew all the more conspicuous when contrasted with similar projects already successfully carried out in Germany, Italy, France, and Denmark. The brief work strongly recommends Scot historian and poet [[John Pinkerton]] to head the project; an editor, Gibbon writes, "replete with a variety of knowledge," and "well qualified for this study, by a spirit of Criticism, acute discerning and suspicious."<ref>Craddock, ''EEEG'', 534-545, at pp. 545, 538-40, 542, 544-45, 600. see also Norton, ''Biblio'', 179-81. At this juncture, Pinkerton's reputation had been decidedly mixed: part serious antiquarian enjoying the patronage of [[Horace Walpole]], part near buffoon whose work could evoke "hilarity" and "ridicule."  Gibbon eventually chose to prefer the former, believing that "the volatile and fiery particles of his nature have been discharged [leaving] a pure and solid substance endowed with many active and useful energies." Craddock, ''EEEG'', p. 542; Trevor-Roper, "Gibbon's Last Project," pp. 407, 414.</ref> For his part, Gibbon was prepared to contribute a general introduction and author-specific prefaces.

The first edition was "pirated" and reprinted twice in 1796, in Ireland and Switzerland:<ref>Norton, ''Biblio'', p. 197; 203-204.</ref>

*** Letters to and from Edward Gibbon, Esq.
*** ''Lettre sur le gouvernement de Berne'' (Norman: 1758-59; Pocock: 1764) ["Letter No. IX. Mr. Gibbon to *** on the Government of Berne."  also appears with English translation in '''FIRST edition''', Vol. 1, pp. 388–413]. a fictional letter from a Swedish diarist to a Swiss friend comparing the governments of Bern and early Rome. Employing language undeniably influenced by Montesquieu, Gibbon observes that Bern in adopting an oligarchic form similar to the Venetian, has omitted any incorporation of the separation of powers, in doing so has ignored the "principles of liberty," and therefore stands on the brink of despotism. Pocock identifies the ''Lettre'' as Gibbon's "first essay on empire in the context of European history." By this time, Gibbon has clearly adopted erudition as "the dominant interest of his young and his mature life."<ref>Pocock, ''EEG'', pp. 89-91, 93. Additional background from Brian Norman, chapter 2 in "The Influence of Switzerland on the Life and Writings of Edward Gibbon," ''Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century'' [SVEC] v.2002:03, (Oxford: Voltaire Foundation, 2002), 21-32. Norman claims "certainty" of his dating of the work based on a close analysis of Gibbon's scriptional accentuation (pp. 30-31).</ref> Sheffield's preface intones, "The excellence of this curious paper will apologize for its great length." (31 octavo pages including translation).
