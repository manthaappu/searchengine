A '''Logical Schema''' is a [[data model]] of a specific problem domain expressed in terms of a particular data management technology.  Without being specific to a particular database management product, it is in terms of either relational tables and columns, object-oriented classes, or XML tags.  This is as opposed to a [[conceptual data model]], which describes the semantics of an organization without reference to technology, or a [[physical data model]], which describe the particular physical mechanisms used to capture data in a storage medium.

The next step in creating a [[database]], after the logical schema is produced, is to create the [[physical schema]].
