In [[statistics]], a '''standard score''' indicates how many [[standard deviation]]s an observation or [[data|datum]] is above or below the mean. It is a [[dimensionless number|dimensionless quantity]] derived by subtracting the [[population mean]] from an individual [[raw score]] and then dividing the difference by the [[statistical population|population]] [[standard deviation]]. This conversion process is called '''standardizing''' or '''normalizing'''; however, "normalizing" can refer to many types of ratios; see [[normalization (statistics)]] for more.

The standard deviation is the unit of measurement of the z-score. It allows comparison of observations from different normal distributions, which is done frequently in research.

Standard scores are also called '''z-values, ''z''-scores, normal scores,''' and '''standardized variables;''' the use of "Z" is because the normal distribution is also known as the "Z distribution". They are most frequently used to compare a sample to a [[standard normal deviate]] (standard normal distribution, with ''μ'' = 0 and ''σ'' = 1), though they can be defined without assumptions of normality.

The z-score is ''only'' defined if one knows the population parameters, as in [[standardized testing]]; if one only has a sample set, then the analogous computation with sample mean and sample standard deviation yields the [[Student's t-statistic]].

The standard score is not the same as the [[z-factor]] used in the analysis of [[high-throughput screening]] data, but is sometimes confused with it.

== Formula ==

The standard score is

:<math>z = {x- \mu \over \sigma}</math>

where: 

: ''x'' is a raw score to be standardized;
: ''μ'' is the [[mean]] of the population;
: ''σ'' is the [[standard deviation]] of the population.

The quantity ''z'' represents the distance between the raw score and the population mean in units of the standard deviation. ''z'' is negative when the raw score is below the mean, positive when above.

A key point is that calculating ''z'' requires the population mean and the population standard deviation, not the sample mean or sample deviation. It requires knowing the population parameters, not the statistics of a sample drawn from the population of interest. But knowing the true standard deviation of a population is often unrealistic except in cases such as [[standardized testing]], where the entire population is measured. In cases where it is impossible to measure every member of a population, the standard deviation may be estimated using a random sample.  For example, a population of people who smoke [[cigarette]]s is not fully measured.

When a population is [[normal distribution|normally distributed]], the [[percentile rank]] may be determined from the standard score and statistical tables.

== Applications ==

The z-score is most often used in the [[z-test]] in [[standardized testing]] – the analog of the [[Student's t-test]] for a population whose parameters are known, rather than estimated. As it is very unusual to know the entire population, the t-test is much more widely used.

Darby and Reissland (1981) make use of z-scores as a way of understanding the contributions from various subsets of data to an overall test of trend. The overall analysis was of trends in the rate of occurrence of cancer and the subsets considered approximately 55 different types of cancer, together with various groupings of these types. In this instance, the use of z-scores is not immediately as a test statistic for a significance test, but rather as a numerical guide to finding subsets of data which might show different trends than others.

==Standardizing in mathematical statistics==
{{further|[[Normalization (statistics)]]}}
In [[mathematical statistics]], a [[random variable]] ''X'' is '''standardized''' using the theoretical (population) mean and standard deviation:

:<math>Z = {X - \mu \over \sigma}</math>

where <math>\mu = \operatorname{E}[X]</math> is the [[mean]] and <math>\sigma = \sqrt{\operatorname{Var}(X)}</math> the [[standard deviation]] of the [[probability distribution]] of ''X''.

If the random variable under consideration is the [[sample mean]]:

:<math>\bar{X}={1 \over n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i</math>

then the standardized version is 

:<math>Z = \frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}.</math>

See [[normalization (statistics)]] for other forms of normalization.

A common name for standard score is the z-score. It is often used in statistics.
