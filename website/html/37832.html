'''Titan''' was the name given to the prototype [[Atlas 2]] computer developed by [[Ferranti]] and the [[University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory]] in [[Cambridge]], [[England]]. It was in operation from 1964 to 1973.<ref>http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Relics/virtex.html</ref> 

Titan was the computer on which [[Peter Swinnerton-Dyer]] developed the early multi-user [[time-sharing]] [[operating system]] called [[Temporary Supervisor]].  This was arguably the world's first [[time-sharing]] operating system<ref>http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Relics/virtex.html</ref>, although that title may be disputed.

Titan differed from the Manchester [[Atlas Computer (Manchester)|Atlas]] by having a real, but cached, [[main memory]], rather than the [[virtual memory|paged (or virtual) memory]] used in the Manchester machine. The Titan's main memory had 128K of 48-bit words and was implemented using ferrite [[core store]] rather than the part core, part rotating  [[Drum memory|drum-store]] used on the Manchester Atlas. It also had two large hard-disk drives and several magnetic tape decks. As with the Manchester Atlas, it used discrete components, in particular [[germanium]] [[transistor]]s.  Some of these components can be seen in the online relics collection of the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory.<ref>http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/relicd?name=&machine=Titan&class=any&uid=</ref>

As a prototype it had a reputation for technical excellence; but it was also often highly unreliable, and indeed some wiring anomalies were still being discovered several years after it was first commissioned. 

One of Titan's most intensive uses was to compute the inverse [[Fourier Transform]]s of data from the [[One-Mile Telescope|One-Mile Radio Telescope]].

A second Atlas 2 was built, also in Cambridge, and was installed at the Computer-Aided Design Centre ([[AVEVA|CADCentre]]) on [[Madingley Road]]. This machine, the last Atlas, was finally switched off on 21 December 1976.
