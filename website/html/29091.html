'''Philosophy-Neurology-Psychology (PNP)''' is an interdisciplinary program at [[Washington University]] which allows students to examine the mind and cognition from multiple perspectives.  This program is available to both undergraduates  (as a [[minor]], [[Academic major|major]] or second major) as well as graduate students (as a [[PhD]] track within [[philosophy]]).

==Undergraduate Program==
Within the PNP program undergraduates students are able to choose between Cognitive Neuroscience (CN) track, examining "the study of higher brain functioning with behavioral research directed at understanding activities such as perceiving, attending, remembering, and acting" or the Language, Cognition and Culture (LCC) track, looking at "the importance of language in human cognition, and the integration of cognition with one's cultural environment" <ref name="PNP Undergraduate Program">[http://pnp.artsci.wustl.edu/undergraduate], PNP Undergraduate Program Details.</ref>.

==Graduate Program==
The PNP graduate program is a track within the [[PhD]] of philosophy and is not designed to be a program in cognitive sciences as the undergraduate program may be used as.   The current program is ten students in size.<ref name="PNP Graduate Program">[http://pnp.artsci.wustl.edu/graduate], PNP Graduate Program Details.</ref>.
