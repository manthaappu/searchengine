'''Johannes Trithemius''' (1 February 1462 – 13 December 1516), born '''Johann Heidenberg''', was an abbot, lexicographer, historian, cryptographer, polymath and occultist who had an influence on later occultism.  The name by which he is more commonly known is derived from his native town of [[Trittenheim]] on the [[Mosel]] in [[Germany]].

==Life==

He studied at the [[University of Heidelberg]]. Travelling from university to his home town in 1482, he was surprised by a [[snowstorm]] and took refuge in the [[Benedictine]] abbey of [[Sponheim]] near the [[Bad Kreuznach]]. He decided to stay and was elected [[abbot]] in 1483, at the age of twenty-one. He set out to transform the abbey from a neglected and undisciplined place into a centre of learning. In his time, the abbey [[library]] increased from around fifty items to more than two thousand. However, his efforts did not meet with praise, and his reputation as a [[magic and religion|magician]] did not further his acceptance. Increasing differences with the [[convent]] led to his [[resignation]] in 1506, when he decided to take up the offer of the [[Bishop of Würzburg]], [[Lorenz von Bibra]] (bishop from 1495 to 1519), to become the abbot of [[St. James's Abbey, Würzburg]], the ''[[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Schottenkloster]]'' in Würzburg. He remained there until the end of his life.  Trithemius was buried at the Schottenkirche St. Jakob with a tombstone by the famous [[Tilman Riemenschneider]].  In 1825 the tombstone was moved to the Neumünster church, next to the cathedral.  In 1945 it was damaged in the firebombing and subsequently restored by the workshop of Theodor Spiegel.

Among his pupils were [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] (1486-1535) and [[Paracelsus]] (1493-1541).

== Steganographia ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Goetia]] -->
Trithemius' most famous work is ''Steganographia'' (written ''c.''1499; published [[Frankfurt]], 1606, placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' in 1609<ref>{{cite book |title = Indice de Libros Prohibidos (1877) |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=Yq8XAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA309&dq=index+librorum+prohibitorum+trithemius&lr=&as_brr=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false |language = Spanish |trans_title = Index of Prohibited Books of Pope Pius IX (1877) |accessdate = 2 August 2009 |publisher = Vatican}}</ref>, removed in 1900<ref>{{cite book |title = Index Librorum Prohibitorum (1900) |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=pM0XAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA298&dq=index+librorum+prohibitorum+tricassinus&lr=&as_brr=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false |page = 298 |language = Latin |trans_title = Index of Prohibited Books of Pope Leo XIII (1900) |accessdate = 2 August 2009 |publisher = Vatican}}</ref>). This book is in three volumes, and appears to be about [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] - specifically, about using [[spiritual being|spirit]]s to communicate over long distances. Since the publication of the decryption [[key (cryptography)|key]] to the first two volumes in 1606, they have been known to be actually concerned with [[cryptography]] and [[steganography]]. Until recently, the third volume was widely still believed to be about magic, but the "magical" formulae have now been shown to be [[stegotext|covertext]]s for yet more cryptography content.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3926/is_/ai_n8820687 | work=Cryptologia | title=Solved: The ciphers in book III of Trithemius's Steganographia | first=Jim | last=Reeds | year=1998}}</ref> The work has lent its name to the modern field of steganography.

== Other works ==
Other works include ''De Laude Scriptorum'' (''In Praise of Scribes'') (written 1492, printed 1494), ''De septum secundeis'' (''The Seven Secondary Intelligences'', 1508), a history of the world based on [[astrology]]; ''Annales Hirsaugiensis'' (1514); and ''Polygraphiae'' (1518).

* ''Annales Hirsaugiensis''. The full title is ''Annales hirsaugiensis...complectens historiam Franciae et Germaniae, gesta imperatorum, regum, principum, episcoporum, abbatum, et illustrium virorum'', [[Latin]] for "The Annals of Hirsau...including the history of France and Germany, the exploits of the emperors, kings, princes, bishops, abbots, and illustrious men". Hirsau was a monastery near [[Württemberg]], whose abbot commissioned the work in 1495, but it took Trithemius until 1514 to finish the two volume, 1400 page work. It was first printed in 1690. Some consider this work to be one of the first [[Humanism in Germany|humanist]] [[history]] books.

==Influences==
The [[Cipher Manuscripts]] were encrypted using the [[Trithemius cipher]], a simple substitution crypto which Trithemius describes in his book ''Polygraphiae''. ''The Cipher Manuscripts'' was used to found the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], an [[initiation|initiatory]] [[secret society]] that heavily influenced [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and modern European occultism.
