<html> <head> <title>Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute</title></head><body>The '''Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute''' is a permanent research institute at the [[University of Utah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sci.utah.edu/about.html|title=About SCI webpage}}</ref> It is a leader in engineering and research in the areas of [[scientific computing]], [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]], and [[imaging science|imaging]]. It focuses on solving computational and imaging problems in medicine, geophysics, chemical engineering, molecular dynamics, aerospace, fluid mechanics, combustion, and atmospheric dispersion.

== Associated research centers ==

The SCI Institute houses the NIH/NCRR Center for Integrative Biomedical Computing (CIBC)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sci.utah.edu/cibc/|title=CIBC Homepage}}</ref> and is associated with several other national research centers:

* [[United_States_Department_of_Energy|DoE]] Center for the Simulation of Accidental Fires and Explosions (C-SAFE)
* DoE Visualization and Analytics Center for Enabling Technologies (VACET)
* DoE Scientific Data Management Center
* DoE Center for Technology for Advanced Scientific Component Software (TASCS)
* NIH National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC)
* NIH Center for Computational Biology.

== Open source software releases ==

Besides research in the areas mentioned above, a particular focus of SCI has been to develop innovative and robust software packages, and release them as [[open source]]. Examples:

* SCIRun, a scientific [[Problem Solving Environment|problem solving environment]] (PSE) for modeling, simulation and visualization of scientific problems (includes BioPSE);
* BioTensor, a program to process and visualize [[Diffusion MRI|diffusion tensor images]];
* Seg3D, an interactive segmentation tool;
* map3d, a scientific visualization application written to display and edit complex, three-dimensional geometric models and scalar, time-based data associated with those models;
* [[ImageVis3D]], a lightweight, feature-rich volume rendering application; and
* [[VisTrails]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vistrails.org/|title=VisTrails website}}</ref> a new scientific workflow management system.
