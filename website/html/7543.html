==Foundation==
To understand the foundation of computer ethics, it is important to look into the different schools of [[ethical theory]]. Each school of ethics influences a situation in a certain direction and pushes the final outcome of an [[ethical dilemma]] to fit its target schema. Modern computer ethic has built its foundation from [[Relativism]] , [[Kantianism]] , [[Utilitarianism]] , and [[Social Contract]] and continues to intertwine with modern ethical theory. 
 
[[Relativism]] is the understanding that there are no universal moral norms of right and wrong. In the school of relativistic ethical belief, ethicists divide it into two connected but different structures, subject (Moral) and culture (Anthropological). [[Moral relativism]] is the idea that each person decides what is right and wrong for them. [[Anthropological relativism]] is the concept of right and wrong is decided by a society’s actual moral belief structure. 

[[Kantianism]] is the belief that people’s actions are to be guided by moral laws, and that these moral laws are universal. [[Kantianism]] is the name given to the ethical theory of German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]. He believed that in order for any ethical school of thought to apply to all rational beings, they must have a foundation in reason.  Kant split this school into two categorical imperatives. The first categorical imperative states to act only from moral rules that you can at the same time will to be universal moral laws. The second categorical imperative states to act so that you always treat both yourself and other people as ends in themselves, and never only as a means to an end. 

[[Utilitarianism]] is the belief that if an action is good if it benefits someone and an action is bad if it harms someone.  This ethical belief can be broken down into two different schools, [[Act Utilitarianism]] and [[Rule Utilitarianism]]. [[Act Utilitarianism]] is the belief that an action is good if its overall affect is to produce more happiness than unhappiness. [[Rule Utilitarianism]] is the belief that we should adopt a moral rule and if followed by everybody, would lead to a greater level of overall happiness. 

[[Social contract]] is the concept that for a society to arise and maintain order, a morality based set of rules must be agreed upon. Social contract theory has influenced modern government and is heavily involved with societal law. Philosophers like [[John Rawls]] , [[Thomas Hobbes]] , [[John Locke]] , and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] helped created the function foundation of [[social contract]] .

The conceptual foundations of computer ethics are investigated by [[information ethics]], a branch of philosophical [[ethics]] established by [[Luciano Floridi]]. The term computer ethics was first coined by Dr. Walter Maner, a professor at [[Bowling Green State University]]. Since the 1990s the field has started being integrated into professional development programs in academic settings.

==Identifying issues==
Identifying ''ethical'' issues as they arise, as well as defining how to deal with them, has traditionally been problematic. In solving problems relating to ethical issues, [[Michael Davis (philosopher)|Michael Davis]] proposed a unique problem-solving method. In Davis's model, the ethical problem is stated, facts are checked, and a list of options is generated by considering relevant factors relating to the problem.  The actual action taken is influenced by specific ethical standards.

==Some questions in computer ethics==
{{Inappropriate tone|date=April 2009}}
There are a number of computers based [[ethical dilemma]] that are frequently discussed. One set of issues deals with some of the new [[ethical dilemma]] that have emerged, or taken on new form, with the rise of the [[Internet]] and [[Social Networking]]. 
There are now many ways to gain information about others that were not available, or easily available, before the rise of [[computers]]. Thus ethical issues about [[storage]] of [[personal information]] are now becoming an ever increasing problem. With more storage of personal data for [[social networking]] arises the problem of selling that information for monetary gain. This gives rise to different ethical situations regarding access, security, and the use of hacking in positive and negative situations.

Situations regarding the [[copyright infringement of software]] , music, movies, are widely becoming discussed, with the rise of file sharing programs such as [[Napster]] , [[Kazaa]] , and the [[BitTorrent (protocol)]] . The ethical questions that arise from [[software piracy]] are : is it immoral or wrong to copy software, music, or movies?
 
The use of [[Internet]] as a tool for abuse; spreading [[child porn]], harassment of others, and other challenges as a result of kids use of this media for both consumption and producing. A second set of questions pertaining to the [[Internet]] and the societal influence that are becoming more widely discussed are questions relating to the values that some may wish to promote via the [[Internet]]. Some have claimed that the [[Internet]] is a "democratic technology”.  Does the [[Internet]] foster [[democracy]] and freedom of speech? What are the ethical implications of this process on the world?  Does the [[digital divide]] raise ethical issues that society is morally obligated to change and spread the ability to access different forms of [[electronic communication]]?

==Ethical standards==
Various national and international professional societies have produced code of ethics documents to give basic parameters for computing professionals.  They include:

* [[Association for Computing Machinery]]<ref>[http://www.acm.org/constitution/code.html ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct]</ref>
* [[British Computer Society]]<ref>[http://www.bcs.org/server.php?show=conWebDoc.1587 BCS Code of Conduct & Code of Good Practice]</ref>
* [[Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act]]<ref>[http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/ulc/ucita/ucita200.htm Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act]</ref>
