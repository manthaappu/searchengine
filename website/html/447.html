<html> <head> <title>ANIMAL (image processing)</title></head><body>'''ANIMAL''' (first implementation: 1988 - revised: 2004) is an interactive environment for [[Image processing]] that is oriented toward the rapid prototyping, testing, and modification of algorithms. To create ANIMAL (AN IMage ALgebra), [[XLISP]] of David Betz was extended with some new types: sockets, arrays, images, masks, and drawables.
The theoretical framework and the implementation of the working environment is described in the paper [http://tev.fbk.eu/people/modena/Papers/BruMod_AF_1989.pdf ANIMAL: AN IMage ALgebra]<ref>R. Brunelli and C. M. Modena, "ANIMAL: AN IMage ALgebra", High Frequency, 1989, LVIII:3:255-259</ref>.

In the theoretical framework of ANIMAL a [[digital image]] is a boundless matrix with its ''history''. However, in the implementation it is bounded by a rectangular region in the discrete plane and the elements outside the region have a constant value. The size and position of the region in the plane (focus) is defined by the coordinates of the rectangle. In this way all the [[pixel]]s, including those on the border, have the same number of neighbors (useful in local operators, such as [[digital filter]]s). Furthermore, pixelwise [[commutative operation]]s 
remain commutative on image level, independently on focus (size and position of the rectangular regions). The ''history'' is a list which tracks the operations and parameters applied to the matrix. This mechanism is useful to document algorithms and generate new functions.

ANIMAL has been ported to [[R (programming language)|R]], a freely available language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
[http://tev.fbk.eu/TM/AnImAl.tgz  The new implementation]   is free  and is used in a recent book<ref>R. Brunelli, ''Template Matching Techniques in Computer Vision: Theory and Practice'', Wiley, ISBN 978-0-470-51706-2, 2009 ''([http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470517069.html] TM book)''</ref>  to illustrate the use of template matching techniques in computer vision  (see the [http://tev.fbk.eu/TM/html/tmCodeCompanionli2.html#x3-2000 preface] of the [http://tev.fbk.eu/TM/html book code companion]).
