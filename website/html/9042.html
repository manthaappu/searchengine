'''DNSCurve''' is a proposed new secure DNS protocol. The basic idea is a define a secure new transport layer protocol to replace TCP, called '''CurveCP''', using [[elliptic curve cryptography]] on top of UDP, and then doing DNS queries inside CurveCP. By using DNS CNAME records to prepend the CurveCP elliptic curve cryptography public keys to the DNS names of the DNS servers, [[Daniel J. Bernstein]] claims that DNSCurve could be implemented on the Internet much easier than [[DNSSEC]].<ref name=27C3>{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/18279777|title=27C3 Talk by Dan Bernstein: High-speed high-security cryptography: encrypting and authenticating the whole Internet.|author=Daniel J. Bernstein}}</ref>

A key part of the reasoning behind the DNSCurve proposal is that elliptic curve cryptography is fast enough. [[Daniel J. Bernstein]] claims that this is the case.<ref name=27C3 />

DNSCurve was proposed by [[Daniel J. Bernstein]].<ref>{{cite web| author = Daniel J. Bernstein | title = High-speed cryptography| url = http://marc.info/?l=djbdns&m=122011940521548&w=2}}</ref>

DNSCurve appears to be much more similar in concept to [[TSIG]] (securing communication with name servers) rather than [[DNSSEC]] (securing DNS records themselves). There are some significant differences, however.  TSIG, frequently needs to switch to the more expensive TCP transport, while DNSCurve is designed to keep the packets smaller.  TSIG is also not typically used for all queries, but primarily for updating DNS records.  TSIG does just authentication, while DNSCurve does both authentication and encryption. Finally, DNSCurve includes a scalable key distribution scheme, while TSIG is much more limited.
