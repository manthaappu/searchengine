'''COSILAB''' is a software tool for solving complex chemical [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]] problems.  It is used worldwide in research and industry, in particular in [[automotive]], [[combustion]], and [[chemical]] processing applications.

Problems to be solved by COSILAB may involve thousands of reactions amongst hundreds of species for practically any mixture composition, pressure and temperature. Its computational capabilities allow for a complex [[chemical reaction]] to be studied in detail, including intermediate compounds, trace compounds and [[pollutants]].  

Whilst complex chemistry is accounted for, [[chemical reactor]] or [[combustion]] geometries that can be handled by COSILAB are relatively simple. For the purpose of ``real-life" simulations this limitation can be overcome, however, by using a library of pre-compiled subroutines and functions, that one can link to his or her own code written in [[Fortran]], the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] or [[C++]].  In this way, it is possible to develop fully two-dimensional or three-dimensional CFD or [[computational fluid dynamics]] codes that are able to capture fairly realistic geometries.  

The development of codes like COSILAB is motivated by a worldwide attempt to keep the environment clean and to save -- or at least make best use of -- the continuously diminishing [[fossil fuel]] resources.
