[[Image:Jaguar-petascale.jpg|thumb|Cray XT5 Jaguar supercomputer, Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility]] In [[computing]], '''petascale''' refers to a computer system capable of reaching performance in excess of one [[FLOPS|petaflop]], i.e. one [[quadrillion]] [[floating point]] operations per [[second]]. The standard benchmark tool is [[LINPACK]] and [[Top500|Top500.org]] is the organisation which tracks the fastest supercomputers. Some uniquely specialized petascale computers do not rank on the Top500 list since they cannot run LINPACK. This makes comparisons hard to ordinary supercomputers.

Petascale can also refer to very large storage systems where the capacity exceeds one [[petabyte]] (PB).

==Applications==
Petascale computing will be used to do advanced computations in fields such as [[weather forecasting|weather]] and [[climate simulation]], nuclear simulations, [[cosmology]], [[quantum chemistry]], and [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] science.

==Development==
The [[National Science Foundation]] is responsible for initiating and funding several petascale computers in the [[USA]], as well as [[DARPA]] who gave [[IBM]] the contract to develop the petascale [[PERCS]] (Productive, Easy-to-use, Reliable Computer System) platform.

[[China]] has developed two petascale computers, [[Nebulae (computer)|Nebulae]] and [[Tianhe-I]].

Other countries, such as [[Germany]] and [[Japan]], have plans of their own for petascale computers.

Petascale computers are under development from manufacturers such as [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Cray]], [[IBM]], [[Dawning Information Industry|Dawning]], [[SGI]], and [[NEC]].

===Active===
As of January 2011, these are the only known active petascale computers in the world.
*[[IBM Roadrunner|Roadrunner]], built by [[IBM]], was the first computer to go petascale, and did so on May 25, 2008, with sustained performance of 1.026 petaflops.
*[[Cray XT5|XT5]] ''"Jaguar"'', built by [[Cray]], was the second, later in 2008. After an update in 2009, its performance reached 1.759 petaflops.<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite web|author=National Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS)|url=http://www.nccs.gov/jaguar/ |title=World's Most Powerful Supercomputer for Science!|publisher=NCCS|date=2010 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}</ref>
*[[Nebulae (computer)|Nebulae]] built by [[Dawning]], was the third petascale computer and the first built by China with a performance of 1.271 petaflops in 2010.
*[[Tianhe-1A]] built by [[NUDT]], is the fastest supercomputer in the world, at 2.566 petaflops in 2010.

==== Other ====
*RIKEN [[RIKEN MDGRAPE-3|MDGRAPE-3]] in Japan which went online in 2006 reaches petascale performance but can't run LINPACK, so comparisons to regular supercomputers are hard.

===Under construction===
*IBM [[Blue Waters]]
*IBM [[IBM Sequoia|Sequoia]]
*SGI [[Pleiades (supercomputer)|Pleiades]] which went online in 2008, reaching 600 TFLOPS, but will reach petascale in 2009.
*[[JUGENE]], an upgraded [[Blue Gene/P#Blue_Gene.2FP|Blue Gene/P]] system at [[Jülich Research Centre]] in Germany, operational in mid 2009.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|author=IBM Press Release |url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/26657.wss |title=New IBM Petaflop Supercomputer at German Forschungszentrum Juelich to Be Europe's Most Powerful|publisher=IBM Inc|date=2009-02-10 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}</ref>
*''Tera 100'' is built by [[Groupe Bull|Bull]] for the Military Applications Department (DAM) at the [[France|French]] [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique|Atomic Energy Authority]] (CEA). Operational in 2010.<ref name="autogenerated">{{cite web|author=Bull Press Release |url=http://www.wcm.bull.com/internet/pr/rend.jsp?DocId=375293&lang=en |title=Bull and the CEA sign a collaboration contract for the design and acquisition of a petaflops-scale supercomputer|publisher=Groupe Bull|date=2008-07-08 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}</ref>

===Platform examples===
*[[Sun Constellation System]]
*IBM [[Blue Gene/P#Blue_Gene.2FP|Blue Gene/P]], [[Blue Gene/P#Blue_Gene.2FQ|Blue Gene/Q]] and [[PERCS]]
