}}</ref>  After graduating from [[Rice University]], he was a [[Fortran]] programmer for [[Western Geophysical]] in [[Houston, Texas]].<ref name="halcyon" />  He received an M.S. from [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1976, and went to work at [[Atari]] in November 1977.<ref name="arthurshall" /><ref name="halcyon" />

His first effort at Atari was ''[[Slot Racers]]'' for the [[Atari 2600]]. While he was working on it, he had discovered and played Crowther and Woods' ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'' at the [[Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], and decided that a graphical video game version "would be really cool".<ref name="halcyon" />  However, with 128 bytes of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]] and 4096 bytes of [[Read-only memory|ROM]], Atari's ''Adventure'' was a much simpler program, and with only a [[joystick]] for input, the set of "commands" was necessarily brief.<ref name="halcyon" />  Even so, ''Adventure'' was a hit upon its 1979 release, and eventually sold a million copies.<ref name="thejadedgamer" />

Atari designers at the time were not given credit for their games, because Atari feared having to bargain with well-known designers.<ref name="thejadedgamer" /> In response to this, Robinett placed a hidden object in the game that would allow the player to reach a hidden screen which displayed the words "Created by Warren Robinett," hence creating one of the earliest known [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter eggs]] in a video game, and the first to which the name "Easter egg" was applied.<ref name="thejadedgamer" /><ref name="halcyon" />

Robinett then wrote the ''[[BASIC Programming]]'' cartridge, finishing both ''BASIC Programming'' and ''Adventure'' in June 1979, and quit Atari.<ref name="halcyon" />

He founded [[The Learning Company]]<ref name="arthurshall" /> in 1980,{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} and worked on several educational games there, including ''[[Rocky's Boots]]'' for the [[Apple II series]] computer.<ref name="thejadedgamer" />  He has since worked on [[virtual reality]] projects for [[NASA]]<ref name="halcyon" /> and the [[University of North Carolina]].<ref name="arthurshall" />
