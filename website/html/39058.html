<html> <head> <title>User modeling</title></head><body>'''User modeling''' is a sub-area of [[human–computer interaction]], in which the researcher / designer develops [[cognitive model]]s of human users, including modeling of their [[skill]]s and [[descriptive knowledge|declarative knowledge]]. User models can predict [[human reliability|human error]] and learning time, and can thus serve as a cheaper alternative to user testing. User models can guide [[user interface design]]ers to minimize error rates and learning time.

User modeling is used in [[adaptive hypermedia]], [[Personalization|web personalization]], [[e-learning]] <ref>

The result of user modeling in computer systems may be stored in  [[user profile]]s. The content of a user model may be extracted via user [[profiling (computer programming)|profiling]].  Additionally a cognitive profile (i.e., user preferences) and history profile (e.g., student knowledge or order history) may be stored.

Sub-areas: [[Intelligent tutoring system|student modeling]].

== Standards for representing user information==
A certain number of representation formats and standards are available for representing the users in computer systems <ref>Nabeth Thierry (2005), D2.3: Models, FIDIS Deliverable, October 2005.  available at: http://www.fidis.net/resources/deliverables/identity-of-identity/ </ref> such as:
* [[IMS-LIP]] (IMS &ndash; Learner Information Packaging, used in [[e-learning]]) 
* [[HR-XML Standards|HR-XML]] (used in [[human resource management]])
* [[JXDM]] (Justice with the Global Justice Extensible Markup)
* [[Europass]] (the Europass online CV)
