WorkNC is used by more than 25% of companies in demanding countries such as Japan<ref>EngineeringTalk, “[http://www.engineeringtalk.com/news/sez/sez116.html Nikkan Kogyo survey]”</ref> and is well known for having always focused on [[automation]] and ease of use<ref> Machinery, the home of production engineering “[http://fplreflib.findlay.co.uk/articles/3777/GrandCruCAM.pdf Grand Cru CAM article]”</ref> since its first release in 1988. [[WorkNC-CAD]] was introduced in 2002, making WorkNC a complete [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]/[[Computer aided manufacturing|CAM]] product, one of the worldwide market leaders in its field<ref>Datakit website, “[http://www.datakit.com/download.php?kind=doc&filename=sescoi.pdf WorkNC, a market leader]”</ref>. The typical users of WorkNC belong to the following industries: [[Automotive industry|automotive]], [[aerospace]] and defense, [[engineering]], [[medical]] & [[Dentistry|dental]], [[tooling]], [[mold (manufacturing)|mold]] and [[die (manufacturing)|die manufacturing]].

== History ==
[[Image:WorkNC-Audi concept car.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Audi]] concept car, machined using '''WorkNC'''.]]
The first version of WorkNC CAM software was released by Sescoi in 1988. The driving forces behind the product were Bruno Marko, president of Sescoi, and Gerard Billard, R&D Innovation Manager<ref>DesignPresentation Associates.“[http://designpresentation.com/blogs/2008/03/sescoi-celebrates-workncs-20th.html Sescoi Celebrates WorkNC's 20th Anniversary] ”</ref>. 

In the late eighties, [[CNC]] programming of complex components was a difficult and lengthy process. This was when Sescoi identified the need for 3-axis CAM software and pioneered the development of WorkNC, a new, reliable and automatic 3-axis CAM system. Over the years, Sescoi has stuck to the original philosophy behind WorkNC : to speed up toolpath calculations, ensure optimum [[reliability]] to facilitate machining directly into hard materials, and maximize automation and ease of use so that programming can be carried out on the [[shop floor]]. Automation is a theme which runs throughout the development history of the software. According to Bruno Marko, “WorkNC’s aim has always been to be the closest thing possible to a ‘single-button’ CAM”.

[[Salomon Group]] was the first customer to use WorkNC in 1988 and has now been using it for over 20 years to manufacture [[ski boot]]s and other sports equipment<ref>Manufacturingtalk magazine, “[http://www.manufacturingtalk.com/news/sez/sez184.html Salomon uses WorkNC CAM to machine skiboots since 1988]”</ref>. Demand for WorkNC took off and Sescoi expanded its operations by opening offices in the USA in 1991, Germany and Japan in 1995, UK in 1997, followed by Spain, India, China and Korea.

The company released [[WorkNC-CAD]] in 2002 and WorkNC 5-axis in 2003. 

WorkNC G3, the third generation of the software with an integrated and intuitive [[CAD/CAM]] interface, was released in 2007. 

In 2008 Sescoi launched [[WorkXPlore 3D]], a high-speed collaborative viewer for analyzing and sharing 3D CAD files without having to rely on the original CAD application<ref>Direct Industry, “[http://www.directindustry.com/prod/sescoi/visualization-software-collaborative-3d-viewer-8732-375155.html WorkXPlore 3D collaborative viewer]”</ref>.

In 2009 the company launched [[WorkNC Dental]], a [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]/[[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]] software for automatic 3 to 5-axis machining of prosthetic appliances, implants or dental structures<ref>Desktop Engineering, “[http://www.deskeng.com/articles/aaardf.htm WorkNC DENTAL Software Showcased at Rapid.Tech]”</ref> , and also launched WorkNC Wire EDM<ref>Desktop Engineering, “[http://www.deskeng.com/articles/aaarjb.htm Sescoi Introduces WorkNC Wire EDM]”</ref>, a software for Wire [[Electrical discharge machining|EDM]]. In 2010 Sescoi launched [[WorkNC-CAD Hybrid Modeling]], a powerful 3D CAD software for 3D model design, reparation and machining preparation, with new surface design capabilities tightly integrated with solid modeling functionality, powered by [[D-Cubed]] software components.<ref name="siemens">Siemens PLM Software, June 8, 2010, [http://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/about_us/newsroom/press/press_release.cfm?Component=98527&ComponentTemplate=822 D-Cubed 2D DCM and 3D DCM from Siemens PLM Software Integrated into Sescoi's WorkNC-CAD Hybrid Modeling]</ref><ref name="euromold2010"/>

=== WorkNC Dental ===
[[File:Disc with dental implants made with WorkNC.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Chrome-cobalt disc with [[Bridge_(dentistry)|bridges]] and [[Crown (dentistry)|crowns]] manufactured using [[WorkNC Dental]] CAD/CAM]]
WorkNC Dental is the [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]/[[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]] software from [[Sescoi]] for automatic 3 to 5-axis machining<ref>Machining videos, “[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaqAG9nMzpc CNC dental machining with Wissner and WorkNC Dental]”</ref> of [[Dentures|prosthetic appliances]], [[Dental implant|implants]], [[Crown (dentistry)|crowns]],  [[Bridge_(dentistry)|bridge implants]]<ref>Machining videos, “[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4vHXMyh6C4 Dental Bridge implant CNC Machining 5 axis]”</ref> and dental structures.

WorkNC Dental has an easy to use [[Graphical user interface|graphic user interface]] designed for labs and [[dental technicians]] who are not machining experts. It is the closest thing to a « one button CAM » for the dental sector and has been developed and tested in collaboration with dental professionals and [[Professional body|professional bodies]]. Its automatic 3 and 5-axis toolpaths combine with technology for nesting and orientating prosthetic implants. Additionally, tools for adding support pins and identification markings make the software an ideal solution for rapid [[prosthesis]] manufacture.

STL and native dental CAD formats are imported into WorkNC Dental ready for “machining [[Wizard_(software)|wizards]]” to guide the user through the manufacturing process. The system automatically selects tools, machining sequences and cutting conditions optimized for particular types of material, such as [[chrome]]-[[cobalt]], [[titanium]] and [[zirconia]], and for particular prostheses, such as copings and bridges. The intricate nature of some implants requires the use of 5-axis machining methods to reach every part of the job. Traditionally requiring highly skilled programmers, WorkNC Dental overcomes this problem with its automated 5-axis software. Intelligence within the system considers the limitations and kinematics of the machine tool itself to automatically produce reliable and collision free 5-axis toolpaths.

=== WorkNC MPM (Multi-Part Machining)  === 
WorkNC MPM is a CAD/CAM module that allows users to easily machine multiple parts simultaneously on the same machine.  Operators are confronted by a number of problems as a result of multiple tool changes (collision management, down time and lack of precision).

WorkNC's MPM module eliminates these problems and offers productivity gains by optimizing the machining operations. No programming is required and no supplementary part origin data need to be defined.

There is also a significant reduction in the number of tool changes required. Problems due to incorrect tool numbering are eliminated, and there are no collisions between the parts.

The use of predefined [[pallet]] systems ensures rapid and safe machining.

MPM can consider a complete pallet load of [[Electrical_discharge_machining#Sinker_EDM|electrodes]] as one part, using each tool across all the electrodes on the pallet.
The software ensures collision-free cutter paths as it moves across the job, and eliminates the many tool change operations that would otherwise be required. MPM automatically determines a safe retract height above the tallest electrode, and the clear graphics enable the programmer to identify the slightest potential problem.

The main benefits of WorkNC MPM are: No programming is necessary on the machine, Simple and reliable part positioning, Unsupervised machining, Optimal use of clamping assemblies and palettes, Significant reduction in number of tool changes, Flexibility and adaptability during modifications, Part symmetry and rotation without having to recalculate toolpaths.

=== WorkNC LMP (Layer Milling Process) === 
WorkNC LMP is a CAD/CAM software for cutting parts in layers, a well-known technique for machining deep and narrow cavities<ref>Layer milling for [[rapid prototyping]], “[http://www.sescoi.com/index.php?id=pr&pr=wnclmp&L=6 Kegelmann Technik Gmbh uses WorkNC Layer Milling Process (LMP)]”</ref>. 

WorkNC-LMP automatically divides 3D models and creates roughing and finishing toolpaths for each layer<ref>Machining videos, “[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyCjwH3EI3c CNC Layer Milling - Machining from Zimmermann/WorkNC]”</ref>. This technology can be used on any [[Machining_center#Computer_numerical_control|machining center]], simplifying the programming and cutting of complex shapes by building them up in manageable sections. 

Sescoi worked in collaboration with F. Zimmermann, combining the speed and accuracy of the dedicated Zimmermann LMC (Layer Milling Centre) with Sescoi's WorkNC-LMP. By using the software in conjunction with the machine all the toolpaths and special machine control sequences are automatically generated to cut parts in unmanned operation.

The LMC works from underneath, using high-speed techniques to machine each layer in turn. As each layer is roughed and finished a new plate is bonded, ready for the next machining operation, this continues until the finished part is built up. WorkNC-LMP automates this process starting from the CAD model, firstly splitting it into layers, and then generating both the roughing and finishing toolpaths for each layer. This technique is ideal for high speed machining enabling the use of short and rigid cutters, and eliminates the possibility of a collision. WorkNC-LMP allows to select the material from a materials library and controls factors such as surface roughening prior to bonding, cutting adhesive channels to control excess glue, overlapping of cutter paths to remove traces of glue, and paths for the application of adhesive between layers. It provides the visual control of all toolpaths and the calculation of the estimated total machining time.

WorkNC-LMP combines the advantages of generative [[rapid prototyping]] with conventional machining, and is the latest example of the company's resolve to make new processes a reality for its customers.

=== WorkNC Wire EDM === 
WorkNC Wire EDM is a CAD/CAM software for Wire [[Electrical discharge machining]]. [[Dialog box]]es guide the user through the system. Functions within WorkNC Wire EDM allow the extraction of [[Cross section (geometry)|cross sections]], ready for 2- or 4-axis cutting. Alternatively, the 3D surfaces of the CAD model can be used directly. 

It also includes graphical verification to automatically check for collisions and the maximum wire angle possible on each individual EDM machine. The latest version makes it easy to extract and link 4-axis wire paths. Dialog boxes guide the user through the process making it simple to add tags, create roughing and finishing wire paths, lead in and out moves, a range of corner strategies, and tag removal cycles. Postprocessors and technology libraries are included for all leading machines.<ref name="euromold2010">thomasnet.com, November 18, 2010, [http://news.thomasnet.com/companystory/-A-Growing-Line-up-of-Productivity-Software-from-Sescoi-at-Euromold-587690 A Growing Line up of Productivity Software from Sescoi at Euromold]</ref>
