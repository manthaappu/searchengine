'''Philip Wadler''' is a [[computer scientist]] well-known for his contributions to [[programming language design]] and [[type theory]]. In particular, he has contributed to the theory behind [[functional programming]] and the use of [[monads in functional programming]], the design of the purely functional language [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], and the [[XQuery]] declarative query language. He is also author of the famous paper "Theorems for free!"<ref>{{cite conference

He is presently a [[professor]] of Theoretical Computer Science in the School of Informatics at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. In 2007 he was inducted as a Fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]].

Wadler is currently working on a new functional language designed for writing [[web applications]], called ''[[Links (programming language)|Links]]''.
