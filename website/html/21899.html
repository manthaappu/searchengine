<html> <head> <title>List of 3D graphics APIs</title></head><body>3D graphics have become so popular, particularly in [[video game]]s, that specialized [[API]]s (application programming interfaces) have been created to ease the processes in all stages of computer graphics generation. These APIs have also proved vital to computer graphics hardware manufacturers, as they provide a way for [[programmer]]s to access the hardware in an abstract way, while still taking advantage of the special hardware of any specific [[graphics card]].

The first 3d graphics framework was probably [[3D Core Graphics System|Core]], published by the ACM in 1977.

==Low-Level 3D API==

These APIs for 3D computer graphics are particularly popular:

*[[X3D]] 
*[[OpenGL]] and the [[OpenGL Shading Language]]
*[[OpenGL ES]] 3D API for embedded devices
*[[Direct3D]] (a subset of [[DirectX]])
*[[RenderMan]]
*[[RenderWare]]
*[[Glide API]]
*[[TruDimension]] LC Glasses and 3D monitor API
*[[QuickDraw 3D]] developed by Apple Computer starting in 1995, abandoned in 1998

===JavaScript based API===
[[WebGL]] is a JavaScript Interface for OpenGL-ES-2.x API, promoted by [[Khronos]]. This is gaining more interest recently, as this enables Applications to use native graphics.

==High-Level 3D API==
There are also higher-level 3D [[scene graph|scene-graph]] APIs which provide additional functionality on top of the lower-level rendering API. Such libraries under active development include:

*[[ClanLib]]
*[[CrystalSpace]]
*[[HOOPS 3D Graphics System]]
*[[Irrlicht Engine]]
*[[Java 3D]]
*[[JMonkey Engine]]
*[[Mobile 3D Graphics API]] (M3G; JSR-184)
*[[JT (visualization format)|JT Open]] from [[Siemens PLM Software]]
*[[NVidia Scene Graph]]
*[[OGRE]]
*[[Open Inventor]]
*[[OpenGL Performer]]
*[[OpenSceneGraph]]
*[[OpenSG]]
*[[QSDK]]
*[[Quesa (software)|Quesa]]
*[[Vega Prime]] by [[Presagis]]
*[[VR-Vantage]] by [[VT MAK]]

===JavaScript based Engines===
There is more interest in Browser based High-Level API for 3D-Graphics Engines. Below mentioned are some.
*[[CopperLicht]]
*[[Away3d]]
