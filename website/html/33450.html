A '''script doctor''' is a highly-skilled [[screenwriter]], hired by a [[film]] or [[television]] production, to rewrite or polish specific aspects of an existing [[screenplay]], including structure, characterization, dialogue, pacing, theme, and other elements. Script doctors generally do their work uncredited, for a variety of commercial and artistic reasons.

==Background==
Script doctors are usually brought in during the development and pre-production phases of a film, to address specific issues with the script, as identified by the financiers, production team, and cast. They may also be employed during post production, to help address narrative problems that crop up during the editing process.

The use of script doctors was first revealed at the 1973 [[Academy Awards]] when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] thanked [[Robert Towne]] for his work on ''[[The Godfather]]''. Since then, the use of script doctors has been downplayed within the industry, to avoid overshadowing the work of the original writers. 

Under the [[WGA screenwriting credit system]], a screenwriter must contribute 50 percent to the story and/or characterization in order to qualify for credit. Uncredited [[screenwriter]]s are not eligible to win the [[Screenplay oscar|Academy Award for Best Screenplay]] or the [[Writers Guild of America Award]]s.

On his website, [[John August]] revealed that when commissioned to doctor a screenplay, he is provided with a digital copy of the existing script, so doctoring requires little physical retyping.<ref>http://johnaugust.com/</ref>

A number of prominent independent filmmakers, such as [[John Sayles]], have worked as script doctors in order to earn the money and clout necessary to make their own films.
