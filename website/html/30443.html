In [[physics]], a '''pseudopotential''' or '''effective potential''' is used as an approximation for the simplified description of complex systems. Applications include [[atomic physics]] and [[neutron scattering]].

== Atomic physics ==

The pseudopotential is an attempt to replace the complicated effects of the motion of the [[Core electron|core]] (i.e. non-[[Valence electron|valence]]) [[electrons]] of an [[atom]] and its nucleus with an effective [[potential]], or pseudopotential, so that the [[Schrödinger equation]] contains a modified effective potential term instead of the [[Coulomb's law|Coulombic]] potential term for core electrons normally found in the Schrödinger equation. The pseudopotential approximation was first introduced by [[Hans Hellmann]] in the 1930s. By construction of this pseudopotential, the valence [[wavefunction]] generated is also guaranteed to be [[orthogonal]] to all the core [[Quantum state|states]].

The pseudopotential is an effective potential constructed to replace the atomic all-electron potential such that core states are eliminated and the valence electrons are described by nodeless pseudo-wavefunctions. In this approach only the chemically active valence electrons are dealt with explicitly, while the core electrons are 'frozen', being considered together with the nuclei as rigid non-polarizable ion cores.
Norm-conserving pseudopotentials are derived from an atomic reference state, requiring that the pseudo- and all-electron valence eigenstates have the same energies and amplitude (and thus density) outside a chosen core cutoff radius <math>r_c</math>.
Pseudopotentials with larger cutoff radius are said to be ''softer'', that is more rapidly convergent, but at the same time less ''transferable'', that is less accurate to reproduce realistic features in different environments. 

Motivation:
# Reduction of basis set size
# Reduction of number of electrons
# Inclusion of relativistic and other effects

Approximations:
# One-electron picture.
# The small-core approximation assumes that there is no significant overlap between core and valence wave-function.
