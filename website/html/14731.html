On November 20, 2010, GameSalad unveiled a new "Free to Make" model, making basic membership free to all users, including iOS publishing. The price of their Professional account was lowered to $499. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.maclife.com/article/news/gamesalad_unveils_free_make_subscription_program_offers_additional_tools_ios_game_developers|title=GameSalad Unveils "Free to Make" Subscription Program with Tools for Game Devs | publisher=Mac|Life}}</ref>

== Behavior system ==
GameSalad provides a [[graphical user interface]] for describing the rules and the behavior of game objects, called Actors, without knowledge of programming or [[scripting language]]s.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://matthewdavid.sys-con.com/node/1177016 | title=Using Game Salad for Rapid Game Development for the iPhone | publisher=SYS-CON Media}}</ref> Behaviors are components of an actor that can either instantaneously or persistently affect the actor depending on rules that compose them. The application comes with a library of behaviors (for movement, changing attribute states, affecting collision, saving, etc.) that can be inserted into rules and other behavior groups to create new behavior.

== Other major features ==
* '''Cross-platform publishing''' - GameSalad has one common dialog-based interface for publishing to multiple platforms such as the iPhone and the web.<ref name="product page">{{cite web | url=http://gamesalad.com/products/creator | title=GameSalad Creator Product Page | publisher=Gendai Games}}</ref>

* '''Real-time editing''' -- Users can edit a scene while the game is running. The initial state of actors can be toggled to be displayed translucently to show their original orientation when the scene started playing.<ref name="product page"/>

* '''Game preview''' -- GameSalad has a specific preview mode for debugging and testing the performance and memory usage of games on the desktop and the iPhone. A viewer application can be installed separately onto an iPhone so that users can click a toolbar button in GameSalad to upload games onto the iPhone over a wireless network.<ref name="product page"/>

* '''Scene editor''' -- Users can place and manipulate actors in a scene. Actors are added to the scene by dragging and dropping. Actors in a scene can be organized into different [[2d computer graphics#Layers|layers]] to change how actors are visualized (rendering order, [[parallax scrolling]], etc.).<ref name="product page"/>

* '''Dashboard''' -- With the dashboard, users can browse uploaded games, run tutorials, message other GameSalad members, and download shared templates upload by other GameSalad members.<ref name="product page"/>

* '''Integrated physics''' -- GameSalad is utilizes a [[rigid body|rigid-body]] physics simulator for handling realistic motion and collision. Users can manage and optimize how objects collide by organizing actors with [[Tag (metadata)|tags]]. Users can choose to have an actor collide with a group of many other types of actors.<ref name="product page"/>

* '''Expressions''' -- For advanced users, GameSalad has an expression editor to define complex behavior and state changes with [[Expression (mathematics)|mathematical expressions]] and a library of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]].<ref name="product page"/>
