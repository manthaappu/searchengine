<html> <head> <title>Chain of events</title></head><body>A '''chain of events''' is a number of [[action (philosophy)|actions]] and their effects that are [[contiguous]] and linked together.

==Chain reaction==
A [[chain reaction]] is a chain of events where one or more events in the chain causes additional reaction in an earlier stage of the chain. It results in a self-amplification of the chain of events.

==Determinism==
{{Main|Determinism}}
''Determinism'' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[Proposition (philosophy)|proposition]] that every event, including human cognition and behaviour, decision and action, is [[causality|causally]] determined by an unbroken ''chain of events''.<ref>Van Inwagen, Peter, 1983, ''An Essay on Free Will'', Oxford: Clarendon Press.</ref></blockquote>  With numerous historical debates, many varieties and philosophical positions on the subject of determinism exist from traditions throughout the world.

==In value theory==
In [[value theory]], it is the amount of cause and effects of the chain of events before generating [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] that separates [[Instrumental value#High and low grades|high and low grades of instrumental value]].

The ''chain of events duration'' is the time it takes to reach the terminal event. In value theory this is generally the intrinsic value (also called terminal value). It is contrasted with [[ethic value duration]], which is the time that an object has any [[value intensity]].

==Fabric of events==
A ''fabric of events'' is an expansion of the ''chain of events'', emphasizing that chains of events are intertwined with each other, as a [[fabric]].

==In aviation==
{{Main|Chain of events (aviation)}}
In [[aviation]], a ''chain of events'', often called the ''error chain'', is a term specifically referring to the concept that many contributing factors typically lead to an [[Aviation accidents and incidents|accident]], rather than one single event.<ref name="GFDPrivate">{{cite book |author=Willits, Pat |others=Mike Abbott and Liz Kailey |title=Guided Flight Discovery: Private Pilot |url=http://www.jeppesen.com/wlcs/application/commercewf?origin=itemsummary.jsp&event=link(details)&wlcs_catalog_item_sku=JS314500&wlcs_catalog_category_id=AT1A1A8&wlcs_document_type=details |accessdate=August 2007 |publisher=[[Jeppesen]] |location=[[Englewood, Colorado|Englewood]] |isbn=088487429X |oclc=145504766 |pages=10â€“26}}</ref>
