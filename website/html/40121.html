'''WikiPilipinas''' (formerly known as '''Wikipiniana''') is an [[World Wide Web|online]], [[free content]] [[website]] which bills itself as a combination "non-academic [[encyclopedia]]", [[web portal]], [[directory]] and [[almanac]] for [[Philippines|Philippine]]-based knowledge. Like [[Wikipedia]], it contains various articles on Philippine-related topics. Unlike Wikipedia, many of the articles cover topics that would otherwise be deemed [[unencyclopedic]] by the stricter Wikipedia. The service for example, promotes the concept of [[original research]] and eschews the larger encyclopedia's [[NPOV|neutral point-of-view]] principle.

Conceived in late 2006 by Philippine publishing magnate [[Gaspar Vibal]], WikiPilipinas (as Wikipiniana) officially went live on June 12, 2007 with several thousand Philippine-related articles [[forked]] from the English Wikipedia. Its name was officially changed from Wikipiniana to WikiPilipinas a few weeks later on the 7th of July. The service was formally launched at the 28th Manila International Book Fair in late August of the same year.

==Overview==
While it started as a [[WP:FORK|fork]] of [[Wikipedia]], WikiPilipinas does not fancy itself an "[[academic]] [[encyclopedia]]" as stated in its official policies and guidelines page. Despite this, the online resource does contain articles on encyclopedic topics such as history, culture, sports, and politics. In addition to those mentioned, WikiPilipinas styles itself as a mash-up of several entities; a "Who's Who" of prominent Filipinos, a directory of institutions and companies, an [[almanac]] of the Philippines and a multi-racial [[Web portal|community portal]] for the different ethnic groups in the Philippines. As an online resource using the [[wiki]] model, it bills itself as a [[Collaborative writing|collaborative effort]]-content provider. The most major goal that the wiki has stated is "to build the largest Philippine knowledge database". Like Wikipedia, the contents of WikiPilipinas are open to editing by anyone with access to the [[Internet]]. However, editors must register before they are allowed to edit.<ref name="WPnasAbout">{{cite web | title =WikiPilipinas: About | publisher =WikiPilipinas | date =2007-08-23 | url =http://en.wikipilipinas.org/index.php?title=Wikipiniana:About | accessdate = 2007-08-27 }}</ref>[[Image:WikiPilipinas icon.png|thumb|right|100px|The WikiPilipinas logo, featruing a green Muslim vinta which a logo of the colors of the Philippine Flag was superimposed.]]

Wikipilipinas was particularly launched by the Vibal Foundation, a nonprofit organization which previously created Filipiniana.net, and WikiPilipinas.org (a reference guide on the Philippines). Conjunctively, the Vibal Foundation (per [[Gaspar Vibal]] and his mother) made a historical move in [[Philippine]] [[education]], when it also launched on June 12, 2008, the 110th [[Philippine Declaration of Independence]] day, e.turo.org, as [[wikt:conduit|conduit]] of these 3 landmark education tools. Tin Mandigma, editor-in-chief of E-turo.org explained that it is an e-learning portal which "seeks to provide free and quality learning materials online to teachers and students; it gives teachers access to lesson plans and modules based on textbook materials published by Vibal Publishing House, Inc. amid plans to offer Department of Education-approved content from various learning institutions as supplementary teaching materials. One of the most common complaints of teachers is that while the Internet has so much information, most of it cannot be adapted to the local classroom. With this project, we hope to help teachers sort through the clutter and give them quality information that would be useful for their students."<ref>[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=121529 abs-cbnnews.com, RP e-learning portal launched on Independence Day]</ref>

===Differences from Wikipedia===
Although it is modeled after Wikipedia, WikiPilipinas differs from it in distinct ways. Founder [[Gaspar Vibal]] describes "improvements" including a [[directory]] of [[Web portal|portals]] based on those of [[Yahoo!]], Inc., and community portals for Filipino ethnic groups.<ref name="MT20070827">{{cite news | last =Suarez | first =Ike | title =Wiki comes to the Philippines - Bringing along ‘copyleft’ IPR model popularized by Wikipedia  | work =Tech Times Online | publisher =[[Manila Times]] | date =2007-08-27 | url =http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/aug/27/yehey/techtimes/20070827tech1.html | accessdate = 2007-08-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071110222952/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/aug/27/yehey/techtimes/20070827tech1.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-11-10}}</ref> WikiPilipinas guidelines explicitly encourage, "''balanced presentation, but not a neutral point of view.''", state that WikiPilipinas, "''does not believe that any view can ever be neutral''" and that fair discussion of an issue is expected. One of the key pillars of Wikipedia is that articles be written from a [[neutral point of view]], a major difference in [[encyclopedia]] models. WikiPilipinas supports the concept of [[original research]], something Wikipedia forbids. WikiPilipinas encourages users to, "''present their own research and findings on the site''" and expects adequate references from editors for factual information. In addition, the site does not have the [[Wikipedia:Notability]] concept that is another cornerstone of Wikipedia. Articles about practically anything are allowed on the site.<ref name="MST20070904"/> Also, WikiPilipinas' conceptualization is far removed from that of an [[academic]] [[encyclopedia]]. The site's policy and guideline page states, "''WikiPilipinas is not an academic encyclopedia.''"<ref name="WPnasPolicy">{{cite web | title =WikiPilipinas Policies and Guidelines | publisher =WikiPilipinas | date =2007-08-24 | url =http://en.wikipilipinas.org/index.php?title=WikiPilipinas:_Help:_Policies_and_guidelines | accessdate = 2007-08-27 }}</ref><ref name="MB20070827">{{cite news | last =Lim | first =Ronald S. | title =WikiPilipinas stirs Pinoy knowledge revolution | work =Youth & Campus | publisher =Manila Bulletin Online | date =2007-08-27 | url =http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/08/27/YTCP20070827101328.html | accessdate = 2007-08-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071031053115/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/08/27/YTCP20070827101328.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-31}}</ref> Unlike Wikipedia with its strict [[conflict of interest]] [[WP:COI|policy]], WikiPilipinas has no rule preventing one from writing about oneself or one's family.<ref name="BM20070823">{{cite news | last =Estopace| first =Dennis | title =Book trader building Pinoy online encyclopedia | work =Headlines | publisher =Business Mirror | date =2007-08-23 | url =http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/08232007/headlines04.html | accessdate = 2007-08-29 |quote=Indeed, anybody with access to the Internet, has the time and temerity to write about, say, his or her clan, could contribute article/s to the WikiPilipinas’s reservoir of knowledge.}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

==Content==
The contents of WikiPilipinas were originally [[WP:FORK|aggregated]] from a selection of around 15,000 Philippine-related articles of Wikipedia. The addition of original articles began soon after, created by WikiPilipinas volunteers and its editorial team.<ref name="MST20070904"/> All text in WikiPilipinas is licensed under the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] (GFDL).<ref name="WPnasAbout"/>

==History==
[[Image:WikiPilipinas at 28th Manila Book Fair 2007-09-01.jpg|thumb|right|The WikiPilipinas launch booth at the 28th Manila International Book Fair.]]
WikiPilipinas was originally conceived as Wikipiniana, an [[open content]] [[management system]] for volunteer members of the [[Philippines|Philippine]] [[online]] resource [[Filipiniana|Filipiniana.net]]. The site initially used the [[Plone (software)|Plone content management system]] the production of articles was deemed too slow under the system. In September 2006, plans to shift the system to use the [[wiki]]-model were conceived (after the founding of Filipiniana.net) by its New York-based founder Gaspar Vibal and [[webmaster]] Richard Grimaldo.<ref>[http://www.yehey.com/News/print.aspx?id=177982  www.yehey.com, Wiki comes to the Philippines]</ref> Octogenarian book publisher Esther A. Vibal, founder of Vibal Publishing House (VPHI), and mother of [[Gaspar Vibal]] learned about online publishing and knowledge sharing. She introduced the concepts through Gaspar's Filipiniana.net and WikiPilipinas.org, the world’s biggest Philippine encyclopedia available on the Web.<ref>[http://business.inquirer.net/money/topstories/view/20080426-132901/Business-lessons-from-an-octogenarian  Inquirer.net, Business lessons from an octogenarian]</ref>

The actual conceptualization of WikiPilipinas (then-Wikipiniana) occurred in February 2007. In planning, [[MediaWiki]] was officially selected to be the site's platform and it was decided that the site were to be modeled after the [[Wikipedia]]. Instead of a complete [[WP:FORK|fork]] of Wikipedia however, Wikipiniana was to be a "hipper" and "freer" version, including [[almanac]] lists and [[directories]].<ref name="BM20070823"/> The WikiPilipinas team, headed by Grimaldo as webmaster and Alfred Ursua as its managing editor, drew up an initial masterlist of priority contents for Project Wikipiniana.<ref>[http://isulong-seoph.aboutmyrecovery.com/2007/08/23/wikipilipinas-profile/  isulong-seoph.aboutmyrecovery.com,  WikiPilipinas Profile]</ref>

The project officially began on March 15, 2007. It was first made available online three months after on June 12 to coincide with the country's official [[Independence Day (Philippines)|Independence Day]].<ref name="Inq20070827">{{cite news | last =Casiraya | first =Lawrence | title =Wikipilipinas founder aims for ‘long tail’ effect | work =Breaking News/Infotech | publisher =Inquirer.net | date =2007-08-23 | url =http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/infotech/view_article.php?article_id=84296 | accessdate = 2007-08-27 }}</ref><ref name="AJ20070823">{{cite news | title =Wikipilipinas founder aims for ‘long tail’ effect | work =Technology | publisher =Asian Journal | date =2007-08-23 | url =http://www.asianjournal.com/?c=190&a=22423 | accessdate = 2007-08-27 }}</ref> A month after going live, the official name of the service was changed from Wikipiniana to WikiPilipinas on July 7. WikiPhilippines was the term decided upon for the section of the site with  articles in English and WikiFilipinas for the section in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. A press-oriented [[sneak preview]] of the site was hosted for the local media on August 22 of the same year. The event was attended by major Philippine media outlets such as [[GMA-7]] and [[RPN-9]], print media like the [[Manila Bulletin]], the [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] and the [[Manila Times]] and dozens of Philippine bloggers.<ref name="WPnasAbout"/> In a press release on August 23, the site's publicists claimed to be "''the fastest online startup in Philippine history''" due to the site receiving 100,000 visitors during the slew of accesses that occurred after the site was covered by the media the previous day.<ref name="SEO100000th">{{cite press release | title =WikiPilipinas reaches 100,000 visitor mark in 24 Hours | publisher =SEO Resources | date =2007-08-23 | url =http://isulong-seoph.aboutmyrecovery.com/2007/08/23/wikipilipinas-reaches-100000-visitor-mark-in-24-hours/  | accessdate = 2007-09-01 }}</ref>

WikiPilipinas had its official launch during the [[Manila International Book Fair|28th Manila International Book Fair]] in early September, 2007.<ref name="WPnasLaunch">{{cite web | title =WikiPilipinas Schedule of Activities at the 28th Manila International Book Fair from August 29 to September 2, 2007 | publisher =WikiPilipinas | date =2007-08-26 | url =http://en.wikipilipinas.org/index.php?title=WikiPilipinas_Schedule_of_Activities_at_the_28th_Manila_International_Bookfair_from_August_29_to_September_2%2C_2007.

The project itself is owned by the Vibal Foundation, which bills itself as the "corporate social arm" of [[Vibal Publishing House]]. It is a sister-project to [[Filipiniana|Filipiniana.net]], a Philippine-oriented research portal.<ref name="MB20070827-2"/>

==Technical specifications==
As a Philippine company, the site's physical [[Server (computing)|server]]s are situated in [[Manila]] in the Philippines. The site was originally hosted on the servers of its sister project, [[Filipiniana.net]]. However, a surge of viewers following intense media coverage on August 21, 2007 prompted the site's owners to turn to [[VConnect Inc.]] to upgrade the site's hardware. WikiPilipinas is now hosted on an [[IBM System x|IBM System x 3850]] with dual 3 [[gigahertz]] Intel [[Xeon]] [[CPU]]s, 16 [[gigabyte]]s of [[RAM]] and 1.4 [[terabyte]]s of combined [[hard drive]] space. The site's [[internet connection]] is provided by [[IP Converge]] with a total [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] allocation of 10 [[Mbit/s]].<ref name="MB20070827-2">{{cite news | last =Ong | first =Edison D. | title =Pinoy online encyclopedia WikiPilipinas aims high to break in into top 10 wikis | work =Info Tech | publisher =Manila Bulletin Online | date =2007-08-27 | url =http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/08/27/INFO20070827101364.html | accessdate = 2007-08-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071016192050/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/08/27/INFO20070827101364.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-16}}</ref>

Many of its observers on the blogging community and [[Wikipedia:Tambayan Philippines|Tambayan Philippines]], the Philippine Wikipedia [[Wikipedia:Regional notice boards|regional notice board]], have observed that it is "trying to be everything all at once: magazine, putative encyclopedia, pluralistic community forum, soapbox-for-a-day, rumor rag, fight club. It is a pastische of different entities, each of which has been successful on its own, but it remains to be seen whether they will be as successful when smashed together. It is less an organic fusion as it is an unnatural pile-up of knowledge-sharing methodologies taken from Euro-America. In many ways, it is symptomatic and representative of the Philippine condition."<ref>[[Wikipedia talk:Tambayan Philippines]]</ref>

Upon learning of its inception, a few Filipinos bloggers questioned the usefulness of WikiPilipinas as a [[WP:FORK|fork]] of Wikipedia.<ref name="Activism20070827">{{cite web | first=Dong B.|last=Calmada|authorlink=Dong Calmada| title =Wikipilipinas: From a Wikipedia subset to one-stop hub on RP| work = Activism 102: An online personal track on activism of the new millennium | publisher =The Bayanihan Blog Network| date =2007-08-27 | url =http://activism102.wordpress.com/2007/08/27/wikipilipinas-from-a-wikipedia-subset-to-one-stop-hub-on-rp/ | accessdate = 2007-08-28 }}</ref> In a post entitled "''Is There Any Point to Wikipiniana?''", a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[blog]]ger weighed the pros and cons of having an encyclopedia administered to entirely by Filipinos.<ref name="Bayanihan20070717">{{cite web |first=Rico|last=Mossesgeld| authorlink=Rico Mossesgeld| title ="Is There Any Point to Wikipiniana?"| work = | publisher =The Bayanihan Blog Network| date =2007-07-17 | url =http://www.bayanihanblogs.com/119/is-there-any-point-to-wikipiniana/ | accessdate = 2007-08-27 }}</ref> Filipino blogger and [[Wikipedian#Users and editors|wikipedian]] Eugene Alvin Villar questioned the usefulness and purpose of WikiPilipinas in a blog post on July 19, 2007. He argued that the "hip and free encyclopedia"'s policy on articles not needing to adhere to a [[NPOV|neutral point of view]] (as Wikipedia does) was not conducive to an unbiased encyclopedia. With WikiPilipinas being marketed as an encyclopedia "by Filipinos, for Filipinos," Villar pointed out the great possibility of bias in the encyclopedia's articles. Aside from the possibility of bias, he also mentioned that the articles of WikiPilipinas were less likely to [[pagerank|rank]] higher than those of the [[English Wikipedia]] in [[Internet search engine|Internet searches]], making effort spent in updating WikiPilipinas articles better spent working on their equivalent Wikipedia articles.<ref name="Vaes20070719">{{cite web | last =Villar| first =Eugene Alvin| authorlink =Eugene Alvin Villar | title ="There is Currently No Point to Wikipiniana (aka WikiPilipinas)"| work =Vaes9 | publisher = | date =2007-07-19 | url =http://vaes9.codedgraphic.com/posts/no_point_to_wikipiniana | accessdate = 2007-08-27 }}</ref> He later reiterated some of these concerns in an interview with the [[Manila Bulletin]] in September. In the interview, he criticized WikiPilipinas for prioritizing publicity over streamlining the site's policies and guidelines.<ref name="MB20070903">{{cite news | last =Jusay | first =Annalyn S. | title =Wikipedia or WikiPilipinas? : the debate continues | work =Tech News: Blog-O-Rama | pages = | publisher =Manila Bulletin | date =2007-09-03 | url =http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/09/03/TECH20070903102006.html | accessdate =2007-09-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071021091509/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/09/03/TECH20070903102006.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-21}}</ref> Notable Filipino blogger Abraham Olandres personally mentioned Villar's criticism of WikiPilipinas. In his post, Olandres agreed that the Filipino-based service would be useless and redundant unless it "''came up with its own set of content''".<ref name="Yuga20070815">{{cite web | last =Olandres | first =Abraham | authorlink =Abraham Olandres | title =Rainy Day Friday Round-up | work =Blogosphere | publisher =YugaTech: Philippine Technology News and Reviews | date =2007-08-15 | url =http://www.yugatech.com/blog/blogosphere/rainy-day-friday-round-up/ | accessdate = 2007-08-27 }}</ref> In a later entry, Olandres pointed out that WikiPilipinas' lack of a notability guideline could possibly slant it towards a Filipino-centric sense of pseudo-notability.<ref name="Yuga20070831">{{cite web | last =Olandres | first =Abe | authorlink =Abe Olandres | title =Will WikiPilipinas redefine what is notable? | work =Daily Dose | publisher =YugaTech: Philippine Technology News and Reviews | date =2007-08-31 | url =http://www.yugatech.com/blog/daily-dose/will-wikipilipinas-redefine-what-is-notable/ | accessdate =2007-09-01}}</ref>

Kristine Mandigma, the president of the Philippine [[literacy]] [[advocacy]] group Read-or-Die Foundation, also made a commentary on WikiPilipinas after attending the service's August 22 official press launch. She described WikiPilipinas as "the online version of an ''omnium gatherum''… a motley and captivating assortment of ideas, facts and factoids, emotions, dissertations, and agonized biographies."<ref name="RoD20070822">{{cite web | last =Mandigma | first =Kristine | authorlink =Kristine Mandigma | title =Wikipilipinas

The site's credibility was questioned in line with a possible connection to [[Vibal Publishing House]], a local [[publishing house|publishing service]] that was implicated in a controversial textbook scandal. Both the publishing company and WikiPilipinas are owned by the same person, [[Gaspar Vibal]]. In an interview with the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'', Vibal asserted that the wiki project and the publishing house were independent of each other.<ref name="Inq20070826-2">{{cite news | last =Casiraya | first =Lawrence | title =Wikipilipinas founder answers credibility issues | work =Breaking News/Infotech | publisher =Inquirer.net
