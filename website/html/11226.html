DLPAR enables memory, CPU capacity, and I/O interfaces to be moved nondisruptively between LPARs within the same server.

[[IBM]] introduced DLPAR on [[POWER4]]-based servers with the availability of [[AIX]] 5.2 in October 2002.  DLPAR has been supported by the operating systems [[AIX operating system|AIX]] and [[i5/OS]] on almost all POWER4 and follow-on POWER systems since then.  The [[Linux kernel]] for POWER also supported DLPAR, but its dynamic reconfiguration capabilities were limited to CPU capacity and [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] devices, but not memory. In October 2009, seven years after the AIX announcement of DLPAR of memory, CPU and IO slots, Linux finally added the capability to DLPAR memory on POWER systems.  The fundamentals of DLPAR are described in the IBM Systems Journal paper titled: "Dynamic reconfiguration: Basic building blocks for autonomic computing on IBM pSeries Servers" 
( http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/421/jann.html ) and written by the original inventor of DLPAR, Joefon Jann, and her team.

Later on, the [[POWER5]] processor added enhanced DLPAR capabilities, including [[Micro-Partitioning|micro-partitioning]]: up to 10 LPARs can be configured per processor, with a single multiprocessor server supporting a maximum of 254 LPARs (and thus up to 254 independent [[operating system]] instances). 

There are many interesting applications of DLPAR capabilities. Primarily, it is used to build agile infrastructures, or to automate hardware system resource allocation, planning, and provisioning. This in turn results in increased system utilization. For example, memory, processor or I/O slots can be added, removed or moved to another LPAR, without rebooting the operating system or the application running in an LPAR. IBM DB2 is such application (http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/eserver/articles/db2_dlpar.html), it is aware of the DLPAR events and automatically tunes itself to changing LPAR resources.

The [[System z9]] and [[zSeries]] mainframes and their operating systems, including [[Linux on zSeries]], support even more sophisticated forms of dynamic LPARs. Relevant LPAR-related features on those mainframe platforms include [[Intelligent Resource Director]], [[IBM Parallel Sysplex#Sysplex|Sysplex]], [[IBM Parallel Sysplex|Parallel Sysplex]], [[IBM Parallel Sysplex#Geographically Dispersed Parallel Sysplex|Geographically Dispersed Parallel Sysplex]], and [[Hipersockets]]. The System z9 supports up to 60 LPARs on a single server, but mainframes also support an additional level of virtualization using [[z/VM]] with the ability to support thousands of operating system instances on a single server.
