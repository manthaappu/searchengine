'''Adminer''' is a tool for managing content in [[MySQL]] databases. Adminer is distributed under [[Apache license]] in a form of a single [[PHP]] file (currently approx. 160 KiB in size). Its author is Jakub Vrána who (during 2007) decided to develop such tool as an "light-weight" alternative to [[phpMyAdmin]]. Currently (August 2009), the tool is in version 2.0 and so far it exceeded phpMyAdmin in some of the features it offers. Also, first webhosting providers <!--flyweb.cz, webhosting-c4.cz, gtny.org...--> started to include Adminer as MySQL managing tool into their portfolio of services.

==Features==
* Users log in specifying the destination server and providing the user name and password (which is stored during whole session)
* Basic functions: select [[database]], select/edit tables, browse/insert/edit table rows
* Searching or sorting via multiple columns
* Editing of other database objects: [[view (database)|views]], [[trigger (database)|triggers]], [[event (computing)|event]]s, [[stored procedure]]s, processes, mysql variables, [[user permission]]s
* Text area for arbitrary SQL commands and storing these commands in command history
* Export of databases and tables (its structures and/or data) as a dump to output or a downloadable attachment
* [[User-friendly]] interface (extensive employment of [[JavaScript]])
* Multiple language support (English, German, Spanish, Dutch, French, Italian, Estonian, Chinese, Czech, Slovak, Russian)
* [[SQL]] [[syntax highlighting]]
* Visual database/[[E-R]] schema editing
* [[XHTML]] 1.1 validity in [[UTF-8]]
* Countermeasures against [[XSS]], [[CSRF]], [[SQL injection]], [[session stealing]], …
* "Light-weight" - released in a form of a single file, approx. 160 KiB in size, with support of [[CSS]] skins

The small single file is a result of compilation and minification of source codes. <ref>{{Citation
