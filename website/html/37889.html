'''''Tomida femina''''' ("A swollen woman"; {{IPA-oc|tuˈmiðɔ ˈfeminɔ|}}) is the earliest surviving poem in [[Old Occitan|Occitan]], a sixteen-line charm probably for the use of [[midwives]]. 

It is preserved in the left and bottom margins of a Latin legal treatise in a ninth- or tenth-century manuscript, where it is written upside down.<ref>The manuscript is #201 of the Bibliothèque communautaire et interuniversitaire of [[Clermont-Ferrand]]. The poem is on folio 89v. See Fig. 1 in Paden and Paden, p. 14.</ref> Line 14 is missing, but has been supplied by the editors on the basis of the pattern of final three lines. It has been edited and translated into English by William Doremus Paden and Frances Freeman Paden:

:A swollen woman
:Sat in a swollen road;
:A swollen child
:She held in her lap;
:Swollen hand
:And swollen feet,
:Swollen flesh
:That will take this blow;
:Swollen wood
:And swollen iron
:That will give this blow.
:The pain goes out
:From bone to flesh,
:From flesh to skin,
:From skin to hair,
:From hair to grass;
:Let mother earth receive the pain.<ref>Paden and Paden, p. 16.</ref>

The meaning of the poetic charm, a "[[talking cure]]", is uncertain. Possibly it is intended as a cure for an [[edema]]. The swollen woman of line 1 and the swollen child of line 3 may both be patients, or perhaps only one of them. The charm transfers the swelling from the patient to wood and iron, possibly referring to medical instruments, and thence to the earth. On the other hand, the swollen woman and child "held in her lap" may refer to a [[pregnancy]]. The chanter may be the midwife. The poem's editors note the fittingness of an image of birth at the beginning of [[Occitan literature]].
