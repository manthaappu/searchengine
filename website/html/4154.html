'''Blogger''' is a [[blog]]-[[Weblog software|publishing service]] that allows private or multi-user blogs with time-stamped entries. It was created by [[Pyra Labs]], which was bought by [[Google]] in 2003. Generally, the blogs are hosted by Google at [[subdomain]] of blogspot.com. Up until May 1, 2010 Blogger allowed users to publish blogs on other hosts, via FTP. All such blogs had (or still have) to be moved to Google's own servers, with domains other than blogspot.com allowed via Custom URLs.<ref>http://buzz.blogger.com/2010/01/important-note-to-ftp-users.html</ref>

==History==
On August 23, 1999, Blogger was launched by [[Pyra Labs]]. As one of the earliest dedicated [[Blog_software|blog-publishing tools]], it is credited for helping popularize the format. In February 2003, [[Pyra Labs]] was acquired by [[Google]] under undisclosed terms. The acquisition allowed premium features (for which Pyra had charged) to become free. In October 2004, Pyra Labs' co-founder, [[Evan Williams (blogger)|Evan Williams]], left Google. In 2004, Google purchased [[Picasa]]; it integrated Picasa and its photo sharing utility [[Picasa#Hello|Hello]] into Blogger, allowing users to post photos to their blogs.

On May 9, 2004, Blogger introduced a major redesign, adding features such as [[web standards]]-compliant templates, individual archive pages for posts, comments, and posting by [[email]]. On August 14, 2006, Blogger launched its latest version in [[Development stage#Beta|beta]], codenamed "Invader", alongside the gold release. This migrated users to Google servers and included some new features. In December 2006, this new version of Blogger was taken out of beta. By May 2007, Blogger had completely moved over to Google operated servers. Blogger was ranked 16 on the list of top 50 domains in terms of number of unique visitors in 2007.<ref>[http://blog.compete.com/2007/10/30/top-50-websites-domains-digg-youtube-flickr-facebook/ "Top 50 Domains - www.TheLifeMovie.blogspot.com Ranked by Unique Visitors"”] September, 2007.</ref>

===Redesign===
As part of the Blogger redesign in 2006, all blogs associated with a user's Google Account were migrated to Google servers. Blogger claims that the service is now more reliable because of the quality of the servers.<ref>[http://buzz.blogger.com/2006/12/new-version-of-blogger.html Blogger Buzz: The New Version of Blogger<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Along with the migration to [[List of Google services and tools|Google servers]], several new features were introduced, including label organization, a [[drag-and-drop]] template editing interface, reading permissions (to create private blogs) and new [[Web feed]] options. Furthermore, blogs are updated dynamically, as opposed to rewriting [[HTML]] files.

In a version of the service called Blogger in Draft,<ref>http://draft.blogger.com/</ref> new features are tested before being released to all users. New features are discussed in the service's [http://bloggerindraft.blogspot.com/ official blog].

In September 2009, Google introduced new features into Blogger as part of its tenth anniversary celebration. The features included a new interface for post editing, improved image handling, [[Raw HTML Conversion]], and other [[Google Docs]]-based implementations, including:

* Adding location to posts via [[geotagging]].
* Post time-stamping at publication, not at original creation.
* Vertical re-sizing of the post editor. The size is saved in a per-user, per-blog preference.
* Link editing in Compose mode.
* Full [[Safari (web browser)|Safari 3]] support and fidelity on both [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Mac OS]].
* New Preview dialog that shows posts in a width and font size approximating what is seen in the published view.
* Placeholder image for tags so that embeds are movable in Compose mode.
* New toolbar with Google aesthetics, faster loading time, and "undo" and "redo" buttons. Also added was the full justification button, a strike-through button, and an expanded color palette.

In 2010, Blogger introduced new templates and redesigned its website. The new post editor was criticized for being less reliable than its predecessor.<ref>[http://experimentgarden.blogspot.com/2009/12/critique-and-criticism-of-new-blogger.html Critique and Criticism of the New Blogger Post Editor - Experiment Garden]</ref>

==Integration==

* The [[Google Toolbar]] has a feature called "BlogThis!" which allows toolbar users with Blogger accounts to post links directly to their blogs.
* "Blogger for Word" is an add-in for [[Microsoft Word]] which allows users to save a Microsoft Word Document directly to a Blogger blog, as well as edit their posts both on- and offline. {{As of|2007|01}}, Google says "Blogger for Word is not currently compatible with the new version of Blogger", and they state no decision has been made about supporting it with the new Blogger.<ref>http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=42497&topic=8931</ref> However, [[Microsoft Office 2007]] adds native support for a variety of blogging systems, including Blogger. 
* Blogger supports Google's [[AdSense]] service as a way of generating revenue from running a [[blog]].
* Blogger offers multiple author support, making it possible to establish [[Collaborative blog|group blogs]].
* Blogger offers a template editing feature, which allows users to customize the Blogger template.
* [[Google Docs]] has direct publishing integration to Blogger.
* [[Windows Live Writer]], a standalone app of the [[Windows Live]] suite, publishes directly to Blogger.
