'''why the lucky stiff''' (often known simply as ''why'', ''_why'') is the persona formerly used by an anonymous and prolific writer, cartoonist, musician, artist, and computer programmer notable for his work with the [[Ruby programming language]]. Along with [[Yukihiro Matsumoto]] and [[David Heinemeier Hansson]], he was seen as a key figure in the Ruby community.

Why the lucky stiff was the keynote speaker at ''RailsConf'' in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scribemedia.org/2006/11/25/why-oh-why/ |title=RailsConf Keynote: Why the Lucky Stiff |publisher=Scribemedia.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-24}}</ref> He also had a speaking session titled "A Starry Afternoon, a Sinking Symphony, and the Polo Champ Who Gave It All Up for No Reason Whatsoever" at the 2005 [[O'Reilly Open Source Convention]] held in [[Portland, Oregon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/6948 |title=O'Reilly Open Source Convention 2005 |publisher=Conferences.oreillynet.com |date=2005-08-04 |accessdate=2009-10-24}}</ref> It explored how to teach programming and make it more appealing to [[adolescence|adolescents]].

On 19 August 2009, his online presence was drastically truncated; his accounts on Twitter and GitHub were shut down, along with many of his personally maintained sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.h-online.com/open/why-the-lucky-stiff-Vanishes--/news/114042 |title="why the lucky stiff" Vanishes - The H Open Source: News and Features |publisher=H-online.com |date=2009-08-20 |accessdate=2009-10-24}}</ref> His projects have since been collected and centralized on the whymirror GitHub account.<ref name="whymirror">{{cite web|url=http://whymirror.github.com |title=whymirror.github.com |publisher=whymirror.github.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-24}}</ref>

'''''Try Ruby''''' is an online interactive learning tool that provided a browser-based Ruby [[shell (computing)|shell]] and an instructor that guided beginners through their first steps in Ruby. Since Why's disappearance, the project has been continued in spirit at tryruby.org

His most recent project, ''[[Hackety Hack]]'', is a Ruby- and [[Shoes (GUI toolkit)|Shoes]]- based environment intended to bring the power, freedom, and simplicity of BASIC programming to the current generation, with special intent to be accessible to children.
