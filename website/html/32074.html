'''Richard Errett Smalley''' (June 6, 1943 – October 28, 2005) was the ''Gene and [[Norman Hackerman]] Professor of [[Chemistry]]'' and a Professor of [[Physics]] and [[Astronomy]] at [[Rice University]], in  [[Houston, Texas]]. In 1996, along with [[Robert Curl]], also a professor of chemistry at Rice, and [[Harold Kroto]], a professor at the [[University of Sussex]],  he was awarded the  [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]  for the discovery of a new form of carbon, [[buckminsterfullerene]] ("buckyballs").

==Early life==
Smalley, the youngest of 4 siblings, was born in [[Akron, Ohio]], and grew up in [[Kansas City, Missouri]].

Smalley attended [[Hope College]] before transferring to the [[University of Michigan]] where he received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in 1965. Between his studies, he worked in industry, where he developed his unique managerial style. He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[Princeton University]] in 1973.  He completed postdoctoral work at the [[University of Chicago]], with [[Lennard Wharton]] and [[Donald Levy]], where he was a pioneer in the development of [[supersonic]] beam [[laser spectroscopy]].

==Fullerenes and nanotechnology==
Smalley's research in physical chemistry investigated formation of inorganic and semiconductor clusters using pulsed molecular beams and time of flight [[mass spectrometry]]. As a consequence of this expertise, Robert Curl introduced him to Harry Kroto in order to investigate a question about the constituents of astronomical dust.  These are carbon rich grains expelled by old stars such as R Corona Borealis. The result of this collaboration was the discovery of C<sub>60</sub> and the fullerenes as the third [[allotropy|allotropic]] form of carbon. 

The research that earned Kroto, Smalley and Curl the Nobel Prize mostly comprised three articles.  First was the discovery of C<sub>60</sub> in the Nov. 14, 1985, issue of Nature "C<sub>60</sub>: Buckminsterfullerene". The second article detailed the discovery of the [[endohedral fullerenes]] in "Lanthanum Complexes of Spheroidal Carbon Shells" in the Journal of the American Chemical Society v. 107 p 7779 (1985).  The third announced the discovery of the fullerenes in "Reactivity of Large Carbon Clusters:  Spheroidal Carbon Shells and Their Possible Relevance to the Formation and Morphology of Soot" in the Journal of Physical Chemistry v. 90 p 525 (1986).

Although only three people can be cited for a Nobel Prize, graduate students [[James R. Heath]] and [[Sean C. O'Brien]] participated in the work. Smalley mentions them in his Nobel Lecture. Heath went on to become a professor at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] and O'Brien joined Texas Instruments and is now at MEMtronics.

Following nearly a decade's worth of research into the formation of alternate fullerene compounds (e.g. C<sub>28</sub>, C<sub>70</sub>), as well as the synthesis of endohedral [[metallofullerenes]] (M@C<sub>60</sub>), reports of the identification of carbon nanotube structures led Smalley to begin investigating the iron-catalyzed synthesis of carbon nanotubes. 

As a consequence of these researches, Smalley was able to persuade the administration of Rice University under Malcolm Gillis to create the Rice Center for Nanoscience and Technology (CNST), focusing on any aspect of [[molecular nanotechnology]].

Smalley's latest research was focused on [[carbon nanotubes]], specifically focusing on the [[chemical synthesis]] side of nanotube research. He is well-known for his group's invention of the high-pressure [[carbon monoxide]] (HiPco) method of producing large batches of high-quality nanotubes. Smalley spun off his work into a company, Carbon Nanotechnologies Inc. and associated [[nanotechnology|nanotechnologies]]. 

He was an outspoken critic of the idea of [[molecular assembler]]s, as advocated by [[K. Eric Drexler]] and introduced scientific objections to them. His two main objections, which he had termed the “fat fingers problem" and the "sticky fingers problem”, argued against the feasibility of molecular assemblers being able to precisely select and place individual atoms. He also believed that Drexler’s speculations about apocalyptic dangers of molecular assemblers threaten the public support for development of nanotechnology.  He debated Drexler in an exchange of letters which were published in [[Chemical & Engineering News]] as a point-counterpoint feature.<ref>[http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html Nanotechnology: Drexler and Smalley make the case for and against 'molecular assemblers'] 2003-12-01</ref>

==Later life==
In 1999 Smalley was diagnosed with [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]], which later became [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]].

In his later years, Smalley was very outspoken about the need for cheap, [[clean energy]], which he described as the number one problem facing humanity in the 21st century. He felt that improved science education was key, and went to great lengths to encourage young students to consider careers in science. His slogan for this effort was "Be a scientist, save the world."

Skeptical of [[religion]] in general for most of his life, Smalley became a [[Christian]] shortly before his death. (See the Wikiquote for his personal statement in May 2005.)

In some of his later presentations, he presented a list entitled "Top Ten Problems of Humanity for Next 50 Years".<ref>"Top Ten Problems of Humanity for Next 50 Years", Professor R. E. Smalley, Energy & NanoTechnology Conference, Rice University, May 3, 2003.</ref> His list in order of priority is:
# Energy
# Water
# Food
# Environment
# Poverty
# Terrorism & war
# Disease
# Education
# Democracy
# Population

==Creationism==

At the [[Tuskegee University]]'s 79th Annual Scholarship Convocation/Parents' Recognition Program he made the following statement regarding the subject of evolution while urging his audience to take seriously their role as the higher species on this planet.<ref>[http://www.tuskegee.edu/Global/story.asp?S=2382961 Scholarship Convocation Speaker Challenges Scholars to Serve the Greater Good] 2004-10-03</ref>  “The burden of proof is on those who don't believe that "'Genesis' was right, and there was a creation, and that Creator is still involved.  We are the only species that can destroy the Earth or take care of it and nurture all that live on this very special planet.  I'm urging you to look on these things. For whatever reason, this planet was built specifically for us. Working on this planet is an absolute moral code. ... Let's go out and do what we were put on Earth to do."

Smalley died on October 28, 2005, at [[M.D. Anderson Cancer Center]] in Houston, Texas, at the age of 62.

[[Old Earth creationist]] and [[astronomer]] [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]] spoke at Smalley's funeral, November 2, 2005.
