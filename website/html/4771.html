The '''Business Motivation Model''' (BMM) in [[enterprise architecture]] provides a scheme and structure for developing, communicating, and managing [[business plan]]s in an organized manner. Specifically, the Business Motivation Model does all of the following: 

* identifies factors that motivate the establishing of business plans;
* identifies and defines the elements of business plans; and 
* indicates how all these factors and elements inter-relate. 

Among these elements are those that provide governance for and guidance to the business — Business Policies and Business Rules.

The specification of the Business Motivation Model is maintained by [[Object Management Group]] and is available at http://www.omg.org/spec/BMM/

Other related frameworks are [[POLDAT]] and the[[Zachman Framework]].
