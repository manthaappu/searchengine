'''MATHLAB''' is a [[computer algebra system]] created in 1964 by [[Carl Engelman]] at [[MITRE]] and written in [[LISP]].

"MATHLAB 68" was introduced in 1967<ref>[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/MATHLAB Mathlab 68 started in 1967 on PDP-6]</ref> and became rather popular in university environments running on [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]s [[PDP-6]] and [[PDP-10]] under [[TOPS-10]] or [[TENEX]]. In 1969 this version was included in the [[DECUS]] user group's library (as 10-142) as royalty-free software.

Carl Engelman left MITRE<!--when? can't possibly have been 1968, since Symbolics was only founded a decade later--> for [[Symbolics]] where he contributed his expert knowledge in the development of [[Macsyma]].

===== Features of MATHLAB 68 =====

Abstract from DECUS Library Catalog:
<blockquote>
MATHLAB is an on-line system providing machine aid for the mechanical symbolic processes encountered in analysis. It is capable of performing, automatically and symbolically, such common procedures as simplification, substitution, differentiation, polynomial factorization, indefinite integration, direct and inverse Laplace transforms, the solution of linear differential equations with constant coefficients, the solution of simultaneous linear equations, and the inversion of matrices. It also supplies fairly elaborate bookkeeping facilities appropriate to its on-line operation.
