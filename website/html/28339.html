A '''Pan tilt zoom camera''' ('''PTZ Camera''') is a [[closed-circuit television camera]] with remote directional and zoom control.

==Uses==
The phrase PTZ Camera has two uses within the video security and surveillance products industries.

First, PTZ is an acronym for [[Panning (camera)|pan]], [[Tilt (camera)|tilt]], and [[Zoom lens|zoom]] and may refer merely to features of specific [[surveillance cameras]].  Second, PTZ Cameras may also be used to describe an entire category of cameras where a combination of sound and/or [[motion detector|motion]] and/or change in heat signature may enable the camera to activate, focus and track suspected changes in the video field.

By activating only during times of change, systems can notify human monitors and minimize storage requirements.

In the March 2009 edition of "Security Products" magazine, Keith Jentoft notes the continuing problems organizations have with outdoor PTZ cameras during thunderstorms.  Despite continuing improvements in PTZ software, problems with continual activation during [[thunderstorm]]s have led some organizations to completely disable these types of cameras during the duration of thunderstorms.  This translates to continuing challenges in trying to monitor and protect facilities from [[crime]] and [[terrorism]] during inclement weather.also it has a wide applications the defense organization

==Auto tracking==
A new innovation to the PTZ camera is a built-in firmware program that monitors the change of pixels generated by the video chip in the camera. When the pixels change due to movement within the cameras field of view, the camera can actually focus on the pixel variation and move the camera in an attempt to center the pixel fluctuation on the video chip. This process results in the camera following movement. The program allows the camera to estimate the size of the object which is moving and distance of the movement from the camera. With this estimate the camera can adjust the cameras optical lens in and out in an attempt to stabilize the size of pixel fluctuation as a percentage of total viewing area. Once the movement exits the cameras field of view the camera automatically returns to a pre-programmed or "parked" position until it senses pixel variation and the process starts over again.
