A '''robotic book scanner''' is a machine which is used  to [[book scanning|scan books]], integrating automated components that allow the device to exceed the speed of traditional manual imaging devices such as camera stands. A robotic scanner usually consists of three basic parts: a mechanical device to turn the pages; a cradle or table to hold the book in place, and a camera or imaging sensor to capture images. Images are then automatically shuttled to a central computer repository, where automated processing may take place in order to perform cropping, de-skewing, and other image enhancement functions. During the process, the book remains intact. 

Several high-end commercial robotic scanners use traditional air and suction technology while others take advantage of optical sensor technology to separate and turn pages one at a time.
