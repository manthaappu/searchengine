One typically shorter [[patch cable]] will plug into the front side, whereas the back holds the connection of a much longer and more permanent cable. The assembly of [[hardware]] is arranged so that a number of [[circuit (telecom)|circuit]]s, usually of the same or similar type, appear on jacks for monitoring, interconnecting, and testing circuits in a convenient, flexible manner.

Patch panels offer the [[convenience]] of allowing technicians to quickly change the path of select [[signalling (telecommunication)|signal]]s, without the [[expense]] of dedicated [[switching]] equipment. This was first used by early [[telephone exchanges]], where the [[telephone switchboard]] (a massive array of patch panels) and a large room full of [[telephone operator]]s running it was ubiquitous.

==Uses and connectors==
In recording studios, television and radio broadcast studios, and concert sound reinforcement systems, patchbays are widely used to facilitate the connection of different devices, such as microphones, electric or electronic instruments, effects (e.g. compression, reverb, etc.), recording gear, amplifiers, or broadcasting equipment. Patchbays make it easier to connect different devices in different orders for different projects, because all of the changes can be made at the patchbay. As well, patchbays make it easier to troubleshoot problems such as ground loops; even small home studios and amateur project studios often use patchbays, because it groups all of the input jacks into one location. This means that devices mounted in racks or keyboard instruments can be connected without having to hunt around behind the rack or instrument with a flashlight for the right jack. Using a patchbay also saves wear and tear on the input jacks of studio gear and instruments, because all of the connections are made with the patchbay.

==Normalling==

It is conventional to have the top row of jacks wired at the rear to outputs and bottom row of jacks wired to inputs. Patch bays may be half-normal (usually bottom) or full-normal, "normal" indicating that the top and bottom jacks are connected together internally. When a patch bay has half-normal wiring, then with no patch cord inserted into either jack, the top jack is internally linked to the bottom jack via break contacts on the bottom jack; inserting a patch cord into the top jack will take a feed off that jack whilst retaining the internal link between the two jacks; inserting a patch cord into the bottom jack will break the internal link and replace the signal feed from the top jack with the signal carried on the patch cord. If a patch bay is wired to full-normal, then it includes break contacts in both rows of jacks.

==Switches==

Dedicated switching equipment can be an alternative to patch bays in some applications. Switchers can make  routing as easy as pushing a button, and can provide other benefits over patch bays, including routing a signal to any number of destinations simultaneously.  However, switching equipment that can emulate the capabilities of a given patch bay is much more expensive.  

Example: a 16-point [[S-Video]] patch panel, with 8 patch cables, cost may start at $150.00{{Citation needed|reason=Link to an online store perhaps?  Prices change, and this needs to be verified.|date=July 2009}}, and connect 8 inputs and 8 outputs.  An S-Video matrix routing switcher with the same capability (8x8) would probably cost between $2,000.00 and $4,000.00 new, though it would probably have more capabilities, including [[audio-follow-video]] and built-in [[distribution amplifier]]s. 

There are various types of switchers for audio and video, from simple [[selector switch]]es to sophisticated  [[production switcher]]s. However, emulating or exceeding the capabilities of audio and/or video patch bays requires specialized devices like [[routing switcher]]s and [[matrix router]]s (aka "[[crosspoint switcher]]s").  

Like patch panels, switching equipment for nearly any type of signal is available, including analog and digital video and audio, as well as [[radio frequency|RF]] (cable TV), [[MIDI]], telephone, networking, electrical, and just about anything else.

Switching equipment may be electronic, mechanical, or electro-mechanical. Some switcher hardware can be controlled via computer and/or other external devices.  Some have automated and/or pre-programmed operational capabilities.  There are also software switcher applications used to route signals and control data within a "pure digital" computer environment.

[[Distribution frame]]s are cheaper, but less convenient.
