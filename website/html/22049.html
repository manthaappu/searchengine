<html> <head> <title>List of color palettes</title></head><body>{{Unreferenced|date=February 2008}}

This article is a '''list of the [[palette (computing)|color palette]]s''' for notable [[computer graphics]], [[Computer terminal|terminals]] and [[video game console]] hardware.

Only a sample and the palette's name are given here. More specific articles are linked from the name of each palette, for the test charts, samples, simulated images, and further technical details (including references).

In the past, manufacturers have developed many different display systems in a competitive, non-collaborative basis (with a few exceptions, as the [[VESA]] consortium), creating many proprietary, non-standard different instances of display [[computer hardware|hardware]]. Often, as with early [[personal computer|personal]] and [[home computer]]s, a given machine employed its unique display subsystem, with its also unique color palette. Also, [[Computer software|software]] developers had made use of the color abilities of distinct display systems in many different ways. The result is that there is no single common standard nomenclature or classification taxonomy which can encompass every computer color palette.

In order to organize the material, color palettes have been grouped following arbitrary but rational criteria. First, generic monochrome and full [[RGB]] repertories common to various computer display systems. Second, usual color repertories used for display systems that employ [[indexed color]] techniques. And finally, specific manufacturers' color palettes implemented in many representative early [[personal computer]]s and [[video game console|videogame console]]s of various brands.

The list for personal computer palettes is split into two categories: [[8-bit]] and [[16-bit]] machines. This is not intended as a true strict categorization of such machines, because mixed architectures also exist (16-bit [[Central processing unit|processor]]s with an 8-bit [[Bus (computing)|data bus]] or 32-bit processors with a 16-bit data bus, among others). The distinction is based more on broad 8-bit and 16-bit computer ''ages'' or ''generations'' (around 1975&ndash;1985 and 1985&ndash;1995, respectively) and their associated [[state of the art]] in color display capabilities.

Here is the common color test chart and sample image used to render every palette in this series of articles:

==List of monochrome and RGB palettes==

{{main|List of monochrome and RGB palettes}}

For the purpose of this article, the term ''monochrome palette'' means a set of intensities for a monochrome display, and the term ''RGB palette'' is defined as the complete set of combinations a given [[RGB]] display can offer by mixing all the possible intensities of the red, green, and blue primaries available in its hardware.

These are generic complete repertories of colors to produce black and white and RGB color pictures by the display hardware, not necessarily the total number of such colors that can be simultaneously displayed in a given text or graphic mode of any machine. RGB is the most common method to produce colors for displays; so these complete RGB color repertories have every possible combination of R-G-B triplets within any given maximum number of levels per component.

For specific hardware and different methods to produce colors than [[RGB]], see the [[List of palettes#List of computer hardware palettes|List of computer hardware palettes]] and the [[List of palettes#List of computer hardware palettes|List of videogame consoles]] sections.

For various software arrangements and sorts of colors, including other possible full RGB arrangements within 8-bit [[color depth|depth]] displays, see the [[List of palettes#List of software palettes|List of software palettes]] section.

===Monochrome palettes===

:These palettes only have some shades of gray.

===Regular RGB palettes===

:These full RGB palettes employ the same number of [[bit]]s to store the relative intensity for the red, green and blue components of every image's [[pixel]] color. Thus, they have the same number of levels per channel and the total number of possible colors is always the cube of a power of two.

===Non-regular RGB palettes===

:These are also RGB palettes, in the sense defined above (except for the 4-bit RGBI, which has an intensity bit that affects all channels at once), but either they do not have the same number of levels for each primary channel, or the numbers are not powers of two, so are not represented as separate bit fields.  All of these have been used in popular [[personal computer]]s.

==List of software palettes==

{{main|List of software palettes}}

Systems that use a 4-bit or 8-bit pixel [[Color depth|depth]] can display up to 16 or 256 colors simultaneously. Many [[personal computer]]s in the later 1980s and early 1990s displayed at most 256 different colors, freely selected by [[software]] (either by the user or by a program) from their wider hardware's color palette.

Usual selections of colors in limited subsets (generally 16 or 256) of the full palette includes some RGB level arrangements commomly used with the 8 bpp palettes as ''master palettes'' or ''universal palettes'' (i.e., palettes for multipurpose uses).

These are some representative software palettes, but any selection can be made in such types of systems.

===System specifics===

:These are selections of colors officially employed as system palettes in some popular [[operating system]]s for [[personal computer]]s that features 8-bit displays.

==List of computer hardware palettes==

{{Main|List of 8-bit computer hardware palettes|List of 16-bit computer hardware palettes}}

In early [[personal computer]]s and [[Computer terminal|terminals]] that offered color displays, some color palettes were chosen algorithmically to provide the most diverse set of colors for a given palette size, and others were chosen to assure the availability of certain colors.  In many early home computers, especially when the palette choices were determined at the hardware level by [[resistor]] combinations, the palette was determined by the manufacturer.

Many of early models output [[composite video]] [[YPbPr]] colors. When seen on TV devices, the perception of the colors may not correspond with the value levels for the YPbPr values employed (most noticeable with NTSC TV color system).

For current RGB display systems for [[Personal computer|PC]]'s ([[Super VGA]], etc.), see the [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#16-bit RGB|16-bit RGB]] and [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#24-bit RGB|24-bit RGB]] for [[HighColor]] (''thousands'') and [[TrueColor]] (''millions of colors'') modes.

For [[video game console]]s, see the [[List of palettes#List of videogame consoles palettes|List of videogame consoles]] section.

For every model, their main different graphical color modes are listed based exclusively in the way they handle colors on screen, not all their different screen modes.

The list is ordered roughly historically by video hardware, not grouped by branch. They are listed according to the original model of every system, which implies that enhanced versions, clones and compatibles also support the original palette.
