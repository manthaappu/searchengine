The '''merge window''' is a [[software development process]] which is sometimes used by large projects.

The merge window is a period of time that occurs directly after the release of a new version of the software. During this time, lots of patches are merged and hence have a long time to get scrutinized and tested before the next release.

The [[Linux kernel]] have used the merge window process since July 2005 with the release of version 2.6.14, since then every 2.6.x release has been followed by a two week merge window.

This causes a lot of work for the project maintainers who have to merge all the patches. The process may be slitted up with people who inspect, approve and merge the patches.
