<html> <head> <title>Differential variational inequality</title></head><body>In mathematics, a '''differential variational inequality (DVI)''' is a [[dynamical system]] that incorporates [[ordinary differential equation]]s and [[variational inequality|variational inequalities]] or [[Complementarity theory|complementarity problems]].  DVIs are useful for representing models involving both dynamics and [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] constraints.  Examples of such problems include, for example, mechanical impact problems, [[electrical circuit]]s with ''ideal'' [[diode]]s, [[Coulomb friction]] problems for contacting bodies, and dynamic economic and related problems such as [[dynamic traffic network]]s and networks of queues (where the constraints can either be upper limits on queue length or that the queue length cannot become negative).  DVIs are related to a number of other concepts including [[differential inclusion]]s, [[projected dynamical systems]], [[evolutionary inequalities]], and [[parabolic variational inequalities]].

Differential variational inequalities were first formally introduced by [[Pang]] and [[Stewart]], whose definition should not be confused with the differential variational inequality used in Aubin and Cellina (1984).

Differential variational inequalities have the form to find <math>u(t)\in K</math> such that

: <math>\langle v-u(t), F(t,x(t),u(t))\rangle\geq 0</math>

for every <math>v\in K</math> and almost all ''t''; ''K'' a closed convex set, where

: <math>\frac{dx}{dt}=f(t,x(t),u(t)),\quad x(t_0) = x_0.</math>

Closely associated with DVIs are dynamic/differential complementarity problems: if ''K'' is a closed convex  cone, then the variational inequality is equivalent to the '''complementarity problem''':

: <math>K\ni u(t)\quad\perp\quad F(t,x(t),u(t))\in K^*. \, </math>

==Index==
The concept of the ''index'' of a DVI is important and determines many questions of existence and uniqueness of solutions to a DVI.  This concept is closely related to the concept of index for [[differential algebraic equation]]s (DAE's), which is the number of times the algebraic equations of a DAE must be differentiated in order to obtain a complete system of differential equations for all variables.  For a DVI, the index is the number of differentiations of ''F''(''t'', ''x'', ''u'') = 0 needed in order to locally uniquely identify ''u'' as a function of ''t'' and ''x''.
