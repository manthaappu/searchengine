'''Britney Jean Spears''' (born December 2, 1981) is an American recording artist and entertainer. Born in [[McComb, Mississippi]] and raised in [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], Spears began performing as a child, landing acting roles in stage productions and television shows. She signed with [[Jive Records]] in 1997 and released her debut album ''[[...Baby One More Time]]'' in 1999. During her first decade within the music industry, she became a prominent figure in mainstream popular music and popular culture, followed by a much-publicized personal life. Her first two albums established her as a pop icon and broke sales records, while title tracks "[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]" and "[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]" became international number-one hits. Spears was credited with influencing the revival of [[teen pop]] during the late 1990s.

In 2001, she released her third studio album ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' and expanded her brand, playing the starring role in the film ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]''. She assumed creative control of her fourth studio album, ''[[In the Zone]]'' released in 2003, which yielded chart-topping singles "[[Me Against the Music]]", "[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]" and "[[Everytime]]". After the release of two compilation albums, Spears experienced personal struggles and her career went under hiatus. Her fifth studio album, ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'', was released in 2007 and despite receiving little promotion, it spawned hits "[[Gimme More]]" and "[[Piece of Me]]". In 2008, her erratic behaviour and hospitalizations caused her to be placed in a [[conservatorship]]. The same year, her sixth studio album ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' was released, with the global chart-topping lead single "[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]". After embarking on [[The Circus Starring Britney Spears]], she released greatest hits ''[[The Singles Collection (Britney Spears album)|The Singles Collection]]'', which featured U.S. and Canadian number-one single "[[3 (song)|3]]".

==Biography==
===1981–97: Early life and career beginnings===
Britney Jean Spears was born on December 2, 1981, the second child of [[Lynne Spears|Lynne Irene]] (née Bridges) and James Parnell Spears. She is of [[English American|English]] heritage through her maternal grandmother, who was born in London, and of distant [[Maltese people|Maltese]] descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1056674/EXCLUSIVE-First-photos-Britney-Spears-newly-discovered-British-family.html|title=Exclusive: First photos of Britney Spears' newly-discovered British family | Mail Online|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Daily Mail and General Trust]] |date=2008-09-17|accessdate=2010-06-04|last=Thomas|first=Liz}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=4}}</ref> Her siblings are Bryan James and [[Jamie Lynn Spears|Jamie Lynn]].<ref>{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=211}}</ref> At age three, she started to attend dance lessons in her hometown of [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], and was selected to perform a solo at the annual recital. During her childhood, she also attended [[gymnastics]] and voice lessons, and won many state-level competitions and children's talent shows.<ref>{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=56}}</ref><ref name=rs1>{{cite journal|url=|title=Cover Story: Britney Spears: Britney Spears : Rolling Stone|date=1999-04-15|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]]|accessdate=2010-06-04|last=Daly|first=Steven|issn=0035-791X}}</ref><ref name=foxnews>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195283,00.html|title=Britney Spears' Biography - Celebrity Gossip | Entertainment News | Arts And Entertainment - FOXNews.com|work=[[Fox News Channel]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]] |date=2008-07-31|accessdate=2010-06-06|last=Reporter|first=Staff}}</ref> Spears made her local stage debut at age five, singing "[[What Child Is This?]]" at her [[kindergarten]] graduation. She said about her ambition as a child, "I was in my own world, [...] I found out what I'm supposed to do at an early age".<ref name=rs1/> At age eight, Spears and her mother Lynne traveled to [[Atlanta]] for an audition in the 1990s revival of ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''. Casting director Matt Cassella rejected her for being too young to join the series at the time, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a [[New York City]] talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's vocals and suggested enrolling her at the [[Professional Performing Arts School]]; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York. Spears was hired for her first professional role, as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical ''[[Ruthless!]]''. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show ''[[Star Search]]'', as well as being cast in a number of commercials.<ref>{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=75}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Laufenberg|2005|p=616}}</ref> In December 1992, she was finally cast in ''The Mickey Mouse Club'', but returned to Kentwood after the show was cancelled. She enrolled at [[Parklane Academy]] in nearby [[McComb, Mississippi]]. Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to "the opening scene in ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' with all the [[cliques]]. [...] I was so bored. I was the point guard on the basketball team. I had my boyfriend, and I went to homecoming and Christmas formal. But I wanted more."<ref name=rs1/><ref name=rs2>{{cite journal|url=|title=Cover Story: The Girl Can't Help It : Rolling Stone|date=2000-05-25|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner|accessdate=2010-06-05|last=Mundy|first=Chris|issn=0035-791X}}</ref>

In June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager [[Lou Pearlman]] to join female pop group [[Innosense]]. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer [[Larry Rudolph]] for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a [[Whitney Houston]] karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided he wanted to pitch her to record labels, therefore she needed a professional [[demo (music)|demo]]. He sent Spears an unused song from [[Toni Braxton]]; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a [[Audio engineering|sound engineer]]. Spears travelled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, arguing audiences wanted pop bands such as [[The Backstreet Boys]] and [[The Spice Girls]], and "there wasn't going to be another [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], another [[Debbie Gibson]], or another [[Tiffany (singer)|Tiffany]]." Two weeks later, executives from [[Jive Records]] returned calls to Rudolph.<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=145}}</ref> Senior vice president of [[A&R]] Jeff Fenster stated about Spears's audition that "It's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal. [...] For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'— is extremely important. And Britney had that."<ref name=rs1/> They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from "lower and less poppy" delivery to "distinctively, unmistakably Britney."<ref name="Hughes 2005 147">{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=147}}</ref> After hearing the recorded material, president [[Clive Calder]] ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned "[[Sheryl Crow]] music, but younger more adult contemporary" but felt alright with her label's appointment of producers, since "It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me." She flew to [[Cheiron Studios]] in [[Stockholm, Sweden]], where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers [[Max Martin]], [[Denniz PoP]] and [[Rami Yacoub|Rami]], among others.<ref name=rs1/>

Following her debut, Spears was credited with leading the revival of [[teen pop]] in the late 1990s. ''[[The Daily Yomiuri]]'' reported that "[m]usic critics have hailed her as the most gifted teenage pop idol for many years, but Spears has set her sights a little higher-she is aiming for the level of superstardom that has been achieved by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Janet Jackson]]."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Teen pop idols stage comeback|newspaper=[[The Daily Yomiuri]]|page=1|date=November 25, 1999|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> ''Rolling Stone'' wrote: "Britney Spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock & roll teen queen, the dungaree doll, the angel baby who just has to make a scene."<ref>{{Cite document|title=Oops!...I Did It Again |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/britneyspears/albums/album/321762/review/5941004/oopsi_did_it_again|year=2000|accessdate=October 8, 2009|publisher=[[Rolling Stone Australia]]|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Rami Yacoub who co-produced Spears's debut album with lyricist Max Martin, commented, "I know from [[Denniz Pop]] and Max's previous productions, when we do songs, there's kind of a nasal thing.

"She’s never been a strong vocalist..." writes Raible, "Could she handle these songs with stripped down arrangements and no vocal effects?

David Browne of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' observed "Christina Aguilera may flash skin and belly button, but in her music and manner, she's too eager not to offend — she's a good girl pretending to be bad.

Like other dance-oriented pop stars, it has been widely reported that Spears [[lip-sync]]s in concert. Author Gary Giddins wrote in his book ''Natural selection: Gary Giddins on comedy, film, music, and books'' (2006) that "among many other performers accused of moving their lips while a machine does the labor are Britney Spears, [[Luciano Pavarotti]], Shania Twain, [[Beyoncé Knowles|Beyoncé]], and Madonna."<ref name="Giddins">{{Cite book|last=Giddins|first=Gary|title=Natural selection: Gary Giddins on comedy, film, music, and books|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=288|year=2006|isbn=9780195179514|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Rashod D. Ollison of ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' observes: "Many pop stars ... feel they have no choice but to seek vocal enhancement. Since the advent of MTV and other video music channels, pop audiences have been fed elaborate videos thick with jaw-dropping effects, awesome choreography, fabulous clothes, marvelous bodies. And the same level of perfection is expected to extend beyond the video set to the concert stage. So if Britney Spears, Janet Jackson or Madonna sounds shrill and flat without a backing track, fans won't pay up to $300 for a concert ticket."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Ollison|first=Rashod|title=The pressure to be perfect singing live ; Audiences expect CD-quality sound; Observation|newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|page=1.C|date=October 26, 2004|issn=19308965|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Giddins adds, "it was reported Britney Spears fans prefer her to lip-sync—despite her denials of doing so (contradicted by her own director)—because they expect flawless digitalization when they pay serious money for a concert."<ref name="Giddins"/> In Australia, NSW Fair Trading Minister Virginia Judge has advised disclaimers be printed on any ticket for concerts which contain any prerecorded vocals. She commented: "There could have been some instances where people actually go and purchase a ticket thinking that they're going to have a live performance ... for some people that means that everything is live, it's fresh, it happens instantaneously, it's not something that's been pre-recorded.

Many critics have argued that Spears should not be considered in the same league of talent as Jackson or Madonna. Journalists Erika Montalvo and Jackie Sheppard of the ''[[Rocky Mountain Collegian]]'' observed "[s]ome may argue that Spears is not only a good recording artist but also an important cultural icon."<ref name="UWIRE"/> However, in examining her level of skill as an artist, it is questioned that "[a]lthough she has been classified among female elites such as Janet Jackson and Madonna, what does Ms. Spears really have in common with these divas of rock?"<ref name="UWIRE">{{Cite news|last1=Montalvo|first1=Erika|last2=Sheppard|first2=Jackie|title=CONCERT REVIEW: Pop's princess still reigns ... for now|newspaper=[[Rocky Mountain Collegian]]|publisher=[[UWIRE]]|date=November 16, 2001|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Joan Anderman of the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' remarked that "[t]hirteen costume changes in 90 minutes won't bless her with Madonna's intelligence or cultural barometer. An army of cutting-edge R&B producers won't supply her with Janet Jackson's sense of humor or sincere smile ... Britney's heroes aren't great singers. But they're real singers. Spears sounds robotic, nearly inhuman, on her records, so processed is her voice by digital pitch-shifters and synthesizers."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Anderman|first=Joan|title=BENEATH HER SEXY GROWLS, A GIRLHOOD INTERRUPTED|newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|page=D.1|date=December 7, 2001|issn=07431791|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

Reporter Ed Bumgardner commented her transition from teen pop start to adult sex symbol with her third studio album ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' "takes its cues from two other successful performers—Madonna and Janet Jackson—both of whom she brazenly rips off and both of whom, like Spears, are passable singers, at best."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Bumgardner |first=Ed|title=CONFUSED: WOMAN OR A GIRL? SPEARS CAN'T DECIDE|newspaper=[[Winston-Salem Journal]]|page=1|date=November 9, 2001|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Critic Shane Harrison wrote: "From the minimalist thump and "[[Nasty (song)|Nasty]]" feel of "[[I'm a Slave 4 U]]" to the scattered quotes in "[[Boys (Britney Spears song)|Boys]]", [''Britney''] feels like [Spears's] attempt at '[[Control (Janet Jackson album)|Control]]'."<ref name="shane"/> Citing Jackson's resolve to incorporate personal and social issues into her work and Madonna's ability to constantly redefine the boundaries of socially acceptable material in the industry, Spears's catalog ultimately pales in comparison, because "[w]hile Jackson and Madonna wrote their own music about subjects of importance, [Spears's] music sounds like an upbeat version of either, 'I want to grow up but the media won't let me,' or 'Here kitty, kitty, I'm wearing my underwear outside of my leather pants'-type ballads."<ref name="UWIRE"/> In contrast, Guy Blackman argues that although "no one would argue that Spears is some kind of pioneering pop auteur, there’s still a lot to like about her back catalogue. During her world-conquering peak, she was just about as cutting edge as you could get in the world of global pop superstardom. Spears didn’t just work with big names, she gave big names their names, and maintained her high currency in the world’s most fickle industry for years, when most aspiring starlets are lucky to manage months."<ref name="The Age"/>

Madonna's respect for Spears has also been a subject of observation. Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens, authors of ''Madonna's drowned worlds: new approaches to her cultural transformations, 1983-2003'' (2004) note that the most well known cross-generational relationship exists between Spears and Madonna in which "the entertainment newsmedia almost became obsessed with their relationship of mutual admiration."<ref name="MDW">{{Cite book|last=Hernández|first=Santiago|coauthors=Freya Jarman-Ivens|title=Madonna's drowned worlds: new approaches to her cultural transformations, 1983-2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|page=162|year=2004|isbn=9780754633723|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> The biographers also report "[s]ome observers of popular culture, however, feel that the comparisons between the two artist are meaningless and fail to recognize Madonna's unique contribution: Madonna was never 'just another pop star' whereas Britney can more easily be seen as a standard manufactured pop act."<ref name="MDW"/>

Spears became an international [[pop icon|pop culture icon]] immediately after launching her recording career. ''Rolling Stone'' magazine wrote: "One of the most controversial and successful female vocalists of the 21st century," she "spearheaded the rise of post-millennial teen pop ... Spears early on cultivated a mixture of innocence and experience that broke the bank".<ref>{{cite web | title = Britney Spears: Biography: Rolling Stone | publisher = Rolling Stone | year = 2008 | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/britneyspears/biography | accessdate = August 9, 2008}}</ref> She is listed by the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as having the "Best-selling album by a teenage solo artist" for her debut album ''...Baby One More Time'' which sold over thirteen million copies in the United States.<ref>{{cite book | last = Folkard | first = Claire | title = Guinness World Records 2003 | publisher = Bantam Books | year = 2003 | page = 288 | isbn = 9780553586367}}</ref> Melissa Ruggieri of the ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]'' reported, "She's also marked for being the best-selling teenage artist.

Barbara Ellen of ''[[The Observer]]'' has reported: "Spears is famously one of the 'oldest' teenagers pop has ever produced, almost middle aged in terms of focus and determination. Many 19-year-olds haven't even started working by that age, whereas Britney, a former Mouseketeer, was that most unusual and volatile of American phenomena — a child with a full-time career. While other little girls were putting posters on their walls, Britney was wanting to be the poster on the wall. Whereas other children develop at their own pace, Britney was developing at a pace set by the ferociously competitive American entertainment industry".<ref>{{Cite news |last= Ellen | first=Barbara | title=Comment: Britney Spears: Growing up is hard to do: America's apple- pie cheerleader is feeling the pressure as she tries to break free from her clean teen image.
