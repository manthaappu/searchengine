'''ML''' is a general-purpose [[functional programming language]] developed by [[Robin Milner]] and others in the early 1970s at the [[University of Edinburgh]],<ref name="Gordon1996">{{cite web | last = Gordon | first = Michael J.

Historically, ML stands for ''[[metalanguage]]'': it was conceived to develop proof tactics in the [[LCF theorem prover]] (whose language, ''pplambda'', a combination of the [[first-order predicate calculus]] and the simply typed [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphic]] [[lambda-calculus]], had ML as its metalanguage). It is known for its use of the [[Hindley–Milner type inference algorithm]], which can automatically infer the [[data type|types]] of most [[Expression (programming)|expressions]] without requiring explicit type annotations.

==Overview==
ML is often referred to as an '''impure''' functional language, because it  encapsulate [[side-effect (computer science)|side-effects]], unlike [[purely functional]] programming languages such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]].

Features of ML include a call-by-value [[evaluation strategy]], [[first-class function]]s, automatic memory management through [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], parametric [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]], [[Type_system#Static_typing|static typing]], [[type inference]], [[algebraic data types]], [[pattern matching]], and [[exception handling]].

Unlike Haskell, ML uses [[eager evaluation]], which means that all subexpressions are always evaluated. However, lazy evaluation can be achieved through the use of [[Closure (computer science)|closures]]. Thus one can create and use infinite streams as in Haskell, but their expression is comparatively indirect.

Today there are several languages in the ML family; the two major dialects are [[Standard ML]] (SML) and [[Caml]], but others exist, including [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]]  — a language that Microsoft supports for their .NET platform. Ideas from ML have influenced numerous other languages, like [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[Cyclone programming language|Cyclone]] {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}, and [[Nemerle]].

ML's strengths are mostly applied in language design and manipulation (compilers, analyzers, theorem provers), but it is a general-purpose language also used in bioinformatics, financial systems, and applications including a genealogical database, a peer-to-peer client/server program, etc.

ML uses static scoping rules.

==Examples==

The following examples use the syntax of [[Standard ML]]. The other most widely-used ML dialect, [[OCaml]], differs, in these simple examples, in various insubstantial ways.

===Factorial===
The [[factorial]] function expressed as pure ML:

<source lang="ocaml">
fun fac (0 : int) : int = 1
  | fac (n : int) : int = n * fac (n - 1)
</source>

This describes the factorial as a recursive function, with a single terminating base case. It is similar to the descriptions of factorials found in mathematics textbooks. Much of ML code is similar to mathematics in facility and syntax.

Part of the definition shown is optional, and describes the ''types'' of this function. The notation E : t can be read as ''expression E has type t''. For instance, the argument n is assigned type ''integer'' (int), and fac (n : int), the result of applying fac to the integer n, also has type integer. The function fac as a whole then has type ''function from integer to integer'' (int -> int). Thanks to [[type inference]], the type annotations can be omitted and will be derived by the compiler. Rewritten without the type annotations, the example looks like:

<source lang="ocaml">
fun fac 0 = 1
  | fac n = n * fac (n - 1)
</source>

The function also relies on [[pattern matching]], an important part of ML programming. Note that parameters of a function are not necessarily in parentheses but separated by spaces. When the function's argument is 0 (zero) it will return the integer 1 (one). For all other cases the second line is tried. This is the [[recursion]], and executes the function again until the base case is reached.

This implementation of the factorial function is not guaranteed to terminate, since a negative argument causes an [[infinite descending chain]] of recursive calls. A more robust implementation would check for a nonnegative argument before recursing, as follows:

<source lang="ocaml">
fun fact n = let
  fun fac 0 = 1
    | fac n = n * fac (n - 1)
  in
    if (n < 0) then raise Fail "negative argument"
    else fac n
  end
</source>

The problematic case (when n is negative) demonstrates a use of ML's [[exception]] system.

The function can be improved further by writing its inner loop in a [[tail-recursive]] style, such that the [[stack]] need not grow in proportion to the number of function calls. This is achieved by adding an extra, "accumulator", parameter to the inner function. At last, we arrive at

<source lang="ocaml">
fun factorial n = let
  fun fac (0, acc) = acc
    | fac (n, acc) = fac (n - 1, n*acc)
  in
    if (n < 0) then raise Fail "negative argument"
    else fac (n, 1)
  end
</source>

===List Reverse===

The following function "reverses" the elements in a list. More precisely, it returns a new list whose elements are in reverse order compared to the given list.

<source lang="ocaml">
fun reverse [] = []
  | reverse (x::xs) = (reverse xs) @ [x]
</source>

This implementation of reverse, while correct and clear, is inefficient, requiring [[quadratic time]] for execution. The function can be rewritten to execute in [[linear time]] in the following more efficient, though less easy-to-read, style:

<source lang="ocaml">
fun reverse xs = let
  fun rev nil acc = acc
    | rev (hd::tl) acc = rev tl (hd::acc)
in
  rev xs nil
end
</source>

Notably, this function is an example of [[parametric polymorphism]]. That is, it can consume lists whose elements have any type, and return lists of the same type.
