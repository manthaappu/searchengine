<html> <head> <title>Differential inheritance</title></head><body>'''Differential Inheritance''' is a common [[inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]] model used by [[Prototype-based programming|prototype-based]] programming languages such as [[JavaScript]], [[Io programming language|Io]] and [[NewtonScript]]. It operates on the principle that most objects are derived from other, more general objects, and only differ in a few small aspects; while usually maintaining a list of pointers internally to other objects which the object differs from.

==An Analogy==
To think of differential inheritance, you think in terms of what is different. So for instance, when trying to describe to someone how [[Dumbo]] looks, you could tell them in terms of elephants: ''Think of an elephant. Now Dumbo is a lot shorter, has big ears, no tusks, a little pink bow and can fly.'' Using this method, you don't need to go on and on about what makes up an elephant, you only need to describe the differences; anything not explicitly different can be safely assumed to be the same.
