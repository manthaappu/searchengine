<html> <head> <title>Thin-film memory</title></head><body>'''Thin-film memory''' is a high-speed variation of [[core memory]] developed by [[UNIVAC|Sperry Rand]] in a government-funded research project.

Instead of threading individual [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] cores on wires, thin-film memory consisted of 4 micrometre thick dots of [[permalloy]], an [[iron]]-[[nickel]] alloy, deposited on small glass plates by vacuum evaporation techniques and a mask. The drive and sense lines were then added using [[printed circuit]] wiring over the alloy dots. This provided very fast access times in the range of 670 nanoseconds, but was very expensive to produce.

In 1962, the [[UNIVAC 1107]], intended for the civilian marketplace, used thin-film memory only for its 128-word general register stack. [[Military computer]]s, where cost was less of a concern, used larger amounts of thin-film memory. Thin film was also used in a number of high-speed computer projects, including the high-end of the [[IBM]] [[System/360]] line, but general advances in core tended to keep pace.
