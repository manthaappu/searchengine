'''StatCVS''' is an [[open source]] program written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] that generates graphical [[report]]s about [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] modules. It reveals, for example, which developer has made the most check-ins to the repository, and plots the development of the [[lines of code]] (LOC) of the entire module and individual folders over time.

StatCVS uses [[JFreeChart]] to generate charts. It is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]].

[[StatSVN]] is an extension to StatCVS that generates the same reports but for the activity of a [[Subversion (software)|Subversion]] repository.
