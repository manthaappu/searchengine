<html> <head> <title>Xia Li</title></head><body>'''Xia Li''' is a scientist based at the [[Monell Chemical Senses Center]] in [[Philadelphia]]. She is known for her work on feline sensory studies, including groundbreaking research as to why [[cat]]s cannot [[taste]] sweets. She, along with her collaborator Dr. [[Joseph Brand]], concluded that modern cats have lost function in an obsolete [[taste receptor]], removing the ability taste sweets, unlike their prehistoric ancestors. Her accomplishments were featured in the inaugural issue of [[PLoS Genetics]] and in the December 2005 issue of [[Catnip Magazine]].
