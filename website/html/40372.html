<html> <head> <title>Winqual</title></head><body>'''Windows Quality Online Services''' ('''Winqual''') is a free [[Microsoft]] service provided to software developers who produce software for [[Microsoft Windows]] to receive reports triggered by their software in user's computers. Integral parts of Winqual are [[Windows Error Reporting]] (WER) and the ''Application Recovery'' API. Windows Error Reporting gives Winqual access to [[end-user]] crash and hang data of applications that fail in Windows platforms, from end-users who agree to report it.

Microsoft requires that interested vendors obtain a [[VeriSign]] Class 3 Digital ID. This Digital ID is a special kind of Digital Certificate used by organizations to digitally sign code (a form of unique identification, also known as a code signing SSL certificate).  <ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/isv/bb190483.aspx Introducing Windows Error Reporting]</ref><ref>[http://www.idevelopsoftware.com/2008/03/winqual-registration-head-aches/ WinQual Registration Head Aches]</ref><ref>[http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1032285 Microsoft Support Forum: WER with Thawte authenticode signed app]</ref><ref>[http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/10/449865.aspx The Old New Thing: How can a company get access to Windows Error Reporting data?]</ref><ref>[http://successfulsoftware.net/2008/02/27/the-great-digital-certificate-ripoff/ The great digital certificate ripoff?]</ref>

Software and hardware manufacturers can link error signatures to Windows Error Reporting Responses. This allows distributing solutions as well as collecting extra information from customers (such as reproducing the steps they took before the crash) and providing them with support links.

The ability to report crash and hang data from Windows Platforms was first introduced in [[Windows XP]] and has been significantly improved{{Fact|date=January 2009}} in [[Windows Vista]] with features such as [[Problem Reports and Solutions]] which is a [[Control Panel]] user interface allowing users to check the status of their crashes and personalized solution views.
