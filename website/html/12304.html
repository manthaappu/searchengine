An '''enumerative definition''' of a concept or term is a special type of [[extensional definition]] that gives an explicit and exhaustive listing of all the [[object (philosophy)|object]]s that fall under the concept or term in question.  Enumerative definitions are only possible for finite sets and only practical for relatively small sets.
