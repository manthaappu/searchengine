'''Harassment by computer''' is a crime in several U.S. states (see [[computer crime]]). It is distinct from [[stalking]] in that stalking typically requires two or more contacts, whereas harassment by computer may be a single incident. It is also different from regular [[harassment]], because the offense typically encompasses a range of crimes that would not be considered harassment if conducted in person.

[[Connecticut]] was the first state to pass a statute making it a criminal offense to harass someone by computer. [[Michigan]], [[Arizona]], and [[Virginia]] have also passed laws banning harassment by electronic means<ref>[http://www.nerac.com/family/NeracReports/Cybercrimes_CT.htm ]{{Dead link|date=November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+18.2-152.7C1 |title=Section 18.2-152.7:1 |work=Code of Virginia |publisher=Legislative Information System of Virginia |date= |accessdate=2008-11-27}}</ref>

Harassment by computer statutes are typically distinct from cyberbullying laws, in that the former usually relate to a person's "use a computer or computer network to communicate obscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, or indecent language, or make any suggestion or proposal of an obscene nature, or threaten any illegal or immoral act," while the latter need not involve anything of a sexual nature.
