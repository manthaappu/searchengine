'''Open Publication''' is not associated with the [[Open Publication License]], despite the similarity in their names, but the two are related in the sense that they encourage openness in published content.  Open Publication is not a license.  Open publication can utilize a number of established licenses which include the [[Creative Commons]] licenses, the [[GNU Free Documentation License]], the [[Free Art License]], and even the [[Open Content License]].

Open Publication is a simple agreement between an author or artist and the public that establishes a protocol by which the author can profit from his/her work and also transfer rights of a work to the public.

== The Niche of Open Publication ==

Open Publishing gives users the ability to use, copy, and distribute a work for free.   However, the author initially restricts the rights of his or her audience from (1) the freedom to change or adapt the work and (2) the freedom to release the improvements.  The author wants the opportunity to make money prior to granting adaptation rights.

The author sets up a [[E-Payment Providers|payment system]] so users can make contributions if they enjoyed the work.  When a set value of payments has been received, the author will release the work under a licenses which gives users the freedom to adapt and release derivatives (whether they be in song, art, film, or written derivatives).

Thus, Open Publication is concept where a "free" work is designed to become "more free" after the artist is satisfactorily compensated for the effort that he or she put into creating the work.
