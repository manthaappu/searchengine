The '''Free Software Foundation''' ('''FSF''') is a [[non-profit corporation]] founded by [[Richard Stallman]] on 4 October 1985 to support the [[free software movement]], a [[copyleft]]-based movement which aims to promote the universal freedom to create, distribute and modify [[computer software]]. The FSF is incorporated in [[Massachusetts]], [[United States|USA]].<ref name="FSF MACorpRegistry">{{cite web|url=http://corp.sec.state.ma.us/corp/corpsearch/CorpSearchSummary.asp?ReadFromDB=True&UpdateAllowed=&FEIN=042888848|title=FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION, INC. Summary Screen | publisher=The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Secretary of the Commonwealth, Corporations Division|accessdate=2009-04-06}}</ref>

From its founding until the mid-1990s, FSF's funds were mostly used to employ software developers to write [[free software]] for the [[GNU Project]]. Since the mid-1990s, the FSF's employees and volunteers have mostly worked on legal and structural issues for the free software movement and the [[free software community]].

Consistent with its goals, only [[free software]] is used on FSF's computers.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/linux-gnu-freedom.html | title = Linux, GNU, and freedom | accessdate = 2006-12-10 | author = Stallman, Richard M. | authorlink = Richard Stallman | year = 2002 | work = Philosophy of the GNU Project | publisher = GNU Project }}</ref>

== GPL enforcement ==

The FSF holds the copyrights on various essential pieces of the [[GNU]] system, such as [[GNU Compiler Collection]]. As copyright holder, it has exclusive authority to enforce the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) when [[copyright infringement]] occurs on that software. While other copyright holders of other software systems adopted the GPL as their license, FSF was the only organization to regularly assert its copyright interests on software so licensed until [[Harald Welte]] launched [[gpl-violations.org]] in 2004.

From 1991 until 2001, GPL enforcement was done informally, usually by Stallman himself, often with assistance from FSF's lawyer, [[Eben Moglen]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Typically, GPL violations during this time were cleared up by short email exchanges between Stallman and the violator.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In late 2001, [[Bradley M. Kuhn]] (then Executive Director), with the assistance of Moglen, David Turner, and [[Peter T. Brown]], formalized these efforts into FSF's GPL Compliance Labs. From 2002-2004, high profile GPL enforcement cases, such as those against [[Linksys]] and [[OpenTV]], became frequent.<ref>{{cite web | last = Meeker | first = Heather | title = The Legend of Linksys | date=  2005-06-28 | url = http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/qECCd2x743n32T/The-Legend-of-Linksys.xhtml | accessdate = 2007-08-11}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last =  Gillmor  | first = Dan | title = GPL Legal Battle Coming? | publisher = SiliconValley.com (a division of the [[San Jose Mercury News]]) | date=  2003-05-21 | url = http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001029.shtml  | accessdate = 2007-08-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20030524174013/http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001029.shtml |archivedate = 2003-05-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last =  Turner | first = David | coauthors = [[Bradley M.

GPL enforcement and educational campaigns on GPL compliance was a major focus of the FSF's efforts during this period.<ref>{{cite web | last = Kennedy | first = Dennis | date=  2004-01-11 | title = A Great Learning Opportunity for Software Lawyers — Upcoming GPL Seminar | url = http://www.denniskennedy.com/blog/2004/01/a_great_learning_opportunity_f.html | accessdate = 2007-08-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928125310/http://www.denniskennedy.com/blog/2004/01/a_great_learning_opportunity_f.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/18/1835252 | publisher= [[Slashdot]] | last = Lord | first = Timothy | date=  2003-07-18 | accessdate = 2007-08-11 | title =  Seminar On Details Of The GPL And Related Licenses}}</ref>

In December 2008 FSF filed a lawsuit against [[Cisco]] for using GPL-licensed components shipped with [[Linksys]] products. Cisco was notified of the licensing issue in 2003 but Cisco repeatedly disregarded its obligations under the GPL.<ref>{{cite web | last =  Paul | first = Ryan | title = Free Software Foundation lawsuit against Cisco a first | date = 2007-12-13 | publisher = [[Arstechnica.com]] | url = http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081211-free-software-foundation-lawsuit-against-cisco-a-first.html | accessdate = 2008-12-11}}</ref> In May 2009 FSF dropped the lawsuit when Cisco agreed to make a monetary donation to the FSF and appoint a Free Software Director to conduct continuous reviews of the company's license compliance practices.<ref>{{cite web | last =  Paul | first = Ryan | title = Cisco settles FSF GPL lawsuit, appoints compliance officer | date = 2009-05-21 | publisher = [[Arstechnica.com]] | url = http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/05/cisco-settles-fsf-gpl-lawsuit-appoints-compliance-officer.ars | accessdate = 2009-10-06}}</ref>

From 2003 to 2005, FSF held legal seminars to explain the GPL and the law around it.<ref>{{cite web | title =  Seminar On Details Of The GPL And Related Licenses | url = http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/18/1835252 | accessdate = 2008-07-04 | date = 2003-07-18}}</ref>  Usually taught by [[Bradley M.

== Current and ongoing activities ==

; The [[GNU project]]: The original purpose of the FSF was to promote the ideals of free software. The organization developed the [[GNU]] operating system as an example of this.
; GNU licenses: The [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) is a widely used license for free software projects. The current version (version 3) was released in June 2007. The FSF has also published the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] (LGPL), the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] (GFDL), and the [[GNU Affero General Public License]] (AGPL).
; GNU Press: The FSF's publishing department, responsible for "publishing affordable books on computer science using freely distributable licenses."<ref>[http://shop.fsf.org/category/books/ List of books published] in GNU Press home site</ref>
; The [[Free Software Directory]] : This is a listing of software packages which have been verified as free software. Each package entry contains 47 pieces of information such as the project's homepage, developers, programming language, etc. The goals are to provide a search engine for free software, and to provide a cross-reference for users to check if a package has been verified as being free software. FSF has received a small amount of funding from [[UNESCO]] for this project. It is hoped that the directory can be translated into many languages in the future{{By whom|date=May 2010}}.
; Maintaining the [[Free Software Definition]] : FSF maintains many of the documents that define the free software movement.
; Project hosting: FSF hosts software development projects on their [[GNU Savannah|Savannah]] website.
; [[Political campaign]]s : FSF sponsors a number of campaigns against what it perceives as dangers to software freedom, including [[software patent]]s, [[digital rights management]] (which the FSF has re-termed "digital restrictions management", as part of their effort to highlight their view that such technologies are "designed to take away and limit your rights,"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/drm.html |title=Digital Restrictions Management and Treacherous Computing |date=September 18, 2006 |accessdate=2007-12-17 |publisher=Free Software Foundation }}</ref>) and user interface copyright. [[Defective by Design]] is an FSF-initiated campaign against DRM. They also have a campaign to promote [[Ogg]]+[[Vorbis]], a free alternative to [[proprietary formats]] like [[MP3]] and [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]]. They also sponsor some free software projects that are deemed to be "high-priority".
; Annual awards: "[[Award for the Advancement of Free Software]]" and "[[Free Software Award for Projects of Social Benefit]]"

== High priority projects ==
[[File:GNewSense screenshot.png|thumb|300px|[[gNewSense]] is a distribution officially supported by the ''FSF'']]

The FSF maintains a list of "high priority projects" to which the Foundation claims that "''there is a vital need to draw the [[free software community]]'s attention''".<ref name="highpriority">{{cite web| url=http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority.html |title=High Priority Free Software Projects|accessdate=January 4, 2009 |publisher=Free Software Foundation |authorlink=Free Software Foundation}}</ref> The FSF considers these projects "''important because computer users are continually being seduced into using [[non-free software]], because there is no adequate free replacement.''"<ref name="highpriority" />

Previous projects highlighted as needing work included the [[Free Java implementations]], [[GNU Classpath]], and [[GNU Compiler for Java]], which ensure compatibility for the Java part of [[OpenOffice.org]], and the [[GNOME]] desktop environment (see [[Java (Sun)#Licensing|Java: Licensing]]).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The FSF Board of Directors is elected by the Voting Membership, whose powers include at least this are outlined in the by-laws:<ref>{{cite web | authorlink = http://www.sec.state.ma.us/cor/coridx.htm | title = Articles of Amendment | publisher = The Commonwealth of Massachusetts | date=  2002-12-18 | url = http://corp.sec.state.ma.us/corp/corpsearch/display_pdf.asp?CORP_DRIVE1/2002/1218/000000000/9228/200228190510_1.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2008-07-04 }}</ref> {{quote|In addition to the right to elect Directors as provided in the by-laws and such other powers and rights as may be vested in them by law, these Articles of Organization or the by-laws, the Voting Members shall have such other powers and rights as the Directors may designate.|Articles of Amendment|Free Software Foundation, Inc.}}

There are currently no known documents available that indicate the composition of the FSF's Voting Membership.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

At any given time, there are usually around a dozen employees.<ref>{{cite web | authorlink = http://www.fsf.org/about/staff | title = Meet the staff of the Free Software Foundation }}</ref>  Most, but not all, work at the FSF headquarters in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite web | authorlink = http://www.sec.state.ma.us/cor/coridx.htm | title = Certificate of Change of Principal Office | publisher = The Commonwealth of Massachusetts | date=  2005-05-26 | url = http://corp.sec.state.ma.us/corp/corpsearch/display_pdf.asp?CORP_DRIVE1/2005/0526/000000000/4122/200516698270_1.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2008-07-04 }}</ref>

[[Eben Moglen]] and [[Dan Ravicher]] previously served individually as [[pro bono]] legal counsel to the FSF. Since the forming of the [[Software Freedom Law Center]], legal services to the FSF are provided by that organization.

On November 25, 2002, the FSF launched the FSF Associate Membership program for individuals.<ref>The site member.fsf.org first appears in the Internet Archive in  December 2002, and that site lists the date of the launch as 25 November 2002. {{cite web | title = FSF Membership Page, as of 2002-12-20 | publisher = The Internet Archive | date=  2002-12-20 | url = http://member.fsf.org/  | accessdate = 2007-08-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20021220112452/http://member.fsf.org/ |archivedate = 2002-12-20}}</ref> [[Bradley M.

== SCO lawsuit ==
In March 2003, [[SCO v. IBM|SCO filed suit against IBM]] alleging that IBM's contributions to various [[free software]], including FSF's [[GNU]], violated SCO's rights. While FSF was never a party to the lawsuit, FSF was [[subpoena]]ed on November 5, 2003.<ref>{{cite web | last = Heise | first = Mark | title = SCO Subpoena of FSF | publisher = Free Software Foundation | date=  2003-11-05 | url = http://www.fsf.org/licensing/sco/sco-subpoena.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-08-11}}</ref> During 2003 and 2004, FSF put substantial advocacy effort into responding to the lawsuit and quelling its negative impact on the adoption and promotion of free software.<ref>{{cite web | last = Kuhn | first = Bradley | authorlink = Bradley M.

== Criticism ==
On May 2, 2010, Ed Bott of [[ZDNet]] noted that the FSF made several factual errors on the front page of their PlayOgg campaign and accused the author of deliberately attempting to misinform.<ref>{{cite web   | authorlink = http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/ogg-versus-the-world-dont-fall-for-open-source-fud/2086 | title = Ogg versus the world: Don't fall for open-source FUD.| accessdate = 2010-06-22 | url = http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/ogg-versus-the-world-dont-fall-for-open-source-fud/2086}}</ref> The errors include the patent nature of the [[ogg]] format, the details of the [[Alcatel-Lucent#Alcatel-Lucent_v._Microsoft|Alcatel-Lucent versus Microsoft lawsuit]], and the accusation that proprietary software players and formats "spy" on users.

On July 22, 2009, Christopher Smart of [[Linux Magazine]] interviewed [[Linus Torvalds]] in response to Microsoft submitting code for the [[Linux kernel]]. Torvalds was quoted as saying that he does not want to be associated with "free software" and criticized the movement for having "extremists".<ref>{{cite web | authorlink = http://www.linux-mag.com/cache/7439/1.html | title = Microsoft Patches Linux; Linus Responds | accessdate = 2010-06-26 | url = http://www.linux-mag.com/cache/7439/1.html}}</ref>

Torvalds had previously criticized Stallman and the enforcement of GPL in a posting on the Linux Kernel forum in October, 2004.<ref>{{cite web | authorlink = http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0410.3/1101.html | title = Linux-Kernel Archive:Re: BK kernel workflow | accessdate = 2010-06-26 | url = http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0410.3/1101.html}}</ref>

On June 16, 2010, Joe Brockmeier (another journalist of Linux Magazine) criticized the practices of the FSF, calling their campaigns, such as [[Defective by Design]], "negative" and "juvenile" and not being adequate for providing users with "credible alternatives" to proprietary software.<ref>{{cite web | authorlink = http://www.linux-mag.com/cache/7806/1.html | title = The Party of Gno.| accessdate = 2010-06-22 | url = http://www.linux-mag.com/cache/7806/1.html}}</ref>
