'''Boss Film Studios''' was founded by visual effects veteran [[Richard Edlund]] after his departure from [[Industrial Light & Magic|Industrial Light and Magic]], producing visual effects for over thirty films from 1983 to 1997.<ref>http://www.oscars.org/79academyawards/scitech/bonner.html</ref> Edlund had worked at ILM on such films as [[Raiders of the Lost Ark]] and the original [[Star Wars]] trilogy. 

==History==
Boss Film Studios (originally Boss Film Corporation) initially undertook two projects, ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' and [[2010 (film)|2010]], simultaneously.  In an effort to get the new venture set up quickly, Edlund acquired [[Douglas Trumbull]]'s Entertainment Effects Group, taking over their Marina Del Rey facility.  

===Competition with ILM===
Boss Film soon established itself as one of the largest competitors to ILM contributing to such projects as ''[[Die Hard]]'', ''[[Poltergeist (film series)|Poltergeist II]]'', and ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]''.

Edlund and his team chose to compete with ILM technically, continuing EEG's preference for using [[70 mm film|65mm]] film for the creation of their optical effects work.  This provided potentially cleaner effects than ILM's [[Vistavision|VistaVision]] format due to its much larger negative area.

===Boss Game Studios===
Boss Film branched out into video game production through sister company [[Boss Game Studios]].  Boss Film also operated a commercial production company producing many television spots for products including Budweiser, Dodge, United Airlines and DHL.

===Closure===
Boss Film announced it was closing its doors on August 26, 1997 citing the difficulties of sustaining an independent effects house within the competitive environment at the time.

Nominated for Best Visual Effects Academy Award 1987 for Poltergeist II.  The named nominees were Richard Edlund; John Bruno; Garry Waller; and Bill Neil.

Nominated for Best Visual Effects Academy Award in 1985 for [[2010 (film)|2010]] (Richard Edlund; Neil Krepela; George Jenson; Mark Stetson) and [[Ghostbusters]] (Richard Edlund; John Bruno; Mark Vargo; Chuck Gaspar).
