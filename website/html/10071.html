'''DesktopX''' is a [[shareware]] desktop enhancement program that allows users to build their own custom desktops. Amongst its features is a complete [[widget engine]] for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] as well as a desktop object system.  User creations can be exported as .desktop files or as widgets. The program is distributed with [[Object Desktop]] as well as stand-alone.

DesktopX was released by [[Alberto Riccio]] in 1999 as VDE ([[Verona]] Desktop Enhancer), and bought in 2000 by [[Stardock]]. Mini-applications created with it were called "object packs" but later rebranded as "widgets" to standardize the term.

Most users used DesktopX to build alternative desktop environments. The mini-application creation ability was there from the start but did not gain widespread use until the release of ''DesktopX 2'' in 2003. Current versions run on [[Windows 2000]] and above.

==Overview==
DesktopX supports the creation of three different types of widgets:
*''objects''; loaded into a running DesktopX environment.
*''widgets''; groups of objects packaged into executables that require DesktopX (equivalent to [[Yahoo! Widget Engine]] widgets).
*''gadgets''; totally standalone widgets provided as applications.

Objects may be controlled by [[Scripting programming language|script]]s written in either [[VBScript]] or [[JScript]], although they are not always required.

Many common actions are provided for as in-built object functions, such as:
* running a [[computer program|program]].
* displaying a [[menu (computing)|menu]] containing the contents of a [[folder]].
* emptying the ''Recycle Bin''.

Similarly, animation, sound and variation depending on the object's state (for example, mouseover or clicking) can be modified without scripting.

DesktopX [[plugin]]s also avoid the need for scripting common tasks, by offering extra functionality such as [[media player (application software)|media player]] displays and controls (currently available for [[iTunes]], [[Winamp]], [[CoolPlayer]], an internal version of [[Windows Media Player]] and Stardock's own ''ObjectMedia'') and access to [[Windows Management Instrumentation]].

As users often wish to have a uniform desktop style, a common practice is to create several widgets as a coherent ''theme''. A few popular artists sell themes in the [[WinCustomize]] [http://www.wincustomize.com/store/ store].

As of 2010 there are three main standalone divisions of DesktopX:
*'''DesktopX Client''', which allows the use of desktops, objects and widgets.
*'''DesktopX Standard''', which includes the ''DesktopX Builder'' that creates objects and widgets as well as desktops.
*'''DesktopX Pro''', which allows the creation of gadgets that may be sold as separate applications or used to promote a website.

DesktopX Standard may also be obtained as part of an [[Object Desktop]] subscription. Corporations may purchase '''DesktopX Enterprise''', allowing the creation of secure desktops.

== Gadgets ==
In 2003, Stardock released DesktopX 2 Pro, which allowed developers to export their creations as stand-alone programs called "gadgets". This feature was enhanced with DesktopX 3 and the price on DesktopX Pro lowered to make it more mainstream.
