<html> <head> <title>Analog Protection System</title></head><body>The '''Analog Protection System''' (APS), also known as '''Copyguard''', is a [[DVD]] copy prevention system originally developed by [[Macrovision]]. Video tapes copied from [[DVD]]s encoded with APS become garbled and unwatchable. The process works by adding pulses to analog video signals to negatively impact the [[automatic gain control|AGC]] circuit of a recording device.  In digital devices changes to the analog [[video signal]] are created by a chip that converts the digital video to analog within the device.  In [[DVD player]]s trigger bits are created during [[DVD authoring]] to inform the APS that it should be applied to DVD players analog outputs or analog video outputs on a [[personal computer|PC]] while playing back a protected DVD-Video disc. In [[set top box]]es trigger bits are incorporated into [[Conditional Access Entitlement Control Message]]s (ECM) in the stream delivered to the STB. In VHS alterations to the analog video signal are added in a [[Macrovision]]-provided “processor box” used by duplicators.

APS can be also signaled digitally, in the [[CGMS-A]] bit field sent in the [[vertical blanking interval]].
