<html> <head> <title>Enterprise Information Integration</title></head><body>'''Enterprise Information Integration''' or '''EII''', is a process of [[information integration]], using [[data abstraction]] to provide a single interface (known as [[uniform data access]]) for viewing all the data within an organization, and a single set of structures and naming conventions (known as [[uniform information representation]]) to represent this data; the goal of EII is to get a large set of [[heterogeneous]] data sources to appear to a user or system as a single, homogeneous data source.

== Overview ==
[[Data]] within an [[Enterprise architecture|enterprise]] can be stored in various formats, including [[relational database]]s (which themselves come in a large number of varieties), text files, [[XML]] files, [[spreadsheet]]s and a variety of proprietary [[data storage device|storage]] methods, each with their own [[index (information technology)|indexing]] and [[data access]] methods.

Standardized data access [[application programming interface|API]]s have emerged, that offer a specific set of commands to retrieve and modify data from a generic data source. Many applications exist that implement these APIs' commands across various data sources, most notably relational databases. Such APIs include [[ODBC]], [[JDBC]], [[OLE DB]], and more recently [[ADO.NET]]. 

There are also standard formats for representing data within a file, that are very important to information integration. The best-known of these is [[XML]], which has emerged as a standard universal representation format. There are also more specific XML "grammars" defined for specific types of data, such as [[Geography Markup Language]] for expressing geographical features, and [[Directory Service Markup Language]], for holding directory-style information. In addition, non-XML standard formats exist, such as [[iCalendar]], for representing calendar information, and [[vCard]], for [[business card]] information.

Enterprise Information Integration (EII) applies data integration commercially.  Despite the theoretical problems described above, the private sector shows more concern with the problems of data integration as a viable product.<ref name="refthree">{{cite conference | author=Alon Y. Halevy et al. | title=Enterprise information integration: successes, challenges and controversies | booktitle=SIGMOD 2005 | year=2005 | pages=778–787 | url=http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/alon/files/eiisigmod05.pdf}}</ref>
EII emphasizes neither on correctness nor tractability, but speed and simplicity. An EII industry has emerged, but many professionals{{Who|date=June 2009}} believe it does not perform to its full potential.  Practitioners cite the following major issues which  EII must address for the industry to become mature:{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

; simplicity of understanding : Answering queries with views arouses interest from a theoretical standpoint, but difficulties in understanding how to incorporate it as an "enterprise solution".{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}  Some developers{{Who|date=June 2009}} believe it should be merged with [[Enterprise application integration|EAI]].  Others{{Who|date=June 2009}} believe it should be incorporated with [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] systems, citing customers' confusion over the differences between the two services.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
; simplicity of deployment : Even if recognized as a solution to a problem, EII {{as of | 2009 | lc = on}}currently takes time to apply and offers complexities in deployment.  People have proposed a variety of schema-less solutions such as "Lean Middleware" <ref name="reffour">{{cite conference | author=David A. Maluf et al. | title=Lean middleware | booktitle=SIGMOD 2005 | year=2005 | pages=788–791 | url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1066157.1066247&coll=portal&dl=ACM&type=series&idx=1066157&part=Proceedings&WantType=Proceedings&title=International%20Conference%20on%20Management%20of%20Data&CFID=15151515&CFTOKEN=6184618}}</ref>, but ease-of-use and speed of employment appear inversely proportional to the generality of such systems.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}  Others{{Who|date=June 2009}} cite the need for standard data interfaces to speed and simplify the integration process in practice.
; handling higher-order information : Analysts experience difficulty — even with a functioning information integration system — in determining whether the sources in the database will  satisfy a given application.  Answering these kinds of questions about a set of repositories requires semantic information like [[metadata]] and/or ontologies.  The few commercial tools{{Which?|date=June 2009}} that leverage this information remain in their infancy.

== Applications ==
EII products enable [[loose coupling]] between [[wiktionary:Homogeneous|homogeneous]]-data consuming client applications and services and [[heterogeneous]]-data stores.  Such client applications and services include Desktop Productivity Tools ([[spreadsheet]]s, [[word processor]]s, presentation software, etc.), [[Integrated development environment|Development Environment]]s and [[Software framework|Framework]]s ([[Java EE]], [[Microsoft .NET|.NET]], [[Mono (software)|Mono]], [[SOAP]] or [[Representational State Transfer|REST]]ian [[Web service]]s, etc.), [[business intelligence]] (BI), [[business activity monitoring]] (BAM) software, [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP), [[Customer Relationship Management]] (CRM), [[Business Process Management]] (BPM and/or BPEL) Software, and [[web content management]] (CMS).
