Cloudvpn is an [[Open source|open-source]], [[Mesh networking|mesh-networking]] capable communication tool. It differentiates itself from other [[Virtual Private Network|VPN]]s by serving as a generic transport layer for any [[Packet (information technology)|packet]]-based data traffic, which can include traditional VPN purpose, but is easily extensible to any other kind of traffic.

==Capabilities==

Cloudvpn tries to establish a decentralized transport network, routing through which is done using an optimized [[Distance-vector routing protocol|DVR]]-like algorithm. This gives the "cloud" of nodes a great potential, allowing simple failover of connections and traffic route optimalization.

All transported traffic is [[Encryption|encrypted]], giving the peers some security against [[eavesdropping]] and related attacks. Communication peers, on the other side, aren't secured from attacks from themselves - one node can usually see and read all traffic coming through it, if the traffic isn't secured or encrypted on some higher level. Peers are therefore needed to trust each other.

Cloudvpn is designed as a set of tools. Every node runs a 'cloud' program, which provides an encrypted connection and mesh routing capabilities, and then attaches various other 'mesh clients', that communicate using the pre-created network. For example, 'ether' tool creates a virtual [[Ethernet]] interface and routes its traffic through the mesh, giving the transport Ethernet-VPN capabilities. Other mesh clients are yet in development, [[WASTE]]-like features are planned.
