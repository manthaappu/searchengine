'''Query optimization''' is a function of many [[relational database management system]]s in which multiple [[query plan]]s for satisfying a query are examined and a good [[query plan]] is identified.  This may or not be the absolute best strategy because there are many ways of doing plans. There is a trade-off between the amount of time spent figuring out the best plan and the amount running the plan. Different qualities of database management systems have different ways of balancing these two. Cost based [[query optimizer]]s evaluate the resource footprint of various query plans and use this as the basis for plan selection.

Typically the resources which are costed are CPU path length, amount of disk buffer space, disk storage service time, and interconnect usage between units of parallelism.  The set of query plans examined is formed by examining possible access paths (e.g., primary index access, secondary index access, full file scan) and various relational table join techniques (e.g., merge join, hash join, product join).  The search space can become quite large depending on the complexity of the [[SQL]] query. There are two types of optimization. These consist of logical optimization which generates a sequence of [[relational algebra]] to solve the query. In addition there is physical optimization which is used to determine the means of carrying out each operation.
