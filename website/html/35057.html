'''IBM solidDB''' is a product family<ref>Product family home page - http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/soliddb/</ref>, developed and sold by [[IBM]].  The product family includes two products built around an in-memory [[relational database management system]].  The first product is a stand-alone relational database management system entitled solidDB<ref>Link to solidDB product page http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/soliddb/soliddb/</ref>.  The second product, released to market in 2008<ref>Link to press release from IBM http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/25803.wss</ref>, is a Universal Cache product, aptly entitled solidDB Universal Cache<ref>Link to solidDB Universal Cache product page http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/soliddb/universal-cache/</ref>.

== Technology ==
solidDB includes an [[in-memory database]] as well as a traditional [[database]], which both employ the same [[SQL]] interface, and a [[high availability]] option. solidDB presents a DB2-like instance to applications where developers can write commands that would normally have retrieved or written data to a database (thereby incurring some latency). The difference is, because solidDB reads and writes its data only to [[Random Access Memory]] within the transaction window, the speed of such operations is up to ten times faster. 

In solidDB version 7, tuning and optimization towards the [[POWER7|Power7]] architecture further enhances the capability of the product. Power7 applications have access to 8 terabytes of memory per core, and up to 2 petabytes of memory globally. In addition, Power7-hosted applications can operate at the speed of [[petaflops]].

== Customers ==
It is historically used as an [[embedded database]] in telecommunications equipment, network software, and similar systems.<ref>Monash, Curt.

== History ==
Solid was acquired by IBM in late 2007 [http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/22921.wss].  It was a [[privately held company]] originally founded in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] in 1992.
