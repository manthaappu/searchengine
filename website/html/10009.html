Hitchins joined the [[Royal Air Force]] in 1951 as an apprentice and retired as a wing commander in 1973 to join industry. From 1975 to 1976 he worked as the system design manager of the Tornado ADV aviation company and technical coordinator for UKAIR CCIS. From 1975 to 1979 he was head of [[Integrative learning|Integrated sciences]] in a grammar school, teaching physics, integrated science, mathematics, electronics, biology and astronomy to advanced level, with music, gymnastics and athletics as additional subjects. 

In 1980 he returned to industry and held posts at two leading systems engineering companies as Marketing Director, Business Development Director and Technical Director. He also worked as UK Technical Director for the [[NATO]] Air Command and Control System (ACCS) project in [[Brussels]] before becoming an academic in 1988.<ref> [http://www.incose.org/about/organization/bios/displayBio.aspx?bio_id=197222 Derek Hitchins], INCOSE website, retrieved Sept. 2007 </ref>
