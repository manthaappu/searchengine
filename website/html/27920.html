<html> <head> <title>Overlap coefficient</title></head><body>The '''overlap coefficient''' is a similarity measure related to the [[Jaccard index]] that computes the overlap between two sets which is defined as follows:

:<math>\mathrm{overlap}(X,Y) = \frac{| X \cap Y | }{\min(|X|,|Y|)}</math>

If set ''X'' is a subset of ''Y'' or the converse then the overlap coefficient is equal to one.
