<html> <head> <title>Self-schema</title></head><body>The term '''self-schema''' refers to the beliefs and ideas people have about themselves. These beliefs are used to guide and organize information processing, especially when the information is significant to the self. Self-schemas are important to a person's overall [[self-concept]]. 

== General self-schema ==
The term '''schematic''' describes having a particular schema for a particular dimension. For instance, a person in a [[musical ensemble|rock band]] at night, when she would have a "rocker" schema. However, during the day, if she works as a [[sales]]person, she would have a "salesperson" schema during that period of time. Schemas vary according to [[culture|cultural background]] and other [[social environment|environmental factors]].

Once people have developed a schema about themselves, there is a strong tendency for that schema to be maintained by a [[cognitive bias|bias]] in what they attend to, in what they remember, and in what they are prepared to accept as true about themselves. In other words, the self-schema becomes self-perpetuating. The self-schema is then stored in [[long-term memory]], and both facilitates and biases the processing of personally relevant information.

The term '''aschematic''' means not having a schema for a particular dimension. This usually occurs when people are not involved with or concerned about a certain attribute. For example, if a person plans on being a [[music]]ian, a self-schema in [[aeronautics]] will not attribute to her; she is aschematic on aeronautics.

Self-schemas vary from person to person because each individual has very different social and cultural life experiences. A few examples of self-schemas are: ''exciting'' or ''dull''; ''quiet'' or ''loud''; ''healthy'' or ''sickly''; ''athletic'' or ''nonathletic''; ''lazy'' or ''active''; and ''geek'' or ''jock''. If a person has a schema for "[[geek]] or [[jock]]," for example, he might think of himself as a bit of a computer geek and would possess a lot of information about that trait. Because of this, he would probably interpret many situations based on relevance to his being a computer geek. 

Another person with the "[[health]]y or [[illness|sickly]]" schema might consider herself a very health conscious person. Her concern with being healthy would then affect everyday decisions such as what groceries she buys, what restaurants she frequents, or how often she exercises. Women who are schematic on appearance exhibited lower [[body image]], lower [[self-esteem]], and more [[mood (psychology)|negative mood]] than did those who are aschematic on appearance.

== Multiple self-schema == 
Most people have multiple self-schemas, however this is not the same as [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]] in the pathological sense. Indeed, for the most part, multiple self-schemas are extremely useful to people in daily life. Subconsciously, they help people make rapid decisions and behave efficiently and appropriately in different situations and with different people. Multiple self-schemas guide what people attend to and how people interpret and use incoming information. They also activate specific cognitive, verbal, and behavioral action sequences – called ''[[behavioral script|scripts]]'' and ''action plans'' in [[cognitive psychology]] – that help people meet [[goal]]s efficiently.
