'''Microsoft Auto''' (also previously known as '''Windows CE for Automotive''', '''Windows Automotive''', and '''Windows Mobile for Automotive''') is an [[embedded operating system]] based on [[Windows CE]] for use on computer systems in [[automobile]]s.  The operating system is developed by [[Microsoft]] through the Microsoft Automotive Business Unit that formed in August 1995.  The first automotive product built by Microsoft's Automotive Business Unit debuted on December 4, 1998 as the [[AutoPC]], and also includes [[Ford Sync]] and [[Blue&Me]]. Microsoft's Automotive Business Unit has built both the software platforms used for automotive devices as well as the devices themselves. The current focus is on the software platforms and includes two products, Microsoft Auto and Windows Automotive.
