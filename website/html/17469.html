'''IEC 62379''' is a [[control engineering]] standard for the common control interface for networked digital audio and video products.

It is a family of standards that specifies a control framework for networked audio and video equipment and is published by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]].<ref>[http://www.iec.ch/ International Electrotechnical Commission]</ref> It has been designed to provide a means for entering a common set of management commands to control the transmission across the network as well as other functions within the interfaced equipment.

The parts within this standard include:-
* Part 1: General,
* Part 2: [[Audio]],
* Part 3: [[Video]],
* Part 4: [[Data]],
* Part 5: Transmission over networks,
* Part 6: Packet transfer service,
