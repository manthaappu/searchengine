In [[mathematical analysis]], the '''Dirichlet kernel''' is the collection of functions

:<math>D_n(x)=\sum_{k=-n}^n
e^{ikx}=1+2\sum_{k=1}^n\cos(kx)=\frac{\sin\left(\left(n +1/2\right) x \right)}{\sin(x/2)}.</math>

It is named after [[Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]].

The importance of the Dirichlet kernel comes from its relation to [[Fourier series]]. The [[convolution]] of ''D<sub>n</sub>''(''x'') with any function ''f'' of period 2&pi; is the ''n''th-degree Fourier series approximation to ''f'', i.e., we have

:<math>(D_n*f)(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^\pi f(y)D_n(x-y)\,dy=\sum_{k=-n}^n \hat{f}(k)e^{ikx},</math>

where

:<math>\hat{f}(k)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^\pi f(x)e^{-ikx}\,dx</math>

is the ''k''th Fourier coefficient of ''f''. This implies that in order to study convergence of Fourier series it is enough to study properties of the Dirichlet kernel. Of particular importance is the fact that the [[Lp space|''L''<sup>1</sup>]] norm of ''D<sub>n</sub>'' diverges to infinity as ''n'' &rarr; &infin;. One can estimate that

:<math>\| D_n \| _{L^1} \approx \log n</math> 

where <math>\approx</math> denotes "is of the order." This lack of uniform integrability is behind many divergence phenomena for the Fourier series. For example, together with the [[uniform boundedness principle]], it can be used to show that the Fourier series of a [[continuous function]] may fail to converge pointwise, in rather dramatic fashion. See [[convergence of Fourier series]] for further details.

==Relation to the delta function==
<!--I am not sure this is useful here.

To understand the definition, one can see that it is 2&pi; times the ''n''th-degree [[Fourier series]] approximation to a "function" with period 2&pi; given by

:<math>\delta_p(x)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty\delta(x-2\pi k)</math>
where &delta;-->

Take the [[periodic function|periodic]] [[Dirac delta function]], which is not really a function, in the sense of mapping one set into another, but is rather a "[[generalized function]]", also called a "distribution", and multiply by 2&pi;. We get the [[identity element]] for convolution on functions of period 2&pi;. In other words, we have

:<math>f*(2\pi \delta)=f \,</math>

for every function ''f'' of period 2&pi;. The Fourier series representation of this "function" is

:<math>2\pi \delta(x)\sim\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty e^{ikx}=\left(1 +2\sum_{k=1}^\infty\cos(kx)\right).</math>

Therefore the Dirichlet kernel, which is just the sequence of partial sums of this series, can be thought of as an ''[[approximate identity]]''. Abstractly speaking it is not however an approximate identity of ''positive'' elements (hence the failures mentioned above).

==Proof of the trigonometric identity==

The [[trigonometric identity]]

:<math>\sum_{k=-n}^n e^{ikx}
=\frac{\sin((n+1/2)x)}{\sin(x/2)}</math>

displayed at the top of this article may be established as follows.  First recall that the sum of a finite [[geometric series]] is

:<math>\sum_{k=0}^n a r^k=a\frac{1-r^{n+1}}{1-r}.</math>

In particular, we have

:<math>\sum_{k=-n}^n r^k=r^{-n}\cdot\frac{1-r^{2n+1}}{1-r}.</math>

Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by ''r''<sup>&minus;1/2</sup>, getting

:<math>\frac{r^{-n-1/2}}{r^{-1/2}}\cdot\frac{1-r^{2n+1}}{1-r} =\frac{r^{-n-1/2}-r^{n+1/2}}{r^{-1/2}-r^{1/2}}.</math>

In case ''r'' = ''e''<sup>''ix''</sup> we have

:<math>\sum_{k=-n}^n e^{ikx}=\frac{e^{-(n+1/2)ix}-e^{(n+1/2)ix}}{e^{-ix/2}-e^{ix/2}} =\frac{-2i\sin((n+1/2)x)}{-2i\sin(x/2)} = \frac{\sin((n+1/2)x)}{\sin(x/2)}</math>

as required.
