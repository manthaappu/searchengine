Prof. Dr. '''Charlotte Froese Fischer''' PhD (b. 1929) is a Canadian-American applied mathematician and computer scientist who gained world recognition for the development and implementation of the Multi-configurational Hartree-Fock ([[MCHF]]) approach to atomic structure calculations and for her theoretical prediction concerning the existence of the negative calcium ion ([[Physical Review Letters]], vol. 59, pp. 2263-2266, 1987). For this last honor, she was elected to fellowship in the [[American Physical Society]].

==Early life==
Charlotte Froese Fischer was born on September 21, 1929 in [[Nikolayevka]], [[Ukraine]] to parents of [[Mennonite]] descent. Her parents immigrated to [[Germany]] on the last train allowed to cross the border before its closure by [[Soviet]] authorities. After a few months in a [[refugee camp]], her family was allowed to immigrate to [[Canada]], where they eventually established themselves in [[Chilliwack, British Columbia|Chilliwack]], [[British Columbia]]. 

==Education and research==
She obtained both a B.A. degree, with honors in Mathematics and Chemistry, and an M.A. degree in Applied Mathematics from the [[University of British Columbia]] in 1952 and 1954, respectively. She then obtained her Ph.D. in applied mathematics and computing at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in 1957 pursuing coursework in quantum theory with [[P.A.M. Dirac]] and working under the supervision of [[Douglas Hartree]], whom she assisted in programming the first Electronic Digital Stored program Automatic Computer ([[EDSAC]]) for atomic structure calculations. 

She served on the mathematics faculty of the University of British Columbia from 1957 - 68 where she introduced numerical analysis and computer courses into the curriculum and was instrumental in the formation of the Computer Science Department. 

The years 1963 - 64 were spent by Froese Fischer at the [[Harvard College Observatory]], where she extended her research on atomic structure calculations. While at [[Harvard]], she was the first woman scientist to be awarded an [[Alfred P. Sloan]] Fellowship. Since then she has become internationally known for her software for atomic structure calculations and her research in atomic structure theory. In 1991 she became a Fellow of the [[American Physical Society]], in part for her contribution to the discovery of negative calcium. In 1995 she was elected a member of the Royal Physiographical Society of Lund and in 2004, as a foreign member of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences. 

==Contributions==
She is the author of over 260 research articles on computational atomic theory, many of which became citation classics for their far-reaching impact in the area of atomic structure calculations. One of her largest efforts in the field is the recent calculation, in collaboration with [[Georgio Tachiev]] and [[Andrei Irimia]], of the complete lower spectra of the [[beryllium]]-like to [[argon]]-like isoelectronic sequences, amounting to the publication of data covering 400 journal pages and a total of over 150 ions (C Froese Fischer, G Tachiev (2004) Atomic Data Nucl Data Tables vol 87 pp 1-184 and C Froese Fischer, G Tachiev, A Irimia (2006) Atomic Data Nucl Data Tables vol 92 607-812)

She is currently an emerita research professor of computer science at [[Vanderbilt University]] and a guest scientist of the Atomic Spectroscopy Laboratory at [[NIST]].
