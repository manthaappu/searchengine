Three main tasks were posed at the first BioCreAtIvE challenge: the entity extraction task<ref>Alex Yeh, Alex Morgan, Marc Colosimo, and Lynette Hirschman (2005) BioCreative task 1A: Gene mention finding evaluation. BMC Bioinformatics 6(Suppl. 1)</ref>, the gene name normalization task<ref>Lynette Hirschman, Mark Colosimo, Alex Morgan, and Alex Yeh (2005) Overview of BioCreative task 1B: Normalized gene lists.

Leon, Martin Krallinger, and Alfonso Valencia (2005) Evaluation of BioCreative task 2.  BMC Bioinformatics 6(Suppl. 1)</ref>. The data sets produced by this contest serve as a Gold Standard training and test set to evaluate and train Bio-NER tools and annotation extraction tools.

The second BioCreAtIvE included three tasks organized by Lynette Hirschman and Alex Morgan of [[MITRE]]; Alfonso Valencia and Martin Krallinger of CNIO in Spain; and W. John Wilbur, Lorrie Tanabe and Larry Smith of [[NIH]].
