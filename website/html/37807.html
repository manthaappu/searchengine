'''Timothy Dale Korson''' (born December 12, 1952) is an American [[software engineer]] and founder of Qualsys Solutions Inc.  Dr. Korson is best known for his contributions since the mid 1980’s in [[Object Oriented]] technologies, testing & project management, often associating with [[Grady Booch]], [[Ivar Jacobson]] and [[James Rumbaugh]].

==Biography==
Dr. Korson earned his B.A. with a major in Mathematics and French in 1974 from Atlantic Union College.  He continued on to in 1981 to receive an M.S. in Mathematics with an emphasis on applied math and CS, from [[Ohio University]].  He then earned his PhD in computer Information Systems in 1986 from [[Georgia State University]].  His dissertation was an empirical study of the effects of modularity on program modifiability.

He is the former executive director of COMSOFT, The Consortium for the Management of Emerging Software Technologies, from 1992 to 2001.  Here he worked as the founding officer of a technology transfer and research consortium with emphasis on object technology.  The COMSOFT sponsor list included [[NBC]], [[IBM]], [[AT&T]], [[Bell South]] and [[Nortel]].

He worked as the principle investigator of:

“Enhanced Graphics Component for Eiffel” with a research grant from [[Eiffel Software|Interactive Software Engineering]] from 1988 to 1989. Here he supervised and assisted in the development of an enhanced, [X Window] based, graphics component for the object-oriented language “[[Eiffel]].”

“Object Modeling and Value Project” with a research grant from  [[AT&T]] from 1990 to 1992.

“Object Metrics and Testing Project” with a research grant given by [[IBM]] and BRN from 1990 to 1994.
