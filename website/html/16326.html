==Personal life==
Wadsworth was born in Duluth Minnesota, where his father, Harrison Morton Wadsworth, Sr., worked as a manager at a steel mill. Harrison Sr. was badly burned in an accident at the mill in 1929, and later died as a result of  what was then known as [[blood poisoning]] (now known as a staph infection). Harrison Jr. then moved with his mother and sister, Eleanor, to Miami Beach, Florida. 

During WWII, he was drafted into the United States Army. Having keen mathematical skills, he was made a supply sergeant and was shipped to the Philippines, where he supported American [[Pacific Theater of Operations]]. After the war, he remained in the [[Army Reserves]]. In 1951, he married Irene Hawkins Wadsworth, a [[Registered Nurse]]. The two remained happily married for 59 years until his death of complications from [[lymphoma]] in 2010. They lived in Cleveland, Ohio while Harrison completed his doctoral studies. Upon earning his PhD, the family moved to Atlanta, Georgia. Harrison and Irene had two children and seven grandchildren.
