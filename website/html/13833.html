The '''Florida Photographic Collection''' is a nationally recognized component of the State Archives of Florida and contains over a million images, and over 6,000 movies and [[video tapes]]. Over 150,000 of the [[photograph]]s are available through the web site.

"Featuring over 150,000 digitized photographs from the State Archives of Florida, the Florida Photographic Collection is the most complete online portrait of Florida available--one that draws its strength from family pictures, the homes of Floridians, their work, and their pastimes." <ref name="Florida Photographic Collection" >{{cite web

The collection spans a wide range of visual images from copies of mid 15th century maps to current photographs. Topics of note are rocket launches from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]], [[Land Speed Record]] attempts on [[Daytona Beach]] (particularly the work of [[Richard LeSesne]]) and a vast number on holidaymaking.
