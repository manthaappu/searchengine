==Discovery==
GhostNet was discovered and named following a 10-month investigation by the [[Infowar Monitor]] (IWM), carried out after IWM researchers approached the Dalai Lama's representative in Geneva <ref name="Tracking_Ghostnet">{{cite news|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/13731776/Tracking-GhostNet-Investigating-a-Cyber-Espionage-Network |title=Tracking GhostNet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network}}</ref> suspecting that their computer network had been infiltrated.<ref name="BBC_3003">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7972702.stm|title=China denies spying allegations|work=[[BBC News]]|date=March 30, 2009|accessdate=March 31, 2009}}</ref> The IWM is composed of researchers from [[Secdev Group]] and Canadian consultancy and the [[Citizen Lab]], [[Munk Centre for International Studies]] at the [[University of Toronto]]; the research findings were published in the [[Infowar Monitor]], an affiliated publication.<ref name="NY-TIMES"/> Researchers from the [[University of Cambridge]]'s [[University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory|Computer Laboratory]], supported by the [[Institute for Information Infrastructure Protection]],<ref name="Cambridge_p2">{{cite web|url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-746.pdf|title=The snooping dragon: social-malware surveillance of the Tibetan movement|author=Shishir Nagaraja, Ross Anderson|publisher=[[University of Cambridge]]|month=March|year=2009|page=2|accessdate=March 31, 2009|format=PDF}}</ref> also contributed to the investigation at one of the three locations in [[Dharamsala]],  where the Tibetan government-in-exile is located.

Compromised systems were discovered in the [[Embassy|embassies]] of [[India]], [[South Korea]], [[Indonesia]], [[Romania]], [[Cyprus]], [[Malta]], [[Thailand]], [[Taiwan]], [[Portugal]], [[Germany]] and [[Pakistan]] and the office of the Prime Minister of [[Laos]]. The [[Foreign ministry|foreign ministries]] of [[Iran]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Latvia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Philippines]], [[Brunei]], [[Barbados]] and [[Bhutan]] were also targeted.<ref name=bbc>{{cite news| title=Major cyber spy network uncovered | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7970471.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | date=March 29, 2009 | accessdate=March 29, 2009}}</ref><ref name=Reuters>{{cite news| title=Canadians find vast computer spy network: report | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE52R2HQ20090328 | work=[[Reuters]] | date=March 28, 2009 | accessdate=March 29, 2009}}</ref> No evidence was found that U.S. or U.K. government offices were infiltrated, although a [[NATO]] computer was monitored for half a day and the computers of the [[Embassy of India in Washington, D.C.|Indian embassy]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], were infiltrated.<ref name="nato">{{cite news| title=Chinese hackers ‘using ghost network to control embassy computers’ | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article5996253.ece | work=[[The Times]] | date=March 29, 2009 | accessdate=March 29, 2009 | location=London | first=Mike | last=Harvey}}</ref><ref name=Reuters/><ref>{{cite news| title=Spying operation by China infiltrated computers: Report | url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/blnus/10291335.htm | work=[[The Hindu]] | date=March 29, 2009 | accessdate=March 29, 2009}}</ref>

==Technical functionality==
Emails are sent to target organizations that contain contextually relevant information. These emails contain malicious attachments, that when opened, drop a Trojan horse on to the system. This Trojan connects back to a control server, usually located in China, to receive commands. The infected computer will then execute the command specified by the control server. Occasionally, the command specified by the control server will cause the infected computer to download and install a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan]] known as [[Gh0st Rat]] that allows attackers to gain complete, real-time control of computers running Microsoft Windows.<ref name="nato"/> Such a computer can be controlled or inspected by attackers, and even has the ability to turn on camera and audio-recording functions of infected computers, enabling monitors to perform surveillance.<ref name="NY-TIMES"/>

==Origin==
The researchers from the IWM stated they could not conclude that the Chinese government was responsible for the spy network.<ref name=uoft>[http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/ghostnet.pdf Tracking GhostNet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network]. [[The SecDev Group]] and [[Munk Centre for International Studies]]. March 29, 2009</ref> However, a report from researchers at the [[University of Cambridge]] says they believe that the Chinese government is behind the intrusions they analyzed at the Office of the Dalai Lama.<ref name=snoop>{{cite web | url = http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-746.pdf | title = The snooping dragon: social-malware surveillance of the Tibetan movement | first = Shishir | last = Nagaraja | coauthors = Anderson, Ross| publisher = Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge | date = March 2009 | format = PDF }}</ref>

Researchers have also noted the possibility that GhostNet was an operation run by private citizens in China for profit or for patriotic reasons, or created by intelligence agencies from other countries such as Russia or the United States.<ref name="NY-TIMES"/> The Chinese government has stated that China "strictly forbids any cyber crime".<ref name=bbc/><ref name=bp/>

The "Ghostnet Report" documents several unrelated infections at Tibetan-related organizations in addition to the Ghostnet infections. By using the email addresses provided by the IWM report, [[Scott J. Henderson]] had managed to trace one of the operators of one of the infections (non-Ghostnet) to [[Chengdu]]. He identifies the hacker as a 27-year-old man who had attended the [[University of Electronic Science and Technology of China]], and currently connected with the Chinese hacker [[Subculture|underground]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Henderson|first=Scott|publication-date=April 2, 2009|title=Hunting the GhostNet Hacker|url=http://www.thedarkvisitor.com/2009/04/hunting-the-ghostnet-hacker/|publisher = The Dark Visitor|accessdate=April 2, 2009}}</ref>

Despite the lack of evidence to pinpoint the Chinese government as responsible for intrusions against Tibetan-related targets, researchers at Cambridge have found actions taken by Chinese government officials that corresponded with the information obtained via computer instrusions. One such incident involved a diplomat who was pressured by Beijing after receiving an email invitation to a visit with the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] from his representatives.<ref name="snoop"/>

Another incident involved a Tibetan woman who was interrogated by Chinese intelligence officers and was shown transcripts of her online conversations.<ref name=uoft>[http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/ghostnet.pdf Tracking GhostNet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network]. [[Munk Centre for International Studies]]. March 29, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.thestar.com/article/610071 U of T team tracks China-based cyber spies] [[Toronto Star]] March 29, 2009{{Dead link|date=March 2009}}</ref> However, there are other possible explanations for this event. Drelwa uses QQ and other instant messengers to communicate with Chinese Internet users. In 2008, IWM found that TOM-Skype, the Chinese version of Skype, was logging and storing text messages exchanged between users. It is possible that the Chinese authorities acquired the chat transcripts through this means.<ref>[http://www.nartv.org/mirror/breachingtrust.pdf]</ref>

IWM researchers have also found that when detected, GhostNet is consistently controlled from IP addresses located on the island of [[Hainan]], China, and have pointed out that Hainan is home to the Lingshui signals intelligence facility and the Third Technical Department of the People’s Liberation Army.<ref name="nato"/> Furthermore, one of GhostNet's four control servers has been revealed to be a government server.<ref>http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/meet-the-canadians-who-busted-ghostnet/article732409/ Meet the Canadians who busted Ghostnet] [[Globe and Mail]] Martch 29, 2009</ref>

The Chinese embassy in London has denied the involvement of its government, stating that there is no evidence that his government was involved. A spokesman called the accusation part of a "propaganda campaign" and "just some video footage pieced together from different sources to attack China".<ref name="BBC_3003" /> Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said that his country was committed to security of the computer network.
