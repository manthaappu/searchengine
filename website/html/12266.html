<html> <head> <title>Enterprise storage</title></head><body>In [[computing]], an '''enterprise storage''' is the [[computer storage]] designed for large-scale, high-technology environments of the modern [[Company|enterprises]].  When comparing to the consumer storage, it has higher [[scalability]], higher [[Reliability engineering|reliability]], better [[fault tolerance]], and much higher initial price.

From the [[salesperson]]'s point of view, the four main enterprise storage [[market]]s are:
* [[computer storage|Online storage]] - large [[disk array]] solutions, minimizing [[access time]] to the data, and maximizing reliability;
* [[Backup]] - off-line storage for data protection, with a smaller price per byte than online storage, but at a cost of higher average access time; often uses [[sequential access]] storage, such as [[tape library|tape libraries]];
* [[archive|Archiving]] - technically similar to [[backup]], but its purpose is long-term retention, management, and discovery of fixed-content data to meet regulatory compliance, litigation protection, and storage cost optimization objectives;
* [[Disaster recovery]] solutions, used to protect the data from localized [[disaster]]s, usually being a vital part of broader [[business continuity plan]].

The enterprise storage industry includes conferences ([http://storagedecisions.techtarget.com/ Storage Decisions], [http://www.snwusa.com/ Storage Networking World], etc.), publications ([http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/ Storage Magazine], [http://infostor.com/ InfoStor], etc.), and companies ([[3PAR]], [[Atempo]], [[Iron Mountain Incorporated|Iron Mountain]], [[Isilon]], [[EMC Corporation|EMC]], [[DELL]], [[Hewlett Packard|HP]], [[Hitachi Data Systems]], [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], [[NetApp]], [[Novell]], [[Open-E]], [[Pillar Data Systems]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Symantec]]/[[Veritas Software]],  etc.).
