'''Dr Peter John Bentley''' (born May 16, 1972) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[author]] and [[computer scientist]] based at [[University College London]].

Peter J. Bentley is a Reader and College Fellow at [[University College London|UCL]] and a Collaborating Professor at [[KAIST]]. He is also a [[popular science]] [[author]] and [[consultant]]. He is a contributing editor for [[WIRED]] UK and was the monthly host of the [[Royal Institution]]'s cafe scientifique.

Born in [[Colchester]], [[England]], he achieved a [[B.Sc.]] in [[Artificial Intelligence]] from the [[University of Essex]] (supervised by [[Edward Tsang]]) and a [[Ph.D.]] in Evolutionary Design (supervised by Jonathan Wakefield) at the age of 24. His doctorate thesis was entitled ''Generic Evolutionary Design of Solid Objects using a Genetic Algorithm.''

Since 1997 he has performed research into [[evolutionary computation]], [[artificial life]], [[swarm intelligence]], [[artificial immune systems]], [[artificial neural networks]] and other types of [[biologically inspired computing]], which he terms ''Digital Biology.'' He is head of the Digital Biology Interest Group at the Department of Computer Science, [[University College London]]. He participates in science festivals and public events, such as the debate on Complexity and Evolution held at the [[Natural History Museum]] in July 2007 with [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Steve Jones (biologist)]], [[Lewis Wolpert]]. His research has been described in several articles of [[New Scientist]]. His recent research focuses on [[morphological computation (robotics)|morphological computation]] and novel architectures designed for [[natural computation]] based on evolution, developmental and self-assembling systems.

Most recently he has received publicity for his [[iphone]] application iStethoscope, which was developed in collaboration with [[cardiologists]] in USA. The app has been used to gather [[heart sounds]] from people around the world in a research project to enable computers to [[diagnose]] [[heart disease]] automatically using [[machine learning]].
