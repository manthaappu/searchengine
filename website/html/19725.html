'''Jart Armin''' is an investigator, analyst and writer on [[cybercrime]] and [[computer security]].

He was an active participant in the origins of [[StopBadware]], set up by the [[Berkman Center for Internet & Society]] and [[Google]] to track malicious web sites.

Armin first came into the public eye in 2007 from his exposure of the [[Russian Business Network|RBN (Russian Business Network)]]. Throughout 2007, via a dedicated blog entitled RBNExploit,<ref>[http://rbnexploit.blogspot.com Jart Armin's RBN blog]</ref> he provided reports and analysis on the undercover operations of the RBN criminal gang, despite constant DDoS attempts and artificially-created mirror websites. With regular blogs and alliance with third parties, Armin raised public awareness of the activities of the RBN which were subsequently reported on in major newspaper articles.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/12/AR2007101202461.html "Shadowy Russian Firm Seen as Conduit for Cybercrime"] by [[Brian Krebs]], [[The Washington Post]]. December 10th, 2007. Retrieved 2010-08-22.</ref>

It was via the RBN blog that Armin provided the first reports of cyber attacks, used in conjunction with the invasion of Georgia by Russian troops, three days in advance of the attack in August 2008.<ref>[http://rbnexploit.blogspot.com/2008/08/rbn-georgia-cyberwarfare-attribution.html "Georgia Cyberwarfare – Attribution & Spam Botnets"] - RBN Blog</ref>

As an advocate of an [[open source]] community approach to the fight against cybercrime, Armin established HostExploit<ref>[http://hostexploit.com/ HostExploit website]</ref> as an educational website aimed at exposing internet bad actors and cybercriminal organizations which deliver [[crimeware]] through hosts and registrars.

==The Reports==

In August 2008, Jart Armin, via HostExploit, published a definitive report "[[Atrivo]] - Cyber Crime USA",<ref name="atrivo">[http://hostexploit.com/downloads/view.download/4/12.html "Atrivo - Cyber Crime USA"] - HostExploit Report</ref> stating that Atrivo (aka Intercage) - a [[Concord]], [[California]], [[United States]]-based [[website hosting]] provider deliberately allowed cyber criminals to use its services. This brought about the shutdown of Atrivo with a related 10% drop in botnet and spam activity worldwide.

 

In November 2008, Armin published a further definitive report, "[[McColo]] - Cyber Crime USA",<ref>"[http://hostexploit.com/downloads/view.download/4/14.html "McColo - Cyber Crime USA"] - HostExploit Report</ref> with contributions from [[StopBadware]], [[Trend Micro]], Emerging Threats, [[KnujOn]], Sunbelt, CastleCops, [[The Spamhaus Project]], [[Arbor Networks]], Malwaredomains, Threat Expert, [[SecureWorks]], [[aa419]], Malwaredatabase and Robtex. The report, and press coverage used in conjunction to the report,<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/12/AR2008111200658.html "Host of Internet Spam Groups Is Cut Off"] by [[Brian Krebs]], [[The Washington Post]]. December 11th, 2008. Retrieved 2010-08-22.</ref> were instrumental in the demise of [[McColo]] by revealing the web hosting service provider to be deliberately funding criminal activities and illegal child sexual abuse content. It was estimated that following the take-down, 70% of the world's spam disappeared overnight.<ref>[http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2008/11/fighting-spam-just-got-little-easier.html "Fighting spam just got a little easier"] - Google Enterprise Blog</ref>

The cybercriminal activities of [[EstDomains]] were tracked by Armin and his allies in RBN blog postings and HostExploit reports.<ref name="atrivo" /> Exposing the link between the RBN and EstDomains in the October 2008 report entitled "RBN – Farewell to EstDomains"<ref>[http://rbnexploit.blogspot.com/2008_10_01_archive.html "Farewell to EstDomains"] - RBN Blog</ref> lead to the operational closure of the EstDomains business and to its customer base moving to the Asian registrar [[Directi]].<ref>[http://www.directi.com/ Directi website]</ref>

In a joint venture with Andrew Martin of MartinSecurity.net, Armin issued the report "Real Host Latvia – RBN Resurgence or Clone?"<ref>[http://hostexploit.com/downloads/view.download/4/10.html "Real Host, Latvia - RBN Resurgence or Clone?"] - HostExploit Report</ref> in August 2009, providing further evidence of continuing RBN involvement in internet fraud. [[Telia]], the hosting registrar, suspended all involvement with Real Host when provided with the evidence contained within the report.

In November 2009, in another joint venture with Andrew Martin<ref>[http://www.martinsecurity.net/2009/11/17/introducing-malfi-another-report-from-hostexploit/ "Introducing MalFI – Another Report From HostExploit"]</ref> and Scott Logan, Jart Armin and HostExploit released a report called "MALfi, A Cybercrime International Report - A Silent Threat".<ref>[http://hostexploit.com/downloads/view.download/4/15.html "MALfi, A Cybercrime International Report"] - HostExploit Report</ref> The report describes how hackers and cybercriminals use blended attacks - a combination of [[Remote File Inclusion|RFI (remote file inclusion)]], [[Local File Inclusion|LFI (local file inclusion)]], [[XSA|XSA (cross-server attack)]], and [[Remote code execution|RCE (remote code execution)]] - to compromise websites and servers.

 

In December 2009, the first in a quarterly series of research documents named the "Top 50 Bad Hosts & Networks"<ref>[http://hostexploit.com/downloads/view.download/4/8.html "Top 50 Bad Hosts & Networks 2009"] - HostExploit Report</ref> was published by Armin and the HostExploit team to show the worst web hosting providers in terms of relative cybercriminal activity, using an objective quantification method. The best performing hosts are noted using the same criteria.

In August 2010, Armin and the HostExploit team released a report<ref>[http://hostexploit.com/downloads/view.download/4/26.html "Demand Media/eNom Report – Cybercrime USA"] - HostExploit Report</ref> providing an analysis of [[Demand Media|Demand Media's]] persistent position as "No 1 Bad Host" in HostExploit’s Top 50 Bad Hosts list.

==Other considerations==

Armin has spoken to audiences at [[Cambridge University]] and [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]], among others. He is a regular commentator on internet technical and security sites.<ref>[http://www.internetevolution.com/archives.asp?section_id=717 Jart Armin articles at Internet Evolution]</ref> He took part in an interview for Russian TV in Jan 2010 on the subject of cybercrime and the RBN’s involvement.<ref>[http://rt.com/Top_News/2010-01-08/global-hacker-threat-russia.html "Global hacker threat comes from Russia"] January 8th 2010, Russian Television.</ref>

==HostExploit==

HostExploit<ref>[http://www.hostexploit.com HostExploit website]</ref> was set up by Armin as an off-shoot from the RBN blog to explore wider cybercrime themes. It operates as an open source community project to inform on topics relating to cybercrime with links to daily news items, articles and reports written by Jart Armin and others.

HostExploit reports are regularly cited in academic research papers.<ref>[http://www.iseclab.org/papers/fire.pdf "FiRE - Finding Rogue Networks"]</ref>
