<html> <head> <title>ARM9</title></head><body>'''ARM9''' is an [[ARM architecture]] [[32-bit]] [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]] family.  With this design generation, ARM moved from a [[von Neumann architecture]] (Princeton architecture) to a [[Harvard architecture]] with separate instruction and [[bus (computing)|data buses]] (and caches), significantly increasing its potential speed.  Most silicon chips integrating these cores will package them as [[modified Harvard architecture]] chips, combining the two address busses on the other side of separated [[CPU caches]] and tightly coupled memories.

There are two subfamilies, implementing different ARM architecture versions.

==Differences from ARM7 cores==
Key improvements over [[ARM7]] cores, enabled by spending more transistors, include<ref>"Performance of the ARM9TDMI and ARM9E-S cores compared to the ARM7TDMI core", Issue 1.0, dated 9 February 2000, ARM Ltd.</ref>:
* Decreased heat production and lower overheating risk.
* Clock frequency improvements.  Shifting from a three stage pipeline to a five stage one lets the clock speed be approximately doubled, on the same silicon fabrication process.
* Cycle count improvements.  Many unmodified ARM7 binaries were measured as taking about 30% fewer cycles to execute on ARM9 cores.  Key improvements include
** Faster loads and stores; many instructions now cost just one cycle.  This is helped by both the modified Harvard architecture (reducing bus and cache contention) and the new pipeline stages.
** Exposing pipeline interlocks, enabling compiler optimizations to reduce blockage between stages.
Additionally, some ARM9 cores incorporate "Enhanced DSP" instructions, such as a multiply-accumulate, to support more efficient implementations of [[digital signal processing]] algorithms.

Switching to a Harvard architecture entailed a non-unified cache, so that instruction fetches do not evict data (and vice versa).  ARM9 cores have separate data and address bus signals, which chip designers use in various ways.  In most cases they connect at least part of the address space in von Neumann style, used for both instructions and data, usually to an [[Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture#Advanced_High-performance_Bus_.28AHB.29|AHB]] interconnect connecting to a [[DRAM]] interface and an [[External Bus Interface]] usable with [[NOR flash]] memory.  Such hybrids are no longer pure Harvard architecture processors.

==ARM9TDMI-based cores==
ARM9TDMI is a successor to the popular ARM7TDMI core, and is also based on the ARMv4T architecture.  Cores based on it support both 32-bit ARM and 16-bit Thumb instruction sets include:
* ARM920T with 16KB each of I/D cache and an [[Memory management unit|MMU]]
* ARM922T with 8KB each of I/D cache and an MMU
* ARM940T with cache and a Memory Protection Unit (MPU)

==ARM9E-based cores==
ARM9E, and its ARM9EJ sibling, implement longer pipelines and the ARMv5TE architecture, which includes some DSP-ish instruction set extensions.  They support 32-bit, 16-bit, and sometimes 8-bit instruction sets.
* ARM926EJ-S (includes ARM [[Jazelle]] technology which enables the direct execution of 8-bit [[Java bytecode]] in hardware), and an MMU
* ARM946
* ARM966
* ARM968
