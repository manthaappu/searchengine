<html> <head> <title>Don Cuco El Guapo</title></head><body>'''"Don Cuco El Guapo"''' is a [[pianist]] [[robot]] designed and built at the department of [[microelectronics]] of the [[Universidad Autónoma de Puebla]] (UAP), [[Mexico]] in 1992.

The exterior of the robot was designed by the [[sculptress]] [[Gloria Erika Weimer]] and is made of a crystal clear plastic, its body is 1.97 m tall (6'5") and weighs 130 [[kilogram|kg]] (290 [[pound (mass)|lb]]). The robot has 28 [[degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]] and was provided cameras for eyes. ''Don Cuco'' is capable of reading [[musical score]]s and play the music on a [[piano]]. To perform such tasks the robot required the application of [[frame grabbing]], [[image processing]], [[pattern recognition]] and interpretation or [[analysis of scene]]. The design team of 30 faculty 20 students at UAP consisted of [[physicist]]s, [[physician]]s, [[electronic engineering|electronic engineer]]s, [[computer scientist]]s, [[musician]]s and designers who worked 20 hours daily for six months to complete the project.

The brains of the robot are based on the [[ILA 9200]] microprocessor design in 1985 by scientists and engineers of [[Argentina]], [[Brasil]], [[Colombia]], [[Spain]] and Mexico. The [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU) was designed at the department of microelectronics of the UAP.

The robot has been presented and has performed in Mexico, Spain and [[Latin America]] before millions of people.
