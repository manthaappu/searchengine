<html> <head> <title>Operational semantics</title></head><body>In [[computer science]], '''operational semantics''' is a way to give meaning to [[computer program]]s in a mathematically rigorous way. Other approaches to providing a [[formal semantics of programming languages]] include [[axiomatic semantics]] and [[denotational semantics]].

The operational semantics for a programming language describes how a valid program is interpreted as sequences of computational steps.
These sequences then ''are'' the meaning of the program.
In the context of [[functional program]]s, the final step in a terminating
sequence returns the value of the program.  (In general there can be many return values for a single program,
because the program could be [[Nondeterministic algorithm|nondeterministic]], and even for a deterministic program there can be many computation sequences since the semantics may not specify exactly what sequence of operations arrives at that value.)

For the first time, the concept of operational semantics was used in defining the semantics of Algol 68. 
The following statement is a quote from the revised ALGOL 68 report: 

<blockquote>
The meaning of a program in the strict language is explained in terms of a hypothetical computer 
which performs the set of actions which constitute the elaboration of that program. ([[#algol68|Algol68]], Section 2)
</blockquote> 

The first use of the term "operational semantics" in its present meaning is attributed to
Dana Scott ([[#plotkin04|Plotkin04]]). 
What follows is a quote from Scott's seminal paper on formal semantics, 
in which he mentions the "operational" aspects of semantics.

<blockquote>
It is all very well to aim for a more ‘abstract’ and a ‘cleaner’ approach to
semantics, but if the plan is to be any good, the operational aspects cannot
be completely ignored. ([[#scott70|Scott70]])
</blockquote>

Perhaps the first formal incarnation of operational semantics was the use of the [[lambda calculus]] to define the semantics of [[LISP]] by [{{Cite web| title=Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine, Part I| author=John McCarthy | url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.html | accessdate=2006-10-13}}]. 
Abstract machines in the tradition of the [[SECD machine]] are also closely related.

== Structural Operational Semantics (SOS) ==

Structural Operational Semantics (SOS), sometimes also called structured operational semantics, was introduced by [[Gordon Plotkin]] in ([[#plotkin81|Plotkin81]])  as a logical means to defining operational semantics. The basic idea behind SOS is to define the behavior of a program in terms of the behavior of its parts, thus providing a structural, i.e., syntax oriented and [[inductive definition|inductive]], view on operational semantics.  An SOS specification defines the behavior of a program in terms of a (set of) [[State transition system|transition relation]](s). SOS specifications take the form of a set of [[inference rule]]s which define the  valid transitions of a composite piece of syntax in terms of the transitions of its components.

For a simple example, we consider part of the semantics of a simple programming language; proper illustrations are given in [[#plotkin81|Plotkin81]] and [[#hennessybook|Hennessy90]], and other textbooks. Let <math>C_1, C_2</math> range over programs of the language, and let <math>s</math> range over states (e.g. functions from memory locations to values). If we have expressions (ranged over by <math>E</math>), values (<math>V</math>) and locations (<math>L</math>), then a memory update command would have semantics:

<math>
\frac{\langle E,s\rangle \Rightarrow V}{\langle L:=E\,,\,s\rangle\longrightarrow (s\uplus (L\mapsto V))}
</math>
<!-- NOTE: This is only a fragment of a full semantics. I've tried to include enough to illustrate the points but not so much that it takes a disproportionate amount of space.  -->

Informally, the rule says that "'''if''' the expression <math>E</math> in state <math>s</math> reduces to value <math>V</math>, '''then''' the program <math>L:=E</math> will update the state <math>s</math> with the assignment <math>L=V</math>".

The semantics of sequencing can be given by the following three rules:

<math>
\frac{\langle C_1,s\rangle \longrightarrow s'}
{\langle C_1;C_2 \,,s\rangle\longrightarrow \langle C_2, s'\rangle}
\quad\quad
\frac{\langle C_1,s\rangle \longrightarrow \langle C_1',s'\rangle}
{\langle C_1;C_2 \,,s\rangle\longrightarrow \langle C_1';C_2\,, s'\rangle}
\quad\quad
\frac{}
{\langle \mathbf{skip} ,s\rangle\longrightarrow s}
</math>

Informally, the first rule says that,
if program <math>C_1</math> in state <math>s</math> finishes in state <math>s'</math>, then the program <math>C_1;C_2</math> in state <math>s</math> will reduce to the program <math>C_2</math> in state <math>s'</math>.
(You can think of this as formalizing "You  can run <math>C_1</math>, and then run <math>C_2</math>
using the resulting memory store.)
The second rule says that
if the program <math>C_1</math> in state <math>s</math> can reduce to the program <math>C_1'</math>  with state <math>s'</math>, then the program <math>C_1;C_2</math> in state <math>s</math> will reduce to the program <math>C_1';C_2</math> in state <math>s'</math>.
(You can think of this as formalizing the principle for an optimizing compiler:
"You are allowed to transform <math>C_1</math> as if it were stand-alone, even if it is just the
first part of a program.") 
The semantics is structural, because the meaning of the sequential program <math>C_1;C_2</math>, is defined by the meaning of <math>C_1</math> and the meaning of <math>C_2</math>.

If we also have Boolean expressions over the state, ranged over by <math>B</math>, then we can define the semantics of the '''while''' command: 
<math>
\frac{\langle B,s\rangle \Rightarrow \mathbf{true}}{\langle\mathbf{while}\ B\ \mathbf{ do }\ C,s\rangle\longrightarrow \langle C;\mathbf{while}\ B\ \mathbf{do}\ C,s\rangle}
\quad
\frac{\langle B,s\rangle \Rightarrow \mathbf{false}}{\langle\mathbf{while}\ B\ \mathbf{ do }\ C,s\rangle\longrightarrow s}
</math>

Such a definition allows formal analysis of the behavior of programs, permitting the study of [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]] between programs. Important relations include [[simulation preorder]]s and [[bisimulation]]. 
These are especially useful in the context of [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrency theory]]. 

Thanks to its intuitive look and easy to follow structure,
SOS has gained great popularity and has become a de facto standard in defining
operational semantics. As a sign of success, the original report (so-called Aarhus
report) on SOS ([[#plotkin81|Plotkin81]]) has attracted more than 1000 citations according to the CiteSeer [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/673965.html], 
making it one of the most cited technical reports in [[Computer Science]].
