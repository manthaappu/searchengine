The m50734 is a high-performance 8-bit single-chip CMOS microcontroller that is fully compatible with Mitsubishi's Series 740 family. This ROM/RAM-less device includes an array of on-chip functions such as UART, Serial I/O, A/D, Watchdog timer, VCU, 32parallel I/O ports. A choice of 8 and 16-bit timers to manage real time tasks. The instruction set of M50734 is upward compatible with the 6502 microprocessor.

Incorporated into this particular IC are the following;

* Enhanced [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] processor
* 24 input/output (I/O) lines
* Four Analogue to Digital (A/D) converters
* Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter ([[UART]])
* High-speed interprocessor link
* Power-down SLEEP mode
* Extended memory addressing

== Outline ==

The M50734SP/FP and the M50734SP/FP-10 are unique CMOS LSI microprocessor with UART, clocked serial I/O, A-D converter, VCU, watchdog timer  and 32-bit parallel I/O arranged around the M5040 CPU core. Since the M50734SP has multiple internal timers for real-time control, it is ideal for controlling office automation equipment such as printers, typewriters, plotters, copy machines, FAX and handy word processors.  Use of the CMOS process enables low power consumption, making the M50734SP also suitable for applications where battery-powered operation is required.

The difference between the M50734SP and the M50734FP, or between the M50734SP-10 and the M50734FP-10 lies only in the package. The difference between the M50734SP/FP and the M50734SP/FP-10 lies only in the clock frequency (max).
