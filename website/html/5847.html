 }}</ref> is a ring-based election algorithm used to find a process with the largest identification. It is a useful method of [[Leader election|election]] in decentralised [[distributed computing]].

== The algorithm ==

The algorithm assumes that each process has a Unique Identification (UID) and that the processes can arrange themselves in a [[unidirectional ring]] with a communication channel going to the clockwise and anticlockwise neighbour. The 2 part algorithm can be described as follows:

# Initially each process in the ring is marked as ''non-participant''.
# A process that notices a lack of leader starts an election. It marks itself as ''participant'' and creates an ''election message'' containing its UID. It then sends this message clockwise to its neighbour.
# When a process receives an ''election message'' it compares the UID with its own, if the current process has a larger UID it replaces the one in the ''election message'' with its UID. The process then marks itself as ''participant'' and again forwards the ''election message'' in a clockwise direction.
# If the process was already marked as ''participant'' when it receives an ''election message'' the procedure is different. In this case it will compare the UID as before but only forward the ''election message'' if it has needed to replace the UID.

The algorithm finishes when a process receives an ''election message'' containing its own UID. Then the second stage of the algorithm takes place

# This process marks itself as ''non-participant'' and sends an ''elected message'' to its neighbour announcing its election and UID.
# When a process receives an ''elected message'' it marks itself as ''non-participant'' records the elected UID and again forwards the ''elected message''.
# When the ''elected message'' reaches the newly elected process the election is over.

Assuming there are no failures this algorithm will finish.

== Properties ==
The algorithm respects [[safety (computer science)|safety]]: a process will receive an elected message with its own UID only if his UID is greater than others', and only when all processes agree on the same UID. The algorithm also respects [[liveness]]. "Participant" and "not participant" states are used so that when multiple processes start an election at roughly the same time, only a single winner will be announced.

When there's a single process starting the election, the algorithm requires 3N-1 sequentially messages, in the worst case. Worst case is when the process starting the election is the immediate following to the one with greatest UID: it takes N-1 messages for the election message to reach it, then N messages for it to get back its own UID, then other N messages to send everyone in the ring the elected message.

This algorithm is not very fault tolerant. Fault tolerance can be increased If every process knows the whole topology, by introducing ACK messages and skipping faulty nodes on sending messages.
