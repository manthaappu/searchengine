This article is a criticism of [[Science]] in the restricted contemporary sense. In other words, the system of acquiring knowledge based on the [[scientific method]], and to the organized body of knowledge gained through such [[research]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/science |title=Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary |quote= knowledge or a system of knowledge covering general truths or the operation of general laws especially as obtained and tested through scientific method '''. . .'''}}</ref> These critiques are aimed at the methodology of research, philosophy of science, and the role science plays in the media and politics.

==Philosophical critiques==
Historian [[Jacques Barzun]] termed science "a [[faith]] as [[fanaticism|fanatical]] as any in [[history]]" and warned against the use of scientific thought to suppress considerations of [[meaning]] as integral to [[human]] existence.<ref>Jacques Barzun, ''Science: The Glorious Entertainment'', Harper and Row: 1964. p. 15. (quote) and Chapters II and XII.</ref> 

Philosopher of science [[Paul K Feyerabend]] advanced the idea of [[epistemological anarchism]], which holds that there are no useful and exception-free [[methodology|methodological rules]] governing the [[scientific progress|progress of science]] or the growth of [[knowledge]], and that the idea that science can or should operate according to universal and fixed rules is unrealistic, pernicious and detrimental to science itself.<ref name="contra">{{cite book | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul |authorlink = Paul Feyerabend | title = Against Method | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 1993 | isbn = 9780860916468 }}</ref> Feyerabend advocates treating science as an [[ideology]] alongside others such as [[religion]], [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[mythology]], and considers the dominance of science in society [[authoritarian]] and unjustified.<ref name="contra"/> He also contended (along with [[Imre Lakatos]]) that the [[demarcation problem]] of distinguishing science from [[pseudoscience]] on objective grounds is not possible and thus fatal to the notion of science running according to fixed, universal rules.<ref name="contra"/> 

Feyerabend also criticized science for not having evidence for its own philosophical precepts. Particularly the notion of Uniformity of Law and the Uniformity of Process across time and space, as noted by [[Steven Jay Gould]].<ref>{{cite book

  | isbn = 0674891988}}</ref> "We have to realize that a unified theory of the physical world simply does not exist" says Feyerabend, "We have theories that work in restricted regions, we have purely formal attempts to condense them into a single formula, we have lots of unfounded claims (such as the claim that all of chemistry can be reduced to physics), phenomena that do not fit into the accepted framework are suppressed; in physics, which many scientists regard as the one really basic science, we have now at least three different points of view...without a promise of conceptual (and not only formal) unification".<ref>{{cite book | isbn = 0860911845 | title = Farewell To Reason| page = 100 | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1987 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}</ref> In other words, science is [[begging the question]] when it presupposes that there is a universal truth with no proof thereof.

Professor [[Stanley Aronowitz]] scrutinizes science for operating with the presumption that the only acceptable criticisms of science are those conducted within the methodological framework that science has set up for itself. That science insists that only those who have been inducted into its community, through means of training and credentials, are qualified to make these criticisms.<ref>{{cite book | isbn = 0816616590 | title = Science As Power: Discourse and Ideology in Modern Society | page = viii (preface) | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | last = Aronowitz | first = Stanley | year = 1988 | authorlink = Stanley Aronowitz}}</ref>  Aronowitz also alleges that while scientists consider it absurd that [[Fundamentalist Christianity]] uses biblical references to bolster their claim that the bible is true, scientists pull the same tactic by using the tools of science to settle disputes concerning its own validity.<ref>Stanley Aronowitz in conversation with Derrick Jensen in {{cite book | isbn = 1931498520 | title = Welcome to the Machine: Science, Surveillance, and the Culture of Control | page = 31 | publisher = Chelsea Green Publishing Company | last = Jensen | first = Derrick | year = 2004 | authorlink = Derrick Jensen}}</ref>

Philosopher [[Alan Watts]] criticized science for operating under a materialist model of the world that he posited is simply a modified version of the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic worldview]], that "the universe is constructed and maintained by a Lawmaker" (commonly identified as [[God]] or the [[Logos]]). Watts asserts that during the rise of secularism through the 18th to 20th century when scientific philosophers got rid of the notion of a lawmaker they kept the notion of law, and that the idea that the world is a material machine run by law is a presumption just as unscientific as religious doctrines that affirm it is a material machine made and run by a lawmaker.<ref>Alan Watts Audio lecture "Myth and Religion: Image of Man" and "Out Of Your Mind, 1: The Nature of Consciousness: 'Our image of the world' and 'The myth of the automatic universe'"</ref>

===Epistemology===

David Parkin compared the [[epistemology|epistemological]] stance of science to that of [[divination]].<ref>{{harvnb|Parkin|1991}} "Simultaneity and Sequencing in the Oracular Speech of Kenyan Diviners", p. 185.</ref> He suggested that, to the degree that divination is an epistemologically specific means of gaining insight into a given question, science itself can be considered a form of divination that is framed from a Western view of the nature (and thus possible applications) of knowledge.

[[Philosopher]] and [[polymath]] [[Robert Anton Wilson]] stresses that the instruments used in scientific investigation produce meaningful answers relevant only to the instrument, and that there is no objective vantage point from which science could verify its findings since all findings are relative to begin with.<ref name="Anton Wilson 1999 4">{{cite book | isbn = 1-56184-002-5 | title = The New Inquisition | page = 4 | publisher = New Falcon Publications | last = Anton Wilson | first = Robert | year = 1999 | authorlink = Robert Anton Wilson}}</ref>

The field of [[ecophenomenology]] disregards science and technology on ontological grounds, and calls for an openness to the "essential elements of human experience with the world".<ref>Stefanovic, 1994: 68</ref> It wants "to enter... into the sensorial present",<ref>Abram, 1996: 272</ref> and to "recover the moral sense of our humanity" by "recover[ing] first the moral sense of [[nature]]".<ref>Kohak, 1984: 13</ref> As an invocation to adopt "a kind of deliberate naivety through which it is possible to encounter a world unencumbered with presuppositions."<ref>ibid: 57</ref> Ecophenomenologists argue that the current environmental crisis is equally physical and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]], and that a fundamental re-conceptualization of human relationships with the natural earth is necessary to help undo the damage done by a culture that takes part in utilitarian exploitation of the natural world. Its because of this that ecophenomenologists attempt to probe beneath western understandings of [[philosophy]], [[temporality]], and [[teleology]], as well as economic, social, and scientific evaluations of nature.

===Ethics===

Several academics have offered critiques concerning [[ethics]] in science. In ''Science and Ethics'', for example, the philosopher [[Bernard Rollin]] examines the relevance of ethics to science, and argues in favor of making education in ethics part and parcel of scientific training.<ref>{{cite book

 | title=Science and Ethics
 | publisher=Cambridge University Press

Many recent thinkers, such as [[Carolyn Merchant]], [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[E. F. Schumacher]] considered that the 17th century [[scientific revolution]] shifted science from a focus on understanding [[nature]], or [[wisdom]], to a focus on manipulating nature, i.e. [[power (sociology)|power]], and that science's emphasis on manipulating nature leads it inevitably to manipulate people, as well.<ref name=UW>Fritjof Capra, ''Uncommon Wisdom'', ISBN 0-671-47322-0, p. 213</ref> Science's focus on quantitative measures has led to critiques that it is unable to recognize important qualitative aspects of the world.<ref name=UW/>

==Media perspectives==
The [[mass media]] face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole. Determining how much weight to give different sides in a [[scientific debate]] requires considerable expertise regarding the matter.<ref>{{cite web

==Politics==
Many issues damage the relationship of science to the media and the use of science and scientific arguments by [[politician]]s. As a very broad generalisation, many politicians seek certainties and ''facts'' whilst scientists typically offer probabilities and caveats. However, politicians' ability to be heard in the [[mass media]] frequently distorts the scientific understanding by the public. Examples in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] include the controversy over the [[MMR vaccine|MMR inoculation]], and the 1988 forced resignation of a Government Minister, [[Edwina Currie]] for revealing the high probability that battery eggs were contaminated with ''[[Salmonella]]''.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/3/newsid_2519000/2519451.stm "1988: Egg industry fury over salmonella claim"], "On This Day," BBC News, December 3, 1988.</ref>

Some scientists and philosophers suggest that scientific theories are more or less shaped by the dominant political, economic, or cultural models of the time, even though the scientific community may claim to be exempt from social influences and historical conditions.<ref>{{cite book | isbn = 9780860916468 | title = Against Method | page = 66 | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1983 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | isbn = 0816616590 | title = Science As Power: Discourse and Ideology in Modern Society | pages = 272–273, 276 | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | last = Aronowitz | first = Stanley | year = 1988 | authorlink = Stanley Aronowitz}}</ref>  For example, [[Zoologist]] [[Peter Kropotkin]] thought that the Darwinian theory of evolution overstressed a painful "we must struggle to survive" way of life, which he said was influenced by [[Capitalism]] and the struggling lifestyles people lived within it.<ref name="Anton Wilson 1999 4"/><ref>{{cite book | isbn = 140431945X | title = Mutual Aid | page = Preface to the 1914 edition | publisher = Porter Sargent | last = Kropotkin | first = Peter | year = 1955 | authorlink = Robert Anton Wilson}}</ref>  Karl Marx also thought that science was largely driven by and used as capital<ref>{{cite book | isbn = 0816616590 | title = Science As Power: Discourse and Ideology in Modern Society | page = 40 | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | last = Aronowitz | first = Stanley | year = 1988 | authorlink = Stanley Aronowitz}}</ref>

Robert Anton Wilson, Stanley Aronowitz, and Paul Feyerabend all thought that the [[military-industrial complex]], large [[corporation]]s, and the grants that came from them had an immense influence over the research and even results of Scientific experiments.<ref name="contra"/><ref>Wilson, Robert Anton: 1999, pg 92</ref><ref>{{cite book | isbn = 0860911845 | title = Farewell To Reason| page = 102 | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1987 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | isbn = 0816616590 | title = Science As Power: Discourse and Ideology in Modern Society | page = 20 | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | last = Aronowitz | first = Stanley | year = 1988 | authorlink = Stanley Aronowitz}}</ref> Aronowitz even went as far as to say "It does not matter that the scientific community ritualistically denies its alliance with economic/industrial and military power. The evidence is overwhelming that such is the case. Thus, every major power has a national science policy; the United States Military appropriates billions each year for "Basic" as well as "Applied" research"<ref>Ibid</ref>
