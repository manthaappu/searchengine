[[File:AIBO.JPG|thumb|right|The AIBO ERS-7]]'''AIBO''' ('''A'''rtificial '''I'''ntelligence ro'''BO'''t, homonymous with "pal" or "partner" in Japanese) was one of several types of [[robot]]ic [[pet]]s designed and manufactured by [[Sony]]; there have been several different models since their introduction on May 11, 1999. AIBO was discontinued in 2006.

==Overview==
Being able to walk, "see" its environment via camera and recognize spoken commands in Spanish and English; AIBO robotic pets are considered to be [[autonomous robot]]s since they are able to learn and mature based on external stimuli from their owner or environment, or from other AIBOs. Artist [[Hajime Sorayama]] created the initial designs for the AIBO.

The original designs are part of the permanent collections of MoMA and the [[Smithsonian Institution]].  The design won Sony and artist Sorayama the highest design award that may be conferred by Japan. On January 26, 2006 Sony announced that it would discontinue AIBO and several other products as of March, 2006 in Sony's effort to make the company more profitable. It also stopped development of the [[QRIO]] robot. AIBO will still be supported until 2013 (ERS7 model) and AIBO technology will continue to be developed for use in other consumer products.<ref> [http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/info/presen/05q3/qfhh7c000008adfe.html] [http://www.jp.aibo.com/support/clinic_info/notice_58.html]</ref>

AIBOware (the name is a trademark of Sony corporation), is the title given to the [[software]] the AIBO runs on its pink [[Memory Stick]]. The ''Life'' AIBOware allows the robot to be raised from pup to fully grown adult while going through various stages of development as its owner interacts with it. The ''Explorer'' AIBOware allows the owner to interact with a fully mature robot able to understand (though not necessarily willing to obey) 100 voice commands. Without the AIBOware, the AIBO will run in what is called "clinic mode" and can only perform basic actions.

Many AIBO owners enjoy teaching their pets new behaviors by reprogramming them (in Sony's special 'R-CODE' language). However, in October 2001, Sony sent a cease-and-desist notice to the webmaster of Aibopet, demanding that he stop distributing code that was retrieved by bypassing the [[copy protection]] mechanisms of the robot.  Eventually, in the face of many outraged AIBO owners, Sony released a programmer's kit for 'non-commercial' use.  The kit has now been expanded into three distinct tools:  R-CODE, AIBO Remote Framework, and the OPEN-R SDK.  These three tools are combined under the name AIBO Software Development Environment.  All of these tools are free to download and can be used for commercial or non-commercial use (Except for the OPEN-R SDK, which is specifically for non-commercial use). Since the first release of OPEN-R, several AIBO programming tools have been developed by university labs, including URBI <ref>[http://www.urbiforge.com/ URBI]</ref>, Tekkotsu <ref>[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tekkotsu/ Tekkotsu]</ref>, Pyro<ref>[http://pyrorobotics.org/ Pyro]</ref> and AiBO+<ref>[http://aiboplus.sourceforge.net AiBO+ home page]</ref>. The Open-R and gcc based toolchain has been updated by the community to use gcc 4.1.2, binutils 2.17 and newlib 2.15. The packaged version of the old and updated Aibo toolchain is available for Ubuntu in a PPA<ref>[http://launchpad.net/~csaba-kertesz/+archive/aiboplus Ubuntu PPA with Aibo toolchain]</ref>.

AIBO's complete vision system uses the [[Scale-invariant feature transform|SIFT]] algorithm, to recognise its charging station. The newest versions are equipped with a [[Wi-Fi]] connection, allowing them to send the pictures they take via email which led to the [[Roblog]].

AIBO's sounds were programmed by Japanese DJ/avant-garde composer [[Nobukazu Takemura]], fusing mechanic and organic concepts.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} The bodies of the "3x" series (Latte and Macaron, the round-headed AIBOs released in 2001) were designed by visual artist [[Katsura Moshino]].

==RoboCup==

The AIBO has seen use as an inexpensive platform for [[artificial intelligence]] research, because it integrates a computer, vision system, and articulators in a package vastly cheaper than conventional research robots. The [[RoboCup]] autonomous [[soccer]] [[:Category:Robotics competitions|competition]] had a "RoboCup Four-Legged Robot Soccer League" in which numerous institutions from around the world would participate. Competitors would [[Computer program|program]] a team of AIBO robots to play games of autonomous robot soccer against other competing teams.  The Four-Legged League ran from 1999 to 2008, although in the final year, many big-name universities did not compete as they had moved to the new NAO platform.  The University of New South Wales <ref>[http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~robocup/2010site/]</ref> was the most successful team in the League, making the final six times and winning three times.

==International AIBO Convention==
The International AIBO Convention takes place every year at Sony Robotics Tower in the Shinjuku prefecture. The first convention took place in 1999, on May 15. It was then set to May 2 to May 4. The 2009 convention, being in its tenth year, set attendance records. The convention usually features AIBO advertisements, free posters, free accessories, freeware/open-source downloads, an acoustic performance from best friends Mark Linn-Baker and Larry Sweeney, and "AIBO Shows".
