'''PICT''' is a [[computer graphics|graphics]] [[file format]] introduced on the original [[Apple Macintosh]] computer as its standard [[metafile]] format. It allows the interchange of graphics (both [[bitmap]]ped and [[vector graphics|vector]]), and some limited text support, between Mac applications, and was the native graphics format of [[QuickDraw]].

The original version, PICT 1, was designed to be as compact as possible while describing vector graphics. To this end, it featured single byte [[opcode]]s, many of which embodied operations such as "do the previous operation again". As such it was quite memory efficient, but not very expandable. With the introduction of the [[Macintosh II]] and Color [[QuickDraw]], PICT was revised to version 2. This version featured 16-bit opcodes and numerous changes which enhanced its utility. PICT 1 opcodes were supported as a subset for backward compatibility.

Within a Mac application, any sequence of drawing operations could be simply recorded/encoded to the PICT format by opening a "Picture", then closing it after issuing the required commands. By saving the resulting byte stream as a [[Resource fork|resource]], a ''PICT resource'' resulted, which could be loaded and played back at any time. The same stream could be saved to a data file on disk (with 512 bytes of unused header space added) as a PICT file.

With the change to [[Mac OS X]] and deprecation of QuickDraw, PICT was dropped in favour of [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) as the native metafile format, though PICT support is retained by many applications as it is so widely supported on the Mac.
