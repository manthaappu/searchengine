'''Program comprehension''' is a domain of computing science dealing with the processes (cognitive or others) used by [[software engineer]]s and [[code analysis]] to understand programs (during their evaluation, before their modification).

Program comprehension is also known as program understanding.

== Theories of program comprehension ==
Precursor work on program comprehension includes:
* Ruven Brooks' theory [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=803210].
* Ted J. Biggerstaff's concept assignment problem [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=257679].
* Anneliese von Mayrhauser's theory [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/wrapper.jsp?arnumber=402076].

== Conferences on program comprehension ==
Although major conferences in computing science welcome work on program comprehension, the International Conference on Program Comprehension [http://www.program-comprehension.org/] (formerly known as International ''Workshop'' on Program Comprehension until 2005 inclusive) is dedicated to research on program comprehension.
