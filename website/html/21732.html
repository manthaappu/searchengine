<html> <head> <title>Linear functional</title></head><body>:''This article deals with [[linear map]]s from a [[vector space]] to its field of [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s.  These maps '''may''' be [[functional (mathematics)|functionals]] in the traditional sense of functions of functions, but this is not necessarily the case.''

In [[linear algebra]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a '''linear functional''' or '''linear form''' (also called a '''[[one-form]]''' or '''covector''') is a [[linear map]] from a [[vector space]] to its field of [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s.   In [[Euclidean space|'''R'''<sup>n</sup>]], if [[euclidean vector|vectors]] are represented as [[column vector]]s, then linear functionals are represented as [[row vector]]s, and their action on vectors is given by the [[dot product]], or the [[matrix product]] with the [[row vector]] on the left and the [[column vector]] on the right.  In general, if ''V'' is a [[vector space]] over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k'', then a linear functional &fnof; is a function from ''V'' to ''k'', which is linear:
:<math>f(\vec{v}+\vec{w}) = f(\vec{v})+f(\vec{w})</math> for all <math>\vec{v}, \vec{w}\in V</math>
:<math>f(a\vec{v}) = af(\vec{v})</math> for all <math>\vec{v}\in V, a\in k.</math>

The set of all linear functionals from ''V'' to ''k'', Hom<sub>''k''</sub>(''V'',''k''), is itself a vector space over ''k''.  This space is called the [[dual space]] of ''V'', or sometimes the '''algebraic dual space''', to distinguish it from the [[continuous dual space]].  It is often written ''V''<sup>*</sup> or <math>\textstyle{V'}</math> when the field ''k'' is understood.

== Continuous linear functionals ==
{{see also|Continuous linear operator}}

If V is a [[topological vector space]], the space of [[continuous function|continuous]] linear functionals &mdash;  the ''[[continuous dual space|continuous dual]]'' &mdash; is often simply called the dual space.  If ''V'' is a [[Banach space]], then so is its (continuous) dual.  To distinguish the ordinary dual space from the continuous dual space, the former is sometimes called the ''algebraic dual''.  In finite dimensions, every linear functional is continuous, so the continuous dual is the same as the algebraic dual, although this is not true in infinite dimensions.

== Examples and applications ==
=== Linear functionals in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> ===
Suppose that vectors in the real coordinate space '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> are represented as column vectors

:<math>\vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix}x_1\\ \vdots\\ x_n\end{bmatrix}.</math>

Then any linear functional can be written in these coordinates as a sum of the form:

:<math>f(\vec{x}) = a_1x_1 + \cdots + a_n x_n.</math>

This is just the matrix product of the row vector [''a''<sub>1</sub> ... ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>] and the column vector <math>\vec{x}</math>:
:<math>f(\vec{x}) = [a_1 \dots a_n] \begin{bmatrix}x_1\\ \vdots\\ x_n\end{bmatrix}.</math>

=== Integration ===
Linear functionals first appeared in [[functional analysis]], the study of [[function space|vector spaces of functions]].  A typical example of a linear functional is [[integral|integration]]: the linear transformation defined by the [[Riemann integral]]

:<math>I(f) = \int_a^b f(x)\, dx</math> 

is a linear functional from the vector space C[''a'',''b''] of continuous functions on the interval [''a'', ''b''] to the real numbers.  The linearity of ''I''(&fnof;) follows from the standard facts about the integral:
:<math>I(f+g) = \int_a^b(f(x)+g(x))\, dx</math>
::<math>= \int_a^b f(x)\, dx + \int_a^b g(x)\, dx = I(f)+I(g)</math>
:<math>I(\alpha f) = \int_a^b \alpha f(x)\, dx</math>
::<math>= \alpha\int_a^b f(x)\, dx = \alpha I(f).</math>

=== Evaluation ===
Let ''P''<sub>n</sub> denote the vector space of real-valued polynomials of degree ≤''n'' defined on an interval [''a'',''b''].  If ''c'' &isin; [''a'', ''b''], then let ''ev''<sub>''c''</sub> : ''P''<sub>n</sub> &rarr; '''R''' be the '''evaluation functional''':
:<math>ev_c f = f(c).</math>
The mapping &fnof; &rarr; &fnof;(''c'') is linear since
:<math>(f+g)(c) = f(c) + g(c)</math>
:<math>(\alpha f)(c) = \alpha f(c).</math>

If ''x''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>n</sub> are ''n''+1 distinct points in [''a'',''b''], then the evaluation functionals ''ev''<sub>x<sub>i</sub></sub>, ''i''=0,1,...,''n'' form a [[basis of a vector space|basis]] of the dual space of ''P''<sub>n</sub>.  ({{harvtxt|Lax|1996}} proves this last fact using [[Lagrange interpolation]].)

=== Application to quadrature ===
The integration functional ''I'' defined above defines a linear functional on the [[linear subspace|subspace]] ''P''<sub>n</sub> of polynomials of degree ≤ ''n''.  If ''x''<sub>0</sub>, &hellip;, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> are ''n''+1 distinct points in [''a'', ''b''], then there are coefficients ''a''<sub>0</sub>, &hellip;, ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> for which

:<math>I(f) = a_0 f(x_0) + a_1 f(x_1) + \dots + a_n f(x_n)</math>

for all ''&fnof;'' &isin; ''P''<sub>''n''</sub>.  This forms the foundation of the theory of [[numerical quadrature]].

This follows from the fact that the linear functionals ''ev''<sub>x<sub>i</sub></sub> : ''&fnof;'' &rarr; ''&fnof;''(''x''<sub>''i''</sub>) defined above form a [[basis of a vector space|basis]] of the dual space of ''P''<sub>''n''</sub> {{harv|Lax|1996}}.

=== Linear functionals in quantum mechanics ===
Linear functionals are particularly important in [[quantum mechanics]].  Quantum mechanical systems are represented by [[Hilbert space]]s, which are [[antilinear|anti]]-[[linear isomorphism|isomorphic]] to their own dual spaces.  A state of a quantum mechanical system can be  identified with a linear functional.  For more information see [[bra-ket notation]].

=== Distributions ===
In the theory of [[generalized function]]s, certain kinds of generalized functions called [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] can be realized as linear functionals on spaces of [[test function]]s.

== Properties ==
* Any linear functional is either trivial (equal to 0 everywhere) or [[surjective]] onto the scalar field.  Indeed, this follows since the image of a vector [[linear subspace|subspace]] under a linear transformation is a subspace, so is the image of ''V'' under ''L''.  But the only subspaces (i.e., ''k''-subspaces) of ''k'' are {0} and ''k'' itself.  

* A linear functional is continuous if and only if its [[Kernel (linear operator)|kernel]] is closed {{harv|Rudin|1991|loc=Theorem 1.18}}.

* Linear functionals with the same kernel are proportional.

== Dual vectors and bilinear forms ==
{{See also|Hodge dual}}
Every non-degenerate [[bilinear form]] on a finite-dimensional space gives rise to an [[isomorphism]] from ''V'' to ''V''*.  Specifically, denoting the bilinear form on ''V'' by ( , ) (for instance in [[Euclidean space]] (''v'',''w'') = ''v''•''w'' is the [[dot product]] of ''v'' and ''w''), then there is a natural isomorphism  <math>V\to V^*:v\mapsto v^*</math> given by

: <math> v^*(w) := \langle v,  w\rangle. \, </math>

The inverse isomorphism is given by <math>V^* \to V : f \mapsto f^* </math> where &fnof;* is the unique element of ''V'' for which for all ''w'' &isin; ''V''

: <math> \langle f^*, w\rangle = f(w). \, </math>

The above defined vector ''v''* &isin; ''V''* is said to be the '''dual vector''' of ''v'' &isin; ''V''.

In an infinite dimensional [[Hilbert space]], analogous results hold by the [[Riesz representation theorem]].  There is a mapping ''V'' &rarr; ''V''* into the ''continuous dual space'' ''V''*.  However, this mapping is [[antilinear]] rather than linear.

==Visualizing linear functionals==
In finite dimensions, a linear function can be visualized in terms of its [[level set]]s.  In three dimensions, the level sets of a linear functional are a family of mutually parallel planes; in higher dimensions, they are parallel [[hyperplane]]s.  This method of visualizing linear functionals is sometimes introduced in [[general relativity]] texts, such as {{harvtxt|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973}}.

==Bases in finite dimensions==
===Basis of the dual space in finite dimensions===
Let the vector space ''V'' have a basis <math>\vec{e}_1, \vec{e}_2,\dots,\vec{e}_n</math>, not necessarily [[orthogonal]].  Then the [[dual space]] ''V''* has a basis <math>\tilde{\omega}^1,\tilde{\omega}^2,\dots,\tilde{\omega}^n</math> called the [[dual basis]] defined by the special property that
:<math> \tilde{\omega}^i (\vec e_j) = \left\{\begin{matrix} 1 &\mathrm{if}\ i=j\\ 0 &\mathrm{if}\ i\not=j.\end{matrix}\right. </math>
Or, more succinctly, 
:<math> \tilde{\omega}^i (\vec e_j) = \delta^i_j </math>
where δ is the [[Kronecker delta]].  Here the superscripts of the basis functionals are not exponents but are instead [[covariance and contravariance|contravariant]] indices.

A linear functional <math>\tilde{u}</math> belonging to the dual space <math>\tilde{V}</math> can be expressed as a [[linear combination]] of basis functionals, with coefficients ("components") ''u<sub>i</sub>'' ,
:<math>\tilde{u} = \sum_{i=1}^n u_i \, \tilde{\omega}^i. </math>
Then, applying the functional <math>\tilde{u}</math> to a basis vector ''e<sub>j</sub>'' yields
:<math>\tilde{u}(\vec e_j) = \sum_{i=1}^n (u_i \, \tilde{\omega}^i) \vec e_j = \sum_i u_i (\tilde{\omega}^i (\vec e_j)) </math> 
due to linearity of scalar multiples of functionals and pointwise linearity of sums of functionals.  Then
:<math> \tilde{u}({\vec e}_j) = \sum_i u_i (\tilde{\omega}^i ({\vec e}_j)) = \sum_i u_i \delta^i {}_j = u_j </math>
that is
:<math>\tilde{u} (\vec e_j) = u_j.</math>
This last equation shows that an individual component of a linear functional can be extracted by applying the functional to a corresponding basis vector.

=== The dual basis and inner product ===
When the space ''V'' carries an [[inner product]], then it is possible to write explicitly a formula for the dual basis of a given basis.  Let ''V'' have (not necessarily orthogonal) basis <math>\vec{e}_1,\dots, \vec{e}_n</math>.  In three dimensions (''n'' = 3), the dual basis can be written explicitly
:<math> \tilde{\omega}^i(\vec{v}) = {1 \over 2} \, \left\langle  { \sum_{j=1}^3\sum_{k=1}^3\epsilon^{ijk} \, (\vec e_j \times \vec e_k) \over \vec  e_1 \cdot \vec e_2 \times \vec e_3} , \vec{v} \right\rangle.</math>
for ''i''=1,2,3, where <math>\epsilon\,\!</math> is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]] and <math>\langle,\rangle</math> the inner product (or [[dot product]]) on ''V''.

In higher dimensions, this generalizes as follows
:<math> \tilde{\omega}^i(\vec{v}) = 
\left\langle
\frac{\underset{{}^{1\le i_2<i_3<\dots<i_n\le n}}{\sum}\epsilon^{ii_2\dots i_n}(\star \vec{e}_{i_2}\wedge\dots\wedge\vec{e}_{i_n})}{\star(\vec{e}_1\wedge\dots\wedge\vec{e}_n)}, \vec{v}
\right\rangle
</math>
where <math>\star</math> is the [[Hodge star operator]].
