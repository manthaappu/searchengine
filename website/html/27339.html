'''OpenBabel''' is [[free software]], a chemical [[expert system]] mainly used for converting [[chemical file format]]s. Due to the strong relationship to [[informatics (academic field)|informatics]] this program belongs more to the category [[cheminformatics]] than to [[molecular modelling]]. It is available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Unix]], and [[Mac OS]]. It is distributed under the [[GNU GPL]].

The project's stated goal is:
"Open Babel is a community-driven scientific project assisting both users and developers as a cross-platform program and library designed to support molecular modeling, chemistry, and many related areas, including interconversion of file formats and data."

==History==
OpenBabel and [[JOELib]] were derived from the [[OELib]] [[Cheminformatics]] library. In turn, [[OELib]] was based on ideas in the original chemistry program Babel and an unreleased [[object-oriented]] library called "OBabel."

==Major features==
* chemical expert system
* interconversion of many [[chemical file format]]s
* substructure search (based on [[Simplified molecular input line entry specification|SMARTS]])
* fingerprint calculation
* wrappers for [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Perl]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]/[[Mono (software)|Mono]]<ref>http://openbabel.org/</ref>
