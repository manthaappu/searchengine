<html> <head> <title>Ken Goldberg</title></head><body>'''Kenneth Y. Goldberg''' (1961-) is a Professor of Industrial Engineering and Operations
Research (IEOR), with a joint appointment in Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science (EECS), and in the School of Information at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He is also a member of the ''[[Berkeley Center for New Media]]''. He is an [[artist]], writer, inventor, and researcher in the field of [[robotics]] and [[automation]].

==Background==
Goldberg was born in  [[Ibadan]], [[Nigeria]] and grew up in  Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. He received a BS in Electrical Engineering and BS in Economics, ''summa cum laude'', from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1984. Goldberg also received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in 1990. He then taught in the department of computer science at the [[University of Southern California]] from 1991-1995 and was visiting faculty in 2000 at the [[MIT Media Lab]].

==Career==
Goldberg and his students develop new algorithms for Feeding, Fixturing,
Grasping and Assembly, with an emphasis on minimalist approaches that
require a minimum of sensing and complexity.  For his PhD dissertation,
Goldberg developed the first algorithm for orienting (feeding) polygonal
parts and proved that the algorithm can be used to orient any part up to
rotational symmetry. He also patented the kinematically yielding gripper,
a new [[robot]] gripper that complies passively to hold parts securely
without sensing. Named IEEE Fellow in 2005, Goldberg co-founded the [[IEEE]]
Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering and his work has resulted
in six United States [[patents]].

Goldberg is credited with developing the first robot with web
interface (August 1994). His subsequent project, the [[Telegarden]],
allowed remote visitors, via the Internet, to view, water, and plant
seeds in a living garden.  This project was online continuously for
nine years in the lobby of the [[Ars Electronica Center]].  Goldberg
is a leading researcher in networked [[telerobotics]] and has
developed a series of collaborative tele-operation systems such as the
Tele-Actor, in which a human moves through a remote environment guided
by remote participants via the Internet.

Goldberg is Founding Director of UC Berkeley's Art, Technology, and
Culture Colloquium, established in 1997.  This monthly speaker series
brings artists, writers, and curators such as [[Billy Klüver]],
[[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]] and [[Bruno Latour]] to give evening lectures and is
free and open to the public.  Goldberg is editor of several books,
including The Robot in the Garden: Telerobotics and Telepistemology in
the Age of the Internet (MIT Press, 2000), which explores what is
knowable at a distance.

For his research, Goldberg was awarded the [[National Science Foundation]]
Young Investigator Award in 1994, the [[National Science Foundation]]
Presidential Faculty Fellowship in 1995, the [[Joseph F. Engelberger]]
Robotics Award in 2000, the [[IEEE]] Major Educational Innovation Award in
2001.

As an artist, Goldberg's work has been exhibited at the
[[Whitney Biennial]], [[Venice Biennale]], Pompidou Center (Paris), Walker Art
Center, Ars Electronica (Linz Austria), [[File festival]] (São Paulo), ZKM (Karlsruhe), ICC Biennale
(Tokyo), Kwangju Biennale (Seoul), Artists Space, and The Kitchen (New
York). He has held visiting positions at [[San Francisco Art Institute]],
[[MIT Media Lab]], and the [[Art Center College of Design]].

''The Tribe'', a short film he co-wrote with his wife, [[Tiffany Shlain]] (who also directed and produced the film) was selected for the
2006 [[Sundance Film Festival]] and the 2006 [[Tribeca Film Festival]].
Goldberg's Ballet Mori project, performed by the San Francisco Ballet, won an Isadora Duncan Award in 2006.
