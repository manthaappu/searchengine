<html> <head> <title>Colatitude</title></head><body>In [[spherical coordinates]], '''colatitude''' is the [[complementary angle]] of the [[latitude]], i.e. the difference between 90° and the latitude.

==Astronomical use==
The colatitude is useful in [[astronomy]] because it refers to the [[zenith distance]] of the [[celestial pole]]s. For example, at [[42nd parallel north|latitude 42&deg;N]], [[Polaris]] (approximately on the North celestial pole) has an [[Celestial coordinate system#Altitude|altitude]] of 42°, so the distance from the [[zenith]] (overhead point) to Polaris is 90 - 42 = 48°.

Adding the declination of a star to the observer's colatitude gives the maximum latitude of that star (its angle from the [[horizon]] at [[culmination]] or upper transit). For example, if [[Alpha Centauri]] is seen with a latitude of 72° north (108° south) and its declination is known (60°S), then it can be determined that the observer's colatitude is 108 - 60 = 48 (i.e. their latitude is 90 - 48 = 42°S).

Stars whose declinations exceed the observer's colatitude are called [[circumpolar]] because they will never set as seen from that latitude. If an object's declination is further south on the celestial sphere than the value of the colatitude, then it will never be seen from that location. For example, Alpha Centauri will always be visible at night from [[Perth, Western Australia]] because the colatitude is 90 - 32 = 58, and 60 is greater than 58; on the other hand, the star will never rise in [[Juneau]] because its declination of -60° is less than -32° (the negation of Juneau's colatitude).
