The '''ASEA IRB''' is an industrial robot series for material handling, packing, transportation, polishing, welding, and grading.  Built in 1975, the robot allowed movement in 5 axes with a lift capacity of 6 [[Kilogram|kg]].  It was the world's first fully electrically driven and microprocessor-controlled robot, using [[Intel]]'s first chipset.

The ASEA IRB was constructed by [[Björn Weichbrodt]], [[Ove Kullborg]], [[Bengt Nilsson]] and [[Herbert Kaufmann]] and was manufactured by [[ASEA]] in [[Sweden]]/[[Västerås]]. The first model, IRB 6, was developed in 1972-1973 on assignment by the ASEA [[CEO]] [[Curt Nicolin]] and was shown for the first time at the end of August 1973. The example shown in the [[technical museum]] is the first robot that was sold. It was bought by Magnussons in [[Genarp]] to wax and polish rust-free tubes bent at 90° [[angle]]s. This robot was donated to the museum during ASEA's 100-year anniversary in 1983.

The IRB 6 sold 1900 copies during the next 17 years (1975-1992).  It became the [[Sweden|Swedish]] symbol for a new [[Labour economics|Labour market]], shared between man and robot.<ref>{{cite web|title=IRB 6 The world's first completely fully electrically driven and microprocessor controlled robot.|url=http://www.tekniskamuseet.se/robotics/utst/fabriken/IRB6.htm}} 070516 tekniskamuseet.se (in [[Swedish language]])</ref>
