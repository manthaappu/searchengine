<html> <head> <title>DADiSP</title></head><body>'''DADiSP''' (Data Analysis and Display, pronounced day-disp) is a [[computer program]] developed by DSP Development Corporation which allows one to display and manipulate data series, [[matrix (math)|matrices]] and [[image]]s in an environment similar to a [[spreadsheet]].

A DADiSP Worksheet consists of multiple interrelated windows such that a change to the data in one window automatically updates all dependent windows. DADiSP includes a series based [[programming language]] called [[SPL (Programming Language)|SPL]] (Series Processing Language) used to implement custom [[algorithm]]s. 

DADiSP is widely used in the study of [[signal processing]], [[numerical analysis]] and [[statistical]] data analysis applications.

DADiSP was originally developed in the early 1980â€™s as part of a research project at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] to explore the aerodynamics of [[Formula One]] racing cars.
