'''OTP''' is the [[open source]] distribution of [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]] and an [[application server]] written in Erlang. [[Ericsson]] released Erlang as [[open source]] to ensure its independence from a single vendor and to increase awareness of the language.

It contains:
* an Erlang [[Interpreter (computing) | interpreter]];
* an Erlang [[compiler]];
* a protocol for communication between servers (nodes);
* a [[Corba]] [[Object Request Broker]];
* a distributed database server ([[Mnesia]]) and
* lots of libraries.

Since it was released as open source in 1998, Erlang has been used by several companies worldwide, including [[Nortel Networks|Nortel]] and [[T-Mobile]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Who uses Erlang for product development?|work=Frequently asked questions about Erlang|url=http://www.erlang.org/faq/faq.html#AEN50|accessdate=2007-07-16|quote=''The largest user of Erlang is (surprise!) Ericsson. Ericsson use it to write software used in telecommunications systems. Many (dozens) projects have used it, a particularly large one is the extremely scalable AXD301 ATM switch.'' Other commercial users listed as part of the FAQ include: Nortel, Deutsche Flugsicherung (the German national [[air traffic control]] organisation), and T-Mobile.}}</ref>. Although Erlang was designed to fill a niche and has remained an obscure language for most of its existence, its popularity is growing due to demand for concurrent services<ref>{{cite web|title=Programming Erlang|url=http://www.ddj.com/linux-open-source/201001928?cid=RSSfeed_DDJ_OpenSource|accessdate=2008-12-13|quote=Virtually all language use shared state concurrency. This is very difficult and leads to terrible problems when you handle failure and scale up the system...Some pretty fast-moving startups in the financial world have latched onto Erlang; for example, the Swedish www.kreditor.se.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Erlang, the next Java|url=http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/userblogs/ralph/blogView?showComments=true&entry=3364027251|accessdate=2008-10-08|quote=I do not believe that other languages can catch up with Erlang anytime soon. It will be easy for them to add language features to be like Erlang. It will take a long time for them to build such a high-quality VM and the mature libraries for concurrency and reliability. So, Erlang is poised for success. If you want to build a multicore application in the next few years, you should look at Erlang.}}</ref>.

Projects using Erlang include [[ejabberd]] - an [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]] instant messaging server, [[Wings 3D]] - a 3D modeller, the [[Yaws (web server)|Yaws]] web server, Yahoo! Delicious<ref>http://blog.socklabs.com/2008/09/erlang_is_delicious_cufp_slide</ref> and the Facebook Chat system<ref>http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=16787213919&id=9445547199&index=2</ref>.
