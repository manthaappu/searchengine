'''Stars''' is a [[computer graphics]] effect used by [[computer games]]. The effect takes the bright parts of a rendered image of the scene, and then smears them outward in a number of directions. The result is that bright areas have streaks emanating from them. Stars can be used to enhance [[Bloom (Shader Effect)|blooming]]. The effect is also sometimes known as ''light streaks'' or just as the ''star effect''.
