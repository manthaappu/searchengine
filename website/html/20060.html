<html> <head> <title>John S. Paraskevopoulos</title></head><body>'''John Stefanos Paraskevopoulos''' (June 20, 1889 &ndash; March 15, 1951) was a Greek/South African [[astronomer]]. He was born in [[Piraeus]], [[Greece]] and graduated from the [[University of Athens]].  He served in the Greek army during the [[Balkan Wars]] and [[World War I]]. In 1919, he went to America for two years, spending part of that time working at [[Yerkes Observatory]] where he met and married Dorothy W. Block. In 1921, he returned to Athens where he became head of the [[Athens Observatory]].  He left this post due to a lack of funding and went to [[Arequipa]], [[Peru]] to work at Boyden Station, a branch of [[Harvard Observatory]], with a view to finding a more suitable location for it. The decision was made to move Boyden Station to [[South Africa]] due to better weather conditions, and Paraskevopoulos served there as director of [[Boyden Observatory]] in [[South Africa]] from 1927 to 1951. He co-discovered a couple of [[comet]]s. The  crater [[Paraskevopoulos (crater)|Paraskevopoulos]] on the [[Moon]] is named after him.
