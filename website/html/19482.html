'''Java Application Descriptor''' (JAD) files describe the [[MIDlet]]s ([[Java ME]] applications) that are distributed as [[JAR (file format)|JAR files]]. JAD files are commonly used to package [[Java (programming language)|Java]] applications or games that can be downloaded to mobile phones. Java applications enable Mobile phones to interact programmatically with online [[web services]], such as the ability to send [[SMS]] messages via [[GSM]] mobile internet or interact in multiplayer games. Some BlackBerry devices use JAD files for themes.

Recent [[midlet]]s contain a manifest file in the [[JAR (file format)|JAR archive]]. This file contains much of the information stored in the JAD file, rendering it unnecessary in most cases.

==JAD files format==
<pre>
MIDlet-1: <Application name>, <icon path>, <midlet class>
MIDlet-Jar-Size: <Size in bytes>
MIDlet-Jar-URL: <Associated JAR file>
MIDlet-Name: <Application name>
MIDlet-Vendor: <Company>
MIDlet-Version: <Application version number>
MicroEdition-Configuration: <CLDC version>
MicroEdition-Profile: <MIDP version></pre>

==JAD mime type==
The [[MIDP2]] specification  instructs that web servers should serve JAD files with a [[MIME type]] of "<tt>text/vnd.sun.j2me.app-descriptor</tt>". If this mime type is not correctly configured, many phones will fail to install the [[midlet]].
