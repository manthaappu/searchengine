<html> <head> <title>Cognitive password</title></head><body>A '''cognitive password''' is a form of [[Authentication|knowledge-based authentication]] that requires a user to answer a question, presumably something they intrinsically know, to verify their identity.  Cognitive password systems have been researched for many years, and are currently commonly used as a form of secondary access.  Cognitive passwords were developed to overcome the common memorability vs. [[Password strength|strength]] problem that exists with the traditional password.  Cognitive passwords, when compared to other password systems, can be measured through the usage of a memorability vs. guessability ratio.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Shon |title=Mike Meyers' CISSP(R) Certification Passport|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2002|edition=illustrated|series=Mike Meyers' certification passport Passport Series|pages=36|chapter=2|isbn=9780072225785|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Vp3MEDK0E7sC}}</ref>

==History==
Research on passwords as an authentification method has struggled between memorability and strong security <ref name="zh1990a724">(Zviran and Haga, 1990a, p. 724)</ref>.  Passwords that are easily remembered are easily [[Password cracking|cracked]] by attackers.  On the other hand [[Password strength|strong passwords]] are difficult to crack, but also difficult to remember <ref>(Zviran and Elrich, 2006, p. 93)</ref>  When passwords are difficult to remember, users may write them down, and the secrecy of the password is compromised <ref>(Zviran and Haga, 1999, p. 173)</ref>.  Early research looking into this tradeoff between security and usability looked to develop a password system that utilized easily remembered personal facts and encouraged user participation.  This line of research resulted in the concept of the associative password, a password system based on [[Sensory cue|user selected cues]] and responses <ref>(Smith, 1987)</ref>.  This concept of associative passwords was extended to a pre-specified set of questions and answers that users would be expected to know and easily recall <ref>(Zviran and Haga, 1990a, p.723)</ref>.

==Cognitive questions==
At the core of a cognitive password system lies the questions.  These questions were designed to be more memorable than the standard username/password authentication method.  As such, a measure of the strength of a cognitive password is the memorability/guessability ratio <ref>(Bunnell et. al, 1997, p. 631)</ref>.
===Question Development===
Questions developed for cognitive password systems are classified as being either fact or opinion based.  Fact based question are questions with answers that are considered independent of an individuals feelings, such as "What is the name of the high school you attended?".  Opinion based questions are the opposite, and as the name implies, have answers based on personal opinions such as, "What is your favorite color?" <ref name="zh1990a724"/>.  Later research developed a set of criteria for question selection which included generalized answerability, number of potential answers, and generalized lack of ambiguity.  The first criteria suggested that questions should be answerable by all (i.e. not asking "When did you purchase your first home?" because not all users may have purchased homes).  The second criteria recommended selecting questions with a sufficiently large set of potential answers (i.e. not asking "How many children do you have?" because a majority of people would answer 0, 1 or 2).  The final criteria looked for questions that were as unambiguous as possible (i.e. not asking "How many family members do you have?" as there may be some confusion as to who would be included in that count)<ref>(Bunnell et. al, 1997, p. 633)</ref>.

===Memorability vs. guessability===
A user's ability to correctly recall their password is expected to decrease as time progresses<ref>(Brown et al., 2004, p. 642)</ref>.  However, the memorability of cognitive passwords remain relatively stable over time, with recall rates significantly higher than traditional passwords<ref name="bea1997635">(Bunnell et. al, 1997, p. 635)</ref><ref>(Zviran and Haga, 1990a, p.728)</ref>.  When fact and opinion-based questions are compared, the fact-based questions are more likely to be correctly remembered than opinion-based questions, but still far more likely than traditional passwords<ref name="bea1997635"/>.  Cognitive questions, with a group averaged as a whole, show relatively high guessability, much higher than traditional passwords but when analyzed individually, certain questions have been shown to have acceptable memorability/guessability ratios <ref name="bea1997635"/>.

==Examples==
The following are some typical cognitive password questions:
* What is your mother’s maiden name?
* Who is your favorite superhero?
* What is your dog’s name?
* What is your car's name?
* What is your favorite movie?
* What city were you born in?
* What is your [[favorite color]]?
