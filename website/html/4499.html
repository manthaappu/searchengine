He is also Director of the Centre for Object Technology and Applications at [[University of Technology Sydney]].

== Biography ==
Henderson-Sellers has received a BSc and A.R.C.S. in Mathematics from the [[Imperial College London]] in 1972, a MSc from the [[Reading University]] in 1973, and a PhD from the [[Leicester University]] in 1976.

From 1976 to 1983 he was a lecturer in the Department of Civil Engineering at the [[University of Salford]] in England and from 1983 at the department of mathematics. In 1988 he emigrated to Australia and became associate professor in the school of Information Systems at the [[University of New South Wales]]. In 1990, he founded the Object-Oriented Special Interest Group of the Australian Computer Society. He is co-founder and leader of the international OPEN Consortium. Currently he is professor of Information Systems at the [[University of Technology Sydney]]. He is also Director of the Centre for Object Technology and Applications at [[University of Technology Sydney]].<ref name="HP09">[http://www-staff.it.uts.edu.au/~brian/ Home Page] of Brian Henderson-Sellers.

He is also Editor of the "International Journal of Agent-Oriented Software Engineering" and on the editorial board of the "Journal of Object Technology" and "Software and Systems Modelling" and was for many years the Regional Editor of Object-Oriented Systems, a member of the editorial board of Object Magazine/Component Strategies and Object Expert.<ref name="HP09"/> And he is associate editor of the "Enterprise Modelling and Information Systems Architectures" journal.<ref>[http://www.wi-inf.uni-duisburg-essen.de/MobisPortal/documents/Flyer.pdf Enterprise Modelling and Information Systems Architectures] An International Journal. Accessed May 26, 2009.</ref> Also he is a frequent, invited speaker at international OT conferences.

In July 2001 Henderson-Sellers was awarded a Doctor of Science (DSc) from the [[University of London]] for his research contributions in object-oriented methodologies.<ref>[http://www.imperial.ac.uk/P3046.htm Awards and Appointments - November 2001] Accessed may 27 2009.</ref>

== Work ==
His research interests are [[object-oriented analysis]] and design, object-oriented metrics, agent-oriented methodologies, and the migration of organizations to object technology.<ref name="HP09"/>

=== Object-oriented Process, Environment and Notation ===
Object-oriented Process, Environment and Notation (OPEN) is a third-generation, public domain, fully [[object-oriented]] methodology and process. It encapsulates business issues, quality issues, modelling issues and reuse issues within its end-to-end [[SDLC|lifecycle]] support for [[software development]] using the [[object-oriented]] paradigm. OPEN provides flexibility. Its metamodel-based framework can be tailored to individual domains or projects taking into account personal skills, organizational culture and requirements peculiar to each industry domain".<ref>[http://www.open.org.au/ Object-oriented Process, Environment and Notation]. Accessed may 27 2009.</ref>

== Publications ==
Henderson-Sellers is author of numerous papers<ref>[http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/h/Henderson=Sellers:Brian.html Brian Henderson-Sellers] List of publications from the DBLP Bibliography Server.
