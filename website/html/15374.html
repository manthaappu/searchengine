The '''Global Observer™''' is an [[AeroVironment]] concept for a high-altitude, long endurance [[unmanned aerial vehicle]], designed by [[AeroVironment]] (AV) to operate as a stratospheric geosynchronous satellite system with regional coverage.

Two Global Observer aircraft, each flying for up to a week at an altitude of between 55,000 – 65,000 feet, could alternate coverage over any area on the earth, providing a platform for communications relays, remote sensing, or long-term surveillance.

In addition to flying above weather and above other conventional aircraft, operation in this altitude regime permits communications and sensor payloads on the aircraft to service an area on the surface of the earth up to 600 miles in diameter, equivalent to more than 280,000 square miles of coverage. Global Observer may offer greater flexibility than a satellite and longer duration than conventional manned and unmanned aircraft.

The Global Observer is currently in development; its first flight was in August 2010,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/08/11/346040/global-observer-clears-wing-load-testing.html

==JCTD Program==

The Global Observer Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) program has the goal of helping solve the capability gap in persistent ISR and communications relay for the US military and homeland security.  The Global Observer JCTD is demonstrating a new stratospheric, extreme endurance UAV system that can be transition for post-JCTD development, extended user evaluation, and fielding.  This program is a joint program with the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and AeroVironment that started in September 2007 and will culminate in a Joint Operational Utility Assessment (JOUA) in 2011.

The program provides for the system development, production of two aircraft, development flight testing, and JOUA with ISR and communications relay payload.  The flight testing and JOUA will be conducted at the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base, California.
The primary objectives of the Global Observer JCTD Program are:

*Develop enabling technologies for a liquid hydrogen powered Global Observer UAS system.
*Design, build, and demonstrate the Global Observer UAS system for a 5 - 7 day endurance for 55,000 - 65,000 ft altitude missions with 380-pound, 2.8 kW payload   capacity. The system must be capable of being transported by a C-130 aircraft.
*Integrate and assess military utility of modular Global Observer payloads to address user identified gaps in ISR and communications relay.
*Evaluate system life cycle costs.

==Mission Possibilities==

'''Communications Relay'''
<br />
Global Observer offers satellite-like capabilities to enable affordable, persistent and seamless communications relay where mission operators need it most.  It also provides more bandwidth to interconnect and route data, enabling teams separated by topographical barriers to communicate with each other and to distant command center in real time.

'''Disaster Response'''
<br />
Global Observer provides hurricane/storm tracking, weather monitoring and sustained support such as: evacuation planning, relief operations and first response coordination.  With an advanced payload, Global Observer can provide alternative communications relay in the event assets such as: cell towers, microwave relays and satellite downlinks are damaged.

'''Maritime Operations'''
<br />
Global Observer can provide long-term surveillance over coastlines plagued by transport of illegal goods. This enables analysts to observe suspicious activity, determine patterns of behavior and identify threats to enable rapid and effective countermeasures/actions.

==Milestones==
The technologies behind Global Observer have been developed over decades of innovation at AV, tracing back to the first human powered airplane and through a series of revolutionary extreme altitude, solar-powered UAS.  Today Global Observer is poised to open the stratosphere for practical use in the same way that airplanes and satellites opened the skies and space during last century.

'''1977 Gossamer Condor''': First human-powered airplane.  Maximum efficiency in aeronautical and propulsion system design.

'''1981 Solar Challenger:''' First solar-powered piloted airplane to cross the English Channel (5+ hour flight).  High efficiency energy generation and storage. (Smithsonian)

'''1993 Pathfinder:''' Groundbreaking solar-powered, high altitude UAS.  Reached 50,000 feet in 1995.

'''2001 Helios:''' Solar-powered, high altitude UAS sets world altitude record for non-rocket powered aircraft - 96,863 feet.

'''2002 Pathfinder Plus:''' First successful relay of high-quality television signals, third-generation cell phone transmissions and Internet linkage from the stratosphere. (Smithsonian)

'''2005 Global Observer “Odyssey Prototype”:''' First liquid hydrogen fueled UAS. 1/3 scale, powered by fuel cell system.

'''2007 Joint Capabilities Technologies Demonstration:''' AV awarded Global Observer Joint Capability Technology Demonstration program, opens development and production facility.

'''2009 Propulsion System:''' Global Observer propulsion system achieves multi-day operation in atmospheric chamber to simulate flight conditions.

'''2010 Ground & Taxi Testing:''' Global Observer aircraft successfully completes ground and taxi testing in preparation for first flight.

'''2010 Wing Load Testing:''' Global Observer successfully completes Wing Load Testing (WLT).

'''2010 First Flight:''' Global Observer successfully completes maiden flight.
