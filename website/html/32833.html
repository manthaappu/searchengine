On some [[Unix-like]] platforms, '''SIGUNUSED''' is a [[Signal (computing)|signal]] that has no purpose at present but is intended for future use. The [[C preprocessor|symbolic constant]] for SIGUNUSED is defined in the [[header file]] <code>signal.h</code>. Symbolic signal names are used because signal numbers can vary across platforms.

==Etymology==
''SIG'' is a common [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] for signal names. ''UNUSED'' is the word ''unused''.

==Usage==
In [[Linux]] 2.6 on the [[x86]], [[PowerPC]] and [[SuperH]] [[computer architecture|architectures]], signal 31 is designated for future use as [[SIGSYS]]; since SIGSYS is currently unimplemented, the signal number is temporarily assigned to SIGUNUSED instead.
