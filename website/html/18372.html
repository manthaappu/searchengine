'''Information technology operations''', or '''IT operations''', are the [[superset]] of all processes and services that are both provisioned by an [[Information technology|IT]] staff to their internal or external [[wiktionary:client|clients]] and used by themselves, to run themselves as a [[business]].

The definition of IT operations differ throughout the IT [[industry]], where [[Distributor (business)|vendors]] and individual organizations often create their own custom definitions of such processes and services for the purpose of [[marketing]] their own products. Usually, they include [[management]], envisioning, [[planning]], [[design]], [[implementation]], construction, [[Software deployment|deployment]], [[Distribution (business)|distribution]], [[Software verification|verification]], [[Installation (computer programs)|installation]], instantiation, [[Execution (computers)|execution]] and [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]]. They endeavor to define common processes and procedures, policies, roles, responsibilities, [[terminology]], [[best practices]] and standards for running an enterprise.
