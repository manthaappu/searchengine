"Reasoning the fast and frugal way: Models of bounded rationality". Psychological Review, 103, 650-669.</ref>, when making a judgment based on multiple criteria, the criteria are tried one at a time according to their [[cue validity]], and a decision is made based on the first criterion which discriminates between the alternatives.

[[Gerd Gigerenzer]] and [[Daniel Goldstein]] discovered that the heuristic did surprisingly well at making accurate [[inferences]] in real-world environments, such as inferring which of two cities is larger. The heuristic has since been modified and applied to domains from [[medicine]], [[artificial intelligence]], and [[political forecasting]] <ref>Graefe, A., Armstrong,  J. S. (2010), "Predicting Elections from the Most Important Issue: A Test of the Take-the-best Heuristic" Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, DOI: 10.1002/bdm.710</ref> <ref>Czerlinski, J., Goldstein, D. G., & Gigerenzer, G. (1999). "How good are simple heuristics?" In Gigerenzer, G., Todd, P. M. & the ABC Group, ''Simple Heuristics That Make Us Smart''. New York: Oxford University Press.</ref>.
