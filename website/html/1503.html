'''Allan Alcorn''' is a pioneering [[electrical engineer|engineer]] and [[computer science|computer scientist]]. He grew up in [[San Francisco, California]], and attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[EECS|Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences]] in 1971.

== Work with Nolan Bushnell ==
He worked for the video pioneering company [[Ampex]], where he met [[Ted Dabney]] and several other people that would end up being constants through the [[Atari, Inc]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], Cyan Engineering and [[Pizza Time Theater]] companies.

Alcorn was the designer of the [[video arcade]] game ''[[Pong]]'', creating it under the direction of [[Nolan Bushnell|Bushnell]] and Dabney.  Pong was a hit in the 1970s.

In addition to direct involvement with all the breakout Atari products, such as the [[Atari 2600]], Alcorn was involved at some of the historic meetings of [[Steve Wozniak]] and [[Steve Jobs]] (at that time an Atari employee) presenting their [[Apple I]] prototype.

==After Atari==
After Alcorn left Atari in 1981, he consulted to many fledging companies in [[Silicon Valley]], especially involved in the startups of [[Catalyst Technologies]], one of the first technology company incubators, created by Nolan Bushnell and other ex-Atari leaders.

Alcorn was involved in several of the startups directly, including [[Cumma (game system)|Cumma]], a re-programmable video game cartridge/kiosk system (and precursor to the similar [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo Geo]] system), and an advisor to [[Etak]], one of the first practical, [[in-car navigation]] systems.

Alcorn later became an Apple Fellow, and led and consulted to a variety of startups during the tech boom.

In 1998, Alcorn co-founded [[Zowie Intertainment]], a spinoff from [[Interval Research]]. There he developed a child's [[playset]] with a location system that allowed a [[personal computer|PC]] to respond to the child's play.
