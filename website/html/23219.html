'''''Madonna''''' is the self-titled [[Album|debut album]] of American recording artist [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], released on July 27, 1983 by [[Sire Records]]. The album was re-released in 1985 for the European market and re-packaged as ''Madonna – The First Album''. In 1982, during establishing herself as a singer in New York downtown, Madonna met Seymour Stein, president of Sire Records, who signed her after listening to her single "[[Everybody (Madonna song)|Everybody]]". The success of the single prompted Sire to sign her for an album's deal. For the album, Madonna chose to work with [[Reggie Lucas]], a Warner Bros. producer. However, she was not happy with the completed tracks and disagreed with Lucas's production techniques, so decided to seek additional help with the production.

Madonna then invited her boyfriend at the time, [[John Benitez|John "Jellybean" Benitez]], to help her finish the album. Benitez remixed many of the tracks and produced "[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]".  The overall sound of ''Madonna'' is dissonant, and is in the form of upbeat synthetic disco, utilising some of the new technology of the time, like the usage of [[LinnDrum|Linn drum machine]], [[Moog Taurus|Moog bass]] and the [[:File:OB-X keyboard.jpg|OB-X synthesizer]]. The songs on the album are sung by Madonna in a bright, girlish vocal timbre, and lyrically talks about love and relationships. 

Contemporary critics have applauded the album, but it received negative feedback when it was released in 1983. In 2008, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' named it as the fifth of "Top 100 Best Albums of Past 25 Years." The album was successful on the charts, reaching number eight on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and the top ten of the charts in Australia, France, Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden and United Kingdom. It was certified five-times [[RIAA certification|platinum]], by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), for shipments of five million copies across the United States. Worldwide, the album has sold ten million copies.

Five singles were released from the album, with "[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]" becoming her first song to chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and "[[Lucky Star (song)|Lucky Star]]", her first top-five hit. The album was promoted by [[The Virgin Tour]] in 1985. Madonna has often remarked that she wished she had more variety in the songs of the album, and had more creative control. However, critics and scholars noted that with the album, Madonna introduced a style of upbeat dance music that would prove particularly appealing to future gay audiences. With ''Madonna'', she began her career as a disco diva.

In 1982, the 23-year-old Madonna was living in New York, and trying to set up her music career.<ref name="rook">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=4}}</ref> She was joined by her Detroit boyfriend [[Stephen Bray|Steve Bray]] who became the drummer of her band, the [[Breakfast Club (band)|Breakfast Club]], which played generally hard-rock music. Soon they abandoned playing songs in the hard-rock genre, and got signed by a music management company called Gotham Records, planning to move in a new musical direction.<ref name="madonnabbc">{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=27}}</ref> They decided to pursue the [[funk]] genre, but the record company was not happy with their musical talents and they were dropped from the label; Madonna and Bray left the band also.<ref name="rook"/> Meanwhile, she had written and developed some songs on her own. She carried rough tapes of three of the songs, "[[Everybody (Madonna song)|Everybody]]", "Ain't No Big Deal" and "[[Burning Up]]". At that time she was frequenting the [[Danceteria]] nightclub in New York. It was here that Madonna convinced the [[Disc jockey|DJ]] [[Mark Kamins]] to play "Everybody".<ref name="rook"/> The song was received positively by  the crowd, and Kamins decided that he should get Madonna a record deal, on the understanding that he would get to produce the [[single (music)|single]].<ref name="rook"/> He took her to his boss [[Chris Blackwell]], who owned [[Island Records]], but Blackwell refused to sign Madonna so they approached [[Sire Records]].<ref name=morton1>{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=142}}</ref> Michael Rosenblatt, who worked at the [[artists and repertoire]] department of Sire, offered Madonna $ 5,000 in advance, plus $ 10,000 in royalties, for each song she wrote.<ref name="rook2">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=5}}</ref><ref name=cross1>{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=25}}</ref> 

Madonna was ultimately signed for two [[12-inch single|12" singles]] by the President of Sire, Seymour Stein, who was impressed by her singing,<ref name="rook2"/> after listening to "Everybody" at a hospital in Lenox Hill where he was admitted.<ref name=cross1/> The 12" version of "Everybody" was produced by Mark Kamins at Blank Tapes Studios in New York, who took over the [[Record producer|production]] work from Steve Bray.<ref name=cross1/> The new recording ran 5:56 on one side and 9:23 for the dub version on the reverse side. Madonna and Kamins had to record the single at their own cost.<ref name=morton2>{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=143}}</ref> Arthur Baker, friend of Mark Kamins, guided him through the role of a [[record producer|music producer]] and provided him with keyboard player Fred Zarr.<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=145}}</ref> Due to the restrained budget, the recording was a hefty affair as Madonna could not understand Kamins' directions and Kamins himself faced problems directing. Rosenblatt wanted to release "Everybody" with "Ain't No Big Deal" on the other side, but later changed his mind and put "Everybody" on both sides of the [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]] after hearing the recorded version of "Ain't No Big Deal".<ref name=cross1/> The single was commercially released in October 1982 and became a dance hit in the United States. This led to Sire signing Madonna for an LP and two more singles.<ref name="rook2"/><ref name=morton146>{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=146}}</ref>

{{Quote box|width=250px|align=right|quote="I thought she had a lot of style, and she crossed over a lot of boundaries because everyone in the rock clubs played her – the black clubs, the gays, the straight – and very few records have that appeal. [...] However, she was unhappy with the whole damn thing, so I went in and sweetened up a lot of music for her, adding some guitars to 'Lucky Star', some voices, some magic. [...] I just wanted to do the best job I could do for her. When we would playback 'Holiday' or 'Lucky Star', you could see that she was overwhelmed by how great it all sounded. You wanted to help her, you know? As much as she could be a bitch, when you were in groove with her, it was very cool, very creative.|source=—John "Jellybean" Benitez talking about Madonna and the album.<ref name="rikky10"/><ref name="tara2">{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=77}}</ref>
 }}
For the album, Madonna opted not to work with either Kamins or Bray, but chose [[Reggie Lucas]], a Warner Bros. producer. Bray decided to push her in the musical direction of [[pop music|pop]], and recorded the song "[[Burning Up]]" with her.<ref name="rikky10">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=10}}</ref> However, Madonna still did not have enough material to warrant a full album. The songs available were, "[[Lucky Star (song)|Lucky Star]]", a new version of "Ain't No Big Deal", "Think of Me" and "I Know It". Lucas brought another two songs to the project, "Physical Attraction" and "[[Borderline (song)|Borderline]]".<ref name="rikky10"/> As he recorded the tracks he deviated considerably from the original versions of the demos. One such altered song was "Lucky Star". The song was written by Madonna for Kamins, who previously promised to play the track at Danceteria.<ref name="cross1"/> However, the track was instead used by Madonna for the album, which she planned to call ''Lucky Star''.<ref name="cross1"/> She believed that "Lucky Star", along with "Borderline", were the perfect foundation for her album. 

Problems arose between her and Lucas during the recording of the songs. Madonna was unhappy with the way the final versions turned out. According to her, Lucas used too many instruments and did not consider her ideas for the songs.<ref name="tara1">{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=76}}</ref> This led to a dispute between the two and, after finishing the album, Lucas left the project without tailoring the songs to Madonna's specifications; hence she called [[John Benitez|John "Jellybean" Benitez]], a DJ at Funhouse disco, to remix the available tracks.<ref name="rikky10"/> In the meantime, due to a conflict of interest, Bray had sold "Ain't No Big Deal" to an act on another label, rendering it unavailable for Madonna's project.<ref name="rikky10"/> It was Benitez who discovered a new song, written by Curtis Hudson and [[Paizo Publishing|Lisa Stevens]] of the pop group Pure Energy.<ref name="cross1">{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=26}}</ref> The song, titled "[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]", had been turned down by [[Phyllis Hyman]] and [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]], formerly of [[The Supremes]].<ref name="morton1">{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=158}}</ref> After vocals were recorded by Madonna, Benitez spent four days trying to enhance the commercial appeal of the track before the April 1983 deadline.<ref name="morton1"/><ref name="rikky10"/> Just before it was completed Madonna and Benitez took the tape over to their friend Fred Zarr's apartment in Brooklyn.<ref name="morton1"/> Zarr added a piano solo in the intermediate section of the track.<ref name="cross1"/>

The overall sound of ''Madonna'' is dissonant, and is in the form of upbeat synthetic disco, utilising some of the new technology of the time, like the usage of [[LinnDrum|Linn drum machine]], [[Moog Taurus|Moog bass]] and the [[:File:OB-X keyboard.jpg|OB-X synthesizer]]. These equipments have already dated since, consequently the sound of the album comes off as harsh.<ref name="rikky11">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=11}}</ref> Madonna commented on her debut album: "The songs were pretty weak and I went to England during the recordings so I wasn't around... I wasn't in control. [...] I didn't realise how crucial it was for me to break out of the disco mold before I'd already finished the [first] album. I wish I could have got a little more variety there."<ref name="rikky11"/> The album starts with the song "Lucky Star", a medium-paced dance track, beginning with a sparkle of synth [[note]] and is followed by heavy beats of [[electronic drum]] and [[Clapping|handclaps]].<ref name="rikky11"/> A guitar is played in high [[Ostinato|riff]] and a bubbling [[bass (sound)|bass]] synth is produced to accompany the guitar sound.<ref name="rikky11"/> The song revolves around the "Starlight, starbright" [[hook (music)|hook]] for more than a minute, before going to the [[chorus effect|chorus]]. According to author Rikky Rooksby, the lyrics are repetitive and inane, revolving around the transparent ambiguity of the stars, and juxtaposition of the male character with being a heavenly body in the sky.<ref name="rikky11"/> "Borderline" is a sentimental track, talking about a love that is never quite fulfilled.<ref name="tara2"/> According to author Santiago Fouz-Hernández and his book ''Madonna's drowned worlds'', the lyrics of the song like "Something in way you love me won't let me be/I don't want to be your prisoner so baby won't you set me free" depicted a rebellion against male chauvinism.<ref name="fouz">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hernández|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=67}}</ref> Madonna used a refined and expressive voice to sing the song, backed by Lucas's instrumentations.<ref name="tara2"/> [[bass (instrument)|Bass]] player Anthony Jackson provided the synths for the song.<ref name="rikky11"/> The chords in the song were inspired by Seventies disco sound in Philadelphia as well as [[Elton John]]'s musical style during the mid-seventies.<ref name="rikky11"/> The chord sequences cite from [[Bachman–Turner Overdrive]]'s song "[[You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet]]" while the synth phases display her typical musical style.<ref name="rikky12">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=12}}</ref>

The third track "Burning Up" has a starker arrangement, brought about by bass, [[Guitar|single guitar]] and [[drum machine]].<ref name="rikky12"/> The [[tom-tom drum]] beats used in the song were reminiscent to the records of singer [[Phil Collins]].<ref name="rikky12"/> It also incorporated electric guitars and the most state-of-the-art synthesizers of that time.<ref name="slant"/> The chorus is a repetition of the same three lines, while the [[Bridge (music)|bridge]] consists of a series of double entendres; the lyrics describing what Madonna is prepared to do for her lover, and that she is individualistic and shameless.<ref name="rikky12"/> Next track "I Know It" has a gentler swing to it and features music from piano, a [[saxophone]], synth phrases while having an offbeat chord change.<ref name="rikky12"/> "Holiday" consists of a [[Sequence (music)|four-bar sequence]], featuring instrumentation from guitars, electronic [[clapping|handclaps]] and synthesized string arrangement. A side-by-side repetitive progression is achieved by making use of the [[Chorus effect|chorus]].<ref name="rikky13">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=13}}</ref> Towards the end of the song, a change in the arrangement happens, where a piano [[Break (music)|break]] is heard. Lyrically, the song expresses the universal sentiment that everybody needs a holiday.<ref name="rikky13"/> In "Think of Me", Madonna warns her erring lover that he should pay her attention, else she would leave. The song consists beats from a snare-drum and a saxophone interlude. "Physical attraction" is a medium paced track, with synth bass, a guitar line, sounds of a [[Brass instrument|brass]] and Madonna singing in a shrill voice, about the attraction between herself and a boy.<ref name="rikky13"/> The last song on the album is "Everybody", which starts with a heavily [[Synthesizer|synthesized]] and spoken [[Introduction (music)|introduction]], with Madonna taking a loud intake of [[breathing|breath]].<ref name="rikky15">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=14}}</ref> She displayed her bubblegum-pop like voice in the song, which was also [[Doubletracking|doubletracked]].<ref name="rikky15"/>

The critical reception of the album changed over the time from negative to positive. Bill Lamb from [[About.com]] commented that "Madonna's album is state of the art dance-pop loaded with hits from 'Holiday' and 'Lucky Star' to 'Borderline'. Irresistible pop hooks glide across shimmering synth beats to make this a landmark album of the early 80's."<ref name="about"/> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] from [[Allmusic]] commented that "[Madonna's] eponymous debut isn't simply good, it set the standard for dance-pop for the next 20 years. Why did it do so? [...] Madonna's singing isn't particularly strong; the songs, while hooky and memorable, couldn't necessarily hold up on their own without the production — but taken together, it's utterly irresistible."<ref name="allmusic"/> Tony Power from ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' said that the album consisted of "quacking synths, overperky bass and state-of-the-art mechanical disco, with Madonna strapped to the wing rather than holding the controls. It's a breathless, subtlety-free debut, with overtones of [[Soft Cell]] and [[Tom Tom Club]]."<ref name="blender"/> While reviewing the remastered version of the album, released in 2001, Michael Paoletta from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' felt that "Nearly 20 years after the release of ''Madonna'', such tracks as 'Holiday', 'Physical Attraction', 'Borderline' and 'Lucky Star' remains irresistible."<ref name="bbissue"/>

Jim Farber from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the album an A, saying "[Madonna] might have wound up just another post-disco dolly if [the songs on the album] didn't announce her ability to fuse club beats with peerless pop."<ref name="ew"/> In July 2008, the magazine ranked the album at number 5 in their list of "Top 100 Best Albums of Past 25 Years.".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20207076_20207387_20207337,00.html |title=The New Classics: Music|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=2010-01-03}}</ref> Jonathan Ross from ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' said that "'Borderline' is sweet and 'Holiday' still fizzes with invention and joie de vivre....this quintessentially '80s dance hit also features a barrelhouse piano solo."<ref name="Qreview"/> [[Robert Christgau]] gave the album an A- and said, "In case you bought the con, disco never died — just reverted to the crazies who thought it was worth living for. This shamelessly ersatz blonde is one of them, and with the craftily orchestrated help of a fine selection of producers, remixers, and DJs, she's come up with a shamelessly ersatz sound that's tighter than her tummy — essence of electro, the D in DOR."<ref name="rc"/> Don Shewey from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' was of the opinion that "without overstepping the modest ambitions of minimal funk, Madonna issues an irresistible invitation to the dance."<ref name="rs"/> Sal Cinquemani from [[Slant (magazine)|Slant Magazine]] commented" "Heralding the synth-heavy movement was a debut album [''Madonna''] that sounds just as fresh today as it did almost two decades ago."<ref name="slant"/> The album also received a number of negative reviews at the time of its release. John Skow of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called her voice sounding as "[[Minnie Mouse]] on helium". Other detractors concurred, suggesting that Madonna was "almost entirely helium, a gas-filled, lighter-than-air creation of MTV and other sinister media packagers."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957012,00.html|title=Show Business: Madonna Rocks the Land|last=Skow|first=John|date=1985-05-27|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=Time Inc|pages=1|accessdate=2010-03-10}}</ref> Other critics  like Barry Walters from ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' commented that "She's a [[one-hit wonder]], she'll disappear after a year."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walter|first=Barry|date=April 1998|title=Madonna Just Made Her Most Daring Album in Years...|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|publisher=Spin Media LLC|volume=14|issue=4|issn=0886-3032|accessdate=2010-05-15|ref=harv}}</ref>

Madonna released five singles from the album. "[[Everybody (Madonna song)|Everybody]]" was released on October 6, 1982, as the debut single. Musically incorporating R&B infused beats, the song portrayed the image of Madonna as a black artist, since her picture did not appear on the single cover.<ref name="rikky12"/> However this misconception was cleared later when Madonna convinced Sire executives to allow her to shoot a music video for the song. The low-budget music video directed by Ed Steinberg portrayed Madonna and her friends singing and dancing in a club to the song. The video helped to promote the song and Madonna as an artist further.<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=332}}</ref> Critically the song did not receive any acclaim and failed to enter the official ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart, but charted on its dance charts.<ref>{{harvnb|Fouz-Hernández|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=66}}</ref> "[[Burning Up]]" was as the album's second single on March 9, 1983, in some countries as an A-side single with "Physical Attraction". It received mixed reviews from contemporary critics and authors, who noted the song's darker, urgent composition while praising its dance beats.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="ew"/> The single failed to do well commercially anywhere, except the dance chart in the United States, where it peaked at three, and the Australian Charts, where it was a top twenty hit.<ref name="kent"/> The accompanying music video of the song portrayed Madonna in the classic submissive female positions, while writhing in passion on an empty road, for her lover who appeared to come from her behind on a car. The video ended showing Madonna driving the car instead, thereby concluding that she was always in charge.<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=756}}</ref> "[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]" was released as the third single on September 7, 1983.  Commercially, the song was Madonna's first hit single when it entered the top twenty of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] while peaking its dance chart.<ref name="bb">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100?chartDate=1984-02-04&order=timeon|title=The Billboard Hot 100: Week Ending February 4, 1984|date=1984-02-04|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref> The song was also a crossover success, entering the top ten and top forty of many European countries.

"[[Borderline (song)|Borderline]]" was the fourth single from the album, and was released on February 15, 1984. Contemporary critics and authors applauded the song, calling it as harmonically the most complex song from the ''Madonna'' album and complimenting the [[dance-pop]] nature of the song. "Borderline" became Madonna's first top ten song on the Hot 100, peaking at ten. Elsewhere, the song reached the top twenty of a number of European nations while peaking the chart in Ireland.<ref name="dean">{{harvnb|Dean|2003|p=523}}</ref> In 2009, the song was placed at eighty-four on [[Blender (magazine)|Blender]] magazine's "The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born" article.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blender.com/lists/68125/500-greatest-songs-since-you-were-born-451-500.html?p=9|title=The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born |last=Staff|first=Blender|date=2009-04-01|work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]|publisher=Alpha Media LLC|accessdate=2009-07-20}}</ref> The accompanying music video portrayed Madonna, with a Latin man as boyfriend. She was enticed by a British photographer to pose and model for him, but later returned to her original boyfriend. The video generated interest amongst academics, who noted the use of power as symbolism in it.<ref name="fouz"/>"[[Lucky Star (song)|Lucky Star]]" was the fifth and final single from the album and was released on August 8, 1984. Both contemporary and old critics have praised the song, heralding it as the introduction to upbeat dance music.<ref name="allmusic"/> "Lucky Star" became Madonna's first top-five hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, when it reached the peak position of four, becoming the first of fifteen consecutive top five hits. It had already become Madonna's first number-one song on the Billboard dance charts, when it peaked the chart alongside previously released single "[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]".<ref name="allmusicsingles"/> The music video portrayed Madonna dancing in front of a white background, accompanied by her dancers. After the video was released, Madonna's style and mannerisms became a [[Bandwagon effect|fashion trend]] among the younger generation. Scholars noted that in the video, Madonna portrayed to herself as narcissistic and an ambiguous character. She referred herself as the "lucky star", unlike the lyrical meaning of the song.<ref name="mary2">{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=29}}</ref>

Madonna had promoted the album throughout 1983–84 by performing a series of "track dates", one-off gigs. These shows were done at New York City and London clubs like [[Danceteria]] and [[Koko (venue)|Camden Palace]] and on American and British television programs like [[American Bandstand]] and [[Top of the Pops]].<ref>{{harvnb|Voller|1999|p=33}}</ref> The album's singles were later performed on [[The Virgin Tour]] in 1985. It was Madonna's first concert tour and visited North American dates. The tour was critically panned but was a commercial success. Later authors have looked back at the tour and commented that it was clear that "[Madonna] was a bonafide pop star in the process of becoming a cultural icon."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sherman|first=Heidi|date=July 2001|title=10 Tours That Changed The World|journal=Spin|publisher=Spin Media LLC|volume=17|issue=7|issn=0886-3032|accessdate=2010-03-15|ref=harv}}</ref> Shari Benstock and Suzanne Ferriss noted the clothes and fashion in the tour and said, "Virgin Tour established Madonna as the hottest figure in pop music."<ref>{{harvnb|Benstock|Ferriss|1994|p=169}}</ref> A video compilation, titled ''Madonna'', was also released to promote the singles, as well as the album.

Promoted by [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Music Video]] as 'A Vision of Madonna', the compilation contained the music videos for the singles "[[Burning Up]] and "[[Borderline (song)|Borderline]]", the then current single "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]" and a special extended dance mix of "[[Lucky Star (song)|Lucky Star]]".<ref name="vision">{{cite journal|date=1984-12-01|title=A Vision of Madonna|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|location=New York|volume=96|issue=50|pages=76|issn=0006-2510|url=http://books.google.com/?id=zSQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PT1&dq=Madonna+video+compilation&cd=17#v=onepage&q=Madonna%20video%20compilation|accessdate=2010-01-21|ref=harv}}</ref> In "Lucky Star" when she says "ooh yeah" it is echoed three times and her image is repeated three times.

Dubbed as 'The Virgin Party', the event drew around 1,200 crowd and promoted Madonna's LPs, tapes, CDs and the videocassette. Attendees were encouraged to wear white, and for $5 admission fees, were able to view the ''Madonna'' videocassette and the premiere of the music video of her then single "[[Material Girl]]". The event was organised as a drive to promote music videos, which at that point did not have a large market.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McCormick|first=Moira|date=1985-03-23|title=Chicago Nightclub Launches Music Cross-Promotions|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|volume=97|issue=12|pages=64|issn=0006-2510|url=http://books.google.com/?id=tSQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT27&dq=madonna+material+girl&cd=4#v=onepage&q=madonna%20material%20girl|ref=harv}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that with the album, Madonna began her career as a disco diva, in an era that did not have any such divas to speak of.<ref name="allmusic"/> In the beginning of the 80s, disco was an [[anathema]] to the mainstream pop, and Madonna had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music, utilizing her charisma, chutzpah and sex appeal. Erlewine also credits the music of the album as "cleverly incorporated great pop songs with stylish, state-of-the-art beats, and it shrewdly walked a line between being a rush of sound and a showcase for a dynamic lead singer. This is music where all of the elements may not particularly impressive on their own — the arrangement, synth, and drum programming are fairly rudimentary — but taken together, it's utterly irresistible. [...] Here, Madonna is on fire, and that's the reason why it launched her career, launched dance-pop, and remains a terrific, nearly timeless, listen."<ref name="allmusic"/> Martin Charles Strong, author of ''The great rock discography'' felt that the album's unprecedented dance-pop and naive appeal served Madonna in establishing her base as an artist.<ref>{{harvnb|Strong|2002|p=345}}</ref> According to biographer [[Andrew Morton (writer)|Andrew Morton]], the album made Madonna a household name, and was instrumental in introducing her star power.<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=159}}</ref> When Madonna appeared on [[American Bandstand]] to promote the album on January 14, 1984, Madonna expressed her dream "to rule the world."<ref>{{cite web|title=Celebrating Madonna: The Queen of Pop's 50 Most Iconic Moments|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/photos/8404/101688|accessdate=2010-02-29}}</ref>

Following the release of the album, Madonna was dismissed by some music critics. After the success of her single "[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]", they began to call her a [[one-hit wonder]].<ref>{{harvnb|Keeley|2000|p=46}}</ref> Madonna said, "In the beginning I was called everything from a Disco Dolly to a One-Hit Wonder."<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=90}}</ref> She responded the comment "Minnie Mouse on helium" from ''Time'' magazine by doing a photoshoot with Alberto Tolot, where she flirted with a giant [[Mickey Mouse]] toy, putting its hand inside her dress and looking at it with an admonishing glare. Author Debbi Voller noted that "such provocative imagery at a young age of her career, could have hurt her too much. But it went on to shut those twerps who dared to take a swag at her voice again."<ref>{{harvnb|Voller|1999|p=30}}</ref> Twenty-five years later, in her acceptance speech of [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] induction, Madonna thanked the critics who snubbed her in the early years, "The ones that said I was talentless, that I was chubby, that I couldn't sing, that I was a one-hit wonder. They pushed me to be better, and I am grateful for their resistance."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/music/madonna-still-manages-to-shock/story-e6frf9hf-1111115778132|title=Madonna shocks with confession at Hall of Fame acceptance speech|last=Reporter|first=Herald Sun|date=2008-03-12|work=[[Herald Sun]]|publisher=[[The Herald and Weekly Times]]|accessdate=2010-05-15}}</ref>

In an interview with ''Time'', Madonna reflected that her relationship with her father had not been good, before she released her debut album. "My father had never believed that what I was doing here [in New York] was worthwhile, nor did he believe that I was up to any good. [...] It wasn't until my first album came out and my father started hearing my songs on the radio that he stopped asking the questions."<ref name="clerk">{{harvnb|Clerk|2002|p=42}}</ref> Music critics Bob Batchelor and Scott Stoddart, commented in their book ''The 1980s'' that "the music videos for the singles off the album, was more effective in introducing Madonna to the rest of the world."<ref>{{harvnb|Batchelor|Stoddart|2007|p=117}}</ref> Author Carol Clerk said that the music videos of "Burning Up", "Borderline" and "Lucky Star" established Madonna, not as the girl-next-door, but as a sassy and smart, tough funny woman. Her clothes worn in the videos were later used by designers like [[Karl Lagerfeld]] and [[Christian Lacroix]], in Paris Fashion week of the same year.<ref name="clerk"/> Professor [[Douglas Kellner]], in his book ''Media Culture: Cultural Studies, Identity, and Politics Between the Modern and the Postmodern'', commented that the videos depicted motifs and strategies which helped Madonna in her journey to become a star.<ref>{{harvnb|Kellner|1995|p=269}}</ref> With the "Borderline" music video, Madonna was credited for breaking the taboo of interracial relationships and was considered one of her career-making moments. [[MTV]] played the video in heavy rotation, increasing Madonna's popularity further.<ref name="fouz"/>

The release of the album, heralded Madonna's arrival in the music scene, but her vocal abilities were not fully formed artistically. Her vocal styles and lyrics appeared similar to those of other pop stars of that period, namely [[Paula Abdul]], [[Debbie Gibson]] and [[Taylor Dayne]].<ref name="fouzvocal">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hernández|Jarman-Ivens|2004|pp=59–61}}</ref> The songs on ''Madonna'' reveal several key trends that have continued to define her success, including a strong dance-based idiom, catchy [[hook (music)|hooks]], highly polished [[arrangement]] and Madonna's own vocal style. In songs such as "Lucky Star" and Borderline", Madonna introduced a style of upbeat dance music that would prove particularly appealing to future gay audiences. The bright, girlish vocal [[timbre]] of the early years became passé in Madonna's later works, the change being deliberate, to cater the latest trends in the music world.<ref name="fouzvocal"/>
