<html> <head> <title>Prototype Verification System</title></head><body>The '''Prototype Verification System''' ('''PVS''') is a [[specification language]] integrated with support tools and a [[theorem prover]].

It was developed at the Computer Science Laboratory of [[SRI International]] in [[California]]. PVS is based on a kernel consisting of an extension of [[Alonzo Church|Church]]'s theory of types with [[dependent types]], and is fundamentally a classical typed higher-order logic. The base types include uninterpreted types that may be introduced by the user, and built-in types such as the booleans, integers, reals, and the ordinals.  Type-constructors include functions, sets, tuples, records, enumerations, and abstract data types. Predicate subtypes and dependent types can be used to introduce constraints; these constrained types may incur proof obligations (called type-correctness conditions or TCCs) during typechecking.  PVS specifications are organized into parameterized theories.

The system is implemented in [[Common Lisp]], and is released under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL).
