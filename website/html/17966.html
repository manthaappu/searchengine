<html> <head> <title>Imagine (3D modeling software)</title></head><body>'''Imagine''' was the name of a cutting edge 3D modeling and raytracing program, originally for the [[Amiga]] computer and later also for [[MSDOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. It was created by [[Impulse (Software company)|Impulse, Inc]]. It used the .iob extension for its objects. Imagine was a derivative of the software [[TurboSilver]], which was also for the Amiga and written by Impulse. The Windows version of the program was abandoned when Impulse dropped out of the 3D software market; but the Amiga version is now maintained and sold by [http://www.imaginefa.com CAD Technologies].  Since then the Windows and DOS versions has been made available in full along with other freely distributed addons and softwares like [[Organica]] at the fansite [http://www.imagine3d.org Imagine 3D] which also has a forum, gallery and downloads section.
