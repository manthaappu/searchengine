'''Imaging for Windows''' from ''Global 360'' is [[document imaging]] software. Earlier versions of Imaging for Windows were included in Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2000. Global360 Imaging for Windows is the upgrade to this Imaging software, which was discontinued as of [[Windows XP]].<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308979]</ref> Its image viewing, editing and scanning functions are superseded by [[Windows Picture and Fax Viewer]] and [[Microsoft Paint]], both of which are based on [[GDI+]] in Windows XP. Unfortunately, the multi-page picture editing functions are gone with the Imaging software.

Imaging for Windows was developed by [[Wang Laboratories|Wang]] (as in Windows 95/NT 4.0), was later absorbed by [[Kodak]] (as ''Eastman Software'', as in Windows 98/2000), then becoming ''eiStream Inc.'', and is now owned by Global 360. Version 4.0 was released in November 2008.<ref>[http://www.global360.com/products/imaging/]</ref>

Imaging for Windows supports creating, annotating, viewing, and printing [[TIFF]], [[BMP file format|BMP]], and [[Microsoft Fax]] ''AWD'' image documents. Users can also view and print [[JPEG]] and [[PCX]]/[[DCX (file format)|DCX]] images.

Imaging for Windows also provides the ability to develop software using [[ActiveX]] tools. Each copy includes the Kodak/Wang Imaging OCX (ActiveX) controls - ImgEdit, ImgAdmin, ImgThumb, ImgScan and ImgOCR controls are provided.
