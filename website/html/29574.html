is a joint work by [[Martin Dyer]], [[Alan M. Frieze]] and [[Ravindran Kannan]].

The main result of the paper is a randomized algorithm for finding an <math>\epsilon</math> approximation to the volume of a convex body <math>K</math> in <math>n</math>-dimensional Euclidean space by assume the existence of a membership oracle. The algorithm takes time bounded by a polynomial in <math>n</math>, the dimension of <math>K</math> and <math>1/\epsilon</math>.

The algorithm is a sophisticated usage of the so-called [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] (MCMC) method.
The basic scheme of the algorithm is a nearly uniform sampling from within <math>K</math> by placing a grid consisting <math>n</math>-dimensional cubes and doing a random walk over these cubes. By using the theory of
[[Markov chain mixing time|rapidly mixing Markov chains]], they show that it takes a polynomial time for the random walk to settle down to being a nearly uniform distribution.
