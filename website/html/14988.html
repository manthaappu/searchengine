In [[mathematics]], the '''generalized taxicab number''' ''Taxicab''(''k'', ''j'', ''n'') is the smallest number which can be expressed as the sum of ''j'' ''k''th positive powers in ''n'' different ways. For ''k'' = 3 and ''j'' = 2, they coincide with [[Taxicab number]]s.

It has been shown by [[Euler]] that

:<math>\mathrm{Taxicab}(4, 2, 2) = 635318657 = 59^4 + 158^4 = 133^4 + 134^4</math>

However, ''Taxicab''(5, 2, ''n'') is not known for any ''n'' &ge; 2; no positive [[integer]] is known which can be written as the sum of two fifth powers in more than one way.<ref>{{cite book
