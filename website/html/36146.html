MediaMax Technology [http://www.mediamaxtechnology.com/] is the exclusive sales and marketing arm for SunnComm's MediaMax suite of products, and is "on track"[http://biz.yahoo.com/iw/051004/096995.html] to merge with SunnComm.

Both companies received attention in 2005 due to its involvement in the [[2005 Sony BMG CD copy protection scandal|Sony BMG CD copy protection scandal]]. 

It is believed that both companies went under soon after when the development team was replaced and reorganized by Scott S. Stoegbauer which included Ron Phillips, Neal Meyer and Jim DiZoglio. The new company operated under the name [http://www.amergencegroup.com/ TranzByte] attempting to focus on non-controversial products such as DVCD which proved to be disastrous.
