'''MPLS VPN''' is a family of methods for harnessing the power of [[Multiprotocol Label Switching]] (MPLS) to create [[virtual private network]]s (VPNs). MPLS is well suited to the task as it provides traffic isolation and differentiation without substantial overhead.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

== Layer 3 MPLS VPN ==

A layer 3 MPLS VPN, also known as L3VPN, combines enhanced [[BGP]]  signaling, MPLS traffic isolation and router support for VRFs ([[VRF|Virtual Routing/Forwarding]]) to create an IP based VPN. Compared to other types of VPN such as IPSec VPN or ATM, MPLS L3VPN is more cost efficient and can provide more services to customers.

However, there is no implementation of privacy of the traffic sent over the MPLS, except to the degree that you trust the operator of the MPLS equipment along the way, so it hardly fits the definition of a VPN at all (even if the people selling it would like you to believe it is an equivalent).
