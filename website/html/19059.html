The '''International Symposium on Distributed Computing''' ('''DISC''') is an annual [[academic conference]] for refereed presentations, whose focus is the theory, design, analysis, implementation, and application of distributed systems and networks. The Symposium is organized in association with the [[European Association for Theoretical Computer Science]] (EATCS). 

The [[Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing]] is presented alternately at DISC and at the ACM [[Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing]] (PODC).<ref>[[European Association for Theoretical Computer Science|EATCS]] web site: [http://www.eatcs.org/index.php/eatcs-awards#dijkstra_prize Awards: Dijkstra Prize].</ref><ref>[[Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing|PODC]] web site: [http://www.podc.org/dijkstra/ Edsger W.

==History==

DISC dates back to 1985, when it began as a biannual '''Workshop on Distributed Algorithms on Graphs''' ('''WDAG'''); it became annual in 1989. The name changed to the present one in 1998.<ref>[http://www.disc-conference.org/ DISC website].</ref><ref name="disc-dblp">[http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/conf/wdag/ DISC] in [[DBLP]].</ref>

While the first WDAG was held in [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]] in 1985, since then WDAG/DISC has been organised primarily in European locations, one exception being WDAG 1992 in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]].<ref name="disc-dblp"/> In  September 2010, DISC returned to North America for the first time since 1985: 24th DISC took place in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], [[USA]].<ref>[http://listserv.acm.org/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0910&L=PODC&T=0&F=&S=&P=725 DISC'2010 Preliminary Call for Papers].</ref> In the same year, its North American sister conference PODC was held in Europe (Zurich) for the first time in its history.<ref name="podc-dblp">[http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/conf/podc/ PODC] in [[DBLP]].</ref><ref>[http://portal.acm.org/browse_dl.cfm?coll=Portal&dl=ACM&idx=SERIES391&linked=1&part=series PODC in ACM Digital Library].</ref>
