In [[traditional grammar]], a '''predicate''' is one of the two main parts of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], the other being the [[subject (grammar)|subject]]. The predicate is said to ''modify'' the subject. For the simple sentence "John is yellow" ''John'' acts as the subject, and ''is yellow'' acts as the predicate. The predicate is much like a [[verb phrase]].

In many current theories of [[semantics|linguistic semantics]] (notably [[truth-conditional semantics]]), a predicate is an expression that can be ''true of'' something. Thus, the expressions "is yellow" or "is like broccoli" are true of those things that are yellow or like broccoli, respectively. This notion is closely related to the notion of a predicate in [[formal logic]], which includes more expressions than the former one, such as [[noun]]s and some kinds of [[adjective]]s.

==Predicate in traditional English grammar==
A predicate is one of the two main parts of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] (the other being the [[subject (grammar)|subject]], which the predicate [[Grammatical modifier|modifies]]).<ref>{{cite book |title=The Merriam Webster Dictionary |year=2004 |publisher=Merriam-Webster |location=Springfield, Massachusetts |page=566}}</ref> The predicate must contain a [[verb]], and the verb requires, permits, or precludes other sentence elements to complete the predicate. These elements are: [[Object (grammar)|objects]] (direct, indirect, prepositional), [[Predicative (adjectival or nominal)|predicatives]], [[adverb]]s:

'''''She''' <u>dances</u>.'' (verb-only predicate)

''Ben <u>reads '''the book'''''.</u> (direct object)

''Ben's mother, Felicity, <u>gave '''me''' a present''.</u> (indirect object without a [[preposition]])

''She <u>listened '''to the radio'''''.</u> (prepositional object)

''They <u>elected him '''president'''''.</u> (predicative / object [[Complement (grammar)|complement]])

''She <u>met him '''in the park'''''.</u> ([[adverb]]ial)

''She <u>is '''in the park'''''.</u> (obligatory adverbial / adverbial complement)

The predicate provides information about the subject, such as what the subject is doing or what the subject is like.

The relation between a subject and its predicate is sometimes called a [[Nexus Grammar|nexus]].

A '''predicate nominal''' is a [[noun phrase]] that functions as the main predicate of a sentence, such as "''George III is the king of England''", ''the king of England'' being the predicate nominal. The subject and predicate nominal must be connected by a [[linking verb]], also called a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]].

A '''predicate adjective''' is an [[adjective]] that functions as a predicate, such as "Jessica is attractive", ''attractive'' being the predicate adjective. The subject and predicate adjective must be connected by a [[linking verb]], also called [[copula (linguistics)|copula]].

==Classes of predicate==
===Carlson classes===
After the work of Greg N. Carlson, predicates have been divided into the following sub-classes, which roughly pertain to how a predicate relates to its subject:

====     Stage-level predicates====
A '''stage-level predicate''' ("s-l predicate" for short) is true of a ''temporal stage'' of its subject.  For example, if John is "hungry", that typically lasts a certain amount of time, and not his entire lifespan.

S-l predicates can occur in a wide range of grammatical constructions and is probably the most versatile kind of predicate.

====Individual-level predicates====
An  '''individual-level predicate''' ("i-l predicate") is true throughout the existence of an individual.  For example, if John is "smart", this is a property of him, regardless which particular point in time we consider.

I-l predicates are more restricted than s-l ones.  I-l predicates can't occur in ''presentational'' "there" sentences (a star in front of a sentence indicates that it is odd or ill-formed):

: There are police available.  ("available" is s-l)
: *There are firemen altruistic. ("altruistic" is i-l)

S-l predicates allow modification by manner adverbs and other adverbial modifiers.  I-l ones do not.

: John spoke French loudly in the corridor.  ("speak French" can be interpreted as s-l)
: *John knew French loudly in the corridor.  ("know French" can't be interpreted as s-l)

When an i-l predicate occurs in [[past tense]], it gives rise to what is called a "lifetime effect":  The subject must be assumed to be dead or otherwise gone out of existence.

: John was available.  (s-l <math>\rightarrow</math> no lifetime effect)
: John was altruistic. (i-l<math>\rightarrow</math> lifetime effect.)

====Kind-level predicates====
A '''kind-level predicate''' ("k-l predicate") is true of a kind of thing, but cannot be applied to individual members of the kind.  An example of this is the predicate "are widespread."  One can't meaningfully say of a particular individual John that he is widespread.  One may only say this of kinds, as in

: Humans are widespread.

Certain types of [[noun phrase]] can't be the subject of a k-l predicate. We have just seen that a [[proper name]] can't be.  [[Grammatical number|Singular]] [[article (grammar)|indefinite]] noun phrases  are also banned from this environment:

: *A cat is widespread. (compare:  Nightmares are widespread.)

===Collective vs. distributive predicates===
Predicates may also be collective or distributive.  Collective predicates require their subjects to be somehow plural, while distributive ones don't. An example of a collective predicate is "formed a line". This predicate can only stand in a nexus with a plural subject:

: The students formed a line.
: *The student formed a line.

Other examples of collective predicates include "meet in the woods", "surround the house", "gather in the hallway" and "carry the piano together". Note that the last one ("carry the piano together") can be made non-collective by removing the word "together". [[Quantifiers]] differ with respect to whether or not they can be the subject of a collective predicate. For example, quantifiers formed with "all the" can, while ones formed with "every" or "each" cannot.
: All the students formed a line.
: All the students gathered in the hallway.
: All the students carried a piano together.
: *Each student gathered in the hallway.
: *Every student formed a line.

==Other languages==
===Japanese===
The [[topic-comment]] structure of [[Japanese grammar]] yields very distinct predicates (as the comment). Indeed, [[Japanese adjectives]] and [[Japanese verbs]] behave rather similarly (for example, the negative form of a verb is an adjective), and can be understood as being two forms of predicates; predicate form is referred to as 終止形 (''shūshikei,'' terminal form). Further, unlike in English, Japanese adjectives do not exist independently of predication, and the [[dictionary form]] is the predicate form – for example, 小さい (''chiisai'') is the predicate form of "small", and means "is small", not simply "small". Accordingly, while some textbooks translate Japanese adjectives as English adjectives (translating 小さい as "small"), other textbooks, such as ''[[Japanese: The Spoken Language]],'' translate Japanese adjectives as English ''predicates'' (translating 小さい as "is small").

===Korean===

Similar considerations apply as in Japanese.
