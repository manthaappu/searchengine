In computer networks '''location transparency''' describes names used to identify [[computer network|network]] resources independent of both the user's location and the resource location.

A [[distributed system]] will need to employ a networked scheme for naming resources.

In other words it is an idea that the resources can be accessed by a user from anywhere on the network without knowing where the resource is located. A file could be on the user's own PC, or thousands of miles away on other servers.

==Software using network transparency==
These well-known software, or types of software, can or do use network transparency:
* [[Network file system|Distributed file systems]] such as the [[Andrew File System]].
* [[MythTV]] back-ends stream, and otherwise interact, with front-ends transparently to the user.
* [[GNOME]] [[GNOME VFS|virtual filesystem]].
* [[KDE]] [[KIO]].
