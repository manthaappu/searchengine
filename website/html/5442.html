'''CapDesk''' is a [[desktop environment]] that rigorously applies the [[Principle of least authority]], in order to provide security for the user when running applications.

Under CapDesk, applications are run with minimal authority, so that an application does not have access to a given file or directory until the user explicitly grants the application the right to access it.

CapDesk is a research system that aims to show that this does not reduce the usability of the system.  On the contrary; CapDesk's user interface is quite conventional from the user's point of view.  Standard GUI mechanisms such as opening a file or using a [[file chooser]] are the basis for granting access rights to applications.

CapDesk was the first system to implement a [[Powerbox]] [[file chooser]].

CapDesk is written in the [[E programming language]], which in turn is currently implemented in [[Java (programming language)|Java]].

==Caplet==
In the CapDesk desktop environment, a '''caplet''' is a program that starts off with no authority beyond the ability to interact with the user via a window and to request [[capability-based security|capabilities]] via a [[powerbox]].

The term is a pun on [[applet]], combining the term with "cap" which is short for "capability".

Applets such as [[Java applet]]s often have no non-trivial use, because they do not have—and more importantly, cannot be granted—useful authority, such as the ability to save a file to the user's filesystem.  In contrast, caplets are more useful, because they can request and be granted authority in a fine-grained but secure way.
