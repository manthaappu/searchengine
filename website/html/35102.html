<html> <head> <title>Sony eVilla</title></head><body>The '''Sony eVilla''' is a discontinued [[Internet appliance]] from [[Sony]]. After 18 months of development, it was released to the public on June 14, 2001 for $499 [[United States dollar|USD]]. With the additional $21.95 USD monthly fee, users could access the [[Internet]], send and receive [[e-mail]], play audio and video, and save files to Sony's [[Memory Stick]].  

After less than three months in the market, Sony discontinued the product on September 13, 2001. Customers received full refunds for the product and the monthly subscription fee.  Spokesman John Dolak remarked that "[the] product did not meet our expectations, it did not operate as planned." 

Sony entered the Internet appliance market as other manufacturers were getting out, canceling their plans, and discontinuing their offerings. By the time the Sony eVilla shipped, only 150,000 internet appliance devices had shipped within the past year. In addition, many customers could not justify the purchase of an inherently limited internet appliance when other manufacturers were offering more capable [[personal computers]] for the same price.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

==Hardware and Software==

The Sony eVilla was powered by a 266 MHz [[Geode (processor)|Geode]] GX 1 [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]], with 64 [[mebibyte|MiB]] [[Dynamic Random Access Memory|DRAM]], and 24 MiB [[flash memory]]. It weighed 31.5 pounds (14.3 kg) and measured 11.81 × 16.18 × 15.82 inches (30 × 41.1 x 40.2 cm).  

There was no [[hard disk]], but the system could read and write to Sony's [[Memory Stick]] cards. The included [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] were connected by two [[DIN connector|PS/2 ports]], and additional devices could be connected with two [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] ports. A 56K [[V.90]] [[modem]] was built into the case, which also housed an unused [[Ethernet]] port. 

The display was a portrait-style 15 inch (38 cm) Sony [[Trinitron]], with 800×1024 pixel resolution. 

The system used the [[BeIA]] 1.0 [[operating system]] from [[Be Inc.]], and supported [[Java platform|Java]] applications, [[Macromedia Flash]] animations, and some [[Microsoft Office]] file formats. Also included was [[RealNetworks]]'s [[RealPlayer]].

One of the major drawbacks of the eVilla was the inability to save pictures and media from internet sites.
