<html> <head> <title>Majority function</title></head><body>In [[Boolean logic]], the '''majority function''' (also called the '''median operator''')  is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from ''n'' inputs to one output. The value of the operation is false when ''n''/2 or more arguments are false, and true otherwise.
Alternatively, representing true values as 1 and false values as 0, we may use the formula

:<math>\operatorname{Majority} \left ( p_1,\dots,p_n \right ) =  \left \lfloor \frac{1}{2} +  \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n  p_i - 1/2}{n} \right \rfloor. </math>

The "&minus;1/2" in the formula serves to break ties in favor of zeros when ''n'' is even; a similar formula can be used for a function that breaks ties in favor of ones.

A major result in [[circuit complexity]] asserts that this function cannot be computed by [[AC0|AC0 circuits]] of subexponential size.

A ''majority gate'' is a [[logical gate]] used in [[circuit complexity]] and other applications of [[Boolean circuits]].  A majority gate returns true if and only if more than 50% of its inputs are true.

== Monotone formulae for majority ==

For ''n'' = 1 the median operator is just the unary identity operation ''x''.  For ''n'' = 3 the ternary median operator can be expressed using conjunction and disjunction as ''xy'' + ''yz'' + ''zx''.  Remarkably this expression denotes the same operation independently of whether the symbol + is interpreted as [[disjunction|inclusive or]] or [[exclusive or]].

For an arbitrary ''n'' there exists a monotone formula for majority of size O(''n''<sup>5.3</sup>) {{harv|Valiant|1984}}. This is proved using [[probabilistic method]]. Thus, this formula is non-constructive. However, one can obtain an explicit formula for majority of polynomial size using a [[sorting network]] of [[Miklós Ajtai|Ajtai]], [[János Komlós (mathematician)|Komlós]], and [[Endre Szemerédi|Szemerédi]].

== Properties ==

Among the properties of the ternary median operator < x,y,z > are:
#   < x,y,y > = y                   
#   < x,y,z > = < z,x,y >            
#   < x,y,z > = < x,z,y >            
#   < < x,w,y > ,w,z > = < x,w, < y,w,z > >

An abstract system satisfying these as axioms is a [[median algebra]].
