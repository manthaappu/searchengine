<html> <head> <title>Redalyc</title></head><body>The '''Red de Revistas Científicas de América Latina y El Caribe, España y Portugal (Redalyc)''' project started in January 2003 with the general aim of building a scientific information system made up by the leading journals of all the knowledge areas edited in and about [[Latin America]]. Now days, Redalyc is an information system that also evaluates the scientific and editorial quality of knowledge in [[Ibero-America]]. A research group generates bibliometric indicators about the impact of the journals, authors and countries included in the journal electronic library. Redalyc has been consolidated as an important [[repository]] of knowledge with 550 journals online and more than 116 000 full-text articles.

Since its creation Redalyc set a goal: to give visibility to the scientific production generated in [[Ibero-America]], that is underestimated in the world-wide scene due to different factors like low investment in [[science]] and [[technology]], the low participation of [[Latin American]] scientists in the ''main current of science'', measured by the percentage of articles signed by Latin American authors in main databases and the low impact of that production.[http://dcpapers.dublincore.org/ojs/pubs/article/view/856/852]

The main communication vehicle of academic and scientific means is the publication in [[scientific journals]]. In this sense, the Latin American participation of authors or institutions in principal journals or the impact of journals produced in the region allows to know the effect of Latin American science in the world. According to Ricyt (2002), the participation of the Latin American scientists in “the main current of science”, measured by the percentage of articles signed by authors of Latin America in the main databases that register scientific publications was practically null, less than 3% in the important repositories, although there was a growing, for example, 2,7% in the [[Science Citation Index]] (SCI).

Redalyc is an effort working under [[Open access (publishing)|Open Access]] supported by the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México [http://www.uaemex.mx] with the help of hundreds superior education institutions and information systems. Using the slogan, La ciencia que no se ve no existe (Science that is not seen does not exist) Redalyc has taken a giant step forward in providing access to academic [[research]] produced in Latin America. It is anticipated that the visibility of the full text of these journals will increase the citation rates and gobal research impact of Latin American scholarship.

Redalyc provides the following services: 

* A Scientific Journal Electronic Library
* Bibliometric indicators 
* Socio-scientific networks
* Grouping of journals
* Usage indicators

== Scientific Journal Electronic Library ==

Organized in two main areas (Social and Natural Sciences) and many specialised sub-sections, Redalyc gathers journals published in 15 countries, with over 550 journals and 16, 000 articles available in [[pdf]] format, along with abstacts in spanish and english languages, reference information and other metadata. Similarly to parallel projects such as [[Latindex]], Redalyc fully embraces the [[Open access (publishing)|Open Access]] policy and its material is released under a [[Creative Commons]] license, with free download. Along with a keyword search on each page, users can browse the catalogue by title, author, country or subject and they also submit original papers in .doc, .rtf or .odt formats,to be included in a specific journal.

== Bibliometric indicators ==

The increase in research evaluation activities and advances in our understanding of innovation have led to a call for new types of statistical data and indicators. Bibliometric techniques have been shown to be useful in development of indicators of scientific research activity to address emerging concerns such as institutional level analysis of capabilities and networks (Katz and
Hicks, 1997). Bibliometric indicators have been used for policy purposes for nearly 25 years (Narin, 1976) and were developed to address central concerns of classical science policy - level of research output and its impact. In this sense they have been so useful that they are incorporated in regular statistical series such as the National Science Foundation's (NSF) science indicators and are used in high profile analyses by leading scientists and policy makers.[http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/sylvank/pubs/ESRC.pdf]

== Socio-scientific networks ==

Authors collaboration networks
* Area: Map showing authors collaboration in a particular knowledge area
* Journal: Map showing authors collaboration in a journal
* Institution: Map showing authors collaboration in an institution
* Country: Map showing authors collaboration in a country
* Author: Map showing an author's collaboration network
* Area: Map showing authors collaboration in the public administration area

== Grouping of journals ==

{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}
== Usage indicators ==

Redalyc produces indicator to keep track of the publications consultation, we Consider that the scientific communication process includes the diffusion of the investigation results impact and the evaluation of their impact in the academic community. The impact and visibility are processed from the articles consulted, which allow us make a detailed follow up.

The statistics obtained are:

* Site use
* Articles report
* Visits report
* Consults comparatives
* Global use reports
* Internationalization index
* Individual reports
* Editorial reports
* Institutional reports
