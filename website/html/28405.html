The '''Parallel Peripheral Interface''' ('''PPI''') is a peripheral found on the [[Blackfin]] embedded processor.

The PPI is a [[half-duplex]], [[bi-directional]] port that is designed to connect directly to [[LCD]]s, [[CMOS sensor]]s, [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]s, video encoders (video [[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]]s), video decoders (video [[Analog-to-digital converter|ADC]]s) or any generic high speed, parallel device.  

The width of the PPI is programmable and can be set between 8 and 16-bits in 1 bit increments.  The latest Blackfin family (BF54x) also features a 18/24-bit PPI for direct connection to [[RGB]] LCD panels.

The PPI can run from 0[[MHz]] up to 66 MHz.  

The PPI has a dedicated clock pin, three multiplexed frame sync pins, and between 16 and 24 data pins.
