'''The Institute of Mathematics and its Applications''' ('''IMA''') is the UK's [[Royal Charter|chartered]] [[British professional bodies|professional body]] for [[mathematician]]s and one of the UK's [[Learned society|learned societies]] for mathematics (the other main one being the [[London Mathematical Society]]). 

The IMA aims to advance mathematics and its applications, promote and foster research and other enquiries directed the advancement, teaching and application of mathematics, to seek to establish and maintain high standards of professional conduct for members and to seek to promote, encourage and guide the development of education and training in mathematics.<ref name="charity">Charity Commission: http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/ShowCharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1017777&SubsidiaryNumber=0</ref>

==History==
The Institute was founded in 1964 by [[M. James Lighthill|Sir James Lighthill]] with a mission to promote mathematics in industry, business, the public sector, education and research.<ref name="origins">Article on the origins of the Institute: http://www.ima.org.uk/institute/origins_of_the_institute.pdf</ref> The IMA has 5000 members, ten percent of whom live outside the [[United Kingdom]]. Forty percent of members are employed in education (schools through to universities) and sixty percent work in commercial and governmental organisations.<ref name="aboutima">http://www.ima.org.uk/institute/aboutus.htm</ref>

No requirements are necessary for entry into this grade.

==Professional status==
In 1990 the Institute was incorporated by [[Royal Charter]] <ref name="aboutima" /> and was subsequently granted the right to award [[Chartered mathematician|Chartered Mathematician]] (CMath) status.<ref name="cmath">http://www.ima.org.uk/Membership/cmath.htm</ref> The Institute may also nominate individuals for the award of [[Chartered scientist|Chartered Scientist]] (CSci) under license from the [[Science Council]].<ref name="csci">http://www.ima.org.uk/Membership/csci.htm</ref> The institute can also award individual Chartered Mathematics Teacher (CMathTeach).

==Publications==
===''Mathematics Today''===
''Mathematics Today''  is a general interest mathematics publication aimed primarily at Institute members, published 6 times a year and containing articles, reviews, reports and other news on developments in mathematics and its applications.<ref name="mathstoday">http://www.ima.org.uk/mathematics/mathstoday.htm</ref>

===Research journals===

Six research journals are published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the IMA.<ref name="journals">http://www.ima.org.uk/mathematics/journals.htm</ref>

*''IMA Journal of Applied Mathematics''
*''IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis''
*''Mathematical Medicine and Biology''
*''IMA Journal of Mathematical Control and Information''
*''IMA Journal of Management Mathematics''
*''Teaching Mathematics and its Applications''

===Other publications===

The IMA began publishing a podcast, ''Travels in a Mathematical World'' on 4 October 2008.<ref name="podcast">http://www.travelsinamathematicalworld.co.uk/</ref> The IMA also publishes conference proceedings, monographs and special interest group newsletters.<ref name="otherpubs">http://www.ima.org.uk/mathematics/publications.htm</ref>

==Conferences==

The Institute runs 8-10 conferences<ref name="conference diary">http://www.ima.org.uk/Conferences/confdiary.htm</ref> most years. These are specialist meetings where new research is presented and discussed.<ref name="conferences">http://www.ima.org.uk/Conferences/conferences.htm</ref>

==Education activities==
The IMA runs a wide range of mathematical activities through The Higher Education Services Area and The Schools and Further Education Group committees.<ref name="Education committees">http://www.ima.org.uk/Education/educationintro.htm</ref>
 
The IMA operates a Programme Approval Scheme, which provides an 'approval in principle' for degree courses that meet the educational requirements for [[Chartered Mathematician]]. For programmes to be approved, the IMA requires the programme to be a honours degree of at least three years length, which meets the required mathematical content threshold of two thirds. The programmes also need to meet the [[QAA]] benchmark for Mathematics and the Framework for High Education Qualification.<ref name="programmeapproval">http://ima.org.uk/Education/programmeapproval.htm</ref>

The IMA provides Education Grants of up to £600 to allow individuals from the UK working in schools or Further/Higher Education to help with the attendance at or the organisation of a mathematics educational activity such as attendance at a conference, expenses to cover a speaker coming into a school, organising a session for a conference. <ref name="EducationGrants">http://www.ima.org.uk/Education/education_grant.html#report</ref>

The IMA also employs a University Liaison Officer to promote mathematics and the IMA to university students undertaking mathematics and help act as a means of support. <ref name="UniversityLiaison">http://www.ima.org.uk/student/index.html</ref> As part of this support the IMA runs the University Liaison Grants Scheme to provide university mathematical societies with grants of up to £400 to organise more activities and work more closely with the IMA. 

==Prizes==

The Councils of the IMA and the [[London Mathematical Society]] jointly award the Christopher Zeeman Medal,  dedicated to recognising excellence in the communication of mathematics <ref name="zeemanmedal">http://www.lms.ac.uk/activities/prizes_com/zeeman.html</ref> and the David Crighton Award dedicated to the recognition of service to mathematics and the wider mathematics community.<ref name="crightonmedal">http://www.lms.ac.uk/activities/prizes_com/crighton.html</ref>

The IMA with the British Applied Mathematics Colloquium (BAMC) award a prize for original research every two years, this is called the Lighthill-Thwaites Prize.

The IMA awards the [[Leslie Fox Prize for Numerical Analysis]], the Catherine Richards Prize for the best articles in Mathematics Today and the IMA Gold Medal for outstanding contribution to mathematics and its applications over the years.

The IMA awards student-level Prizes at most universities which offer mathematics around the UK. Each student prize consists of a years membership of the IMA.<ref name="studentprizes">http://travelsinamathematicalworld.blogspot.com/2008/11/ima-prize-giving-at-kings.html</ref>
