A '''solver''' is a generic term indicating a piece of [[mathematical software]], possibly in the form of a stand-alone [[computer program]] or as a [[Library (computing)|software library]], that 'solves' a mathematical problem. A solver takes problem descriptions in some sort of generic form and calculate their solution. In a solver, the emphasis is on creating a program or library that can easily be applied to other problems of similar type.

Types of problems with existing dedicated solvers include:

* [[Linear equation|Linear]] and [[non-linear equation]]s, or [[System of linear equations|systems]] of such equations. In this case the "solver" is more appropriately called a [[root-finding algorithm]].
* Linear and non-linear [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]] problems
* Systems of [[ordinary differential equation]]s
* Systems of [[differential algebraic equation]]s
* Logic/[[Boolean satisfiability problem|satisfiability]] problems
* [[Constraint satisfaction problem]]s
* [[Shortest path problem]]s
* [[Minimum spanning tree]] problems
* [[Search algorithm]]s

The [[General Problem Solver]] (''GPS'') is a particular computer program created in 1957 by Herbert Simon, J.C. Shaw, and Allen Newell intended to work as a universal problem solver, that theoretically can be used to solve every possible problem that can be formalized in a symbolic system, given the right input configuration. It was the first computer program which separated its knowledge of problems (in the form of [[problem domain|domain]] rules) from its strategy of how to solve problems (as a general search [[Software engine|engine]]).

Solvers typically use an architecture similar to the GPS to decouple a problem's definition from the strategy used to solve it. While the strategy utilized by GPS was a general algorithm with the only goal of completeness, modern solvers tend to use a more specialized approach tailored to the specific problem class which the solver aims for. The advantage in this decoupling is that the solver doesn't depend on the details of any particular problem instance.

For problems of a particular class (e.g., systems of [[non-linear equation]]s) there are usually a wide range of different algorithms available; sometimes a solver implements multiple algorithms, but sometimes just one. Normally, solvers just use numerical methods, although there are some solvers that are capable of performing some symbolic manipulation to find a solution.
