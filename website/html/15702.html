<html> <head> <title>Graph equation</title></head><body>'''Graph equations''' are [[equations]] in which the unknowns are [[Graph theory|graphs]]. One of the central questions of graph theory concerns the notion of [[Graph isomorphism|isomorphism]]. We ask: When are two graphs the same (i.e, graph isomorphism)? The graphs in question may be expressed differently in terms of graph equations.<ref>[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/113386917/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0  Bibliography on Graph equations ]</ref>

What are the graphs ([[root of a function|solutions]]) ''G'' and ''H'' such that the [[line graph]] of ''G'' is same as the [[total graph]] of ''H''? (What are ''G'' and ''H'' such that  ''L''(''G'') = '' T''( ''H'') ? ).

For example, ''G'' = ''K''<sub>3</sub>, and ''H'' = ''K''<sub>2</sub> are the solutions of the graph equation  ''L''(''K''<sub>3</sub>)  =  ''T''(''K''<sub>2</sub>) and ''G'' = ''K''<sub>4</sub>, and ''H'' = ''K''<sub>3</sub> are the solutions of the graph equation ''L''(''K''<sub>4</sub>) = ''T''(''K''<sub>3</sub>).

Note that ''T''(''K''<sub>3</sub>) is a 4-[[regular graph]] on 6 vertices.
