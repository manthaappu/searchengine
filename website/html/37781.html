{{TOCRight}}
This is a '''timeline of computer security hacker history'''. [[Hacker (computer security)|Hacking]] and [[system cracking]] appeared with the first [[electronics|electronic]] [[computer]]s. Below are some important events in the history of hacking and cracking.

==1930s==
===1932===
* Polish cryptologists: [[Marian Rejewski]], [[Henryk Zygalski]] and [[Jerzy Różycki]] broke the [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Enigma machine]] code.

===1939===
* [[Alan Turing]], [[Gordon Welchman]] and [[Harold Keen]] worked together to develop the [[Bombe]] (on the basis of Rejewski's works on [[Bomba (cryptography)|Bomba]]). The [[Enigma machine]]'s use of a reliantly small key space makes it vulnerable to brute force and thus a violation of [http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326.html CWE-326].

==1960s==
===1965===
* William D. Mathews from MIT found a vulnerability in a [http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/23257 Multics CTSS running on a IBM 7094]. This flaw discloses the contents of the password file. The issue occurred when multiple instances of the system text editor were invoked, causing the editor to create temporary files with a constant name. This would inexplicably cause the contents of the system CTSS password file to display to any user logging into the system.

==1970s==
===1971===
* [[John Draper|John T. Draper]] (later nicknamed Captain Crunch), his friend [[Joybubbles|Joe Engressia]], and [[blue box]] [[phone phreaking]] hit the news with an [[Esquire Magazine]] feature story.<ref name="price">David Price: [http://www.counterpunch.org/price06302008.html Blind Whistling Phreaks and the FBI's Historical Reliance on Phone Tap Criminality] [[CounterPunch]], June 30, 2008</ref>

==1980s==
===1981===
* [[Chaos Computer Club]] forms in [[Germany]].

* '''The Warelords''' forms in The United States, founded by '''Black Bart''' (cracker of Dung Beetles in 1982) in St. Louis, Missouri, and was composed of many teenage hackers, phreakers, coders, and largely black hat-style underground computer geeks.  One of the more notable group members was '''Tennessee Tuxedo''', a young man that was instrumental with developing conference calls via the use of trunk line phreaking via the use of the Novation Apple Cat II that allowed them to share their current hacks, phreaking codes, and new software releases. Other notable members were The Apple Bandit, Krakowicz, and Krac-man.  Black Bart was clever at using his nationally known and very popular BBS system in order to promote the latest gaming software.  He used that relationship to his advantage, often shipping the original pre-released software to his most trusted code crackers during the beta-testing phase, weeks prior to their public release.  The Warelords often collaborated with other piracy groups at the time, such as The Syndicate and The Midwest Pirates Guild and developed an international ring of involved piracy groups that reached as far away as Japan.  Long before the movie War Games went into pre-production, The Warelords had successfully infiltrated such corporations and institutions as The White House, Southwestern Bell "Ma Bell" Mainframe Systems, and large corporate providers of voice mail systems.

===1982===
* [[The 414s]] break into 60 computer systems at institutions ranging from the Los Alamos Laboratories to Manhattan's [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]].<ref name="time">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949797-1,00.html The 414 Gang Strikes Again, Aug 29 1983, Time magazine]</ref> The incident appeared as the cover story of [[Newsweek]] with the title ''Beware: Hackers at play'',<ref>''Beware: Hackers at play'', Newsweek, September 5, 1983, pp. 42-46,48</ref> possibly the first mass-media use of the term ''hacker'' in the context of computer security. As a result, the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] held hearings on computer security and passed several laws.<ref>David Bailey, "Attacks on Computers: Congressional Hearings and Pending Legislation," sp, p. 180, 1984 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, 1984.</ref>

===1983===
* The group [[P.H.I.R.M.|KILOBAUD]] is formed in February, kicking off a series of other hacker groups which form soon after.
* The movie ''[[WarGames]]'' introduces the wider public to the phenomenon of hacking and creates a degree of mass paranoia of hackers and their supposed abilities to bring the world to a screeching halt by launching nuclear [[ICBM]]'s.
* [[The 414s]] are caught and investigated by the [[FBI]].  Although most members are not charged with a crime, they gain widespread media attention,<ref>{{Cite news|newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]]|date=September 27, 1983|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Elmer-DeWitt|first=Philip|title=The 414 Gang Strikes Again|newspaper=[[Time magazine]]|pages=75|date=August 29, 1983|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949797,00.html|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> eventually becoming a cover story of ''[[Newsweek]]'' entitled "Beware: Hackers at play".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Beware: Hackers at play|newspaper=[[Newsweek]]|pages=42–46, 48|date=September 5, 1983|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

===1984===
* Someone calling himself [[Lex Luthor]] founds the [[Legion of Doom (hacking)|Legion of Doom]].

The publication provides tips for would-be hackers and phone phreaks, as well as commentary on the hacker issues of the day. Today, copies of ''2600'' are sold at most large retail bookstores.

* [[William Gibson]]'s groundbreaking science fiction novel [[Neuromancer]], about ''Case'', a futuristic computer hacker, is published.  Considered the first major [[cyberpunk]] novel, it brought into hacker jargon such terms as "[[cyberspace]]", "the matrix", "simstim", and "[[Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics|ICE]]".

===1985===
* [[Kilobaud|KILOBAUD]] is re-organized into The [[P.H.I.R.M.]], and begins [[sysop]]ping hundreds of [[Bulletin board system|BBSs]] through-out the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Europe]].
* The online 'zine [[Phrack]] is established.
* [[The Hacker's Handbook]] is published in the UK.

===1986===

* Arrest of a hacker who calls himself [[The Mentor]]. He published a now-famous treatise shortly after his arrest that came to be known as the [[Hacker's Manifesto]] in the e-zine [[Phrack]].  This still serves as the most famous piece of hacker literature and is frequently used to illustrate the mindset of hackers.
* Astronomer [[Clifford Stoll]] plays a pivotal role in tracking down hacker [[Markus Hess]], events later covered in Stoll's 1990 book ''[[The Cuckoo's Egg (book)|The Cuckoo's Egg]]''.<ref>{{cite book

* [[Operation Sundevil]] introduced.  After a prolonged sting investigation, Secret Service agents swoop down on organizers and prominent members of BBSs in 14 U.S. cities including the [[Legion of Doom (hacking)|Legion of Doom]], conducting early-morning raids and arrests. The arrests involve and are aimed at cracking down on credit-card theft and telephone and wire fraud. The result is a breakdown in the hacking community, with members informing on each other in exchange for immunity. The offices of [[Steve Jackson Games]] are also raided, and the [[role-playing game|role-playing]] sourcebook [[GURPS Cyberpunk]] is confiscated, possibly because the government fears it is a "handbook for computer crime".

===1993===

[[Vladimir Levin]], the 30-year-old [[ringleader]], uses his work laptop after hours to transfer the funds to accounts in [[Finland]] and [[Israel]]. Levin stands trial in the [[United States]] and is sentenced to three years in prison. Authorities recover all but $400,000 of the stolen money.
* Hackers adapt to emergence of the [[World Wide Web]] quickly, moving all their how-to information and hacking programs from the old BBSs to new hacker [[Web site]]s.
* [[AOHell]] is released, a [[freeware]] [[application software|application]] that allows a burgeoning community of unskilled [[script kiddie]]s to wreak havoc on [[America Online]].

It would also hit a web page counter when it took control, allowing the programmer who created it as well as the world to track the progress of the worm. It would replace documents with random garbage on the third of every month. It was hyped by the media but actually affected relatively few computers, and was not a real threat for most users.
