A '''fictional universe''' is a [[consistency|self-consistent]] fictional [[setting (literature)|setting]] with elements that differ from the real world. It may also be called an imagined, constructed or fictional realm (or world).

The terms [[Multiverse#Multiverse Hypothesis in fiction|multiverse]], [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]], [[alternate history]], [[Bible (writing)|story or screen bible]], [[backstory]] and [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] have a considerable amount of overlap with fictional universes.

A fictional universe can be almost indistinguishable from the real world, except for the presence of the invented characters and events that characterize a work of fiction.  It can also bear little or no resemblance to reality, with invented fundamental principles of space and time.  

The subject is most commonly addressed in reference to fictional universes that differ markedly from reality, such as those that introduce entire fictional cities, countries, or even planets, or those that contradict commonly known facts about the world and its history, or those that feature fantasy or science fiction concepts such as [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] or [[faster than light]] travel—and especially those in which the deliberate development of the setting is a substantial focus of the work.

==Definition==

What distinguishes a fictional universe from a simple setting is the level of detail and internal consistency. A fictional universe has an established continuity and internal logic that must be adhered to throughout the work and even across separate works. So, for instance, many books may be set in conflicting fictional versions of Victorian London, but all the stories of [[Sherlock Holmes]] are set in ''the same'' Victorian London. However, the various film series based on Sherlock Holmes follow their own separate continuities, and so do not take place in the same fictional universe.

The history and geography of a fictional universe are well-defined, and maps and timelines are often included in works set within them. Even [[fictional language|languages]] may be constructed. When subsequent works are written within the same universe, care is usually taken to ensure that established facts of the [[canon (fiction)|canon]] are not violated. Even if the fictional universe involves concepts such as magic that don't exist in the real world, these must adhere to a set of rules established by the author. 

A famous example of a fictional universe is [[Arda]], of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s books ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.  He created first its [[Languages of Arda|languages]] and then the world itself, which he states was "primarily linguistic in inspiration and was begun in order to provide the necessary 'history' for the Elvish tongues."<ref>Foreword to ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', by J.R.R. Tolkien</ref>

Virtually every successful fictional [[TV series]] or [[comic book]] develops its own "universe" to keep track of the various episodes or issues. Writers for that series must follow the ''[[Bible (writing)|story bible]]'',<ref name="jane">[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000550.php How to Give Maris Hives, Alphabetized] (April 2008), a blog entry by scriptwriter [[Jane Espenson]]</ref> which often becomes the [[canon (fiction)|series canon]]. For example, the American [[sitcom]] ''[[Friends]]'' posits a universe where the [[soap opera]] ''[[Days of our Lives]]'' has a continuing character named [[Dr. Drake Ramoray]] and the actor in that role often hangs out at the fictional coffee shop [[Central Perk]]. [[Spin-off (media)|Spin-off]] TV series (for example, ''Friends'' spin-off ''[[Joey (TV series)|Joey]]'' and fellow NBC sitcoms ''[[Mad About You]]'' and ''[[Seinfeld]]'') are often set in the same universe. [[Superman]] resides in the fictional municipalities of [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] and [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], both of which have extensive [[backstory|backstories]].

Frequently, when a series gets too complicated or too self-inconsistent (because of, for example, too many writers), the producers or publishers will introduce [[retroactive continuity]] (retcon) to make future editions easier to write and more consistent. This creates an alternate universe that future authors can write about. These stories about the universe or universes that existed before the retcon are usually not canonical, unless the franchise-holder gives permission. ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' was an especially sweeping example.

==Scope==
[[Sir Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' is one of the earliest examples of a cohesive fictional world with its own rules and functional concepts but it comprises only one small island. Later fictional universes, like [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan the Cimmerian]]'' stories or [[Lev Grossman]]'s [[Fillory]], are global in scope and some, like ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Honorverse]]'', or the [[Lensman series]], are galactic or even intergalactic.

A fictional universe may even concern itself with more than one interconnected universe through fictional devices such as dreams, "[[time travel]]" or "parallel worlds". Such a series of interconnected universes is often called a [[parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]]. Such multiverses have been featured prominently in science fiction since at least the mid-20th century.

The classic ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode "[[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek)|Mirror, Mirror]]" introduced the [[Mirror Universe (Star Trek)|Mirror Universe]], in which the crew members of the [[Starship Enterprise|Starship ''Enterprise'']] were brutal rather than compassionate. The 2009 movie ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' created an "alternate reality" and freed the [[Star Trek]] [[media franchise|franchise]] from [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] issues. In the mid-1980s, [[DC Comics|DC]] comic books' ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' told of countless parallel universes that were destroyed.

==Format==
A fictional universe can be contained in a single work, as in [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' or [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'', or in [[serial (literature)|serial]]ized, [[book series|series]]-based, open-ended or [[Round-robin story|round robin]]-style fiction.

In most small-scale fictional universes, general properties and [[timeline]] events fit into a consistently organized [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]]. However, in the case of universes that are rewritten or revised by different [[writer]]s, [[editing|editors]] or [[Film producers|producer]]s, this continuity may be violated, by accident or by design—film productions are notorious for altering fictional canon of written series.

The occasional publishing use of retroactive continuity ([[retcon]]) often occurs due to this kind of revision or oversight. Members of [[fandom]] often create a kind of fan-made canon ([[canon (fiction)#Nature of fictional canons|fanon]]) to patch up such errors; "fanon" that becomes generally accepted sometimes becomes actual canon. Other fan-made additions to a universe ([[fan fiction]], [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternative universe]], [[pastiche]], [[parody]]) are usually not considered canonical unless they get [[authorization|authorized]].

==Collaboration==
{{Main|Shared universe}}

Shared universes often come about when a fictional universe achieves great commercial success and attracts other media. For example, a successful movie may catch the attention of various book authors, who wish to write stories based on that movie. Under US law, the copyright-holder retains control of all other [[derivative work]]s, including those written by other authors. But they might not feel comfortable in those other mediums or may feel that other individuals will do a better job. Therefore, they may open up the copyright on a shared-universe basis. The degree to which the copyright-holder or [[franchise (media)|franchise]] retains control is often one of the points in the [[license agreement#Intellectual property|license agreement]].

For example, the [[comic book]] [[Superman]] was so popular that it spawned over 30 different radio, television and movie series and a similar number of [[video games]], as well as theme park rides, books and songs. In the other direction, both [[Star Trek]] and [[Star Wars]] are responsible for hundreds of books and games of varying levels of [[canon (fiction)|canonicity]].

Fictional universes are sometimes shared by multiple prose authors, with each author's works in that universe being granted approximately equal [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] status. For example, [[Larry Niven]]'s fictional universe [[Known Space]] has an approximately 135 year period in which Niven allows other authors to write stories about the [[Man-Kzin Wars]]. Other fictional universes, like the [[Ring of Fire series]], actively court canonical [[The Grantville Gazettes|stimulus from fans]], but gate and control the  changes through a formalized process and the final say of [[Eric Flint|the editor and universe creator]].<ref>{{cite book | title =''[[Grantville Gazette III]]'' | others = [[Thomas Kidd (illustrator)|Thomas Kidd]] (cover art) | ISBN = 978-1-4165-0941-7, ISBN 1-4165-0941-0 | publisher = [[Baen Books]] | last = [[Eric Flint|Flint, Eric]] and various others | pages = 311–313|quote=The print published and e-published Grantville Gazettes all contain a post book [[afterword]] detailing where and how to submit a manuscript to the fictional canon oversight process for the [[1632 series]].}}</ref>

Other universes are created by one or several authors but are intended to be used non-canonically by others, such as the fictional settings for [[game]]s, particularly [[role-playing game]]s and [[video game]]s. Settings for the role-playing game ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' are called [[campaign setting]]s; other games have also incorporated this term on occasion. [[Virtual world]]s are fictional worlds in which [[online]] computer games, notably [[MMORPG]]s and [[MUD]]s, take place. A [[fictional crossover]] occurs when two or more [[fictional character]]s, series or universes cross over with one another, usually in the context of a character created by one author or owned by one [[company (law)|company]] meeting a character created or owned by another. In the case where two fictional universes covering entire ''actual'' universes cross over, physical travel from one universe to another may actually occur in the course of the story. Such crossovers are usually, but not always, considered non-canonical by their creators or by those in charge of the [[intellectual property|properties]] involved.
