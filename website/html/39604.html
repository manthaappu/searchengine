'''Vladimir Grigoryevich Shukhov''' ({{lang-ru|Владимир Григорьевич Шухов}}), ({{OldStyleDate|August 28|1853|August 16}} - February 2, 1939) was a [[Russia]]n [[engineer]]-[[polymath]], [[scientist]] and  [[architect]] renowned for his pioneering works on new methods of analysis for [[structural engineering]] that led to breakthroughs in [[industrial design]] of world's first  [[hyperboloid structure]]s <ref>{{cite web | title = Hyperboloid water tower | year = 2007 | publisher = Nicolas Janburg, ICS | work = International Database and Gallery of Structures | url = http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0037128 | accessdate = 2007-11-28}}</ref>, [[Thin-shell structure|lattice shell structures]]<ref name="Nicolas Janburg, ICS">{{cite web | title = Rotunda of the Panrussian Exposition | year = 2007 | publisher = Nicolas Janburg, ICS | work = International Database and Gallery of Structures | url = http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0000385 | accessdate = 2007-11-28}}</ref>, [[tensile structure]]s<ref name="Nicolas Janburg, ICS"/>, [[gridshell]] structures<ref name="Nicolas Janburg, ICS"/>, [[oil reservoir]]s, [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], [[boiler]]s, ships and [[barge]]s. 

Besides the innovations he brought to the oil industry and the construction of numerous bridges and buildings, Shukhov was the inventor of a new family of doubly-curved structural forms. These forms, based on non-Euclidean hyperbolic [[geometry]], are known today as [[hyperboloid]]s of revolution. Shukhov developed not only many varieties of light-weight hyperboloid [[tower]]s and [[roof]] systems, but also the mathematics for their analysis. Shukhov is particularly reputed for his original designs of [[hyperboloid structure|hyperboloid towers]] such as the [[Shukhov Tower]].

==Biography==
[[File:Russian Cracking.jpg|thumb|220px|Factory of [[Shukhov cracking process]], [[Baku]], [[USSR]], 1932]]

Vladimir Shukhov was born in a town of [[Graivoron]], [[Belgorod]] [[uezd]], [[Kursk]] [[gubernia]] (in present-day [[Belgorod Oblast]]) into a petty noble family. His father Grigory Ivanovich Shukhov was a minor government official, promoted for his efforts in the [[Crimean War]]. For a while, Grigory served as [[Mayor]] of Graivoron and later as an administrator in [[Warsaw]].

In 1864 Vladimir entered [[Saint Petersburg]] [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] from which he graduated with distinction in 1871. During his high school years he showed mathematical talents, once demonstrating to his classmates and teacher an original [[Mathematical proof|proof]] of the [[Pythagorean theorem]]. The teacher praised his skills but he failed the grade for violating the textbook's guidelines. 

[[File:First Shukhov Tower Nizhny Novgorod 1896.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The world's first [[hyperboloid structure]] by Shukhov, [[Nizhny Novgorod]],  1896]]

After graduating from the gymnasium, Shukhov entered the [[Moscow State Technical University|Imperial Moscow Technical School]], in which his teachers included [[Pafnuty Chebyshev]], [[Aleksey Letnikov]], and [[Nikolai Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Nikolay Zhukovsky]]. In 1876 Shukhov graduated from the school with distinction and a Gold Medal. Chebyshev proposed to him a job as a lecturer in mathematics at the Imperial Moscow Technical School, but Shukhov decided to seek a job in the industry instead.

Thereupon Shukhov went to [[Philadelphia]], to work on the Russian pavilion at the [[World's Fair]] and to study the inner workings of the American industry. During his stay in the US Shukhov came to know a Russian-American entrepreneur, Alexander Veniaminovich Bari (Александр Вениаминович Бари) who also worked on the organization of the Fair.

In 1877 Shukhov returned to Russia and joined the drafting office of the Warsaw-[[Vienna]] railroad. Within several months, Shukhov's frustration with standard and routine engineering made him abandon the office and join a military-medical academy.

On his coming to Russia in 1877, Bari persuaded Shukhov to give up his medical education and to assume the office of Chief Engineer in a new company specializing in innovative engineering. Shukhov worked with Bari at this company until the [[October Revolution]]. Their works revolutionized many areas of civil engineering, ship engineering, and oil industry. The thermal [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] method, the [[Shukhov cracking process]], was patented by Vladimir Shukhov in 1891. 

Shukhov always found  time for a passionate [[hobby]] - photography.<ref>[http://www.shukhov.org/fotos.html The photographic works of Vladimir Shukhov]</ref> The photographic works of Shukhov opened new trends ahead of their flourishing of [[Fine art photography]]. He made photos in various [[genre]]s: [[reporting]], city [[landscape]], [[portrait]], [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]]. About two thousand photos and negatives made by Shukhov have survived until this day. 

After the October Revolution Shukhov decided to stay in the [[Soviet Union]] despite having received alluring job offers from around the world. Many signal Soviet engineering projects of the 1920s were associated with his name. In 1919 he framed his slogan: ''We should work independently from politics. The buildings, boilers, beams would be needed and so would we''. In the later 1930s during the [[Great Purge]] he retired from engineering work but was not arrested or persecuted.

Shukov died on February 2, 1939 in Moscow and was buried at the [[Novodevichy Convent|Novodevichy Cemetery]]. His many honours included the [[Lenin Prize]] (1929) and the title of Hero of Labour (1928).

Vladimir Shukhov is often referred as the Russian [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] for the sheer quantity and quality of his pioneering works. He was one of the first to develop practical calculations of [[Stress (physics)|stress]]es and [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]]s of [[Beam (structure)|beams]], shells and membranes on elastic foundation. These theoretical results allowed him to design the first Russian oil tanker, new types of oil tanker barges, and a new type of oil reservoirs. The same principle of the shell on an elastic foundation allowed to theoretically calculate the optimal diameter, wall thickness and fluid speed for the fluid pipelines. Shukhov's projects were instrumental in constructing:

*An oil [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]], the first in the [[Russian Empire]], between Balkhany and Cherny Gorod near [[Baku]] (12 km, 1878 complete, used by the [[Branobel]]). By 1883 the total length of Shukhov-designed, Bari-built oil pipelines in Baku exceeded 94 km, transporting 30 thousands [[barrel]]s of oil per day. In 1894 a similar pipeline network was built in [[Grozny]]. Shukhov designed the first Trans-Caucasian [[kerosene]] [[Baku-Batumi pipeline|pipeline between Baku and Batumi]] (835 km long) and [[Grozny-Tuapse oil pipeline|Grozny-Tuapse pipeline]] (618 km long).

*A superior design for water-mains. Shukhov designed (and Bari built) complete water-supply systems for the cities of [[Cherkassy]], [[Tambov]], [[Kharkov]], [[Voronezh]] and many others. In that age of infectious diseases his water-supply systems literally saved thousands of lives.
*A superior design for oil-tanker barges (less than half of the metal previously required), 84 150-meters long barges were built (mostly for the [[Volga]] river) as well as the first Russian seaworthy [[oil tanker]] ship. His approach to the ship strength analysis (using the model of a shell on an elastic foundation) was absolutely novel for that time.
*Shukhov-designed inexpensive oil tanks with the bottom calculated as a membrane on elastic foundation. They became very popular among oil-producers of the Imperial Russia. By 1881, 130 such tanks were built in [[Baku]] alone. 

Shukhov made important contributions to the chemical industry:

*He designed and built an [[oil]] [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] plant. His patents ([[Shukhov cracking process]] - patent of Russian empire No. 12926 from November, 27th, 1891) on cracking were used to invalidate [[Standard Oil]]'s patents ([[Burton process]] – Patent of USA  No. 1,049,667 on January 7, 1913) on [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]].

*He designed an original oil [[pump]]. Shukhov's pumps revolutionized Baku's oil industry allowing to increase its oil output.
*He designed one of the first [[furnace]]s that used the [[residual oil]]: before his works the residual oil was considered a waste and was discarded, due to his works it became recognized as an important technical product known as a ''fuel oil''.

Shukhov also left a lasting legacy to the [[Constructivist architecture]] of early Soviet Russia. As a leading specialist of metallic structures ([[hyperboloid structure]]s, [[thin-shell structure]]s, [[tensile structure]]s), he may be compared with [[Gustave Eiffel]]. Shukhov's innovative and exquisite constructions still grace many towns across the former [[Russian Empire]]: 

*Eight [[thin-shell structure]]s exhibition pavilions for the [[All-Russia exhibition 1896|All-Russia Exhibition]] in [[Nizhny Novgorod]] of 1896, covering the area of 27,000 m², and featuring an unorthodox water-tower that served as a model for more than 30 similar structures built in Imperial Russia, and thousands around the world now.
[[File:Double curvature steel lattice Shell by Shukhov in Vyksa 1897 shell.jpg|thumb|The world's first double curvature steel [[gridshell]] by Shukhov (during construction), [[Vyksa]] near [[Nizhny Novgorod]], 1897.]]
*About 200 original towers (hyperboloid steel [[gridshell]]s) all over the world, the most famous being the 160-meter-high [[Shukhov Tower]] in Moscow (1922) and 70-meter-high [[Adziogol Lighthouse]] near [[Kherson]] (1910). On Shukhov's 110th birthday in 1963 [[Soviet Union]] issued a postal stamp showing Shukhov and his tower (pictured).
*Spacious elongated shop galleries, bridged with innovative metal-and-glass vaults, notably the [[Upper Trade Rows]] on [[Red Square]] (1889–94), [[Pushkin Museum|Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts]]  (1898–1912) and [[Petrovka Passage]] (1903–06).
*Enormous metal arch vaulting for the Municipal Railway Park (1908) and the [[Kievskiy Rail Terminal|Kievskiy Railway Station]] in Moscow (1912–17).
*The colossal hall of the Central Post Office, Moscow (1911–13).
*Truss-supported metal framework for the Central Universal Store in Moscow (1906–08).
*A rotating scene for the [[Moscow Art Theatre]]. 
*Several [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] projects, designed in collaboration with [[Konstantin Melnikov]],  notably the [[Bakhmetevsky Bus Garage]] (1926–28) and [[Novo-Ryazanskaya Street Garage]] (1926–29).
*More than 180 [[bridge]]s across the [[Volga]], [[Yenisey]], [[Dnieper]], and other rivers.
*Stabilization [[Minaret]] of the [[Madrasah]] [[Ulugh Beg]] in [[Samarkand]] (Shukhov's last engineering work).
