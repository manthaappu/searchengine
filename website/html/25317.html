The MIP goal is to support all levels from corps to battalion. MIP's focus is on [[command and control]] systems.

The [[NATO]] Data Administration Group (NDAG) cooperates with the MIP's Data Modeling Working Group (DMWG) in building the [[JC3IEDM|Joint Consultation, Command and Control Information Exchange Data Model (JC3IEDM)]].

==C2IEDM==
The C2IEDM (the predecessor to the [[JC3IEDM]]), or '''Command and Control Information Exchange Data Model''', is a [[data model]] that is managed by the Multilateral Interoperability Programme (MIP).<ref>[http://www.mip-site.org/035_Public_Organ_DMWG.htm MIP site: Data Modelling Working Group]</ref> It originated with experts from various [[NATO]] partners and from the [[Partnership for Peace]] nations. This data model is in the process of being submitted to [[Object Management Group]] (OMG) for consideration as the standard for [[Information exchange]]. It falls under the shared operational picture exchange service.
