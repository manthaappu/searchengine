<html> <head> <title>Huygens Software</title></head><body>'''Huygens software''' refers to different [[multiplatform]] [[microscope image processing]] packages from Scientific Volume Imaging, made for restoring [[Cartesian coordinate system#Cartesian coordinates in two dimensions|2D]] and [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] [[microscopy]] images or [[time series]] and analyzing and visualizing them.

The restoration is based on different [[deconvolution]] [[algorithm]]s, that permit the recovery of objects from images that are degraded by blurring and noise. In [[microscopy]] the blurring is largely due to [[diffraction]] limited imaging by the instrument; the [[Noise_(physics)|noise]] is usually [[photon noise]].

The [[scientific visualization]] of 3D volume data is based on the [[simulated fluorescence process algorithm]] (SFP), but [[isosurface]]s and [[maximum intensity projection]]s are also used for object analysis and [[colocalization]].

Huygens software is named after the Dutch physicist [[Christiaan Huygens]] who is perhaps best known for his argument that light behaves like waves. Since
wave diffraction plays a key role in the Huygens Software, it was named after him.
