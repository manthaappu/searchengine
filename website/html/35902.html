A '''strict programming language''' is one in which only [[strict function]]s (functions whose parameters must be evaluated completely before they may be called) may be defined by the user. A '''non-strict programming language''' allows the user to define non-strict functions, and hence may allow [[lazy evaluation]].

== Examples ==

Nearly all [[programming language]]s in common use today are strict. Examples include [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Perl]] (up through version 5), [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Common Lisp]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], and [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. The best known non-strict languages are [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[Miranda (programming language)|Miranda]], and [[Clean (programming language)|Clean]].

== Explanation ==

In most non-strict languages the non-strictness extends to [[algebraic data type|data constructor]]s. This allows conceptually infinite data structures (such as the list of all [[prime number]]s) to be manipulated in the same way as ordinary finite data structures. It also allows for the use of very large but finite data structures such as the complete [[game tree]] of [[chess]].

Non-strictness has several disadvantages which have prevented widespread adoption:

* Because of the uncertainty regarding if and when expressions will be evaluated, non-strict languages generally must be [[purely functional]] to be useful.
* All [[computer architecture|hardware architecture]]s in common use are optimized for strict languages, so the best compilers for non-strict languages produce slower code than the best compilers for strict languages, with the notable exception of the [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler]] which outperforms many strict language compilers{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.
* [[Space complexity]] of non-strict programs is difficult to understand and predict.

Strict programming languages are often associated with [[eager evaluation]], and non-strict languages with [[lazy evaluation]], but other [[evaluation strategy|evaluation strategies]] are possible in each case. The terms "eager programming language" and "lazy programming language" are often used as synonyms for "strict programming language" and "non-strict programming language" respectively.

In many strict languages, some advantages of non-strict functions can be obtained through the use of [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] or [[thunk]]s.
