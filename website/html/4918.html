<html> <head> <title>CAMiLEON</title></head><body>The '''CAMiLEON''' (Creative Archiving at Michigan & Leeds) project was a joint undertaking by the [[University of Michigan]] and the [[University of Leeds]] to develop and evaluate a range of technical strategies for the long term [[digital preservation| preservation of digital material]] suffering from [[digital obsolescence]].  The project was funded jointly by the UK [[Joint Information Systems Committee]] (JISC) and the US [[National Science Foundation]] over a 3-4 year period from 1 October 1999. The UK component of the project was completed on 31 December 2002, the US component finished on 30 September 2003.

The project's first case study was the multimedia [[BBC Domesday Project]] created by the [[BBC]] between 1985 and 1986.  The BBC published this work on Laser Discs in LVROM format, which can now be read only by a few machines, and there were fears that the data would become unreadable.  The method proposed by CAMiLEON to recover the data was to [[emulator|emulate]] the obsolete hardware using modern equipment. CAMiLEON has successfully produced a system, DomesEm, that emulates the original hardware and allows the discs to be viewed.
