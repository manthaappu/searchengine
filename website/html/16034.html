<html> <head> <title>HMAC</title></head><body>[[File:Shahmac.jpg|thumb|right|400px|SHA-1 HMAC Generation.]]In [[cryptography]], '''HMAC''' (Hash-based Message Authentication Code), is a specific construction for calculating a [[message authentication code]] (MAC) involving a [[cryptographic hash function]] in combination with a secret [[cryptographic key|key]].  As with any MAC, it may be used to simultaneously verify both the ''[[data integrity]]'' and the ''[[Authentication|authenticity]]'' of a [[cleartext|message]].  Any cryptographic hash function, such as [[MD5]] or [[SHA-1]], may be used in the calculation of an HMAC; the resulting MAC algorithm is termed HMAC-MD5 or HMAC-SHA1 accordingly. The cryptographic strength of the HMAC depends upon the [[cryptographic strength]] of the underlying hash function, the size of its hash output length in bits and on the size and quality of the cryptographic key.

An iterative hash function breaks up a message into blocks of a fixed size and iterates over them with a [[One-way compression function|compression function]]. For example, MD5 and SHA-1 operate on 512-bit blocks. The size of the output of HMAC is the same as that of the underlying hash function (128 or 160 bits in the case of MD5 or SHA-1, respectively), although it can be truncated if desired.

The definition and analysis of the HMAC construction was first published in 1996 by [[Mihir Bellare]], Ran Canetti, and Hugo Krawczyk,<ref name=BCK96/> who also wrote RFC 2104.  This paper also defined a variant called NMAC that is rarely if ever used. [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS]] PUB 198 generalizes and standardizes the use of HMACs. HMAC-SHA-1 and HMAC-MD5 are used within the [[IPsec]] and [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] protocols.

==Definition (from RFC 2104)==
Let:
*'''H'''(·) be a cryptographic hash function
*''K'' be a secret key padded to the right with extra zeros to the input block size of the hash function, or the hash of the original key if it's longer than that block size
*''m'' be the message to be authenticated
*∥ denote [[concatenation]]
*⊕ denote [[exclusive or]] (XOR)
*opad be the outer padding (0x5c5c5c…5c5c, one-block-long [[hexadecimal]] constant)
*ipad be the inner padding (0x363636…3636, one-block-long [[hexadecimal]] constant)

Then '''HMAC'''(''K'',''m'') is mathematically defined by

:'''HMAC'''(''K'',''m'') = '''H'''<big><big>(</big></big>(''K'' ⊕ opad) ∥ '''H'''<big>(</big>(''K'' ⊕ ipad) ∥ m<big>)<big>)</big></big>.

==Implementation==
The following [[pseudocode]] demonstrates how HMAC may be implemented.

 '''function''' hmac (key, message)
     '''if''' (length(key) > blocksize) '''then'''
         key = hash(key) <span style="color: green;">''// keys longer than blocksize are shortened''</span>
     '''end if'''
     '''if''' (length(key) < blocksize) '''then'''
         key = key || [0x00 * (blocksize - length(key))] <span style="color:green;">// keys shorter than blocksize are zero-padded('||' is concatenation) </span>
     '''end if'''
     
     o_key_pad = [0x5c * blocksize] ⊕ key <span style="color: green;">''// Where blocksize is that of the underlying hash function''</span>
     i_key_pad = [0x36 * blocksize] ⊕ key <span style="color: green;">''// Where ⊕ is exclusive or (XOR)''</span>
     
     '''return''' hash(o_key_pad || hash(i_key_pad || message)) <span style="color: green;">''// Where '||' is concatenation''</span>
 '''end function'''

== Example usage ==
A business that suffers from attackers that place fraudulent [[Internet]] orders may insist that all its customers deposit a secret key with them. Along with an order, a customer must supply the order's HMAC digest, computed using the customer's symmetric key. The business, knowing the customer's symmetric key, can then verify that the order originated from the stated customer and has not been tampered with.

==Design principles==

The design of the HMAC specification was motivated by the existence of attacks on more trivial mechanisms for combining a key with a hash function.  For example, one might assume the same security that HMAC provides could be achieved with MAC = '''H'''(''key'' ∥ ''message'').  However this method suffers from a serious flaw: with most hash functions, it is easy to append data to the message without knowing the key and obtain another valid MAC.  The alternative, appending the key using MAC = '''H'''(''message'' ∥ ''key''), suffers from the problem that an attacker who can find a collision in the (unkeyed) hash function has a collision in the MAC.   Using MAC = '''H'''(''key'' ∥ ''message'' ∥ ''key'') is better, however various security papers have suggested vulnerabilities with this approach, even when two different keys are used.<ref name=BCK96>{{Cite web |title=Keying Hash Functions for Message Authentication |first1=Mihir |last1=Bellare |author1-link=Mihir Bellare |first2=Ran |last2=Canetti |first3=Hugo |last3=Krawczyk |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.134.8430 |year=1996 |postscript=.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=MDx-MAC and Building Fast MACs from Hash Functions |year=1995 |first1=Bart |last1=Preneel |author1-link=Bart Preneel |first2=Paul C. |last2=van Oorschot |author2-link=Paul van Oorschot |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.34.3855 |accessdate=2009-08-28 |postscript=.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=On the Security of Two MAC Algorithms |year=1995 |first1=Bart |last1=Preneel |author1-link=Bart Preneel |first2=Paul C. |last2=van Oorschot |author2-link=Paul van Oorschot |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.42.8908 |accessdate=2009-08-28 |postscript=.}}</ref>

No known extensions attacks have been found against the current HMAC specification which is defined as '''H'''(''key1'' ∥ '''H'''(''key2'' ∥ ''message'')) because the outer application of the hash function masks the intermediate result of the internal hash.  The values of ''ipad'' and ''opad'' are not critical to the security of the algorithm, but were defined in such a way to have a large [[Hamming distance]] from each other and so the inner and outer keys will have fewer bits in common.

== Security ==
The cryptographic strength of the HMAC depends upon the size of the secret key that is used.  The most common attack against HMACs is brute force to uncover the secret key.  HMACs are substantially less affected by collisions than their underlying hashing algorithms alone.<ref>{{cite web

This recovers a proof based guarantee since no known attacks compromise the pseudorandomness of the compression function, and it also helps explain the resistance-to-attack that HMAC has shown even when implemented with hash functions whose (weak) collision resistance is compromised.''

In 2006, [[Jongsung Kim]], [[Alex Biryukov]], [[Bart Preneel]], and [[Seokhie Hong]] showed how to distinguish HMAC with reduced versions of MD5 and SHA-1 or full versions of [[HAVAL]], [[MD4]], and [[SHA-0]] from a [[random function]] or HMAC with a random function. Differential distinguishers allow an attacker to devise a forgery attack on HMAC. Furthermore, differential and rectangle distinguishers can lead to [[preimage attack|second-preimage attacks]]. HMAC with the full version of MD4 can be [[forgery (Cryptography)|forged]] with this knowledge. These attacks do not contradict the security proof of HMAC, but provide insight into HMAC based on existing cryptographic hash functions.
