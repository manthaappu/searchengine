'''Command Prompt''' ([[executable]] name <code>'''cmd.exe'''</code>) is the [[command-line interpreter]] on [[OS/2]], [[Windows CE]] and on [[Windows NT]]-based operating systems (including Windows [[Windows 2000|2000]], [[Windows XP|XP]], [[Windows Vista|Vista]], [[Windows 7|7]], [[Windows Server 2003|Server 2003]] and [[Windows Server 2008|Server 2008]]). It is the analog of <code>[[COMMAND.COM]]</code> in [[MS-DOS]] and [[Windows 9x]] (where it is called MS-DOS Prompt) systems, or of the [[Unix shell]]s used on [[Unix-like]] systems.

== Versions == 
Therese Stowell developed the initial version of <code>cmd.exe</code> for Windows NT.<ref>{{cite book |title=Showstopper! The Breakneck Race to Create Windows NT and the Next Generation at Microsoft |first=G. Pascal |last=Zachary | year=1994 |publisher=Warner Books |isbn=0-02-935671-7}}</ref> Although some old DOS commands are unsupported or have been changed (ex: the functionality of <code>[[deltree]]</code> was rolled into <code>[[rmdir|rd]]</code> in the form of the /s parameter), <code>cmd.exe</code> still has a greater number of [[Shell builtin|built-in commands]].

Both the OS/2 and the Windows NT versions of <code>cmd.exe</code> have more detailed error messages than the blanket "Bad command or file name" (in the case of malformed commands) of command.com. In the OS/2 version of <code>cmd.exe</code>, errors are reported in the current language of the system, their text being taken from the system message files. The '''help''' command can then be issued with the error message number to obtain further information.

<code>cmd.exe</code> remains part of [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows Server 2008]], and [[Windows 7]].

== Technical information ==
Unlike <code>[[COMMAND.COM]]</code>, which is a [[DOS]] program, <code>cmd.exe</code> is a native program for the platform. This allows it to take advantage of features available to native programs on the platform that are otherwise unavailable to DOS programs. For example, since <code>cmd.exe</code> is a native text-mode application on [[OS/2]], it can use real [[Pipeline (Unix)|pipes]] in command pipelines, allowing both sides of the pipeline to run concurrently. As a result, it is possible to redirect the standard error in <code>cmd.exe</code>, unlike <code>COMMAND.COM</code>. (<code>COMMAND.COM</code> uses temporary files, and runs the two sides serially, one after the other.)

In reality, <code>cmd.exe</code> is a Windows program that acts as a DOS-like command line interpreter. It is generally compatible, but provides extensions which address the limitations of <code>COMMAND.COM</code>:

* <code>SETLOCAL</code>/<code>ENDLOCAL</code> commands limit the scope of changes to the environment
* internal <code>CALL</code> and <code>GOTO</code> labels lessen the need for individual batch files to perform parts of a task.
* filename-parsing extensions to the <code>SET</code> command are comparable to [[C shell]].
* an expression-evaluation extensions is also provided in the <code>SET</code> command.
* an expansion of the <code>FOR</code> command to support parsing files and arbitrary sets in addition to filenames.
* use of arrow keys to scroll through command history (provided by <code>[[DOSKey]]</code> in <code>COMMAND.COM</code>)
* off-by-default path completion capabilities similar to <code>bash</code> [[tab completion]]
* a [[Directory (file systems)|directory]] stack accessible with the <code>[[pushd and popd|PUSHD]]</code> and <code>[[pushd and popd|POPD]]</code> commands
* <code>IF</code> can perform [[Case sensitivity|case-insensitive]] comparisons and numeric equality and inequality comparisons in addition to case-sensitive string comparisons 
* the ability to [[escape character|escape]] reserved characters by using the [[caret]] character (<code>^</code>)

The command extensions involve changes and/or additions to the following
commands:

    DEL or ERASE
    COLOR
    CD or CHDIR
    MD or MKDIR
    PROMPT
    PUSHD
    POPD
    SET
    SETLOCAL
    ENDLOCAL
    IF
    FOR
    CALL
    SHIFT
