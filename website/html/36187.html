<html> <head> <title>Superconvergence</title></head><body>In [[numerical analysis]], a '''superconvergent''' method is one which converges faster than generally expected. For example in the [[Finite Element Method]] approximation to [[Poisson's equation]] in two dimensions, using piecewise linear elements, the average error in the [[gradient]] is [[First order approximation|first order]]. However under certain conditions it's possible to recover the gradient at certain locations within each element to [[Second order approximation|second order]].
