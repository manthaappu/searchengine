<html> <head> <title>James Pustejovsky</title></head><body>''' James Pustejovsky''' is a TJX Feldberg [[professor]] of [[computer science]] at [[Brandeis University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]].  His expertises are on Theoretical and computational modeling of language, specifically: [[Computational linguistics]], [[Lexical semantics]], [[Knowledge representation and reasoning|Knowledge representation]], temporal reasoning and [[Extraction]]. His main topic of research is [[Natural language processing]].

Pustejovsky proposed [[Generative Lexicon]] theory in [[lexical semantics]].  His other interests include [[Time|temporal]] reasoning, events, [[information extraction]], [[computational linguistics]].

== Current research ==
Pustejovsky's research group's current projects include the [[TimeML]] and Medstract projects.  The TimeML project is attempting to create a standard [[markup language]] for [[Time|temporal]] events in a document.  The Medstract project attempts to extract information from [[medical]] documents using current [[natural language processing]] technology.
