'''STONITH''' ("Shoot The Other Node In The Head" or "Shoot The Offending Node In The Head"), sometimes called '''STOMITH''' ("Shoot The Other Member/Machine In The Head"), is a technique for [[node fencing]] in [[computer cluster]]s.  The simple idea utilizes the notion that if a node is on the wrong side of the fence, i.e. a node and its backup are both active, a STONITH message will force the offending node to power down.

Two nodes in the same cluster trying to do exactly the same thing can have catastrophic results, such as if both nodes try writing to a shared storage resource. STONITH provides effective, if rather drastic, protection against these problems.
