The term '''information revolution''' (sometimes called also the "information''al'' revolution") describes current [[economy|economic]], social and technological trends beyond the Industrial Revolution.

Many competing terms have been proposed that focus on different aspects of this societal development.
The British [[polymath]] [[crystallographer]] [[J. D. Bernal]] (1939) introduced the term "''scientific and technical revolution''" in his book ''The Social Function of Science'' in order to describe the new role that science and technology are coming to play within society. He asserted that science is becoming a "productive force", using the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Theory of Productive Forces]]. After some controversy, the term was taken up by authors and institutions of the then-[[Soviet Bloc]]. Their aim was to show that [[socialism]] was a safe home for the scientific and technical ("technological" for some authors) revolution, referred to by the acronym '''STR'''. The book ''Civilization at the Crossroads'', edited by the Czech [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Radovan Richta]] (1969), became a standard reference for this topic.

[[Daniel Bell]] (1980) challenged this theory and advocated ''[[Post Industrial Society]]'', which would lead to a [[service economy]] rather than [[socialism]]. Many other authors presented their views, including [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] (1976) with his "Technetronic Society".

==Information in social and economic activities==

The main feature of the information revolution is the growing economic, social and technological role of [[information]]. Information-related activities did not come up with the Information Revolution. They existed, in one form or the other, in all human societies, and eventually developed into institutions, such as the [[Platonic Academy]], [[Aristotle]]'s [[Peripatetic school]] in the [[Lyceum]], the [[Musaeum]] and the [[Library of Alexandria]], or the schools of [[Babylonian astronomy]]. The [[Agricultural Revolution]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]] came up when new informational inputs were produced by individual innovators, or by scientific and technical institutions. During the Information Revolution all these activities are experiencing continuous growth, while other information-oriented activities are emerging.

Information is the central theme of several new sciences, which emerged in the 1940s, including [[Claude E. Shannon|Shannon]]'s (1949) ''[[Information Theory]]'' and [[Norbert Wiener|Wiener]]'s (1948) ''[[Cybernetics]]''. Wiener (1948, p. 155) stated also: "information is information not matter or energy". This aphorism suggests that information should be considered along with [[matter]] and [[energy]] as the third constituent part of the Universe; information is carried by matter or by energy.

We can distinguish between [[information]], [[data]], [[knowledge]], and [[wisdom]]. [[Data]] comes through research and collection. [[Information]] is organized data. [[Knowledge]] is built upon information.  [[Wisdom]] is knowing what to do with the knowledge--knowing how to synthesize the knowledge and make it useful to [[humankind]].  

Data and information are easily transferable; knowledge built by a person is not certain that it can  be transferred to another. Following this, the notion of a "[[knowledge society]]" cannot be defined cogently.  A ''wisdom society'' would have to be a [[Futurism|futuristic]] society in which all human beings were educated to the highest level.  

Information is then further considered as an economic activity, since firms and institutions are involved in its production, collection, exchange, distribution, circulation, processing, transmission, and control. Labor is also divided into physical labor (use of muscle power) and informational labor (use of intellectual power). A new economic sector is thereby identified, the [[Information Sector]], which amalgamates information-related labor activities.

==The theory of information revolution==
The term ''information revolution'' may relate to, or contrast with, such widely used terms as [[Industrial Revolution]] and [[Agricultural Revolution]]. Note, however, that you may prefer mentalist to materialist paradigm. The following fundamental aspects of the theory of information revolution can be given (Veneris 1984, 1990):

# The object of economic activities can be conceptualized according to the fundamental distinction between [[matter]], [[energy]], and [[information]]. These apply both to the object of each economic activity, as well as within each economic activity or enterprise. For instance, an industry may process matter (e.g. iron) using energy and information (production and process technologies, management, etc).
# Information is a [[factor of production]] (along with [[Capital (economics)|capital]], [[Labor (economics)|labor]], [[land (economics)]]), as well as a [[Product (business)|product]] sold in the [[market]], that is, a [[commodity]]. As such, it acquires [[use value]] and [[exchange value]], and therefore a [[price]].
# All products have [[use value]], [[exchange value]], and informational value. The latter can be measured by the information content of the product, in terms of innovation, design, etc.
# Industries develop information-generating activities, the so-called [[Research and Development]] ([[R&D]]) functions.
# Enterprises, and society at large, develop the information control and processing functions, in the form of management structures; these are also called "[[white-collar workers]]", "[[bureaucracy]]", "managerial functions", etc.
# Labor can be classified according to the object of labor, into information labor and non-information labor.
# Information activities constitute a large, new economic sector, the information sector along with the traditional [[primary sector]], [[secondary sector]], and [[tertiary sector]], according to the [[three-sector hypothesis]]. These should be restated because they are based on the ambiguous definitions made by [[Colin Clark]] (1940), who included in the tertiary sector all activities that have not been included in the primary (agriculture, forestry, etc.) and secondary (manufacturing) sectors. The [[quaternary sector]] and the [[quinary sector of the economy]] attempt to classify these new activities, but their definitions are not based on a clear conceptual scheme, although the latter is considered by some as equivalent with the [[Information Sector|information sector]]. [http://geography.about.com/od/urbaneconomicgeography/a/sectorseconomy.htm]
# From a strategic point of view, sectors can be defined as [[information sector]], [[means of production]], [[means of consumption]], thus extending the classical [[Ricardo]]-[[Marx]] model of the [[Capitalist mode of production]] (see [[Influences on Karl Marx]]). [[Marx]] stressed in many occasions the role of the "intellectual element" in production, but failed to  find a place for it into his model.
# [[Innovations]] are the result of the production of new information, as new products, new [[methods of production]], [[patents]], etc. [[Diffusion of innovations]] manifests saturation effects (related term: [[market saturation]]), following certain cyclical patterns and creating "economic waves", also referred to as "[[business cycles]]". There are various types of waves, such as [[Kondratiev wave]] ( 54 years), [[Kuznets swing]] (18 years), [[Juglar cycle]] (9 years) and [[Kitchin cycle|Kitchin]] (about 4 years, see also [[Joseph Schumpeter]]) distinguished by their nature, duration, and, thus, economic impact.
# [[Diffusion of innovations]] causes structural-sectoral shifts in the economy, which can be smooth or can create crisis and renewal, a process which [[Joseph Schumpeter]] called vividly "[[creative destruction]]".

From a different perspective, [[Irving E. Fang]] (1997) identified six 'Information Revolutions': writing, printing, mass media, entertainment, the 'tool shed' (which we call 'home' now), and the Information Highway. In this work the term 'information revolution' is used in a narrow sense, to describe trends in communication media.

==Measuring and modeling the Information Revolution==

Porat (1976) measured the Information Sector in the US using the [[input-output analysis]]; [[OECD]] has included statistics on the Information Sector in the economic reports of its member countries.

Veneris (1984, 1990) explored the theoretical, economic and regional aspects of the Informational Revolution and developed a [[systems dynamics]] [[simulation]] [[computer model]].

These works can be seen as following the path originated with the work of [[Fritz Machlup]] who in his (1962) book "The Production and Distribution of Knowledge in the United States", claimed that the "knowledge industry represented 29% of the US gross national product", which he saw as evidence that the Information Age has begun. He defines knowledge as a commodity and attempts to measure the magnitude of the production and distribution of this commodity within a modern economy. Machlup divided information use into three classes: instrumental, intellectual, and pastime knowledge. He identified also five types of knowledge: practical knowledge; intellectual knowledge, that is, general culture and the satisfying of intellectual curiosity; pastime knowledge, that is, knowledge satisfying non-intellectual curiosity or the desire for light entertainment and emotional stimulation; spiritual or religious knowledge; unwanted knowledge, accidentally acquired and aimlessly retained.
