<!-- "will revolutionize", "will change the face of"-->

'''Semantic publishing''' on the [[World Wide Web|Web]] or [[semantic web]] publishing refers to publishing information on the web as documents accompanied by [[semantic markup]]. Semantic publication provides a way for computers to understand the structure and even the meaning of the published information, making information search and [[data integration]] more efficient.

Although semantic publishing is not specific to the Web, it has been driven by the rising of the semantic web. In the semantic web, published information is accompanied by metadata describing the information, providing a "semantic" context.

Although semantic publishing has the potential to change the face of [[web publishing]], acceptance depends on the emergence of compelling applications. Web sites can already be built with all contents in both [[HTML]] format and semantic format.<ref>
Examples are [http://www.mindswap.org/ mindswap], [http://ebiquity.umbc.edu/ UMBC ebiquity], and [http://web2express.org/openlab web2express.org open lab]</ref> [[RSS]]1.0, uses [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] (a semantic web standard) format, although it has become less popular than RSS2.0 and [[Atom (standard)|Atom]].<ref name=ufeed>
Web2express.org applies RDF to various data feeds. Anyone can use their service
[http://web2express.org/ufeed/ free online service (ufeed)] to create and provide RDF data resources and datafeeds for products, news, events, jobs and studies.</ref>

Semantic publishing has the potential to revolutionize [[Academic publishing|scientific publishing]]. [[Tim Berners-Lee]] predicted in 2001 that the semantic web “will likely profoundly change the very nature of how [[scientific knowledge]] is produced and shared, in ways that we can now barely imagine”.<ref>{{
harvnb|Berners-Lee|Hendler|2001}}</ref> Revisiting the semantic web in 2006, he and his colleagues believed the semantic web “could bring about a revolution in how, for example, scientific content is managed throughout its life cycle”.<ref>{{
harvnb|Shadbolt|Berners-Lee|Hall|2006}}</ref> Researchers could directly self-publish their experiment data in "semantic" format on the web. Semantic search engines could then make these data widely available. The [[W3C]] interest group in healthcare and life sciences is exploring this idea.<ref>

==Two approaches==
*Publish information as data objects using semantic web languages like [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] and [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]]. [[Ontology (information science)|Ontology]] is usually developed for a specific information domain, which can formally represent the data in its domain. Semantic publishing of more general information like product information, news, and job openings uses so-called [[shallow ontology]].<ref name=ufeed/> The SWEO Linking Open Data Project<ref>
[http://esw.w3.org/topic/TaskForces/CommunityProjects/LinkingOpenData W3C SWEO Linking Open Data Project]</ref> maintains a list of data sources<ref>
[http://esw.w3.org/topic/TaskForces/CommunityProjects/LinkingOpenData/DataSets list of data sources]</ref> that follow this approach as well as a list of Semantic Publishing Tools.<ref>
[http://esw.w3.org/topic/TaskForces/CommunityProjects/LinkingOpenData/PublishingTools Semantic Publishing Tools]</ref>
*Embed formal metadata in documents using new markup languages like [[RDFa]] and [[Microformats]].

==Examples of ontologies and vocabularies for publishing==

*[[Dublin Core]]
*[[SKOS]]
*[[FOAF (software)|FOAF]]
*[[SIOC]]
*[[RSS (file format)|RSS]]
*[[DOAP]]

==Examples of free or open source tools and services==
*[http://ambraproject.org/ Ambra Project] is open source software designed to publish [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] journals with [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]. Used by [[PLoS]].
*[[Semantic MediaWiki]]: An extension to the wiki application [[MediaWiki]] that allows users to semantically annotate data on the wiki, and then republish it in formats such as RDF XML.
*[http://swoogle.umbc.edu/ Swoogle]: A search engine for ontologies and instance data on the Web.
*[http://www.web2express.org/ufeed/ Ufeed]: Tool for publishing data resources and data feeds in RDF, including product information, news, events, jobs and studies.
*[http://sites.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/suhl/bizer/d2r-server/ D2R Server]: Tool for publishing relational databases on the Semantic Web as [[Linked Data]] and [[SPARQL]] endpoints.
*[http://www.bigblogzoo.com BigBlogZoo]: Regularly [[Web crawler|crawl]]s 60,000 [[XML]] sources and  reaggregates articles under a [[Semantic URL]]. Adopts the DMOZ RDF classification schema.
