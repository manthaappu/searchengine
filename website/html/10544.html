'''Dirac''' (named after [[Paul Dirac]]) is a relativistic [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio]] [[quantum chemistry]] program. The full name is "Program for Atomic and Molecular Direct Iterative Relativistic All-electron Calculations", in short PAM Dirac. It is capable of calculating various molecular properties using the [[Hartree&ndash;Fock]], [[Møller&ndash;Plesset perturbation theory|MP2]], [[density functional theory]], [[configuration interaction]] and [[coupled cluster]] electronic structure theories. Dirac is one of the most successful general-purpose quantum chemistry packages that provides accurate description of relativistic effects in molecules, using the [[Dirac equation]] as its starting point.<ref>{{cite journal | author = M.
