'''Journalling Flash File System version 2''' or '''JFFS2''' is a [[log-structured file system]] for use in [[flash memory]] devices.<ref>[http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/faq/jffs2.html#L_hdd_jffs2 JFFS2, mainly designed for raw flash, not for block devices like hard drives, USB sticks, CF cards etc. (block2mtd)]</ref> It is the successor to [[JFFS]].  JFFS2 has been included in the [[Linux kernel]] since the 2.4.10 release. JFFS2 is also available for [[Open Firmware]], the [[eCos]] RTOS and the [[RedBoot]] bootloader.

The new [[LogFS]] filesystem is aimed to replace JFFS2 for most uses, but focuses more on large devices (> 64 MB - 512 MB), see also [[UBIFS]] and [[YAFFS]].

== Features ==

JFFS2 introduced:
* Support for [[NAND flash#NAND flash|NAND flash]] devices. This involved a considerable amount of work as NAND devices have a sequential I/O interface and cannot be memory-mapped for reading.
* Hard links. This was not possible in JFFS because of limitations in the on-disk format.
* Compression. Three algorithms are available: [[zlib]], rubin and rtime.
* Better performance.  JFFS treated the disk as a purely circular log.  This generated a great deal of unnecessary I/O.  The [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] [[algorithm]] in JFFS2 makes this mostly unnecessary.

== Design ==

As with JFFS, changes to files and directories are "logged" to flash in ''nodes'', of which there are two types:
* ''[[inode]]s'': a header with file metadata, followed by a payload of file data (if any). Compressed payloads are limited to one page. 
* ''dirent'' nodes: directory entries each holding a name and an inode number. Hard links are represented as different names with the same inode number. The special inode number 0 represents an unlink.
As with JFFS, nodes start out as ''valid'' when they are created, and become ''obsolete'' when a newer version has been created elsewhere.

Unlike JFFS, however, there is no circular log.  Instead, JFFS2 deals in ''blocks'', a unit the same size as the erase segment of the flash medium. Blocks are filled, one at a time, with nodes from bottom up.  A ''clean'' block is one that contains only ''valid'' nodes.  A ''dirty'' block contains at least one ''obsolete'' node. A ''free'' block contains no nodes.

The [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collector]] runs in the background, turning ''dirty'' blocks into ''free'' blocks.  It does this by copying ''valid'' nodes to a new block and skipping ''obsolete'' ones.  That done, it erases the ''dirty'' block and tags it with a special marker designating it as a ''free'' block (to prevent confusion if power is lost during an erase operation).

To make [[wear levelling|wear-levelling]] more even and prevent erasures from being too concentrated on mostly-static file systems, the garbage collector will occasionally also consume ''clean'' blocks.

== Disadvantages ==

* All nodes must still be scanned at [[Mount (computing)|mount]] time.  This is slow and is becoming an increasingly serious problem as flash devices scale upward into the [[Gigabyte]] range.
* Writing many small blocks of data can even lead to negative compression rates, so it is essential for applications to use large write buffers.
* There is no practical way to tell how much usable free space is left on a device since this depends both on how well additional data can be compressed, and the writing sequence.
