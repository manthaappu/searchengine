The '''RS Media''' is another product in [[WowWee]]'s line of [[biomorphic]] [[robot]]s, based on a walking system designed by [[Mark Tilden]]. The RS Media uses basically the same body as the [[Robosapien v2|Robosapien V2]], but a different [[brain]] based on a [[Linux]] kernel. As the name implies, the RS Media's focus is on [[multimedia]] capabilities, including the ability to record and playback [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]], [[pictures]] and [[video]]. It retains and builds upon the Robosapien V2's [[sensor]] array and [[programming|programmability]].

== Hardware ==

* Two primary [[processors]]:
** 200MHz [[ARM architecture|ARM9]] with 64MB of [[Flash memory|flash RAM]] for the primary LINUX [[operating system]] and user files
** Custom 16 bit processor for handling the biomorphic robot functions
* 16MB (2006 Model) or 32MB (2007 Model) of [[RAM]]
* 1 [[USB]] port
* [[Stereo]] audio plug
* [[SD card]] slot (accepts up to 1GB cards)
* [[VGA]] color [[camera]] in the forehead for [[Computer vision|image recognition]], and video recording
* 20kHz [[microphone]] in the chest for audio recording
* 1.9" 176x132 pixel color TFT supertwist [[LCD]] screen in its chest 
* 11W 3-[[Computer speaker|speaker]] system (2 x metal speakers + 1 back-mounted [[woofer]])
* Power-adapter port in foot
* 12 [[Electric motor|motors]] based on the configuration found in the Robosapien V2

=== Sensors ===

* 3 [[infrared]] (IR) [[detectors]] that use IR ranging for object detection
* VGA quality camera in its forehead for video and human-tracking abilities
* 3 sound [[sensors]] for [[sound]] localization and audio [[recording]]
* 2 [[touch]] sensors on the back of each hand
* 1 toe and 1 heel touch sensor in each foot

== Software ==

Unlike previous products in WowWee's Robo line of products, the RS Media is the first to feature bundled [[Personal computer|PC]] [[software]]. There are 4 applications: the BodyCon Editor, the Personality Editor, the Macro Editor, and the Media Organizer. 

'''BodyCon Editor:'''
The BodyCon Editor allows the user to customize and preview the RS Media movements. The user can create a sequence of movements as well as [[voice]] and sound effects and save everything in a [[Computer file|file]] for playback in the future. This file can also be included in a personality or to a user-created Macro.

'''Personality Editor:'''
The RS Media expands on the single personality that original Robosapien models came with, and comes with 4 different personalities ([[#Personalities|see below for more information]]). It also allows you to create your own personality from scratch.

'''Macro Editor:'''
The Macro Editor is actually a subcomponent of the Personality Editor, but it warrants its own description. The user can create their own [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] which are sequences of commands that the RS Media can execute. Macros can also include conditional routines that are based on environmental or user feedback. 

'''Media Organizer:'''
The Media Organizer gives the user a [[GUI]] interface to manage the audio, images, video, games, and personalities on the RS Media. Files can be uploaded, downloaded, deleted and moved around. The robot would need to be connected to the computer running the Media Organizer software using a USB cable.

== 3rd Party Software, Themes, and Utilities ==

There is some 3rd Party Software that people have developed to make using the RS Media easier.

'''RSM Remote:'''
It allows you to control most of RS Media's functions and even take a video, photo or audio recording, as well as tell him to track a certain color, all from a PC.

'''iMedia Screen Theme:'''
iMedia is an iPhone inspired theme for RS Media.
It replaces pictures for Control Mode, Arm Mode, Guard Mode and all Media Mode related pictures.

'''RS Media Time Sync:'''
A handy little app which will automatically synchronize your RSMedia's time with your PC's, without the hassle of setting it via the USB or Serial Console.

'''RS Media Tango! Screen Theme:'''
Unleash the Linux in your RSMedia with this Tango!/GNOME screen theme. Includes graphics for Control Mode, Arm Mode Guard Mode, All Program Modes, as well as Media Mode animations which fade in and out as you scroll through them.

== Personalities ==

A personality is a collection of the RS Media's audio responses. The RS Media ships with 4 personalities that the user can switch among using the [[remote control]]:

* RS Media (default)
* Service Bot 3000 - an English butler.
* Space Bot - a fictional space captain
* Billy-Joe Sapien - a cowboy

Users may also modify the existing personalities or create their own from scratch.

== Multimedia features ==

The RS Media is capable of recording and playing [[MP3]]'s, [[MPEG4]]'s, [[JPEG]]'s, as well as Java applications. It comes with 3 [[Java (programming language)|Java]] games that are controlled with the remote control and displayed to its LCD screen. It can also be used as an audio player via the [[stereo]] line-in port. The built-in memory can be supplemented by inserting an SD memory card (up to 1GB in size) into the SD slot.

== Programming ==

Like other WowWee robots, the RS Media can be programmed to execute sequences of moves and audio clips either as a standalone program or as a reaction to a sound, touch or visual [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]]. The RS Media has the same programming mode as the V2, Puppet Mode, where the user can manually bend and move the robot's body parts to create a program. The most sophisticated way to program the RS Media is by use of the computer applications.

== Hacking ==

As with other Robosapien models, the RS Media was designed with the possibility for modifications. In reference to the philosophy behind the 'hackability' of the robots, Tilden once said, "Years ago some bright [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] lads asked if I could build a competent [[humanoid]] cradle into which they could put their smart programs.  Took me a while, but here it is lads, inexpensive and ready to go right out of the box.  Make it think, and let me know how it goes."

In spring of 2009, Helibot from the RoboCommunity has created a new driver to allow access to the Robot's Linux operating system via the USB port and a terminal program. This is now a part of the RSMedia Development Kit which is now available on SourceForge.

== Availability ==

The RS Media was released in October 2006 in [[Australia]] and the [[UK]].
