'''OMDoc''' (Open Mathematical Documents) is a [[semantics|semantic]] markup format for [[mathematics|mathematical]] documents. While [[MathML]] only covers mathematical formulae and the related [[OpenMath]] standard only supports formulae and “content dictionaries” containing definitions of the symbols used in formulae, OMDoc covers the whole range of written mathematics.

== Coverage ==
OMDoc allows for mathematical expressions on three levels:

;Object level:formulae, written in Content [[MathML]] (the non-presentational subset of MathML), [[OpenMath]] or languages for [[mathematical logic]].
;Statement level:definitions, theorems, proofs, examples and the relations between them (e.g. “this proof proves that theorem”).
;Theory level:A theory is a set of contextually related statements. Theories may import each other, thereby forming a [[graph (data structure)|graph]]. Seen as collections of symbol definitions, OMDoc theories are compatible to OpenMath content dictionaries.

On each level, formal syntax and informal natural language can be used, depending on the application.

==Semantics and Presentation==
OMDoc is a semantic markup language that allows to write down the ''meaning'' of texts about mathematics. In contrast to [[LaTeX]], for example, it is not primarily presentation-oriented. An OMDoc document need not specify what its contents should look like. A conversion to LaTeX and [[XHTML]] (with Presentation [[MathML]] for the formulae) is possible, though. To this end, the presentation of each symbol can be defined.

== Applications ==
Today, OMDoc is used in the following settings:

;[[E-learning]]:creation of customized textbooks
;Data exchange:OMDoc import and export modules are available for many [[automated theorem proving|automated theorem provers]] and [[computer algebra system]]s. OMDoc is intended to be used for communication between mathematical [[web service]]s.
;Document preparation:Documents about mathematics can be prepared in OMDoc and later exported to a presentation-oriented format like LaTeX or XHTML+MathML.

== History ==
OMDoc has been developed by the German mathematician and computer scientist [[Michael Kohlhase]] since 1998. So far, there have been the following releases:

* 1.0 (November 2000)
* 1.1 (December 2001)
* 1.2 (July 2006)

== Future Developments ==
It is planned to create the infrastructure for a “[[semantic web]] for technology and science” based on OMDoc. To this end, OMDoc is being extended towards sciences other than mathematics. The first result is [[PhysML]], an OMDoc variant extended towards [[Physics]].

For a better integration with other Semantic Web applications, an [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] ontology of OMDoc is under development, as well as an export facility to [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]].
