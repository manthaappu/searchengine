<html> <head> <title>Slow-growing hierarchy</title></head><body>In [[computability theory]], [[computational complexity theory]] and [[proof theory]], the '''slow-growing hierarchy''' is an ordinal-indexed family of slowly increasing functions ''g''<sub>α</sub>: '''N''' → '''N''' (where '''N''' is the set of [[natural numbers]], {0, 1, ...}). It contrasts with the [[fast-growing hierarchy]].

== Definition ==
Let μ be a [[large countable ordinal]] such that a [[fundamental sequence (ordinals)|fundamental sequence]] is assigned to every [[limit ordinal]] less than μ.  The '''slow-growing hierarchy''' of functions ''g''<sub>α</sub>: '''N''' → '''N''', for α < μ, is then defined as follows: 

*<math> g_0(n) = 0,\, </math>
*<math> g_{\alpha+1}(n) = g_\alpha(n) + 1,\, </math>
*<math> g_\alpha(n) = g_{\alpha[n]}(n) \,\!</math> if α is a limit ordinal.

Here α[''n''] denotes the ''n''<sup>th</sup> element of the fundamental sequence assigned to the limit ordinal α.

[[Fast-growing hierarchy#Definition]] describes a standardized choice for fundamental sequence for all α < ε<sub>0</sub>.

== Relation to fast-growing hierarchy ==
The slow-growing hierarchy grows much more slowly than the fast-growing hierarchy. Even ''g''<sub>[[ε0|ε<sub>0</sub>]]</sub> is only equivalent to ''f''<sub>3</sub> and ''g''<sub>α</sub> only attains the growth of ''f''<sub>ε<sub>0</sub></sub> (the first function that [[Peano arithmetic]] cannot prove [[total function|total]] in the hierarchy) when α is the [[Bachmann–Howard ordinal]]. (Girard 1981) and (Cichon and Wainer 1983)

However, Girard (1981) proved that the slow-growing hierarchy eventually ''catches up'' with the fast-growing one. Specifically, that there exists an ordinal α and integers ''a'', ''b'' such that
:''g''<sub>α</sub>(''n'') < ''f''<sub>α</sub>(''n'') < ''g''<sub>α</sub>(''n'' + 1)
where ''f''<sub>α</sub> are the functions in the fast-growing hierarchy. He further showed that the first α this holds for is the ordinal of the theory ''ID''<sub><ω</sub> of arbitrary finite iterations of an inductive definition. (Wainer 1989). However for the Cichon assignment of fundamental sequences the first match up occurs at the level ε<sub>0</sub> (Weiermann 1997).

Extensions of the result proved in Wainer 1989 to considerably larger ordinals show that there are very few ordinals below the ordinal of transfinitely iterated <math>\Pi^1_1</math>-comprehension where the slow and fast growing hierarchy match up (Weiermann 1995).

For the novice it is worth mentioning that the slow growing hierarchy depends extremely sensitive on the choice of the underlying fundamental sequences (Weiermann 1997 and Weiermann 1999).

== Relation to term rewriting ==
Cichon provided an interesting connection between the slow growing hierarchy and derivation length for term rewriting (Cichon 1990).
