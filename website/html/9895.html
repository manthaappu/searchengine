<html> <head> <title>Delta lemma</title></head><body>The '''&Delta;-lemma''' is a [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] set-theoretic tool used in proofs to impose an [[upper bound]] on the size of a collection of pairwise incompatible elements in a [[forcing (set theory)|forcing]] [[poset]].  It may for example be used as one of the ingredients in a proof showing that it is consistent with [[ZFC]] that the [[continuum hypothesis]] does not hold.

==Formal definition==

A &Delta;-system ''W'' is a collection of sets whose pairwise intersection is constant.  That is, there exists a fixed ''S'' (possibly empty) such that for all ''A'', ''B'' &isin; ''W'' with ''A'' &ne; ''B'', ''A'' &cap; ''B'' = ''S''.  

The &Delta;-lemma states that every uncountable collection of finite sets contains an uncountable &Delta;-system.
