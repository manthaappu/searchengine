'''FaceKoo''' is a [[Chinese-language]] [[social networking]] [[website]]. According to [[Alexa ranking]], its page views surpassed [[MySpace China]] briefly in November 2008 and December 2008.

==Launch==
FaceKoo ({{zh|s=飞思酷|t=飛思酷|p=fēi'sī'kù}}) is a creation of FaceKoo, Inc., a [[privately held company]] based in [[Beijing]], [[China]]. It is a leading [[next generation]] social networking site (SNS) created specifically for the young age group of the Chinese-language market. 

FaceKoo was created by co-founders Calvin Pak, [[CEO]], David Yan, [[Chief technical officer]], and Sheryl Liu, [[CMO]] - all U.S.-educated [[Chinese American]]s with extensive business track records in the [[Silicon Valley]]. Its name derived from the words "face" and "cool," FaceKoo's flagship MagicMirror product offers a new way of meeting friends via a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[face-recognition]] system. FaceKoo also offers games and other applications for users to interact more easily and in a more fun way.

FaceKoo was launched in [[China]] in March 2008, and since then has expanded rapidly. As of June 2009, It has over 1 million registered users, and is one of China's fastest growing social network sites.

==Competition==
Despite very little [[advertising]] [[revenue]], and no sponsors, FaceKoo managed to outcompete its [[competitor]]s. FaceKoo's daily ranking is now ahead of [[360quan]] - a major rival that has received more than $20 million USD in funding. Also, FaceKoo's page views have exceeded [[Cyworld China]] (number one site in [[Korea]]), and [[iPart China]] (number one site in Taiwan). Both companies are spending heavily on marketing in China every month.
