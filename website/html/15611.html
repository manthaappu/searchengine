'''gpSP''' (game play SP) is a [[Game Boy Advance]] emulator, made by Exophase, for use with the Sony [[PlayStation Portable]] and [[GP2X]] video game systems.
There have been ports to [[iPod]] <ref>[http://www.dcemu.co.uk/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=112891 IgpSP v0.9-2Xb-K3 - GBA Emulator for iPod - DCEmu Forums:: The Homebrew & Gaming Network :: PSP Dreamcast Nintendo DS Wii GP2X Xbox 360 GBA Gamecube PS2 Apple iPhone Forums<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The PSP version runs most commercial games at full speed, however some still have problems from minor or severe glitches, while others are very slow. The GP2X version is similar to the PSP one, but typically slower. Unlike [[VisualBoyAdvance]], which [[High-level emulation|high-level emulates]] the GBA BIOS,<ref>[http://vba.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vba/VisualBoyAdvance/src/bios.cpp?view=log Source code of GBA BIOS reimplementation in VisualBoyAdvance]</ref> gpSP requires a GBA BIOS file in order to operate. Due to copyright reasons, this BIOS cannot be included with the emulator by Exophase, and users must dump it on their own using a [[Game Boy Advance flash cartridge]].

To date, gpSP has proven to be the most efficient, compatible and widely used of all GBA emulators for the PSP, GP2X and the iPhone.

Exophase has stopped working on the PSP version of GpSP, in favor of the GP2X and [[Pandora (console)|Pandora]] versions of gpSP.<ref name=autogenerated1>http://www.gp32x.com/board/index.php?s=&showtopic=42302&view=findpost&p=613075</ref> Future versions of gpSP will be closed source<ref name=autogenerated1 /> due to the constant third-party re-release of gpSP against Exophase's wishes.<ref>http://www.gp32x.com/board/index.php?s=&showtopic=42302&view=findpost&p=613143</ref>

These third-party releases add extra features and improved compatibility to exophase's original gpSP.
