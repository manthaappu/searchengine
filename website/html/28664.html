'''Paul H. Cress''' ([[1939]]-[[2004]]) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] computer scientist.  He was a young lecturer in computer science at the [[University of Waterloo]] ([[Waterloo, Ontario]],''' Canada''') when, starting in 1966, he and his colleague [[Paul Dirksen]] led a team of programmers developing a fast [[Fortran|FORTRAN]] [[compiler]] called [[WATFIV programming language|WATFOR]] (WATerloo FORtran), for the [[IBM System/360]] family of computers.  The /360 WATFOR project was initiated by Professor J. Wesley Graham, following the successful implementation in 1965 of a WATFOR compiler for the [[IBM 7040]] computer.  An enhanced version of the /360 WATFOR compiler was called [[WATFIV programming language|WATFIV]], variously interpreted to mean "WATerloo Fortran IV" or "WATFOR-plus-one". 

[[WATFIV programming language|WATFOR]] and [[WATFIV programming language|WATFIV]] made [[Fortran|FORTRAN]] programming accessible not only to university students and researchers but to high schoolers as well, and largely established Waterloo's early reputation as a centre for software and Computer Science research. In 1972, Cress and Dirksen were joint winners of the [[Grace Murray Hopper Award]] from the [[Association for Computing Machinery]], "For the creation of the WATFOR Compiler, the first member of a powerful new family of diagnostic and educational programming tools."   Paul Cress died August 20, 2004, aged 65.
