'''''IBM and the Holocaust''''' is a book by [[investigative journalist]] [[Edwin Black]] which details the business dealings of the American-based [[multinational corporation]] [[IBM|International Business Machines]] (IBM) and its German and other European subsidiaries with the government of [[Adolf Hitler]] during the 1930s and the years of [[World War II]]. In the book, Black outlines the way in which IBM's technology helped facilitate [[Nazi]] [[genocide]] against the [[Jews|Jewish people]] through generation and tabulation of [[punch card]]s based upon national [[census]] data.<ref name="Preston2001">{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/feb/18/historybooks.features |title=Six million and counting |last=Preston |first=Peter |date=February 18, 2001 |work=[[The Observer]]|publisher=[[guardian.co.uk]]  |accessdate=June 14, 2001}}</ref>


== Synopsis ==
=== Thesis ===

Author Edwin Black describes the thesis of his book ''IBM and the Holocaust: The Strategic Alliance between Nazi Germany and America's Most Powerful Corporation'' in the following way:

<blockquote>
"[The book] tells the story of IBM's conscious involvement — directly and through its subsidiaries — in the [[Holocaust]], as well as its involvement in the Nazi war machine that murdered millions of others throughout Europe. <br /><br />
"Mankind barely noticed when the concept of ''massively organized information'' quietly emerged to become a means of social control, a weapon of war, and a roadmap for group destruction.... Hitler and his hatred of the Jews was the ironic driving force behind this intellectual turning point. But his quest was greatly enhanced and energized by the ingenuity and craving for profit of a single American company and its legendary, autocratic chairman. That company was International Business machines, and its chairman was Thomas J. Watson."<ref>Edwin Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust: The Strategic Alliance between Nazi Germany and America's Most Powerful Corporation.'' Second paperback edition. Washington, DC: Dialog Press, 2009; pg. 7.</ref></blockquote>

=== Origins of IBM ===

Black begins his study with the origins of IBM. In the early 1880s, [[Herman Hollerith]] (1860-1929), a young employee at the [[United States Bureau of the Census|U.S. Census Bureau]], conceived of the idea of creating readable cards with standardized perforations, each representing specific individual traits such as gender, nationality, and occupation. The millions of cards created for each individual counted in the national census could then be sorted and resorted on the basis of specific bits of information they contained — thereby providing a quantified portrait of the nation.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 25.</ref> 

Hollerith built a [[prototype]] of his counting machine in 1884 and later won a contest for the best automated counting device conducted by the Census Bureau in conjunction with its 1890 census.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 26.</ref> The Census Bureau saved $5 million through use of Hollerith counting machines — about one-third of its annual budget — and Hollerith and his [[patent|patented]] invention gained international renown and customers around the world.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pp. 26-27.</ref>

By the turn of the 20th Century, Hollerith and his Tabulating Machine Company had achieved near-[[monopoly]] status. A rival arose in the next decade, however, and the U.S. Census Bureau abandoned its use of the more costly and slower Hollerith machines for its 1910 census. A disconsolate Hollerith licensed out his patents abroad. In 1910, the [[Germany|German]] licensee Willy Heidinger established the Deutsche Hollerith Maschinen Gesellschaft (German Hollerith Machine Corporation), commonly known by the [[acronym]] "[[Dehomag]]."<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 30.</ref> 

The next year, Hollerith sold his American business to [[industrialist]] [[Charles Ranlett Flint|Charles Flint]] (1850-1934) for $1.41 million.<ref name="Black31">Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 31.</ref> The counting machine operation was made part of a new [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] called the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR).<ref name="Black31" />

To head this massive new enterprise, Flint chose [[Thomas J. Watson]] (1874-1956), the star salesman of the [[NCR Corporation|National Cash Register Corporation]]. Watson was initially paid $25,000 per year — a substantial salary in the day — plus 1200 shares of stock and a commission of 5% of CTR's after-tax, after-dividends profits.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pp. 38-39.</ref>

The German [[hyperinflation]] of 1922-1923 made it impossible for Dehomag, the German licensee of CTR's technology, to make its scheduled [[royalties|royalty payments]] to America, with its balance in arrears topping the $100,000 mark.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 43.</ref> Threatened with bankruptcy and complete loss of his investment, Dehomag chief Willy Heidinger agreed to transfer 90% of the stock in his company to Watson's CTR as a means of settling his debt.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pp. 43-44.</ref> The German licensee Dehomag thus became a direct [[subsidiary]] of the American corporation CTR.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 44.</ref>

In 1924, following the death or departure of several key figures in the company, Watson assumed the role of [[Chief Executive Officer]] of CTR and renamed the now-focused company International Business Machines (IBM).

=== IBM business relations with the Nazi regime ===

The bulk of Black's book details the ongoing business relationship between Watson's IBM and the emerging German regime headed by [[Adolf Hitler]] and his [[Nazi party|National Socialist German Workers Party]] (NSDAP). Hitler came to power in January 1933; on March 20 of that same year he established a [[concentration camp]] for [[political prisoner]]s in the [[Bavaria]]n town of [[Dachau]], just outside the city of [[Munich, Germany|Munich]]. Repression against political opponents and the country's substantial ethnic Jewish population began at once. By April 1933, some 60,000 had been imprisoned.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pp. 44-45.</ref>

Despite the violent and repressive climate emerging in the new ultra-[[nationalism|nationalist]] Germany, business relations between IBM and the Hitler regime continued uninterrupted in the face of broad international calls for an economic boycott.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 45.</ref> Indeed, Willy Heidinger, who remained in control of Dehomag, the 90%-owned German subsidiary of IBM, was an enthusiastic supporter of the Hitler regime.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 50.</ref>

On April 12, 1933, the German government announced the plans to immediately conduct a long-delayed national census.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 54.</ref> The project was particularly important to the Nazis as a mechanism for the identification of Jews, [[Romani people|Gypsies]], and other [[ethnic group]]s deemed undesirable by the regime. Dehomag offered to actively assist the German government in its task of ethnic identification, concentrating first upon the 41 million residents of [[Prussia]].<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 55.</ref> 

This activity was not only countenanced by Thomas Watson and IBM in America, Black argues, but was actively encouraged and financially supported, with Watson himself traveling to Germany in October 1933 and the company ramping up its investment in its German subsidiary from 400,000 to 7,000,000 [[Reichsmark|reichsmarks]] — about $1 million.<ref name="Black60">Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 60.</ref> This injection of American capital allowed Dehomag to purchase land in [[Berlin]] and to construct IBM's first factory in Germany, Black charges, thereby "tooling up for what it correctly saw as a massive financial relationship with the Hitler regime."<ref name="Black60" /> 

Black also asserts that a "secret deal" was made between Heidinger and Watson during the latter's visit to Germany which allowed Dehomag commercial powers outside of Germany, enabling the "now Nazified" company to "circumvent and supplant" various national subsidiaries and licensees by "soliciting and delivering punch card solution technology directly to IBM customers in those territories."<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 61.</ref> As a result, Nazi Germany soon became the second most important customer of IBM after the lucrative US market, Black notes.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 111.</ref>

=== Holocaust implications ===

The 1933 census, with design help and tabulation services provided by IBM through its German subsidiary, proved to be pivotal to the Nazis in their efforts to identify, isolate, and ultimately destroy the country's Jewish minority. Black describes the situation faced by German Jews:

<blockquote>
"Since the advent of the [[Third Reich]], thousands of Jews nervously assumed they could hide from the [[Aryan clause]].<br /><br />
"But Jews could not hide from millions of punch cards thudding through Hollerith machines, comparing names across generations, address changes across regions, families trees and personal data across unending registries. It did not matter that the required forms or questionnaires were filled in by leaking pens or barely sharpened pencils, only that they were later tabulated and sorted by IBM's precision technology."<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 107.</ref></blockquote>

On September 13, 1935, Hitler demanded the immediate implementation of a "Law for the Protection of German Blood" which deprived Jews of German citizenship and  prohibited from having sexual relations with or from marrying Aryans.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 108.</ref> Machine-tabulated census data greatly expanded the estimated number of Jews in Germany by identifying individuals with only one or a few Jewish ancestors. Previous estimates of 400,000 to 600,000 were abandoned for a new estimate of 2 million Jews in the nation of 65 million.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 110.</ref>

Another German census was conducted on May 17, 1939, when 750,000 census takers conducted interviews with the country's 22 million households, 5.5 million factories, and 3.5 million factories.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 169</ref> The purpose of the census was to identify the number of Jews in Germany and its newly expanded territories and to precisely locate each individual so that the Jewish population could be effectively [[ghetto|ghettoized]].<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pp. 169-170.</ref> Ancestral lines had to be documented by each head of household as part of the national census, which dwarfed in size and detail the 1933 Prussian census.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 170.</ref>

As the Nazi war machine spread occupied the nations of Europe, capitulation was followed by a census of the population of the subjugated nations, with an eye to the identification and isolation of Jews and Gypsies. For example, the September 1, 1939 [[invasion of Poland]] was followed by an October 14 order of the [[Einsatzgruppen|Special Operations unit of the German Secret Police]] for a full census of the Jewish population, information which supplemented published information from the 1931 general Polish census.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 186.</ref> These census operations were intimately intertwined with technology and cards supplied by IBM's German and new Polish subsidiaries, which were awarded specific sales territories in Poland by decision of the New York office following Germany's successful [[Blitzkrieg]] invasion.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 193.</ref>

In the case of Poland, the ordered census took place over several days, from December 17 to December 23, 1939.<ref name="Black197">Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 197.</ref> The census was both meticulous and cold-blooded, as Black notes:

<blockquote>
"Each person over the age of twelve was required to fill out census and registration in duplicate, and then was fingerprinted. Part of the form was stamped and returned as the person's new identification form. Without it, they would be shot. With it, they would be deported."<ref name="Black197" /></blockquote>

Data generated by means of counting and alphabetization equipment supplied by IBM through its German and other national subsidiaries was instrumental in the efforts of the German government to concentrate and ultimately destroy ethnic Jewish populations across Europe, Black demonstrates. He also notes, in an understated aside, that fully half of IBM's German subsidiary's annual profit — RM 1.8 million — was suddenly generated in December 1939.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 198.</ref>

=== IBM technology in the camps ===

Black also reports that every Nazi [[concentration camp]] maintained its own ''Hollerith Abteilung'' (Hollerith Department), assigned with keeping tabs on inmates through use of IBM's punchcard technology.<ref>Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 351.</ref> In his book, Black charges that "without IBM's machinery, continuing upkeep and service, as well as the supply of punch cards, whether located on-site or off-site, Hitler's camps could have never managed the numbers they did.<ref name="Black352">Black, ''IBM and the Holocaust,'' Second paperback edition, pg. 352.</ref>

Each of the major concentration camps was assigned a Hollerith code number for paperwork purposes: [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] — 001; [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]] — 002; [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] — 003; [[Flossenbürg concentration camp|Flossenbürg]] — 004; [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp|Gross-Rosen]] — 005; [[Herzogenbusch concentration camp|Herzogenbusch]] — 006; [[Mauthausen concentration camp|Mauthausen]] — 007; [[Natzweiler concentration camp|Natzweiler]] — 008; [[Neuengamme concentration camp|Neuengamme]] — 009; [[Ravensbrück concentration camp|Ravensbrück]] — 010; [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]] — 011; and [[Stutthof concentration camp|Stutthoff]] — 012.<ref name="Black352" />

Upon arrival at the camps in 1943, incoming prisoners would be examined for fitness to work, physical information would be recorded on a medical record, names would be cross-checked with data from the Political Section to determine whether the prisoner was additionally wanted for political offenses.

== Company response ==

While not directly contradicting Black's evidence, IBM has questioned Black's research methodology and conclusions.<ref name="Bazyler2005">Michael J. Bazyler, ''Holocaust Justice: The Battle for Restitution in America's Courts.'' New York: New York University Press, 2005; pg. 303.</ref> IBM indicates it does not have much information about this period or the operations of Dehomag, as most documents were destroyed or lost during the war. IBM also claimed that a lawsuit, which was dismissed, was filed to coincide with the book launch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/1388.wss|title=IBM Statement on Nazi-era Book and Lawsuit|location=Armonk, New York|author=IBM Press Room|work=Press Release|date=February 14, 2001}}</ref> 

In 2002, IBM disputed Edwin Black's claim that IBM is withholding materials regarding this era in its archives.<ref name="pr addendum">{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/828.wss|title=Addendum to IBM Statement on Nazi-era Book and Lawsuit|author=IBM Press Room|work=Press Release|location=Armonk, New York|date=March 29, 2002}}</ref> Nevertheless, IBM subsequently turned over a substantial portion of it corporate records of the period to academic archives in New York and [[Stuttgart, Germany|Stuttgart]], for review by independent scholars.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/03/27/print/main504730.shtml|title=IBM And Nazi Germany: Researcher Has New Documents On World War II Conduct|last=Grace|first=Francie|date=March 27, 2002|publisher=CBS News}}</ref>

== Critical response ==

[[Richard Bernstein]], writing for ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', wrote that Black's case "is long and heavily documented, and yet he does not demonstrate that IBM bears some unique or decisive responsibility for the evil that was done."<ref name="Bernstein2001">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/07/arts/07BERN.html?pagewanted=all|title='IBM and the Holocaust': Assessing the Culpability|last=Bernstein|first=Richard|date=March 7, 2001|work=Arts section|publisher=The New York Times}}</ref> IBM quoted this claim in a March 2002 press release "Addendum to IBM Statement on Nazi-era Book and Lawsuit".<ref name="pr addendum"/>

Others have seen Black's work as a revelatory piece of historical scholarship. In 2003, the [[American Society of Journalists and Authors]] acknowledged ''IBM and the Holocaust'' with its award for Best Non-Fiction Book of the Year.<ref>[http://www.asja.org/awards/awarhist.php ASJA Award Recipients], American Society of Journalists and Authors.

== Legal actions ==

In February 2001, an [[Alien Tort Claims Act]] claim was filed in U.S. federal court against IBM for allegedly providing the punched card technology that facilitated the Holocaust, and for covering up Dehomag's activities. In April 2001, the lawsuit was dropped. Lawyers said they feared proceeding with the suit would slow down payments from a special German Holocaust fund created to compensate forced laborers and others who had suffered due to the Nazi persecution. IBM's German division paid $3 million into the fund, although the corporation made clear that it was not admitting liability with its contribution.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/07/08/ramasastry.holocaust.ibm/index.html|title=A Swiss court allows Gypsies' Holocaust lawsuit to proceed, Case questions role of corporate giant IBM in World War II|work=Law Center, Find Law|last=Ramasastry|first=Anita|date=July 8, 2004}}</ref>

In 2004, the human rights organization [[GIRCA|Gypsy International Recognition and Compensation Action]] (GIRCA) filed suit against IBM in [[Switzerland]].
