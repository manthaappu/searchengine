'''Webconverger''' is a [[Debian]]-based [[Live CD|live]] [[operating system]] designed to be used solely for accessing [[Web applications]]. It can be run from various media like [[CD]] & [[USB flash drive]]. Webconverger is an [[open source]] project and has its own public [[Git (software)|git]] repository but it also contains the proprietary Adobe Flash player. Webconverger is pre-compiled to run on any [[x86]] hardware so far. It does not have high system requirements and will also run on older machines.

Webconverger is a minimalistic browser-only system. It runs the [[Iceweasel]] web browser with a customised window manager [[dwm]] and [[Firefox]] add-on that locks the browser to a simple kiosk operation mode. The browser runs in full screen mode with all menus, toolbars, key commands and most right button menus disabled. Webconverger contains [[Adobe Flash]] support and [[PDF]] viewing by default. Both wired and wireless networks are supported via [[DHCP]]. There is also support for [[internationalization and localization|internationalization]], including [[CJK]] input methods.
