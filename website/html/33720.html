'''Selective File Dumper''' (SFDumper) is a [[Free software|free]] [[open source]] [[computer forensics]] tool, written by Nanni Bassetti and Denis Frati, for [[Linux]] systems.

It is a [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]] script which can retrieve all the files of a chosen type (e.g. .doc or .jpg), regardless if they are active, deleted or unallocated. It automatically runs [[Foremost]] for carving, and [[Sleuthkit]] for deleted files retrieval. It then eliminates duplicated files by comparing the [[SHA256]] [[hash]]es of the carved files and the active and deleted files. Thanks to carving, files simply renamed to a different extension will be identified. Also, it is possible to expand the Foremost configuration file inside the script to add new extensions. Finally, it is possible to do a [[Index term|keyword]] search on the extracted files. The script can work on an image file or directly from a device.

It is [[free software]] licensed under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) and [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] (LGPL).
