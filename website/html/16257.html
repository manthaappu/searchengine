The '''Haptik Library''' is a component-based [[open source software|open source]] library which provides a Hardware Abstraction Layer for access to haptic devices.
Different hardware from different manufactures can be easily accessed in a uniform way, allowing to remove from applications all dependencies on particular configurations of [[Application programming interface|API]]s, hardware and drivers.

'''Haptik''' is not tied to any particular graphics, physics or collision-detection [[Software development kit|SDK]]s, and has been designed to be user-friendly, even with complex existing applications or within third-party software frameworks. It can be effortless integrated with both procedure or class based code, allows for either polled or callback-based access, and supports both right-handed (OpenGL) and left-handed (DirectX) coordinate systems.
Haptik consists of runtime-loaded plugins and therefore can be easily extended and customized. Moreover differently from many existing libraries its component-based architecture guarantees both backward and forward binary compatibility of compiled client applications with old and future versions of hardware devices, drivers, plugins and the library itself. This is obtained while still keeping the maximum performance achievable using devices native SDKs directly.

Haptik is not only for [[C++]] users and can be used from many languages and environments such as [[MATLAB]] and [[Simulink]] as well as Java applets and applications.
