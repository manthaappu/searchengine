'''Model-driven software development''' (MDSD) is an alternative to [[Round-trip engineering]]. Round-trip engineering is the concept of being able to make any kind of change to a [[model]] as well as to the [[code]] generated from that model. The changes always propagate [[bidirectional]] and both artifacts are always consistent. The transition from code to model(the reverse Engineering) is especially interesting in this context.<ref name="lulu">Model-Driven Software Development,(Technology, Engineering, Management) Thomas Stahl, Markus Volter</ref>

In the context of these approaches the model typically prossesses the same [[abstraction level]] as the code(that is, 'one rectangle per class'). It is actually the [[visualization]] of a program's structure. In such a scenario, it is both feasible and useful to track changes to the code in the model automatically.

MDSD takes a different approach: the model is definitely more abstract than the code generated from it. Thus it is generally impossible to keep the model consistent automatically after a [[manual change]] of the [[generated code]]. For this reason, manual changes to generated code should be avoided.A precise definition that states which parts are generated and which are implemented manually is therefore necessary.<ref name="lulu"/>

1. Abstraction <br>
The [[abstraction]] level of decisions is raised to model level. This only makes sense if a corresponding abstraction on the model level can be identified.<br>
2. Tagging the model<br>
This involves moving code-level decisions into the model without raising the abstraction level. This procedure is called 'tagging'the model with [[implementation]] decisions.<br>
3. Separation of code classses <br>
This involves the adaptation of the [[target architecture]] in such a way that manually-created code must be written into classes specifically created for this purpose.<br>
4. Tagging the code <br>
This consists of the introduction of [[protected region]]s to the code, and is accomplished through the use of special tags that protect the code placed between them from [[overwriting]] during regeneration.

This list reflects the various solution's elegance in strictly descending order. Tagging the model still allows a clear separation of responsibilities and enables a fully-automated regeneration without further manual treatment.
