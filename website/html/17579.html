== History ==

INCA Internet first came into the market on January 2000, and acquired a global [[patent]] through 'nProtect Netizen' which was the first program to provide a real-time client PC information security service. INCA Internet has developed into a strong corporation with an independent technology and is leading the Korean and Japanese security market in the financial and [[electronic commerce]] industry. 

When INCA Internet was first founded, the internet usage's fast spread, ill-intended cyber attack pattern diversification, the user's niche for various complicated [[malware]] started to show the limit of single one-time purchase security solutions and HW based information security products. Since then, INCA Internet has quickly adjusted to the [[information security]] market trend and provided an end-user based user friendly [[Pc security|PC security]] solution that is optimized for today's internet environment.

Since December 2005, INCA Internet has been located within the [[Guro-gu|Guro Digital Complex]], which is the largest [[Information technology|IT]] industrial complex of [[South Korea|Korea]] and played a pivotal role in the economic growth of Korea, referred to as the "[[Miracle on the Han]]" contributing 10% of national exports in the 1970s. It is a futuristic industrial hub, centering on research and development, advanced information, technology, and knowledge industries. The relocation has had a great synergy effect on INCA Internet and many IT corporations located here have benefited through information sharing and partnerships.<ref name="INCA_GDC">{{cite web|url=http://www.segye.com/Articles/NEWS/ECONOMY/Article.asp?aid=20080718000529&subctg1=&subctg2=|date=2008-07-18|publisher=[http://www.segye.com/Articles/Main.asp Segye.com]|title=Great Synergy Effect in Guro Digital Complex}}</ref>

== Markets ==

All INCA Internet nProtect products apply a [[SaaS]] (software as a service) model. It was the first company of the security industry to provide [[internet banking]] security online and has since spread the [[SaaS]] model into [[Pc security|PC security]] and web security.

The company currently holds more than 70% of the [[market share]] of [[information security]] for Korean [[financial institutions]] and more than 90% of [[Cheating in online games|game portal security]]. Internationally, INCA Internet mainly provides security solutions for [[China]], [[Japan]], [[South-east Asia]], and [[Europe]]. Companies such as [[JCB]] Card,<ref name="INCA_JCB">{{cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=101&oid=001&aid=0000894972|date=2005-01-26|publisher=[[Yonhap News]]|title=INCA provides security for JCB Cards}}</ref> [[UFJ]],<ref name="INCA_UFJ">{{cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=105&oid=008&aid=0000524976|date=2005-04-07|publisher=[http://stock.moneytoday.co.kr/ Money Today]|title=INCA Internet "ruling" Japanese Financial Institution Security Market}}</ref> Tokyo Star Bank<ref name="INCA_UFJ" /> are among some of the corporations using INCA Internet's protection.

== Criticism ==
Their programs are widely used in the Korean [[internet]] environment; and depend on [[ActiveX]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. Internet banks in the Korea need these programs by law, so users using [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], or other browsers or operating systems besides [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] can not access these online banks.<ref>Simply go to Internet banking page of the Post office of Korea, http://www.epostbank.go.kr/?dp_id=D_001 Using MSIE, you can see many Security Alerts. Using other browsers, you will be unable to proceed. That page means 'If you see alert message, '''must allow all'''(Message for only MSIE).</ref>

Most of the functions run at kernel level of an [[OS]], so versions of Windows that use [[UAC]] or User Account Control ([[Windows Vista]], [[Windows 7]]) are unable to run smoothly. Some input devices especially [[USB]] [[Keyboard (computing)|Keyboard]] are unable to function in conjunction with nProtect.

nProtect Netizen, nProtect Personal and nProtect Keycrypt are programs used mostly for internet banking in Korea. They are programmed to terminate processes that are not associated with banking, but processes are terminated indiscriminately if they are deemed a threat and thus may compromise a system's stability. These programs also inject themselves into all existing processes from startup, and sometimes collide with other anti-viruses. More problematically, Korean banks do not update their program every time INCA releases an update.
