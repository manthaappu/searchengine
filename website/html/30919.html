Quora's service allows users to ask questions and give answers. Additionally, users can comment on the questions and answers and "upvote" or "downvote" the answers. An "Answer Summary" can be created to reflect the consensus of the community.  This summary is a wiki that can be edited by any registered user.
Recently a blogging feature called Quora Posts has been added.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quora.com/What-features-has-Quora-recently-launched|title=What features has Quora recently launched?|editor-last=Lewenstein|editor-first=Joel|editor=Joel Lewenstein|date=November 28, 2010|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}</ref>
