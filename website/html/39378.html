<html> <head> <title>Vibronic transition</title></head><body>A '''vibronic transition''' denotes the simultaneous change of vibrational and electronic [[quantum number]] in a [[molecule]]. According to the separability of electronic and nuclear motion in the [[Born-Oppenheimer approximation]], the [[vibrational transition]] and electronic transition may be described separately. The [[selection rule]] for electronic transitions is given by [[Koopmans' theorem]], while that for vibrational transitions is described by the [[Franck-Condon principle]]. 

Most processes leading to the absorption and emission of [[visible light]], and therefore the colorful world around us, are due to vibronic transitions. This may be contrasted to pure electronic transitions which occur in [[atom]]s and lead to sharp monochromatic lines (e.g. in a [[sodium vapor lamp]]) or pure vibrational transitions which only absorb or emit [[infrared light]].
