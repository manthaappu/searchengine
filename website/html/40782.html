{{Power Architecture}}
'''Xenon''' is a [[Central processing unit|CPU]] that is used in the [[Xbox 360]] game console. The processor, internally codenamed "Waternoose" by IBM<ref>[http://www.designnews.com/article/12317-Learning_from_Failure.php "Learning from failure - The inside story on how IBM out-foxed Intel with the Xbox 360"], Dean Takahashi, ''Electronic Business'', May 1, 2006</ref> and '''XCPU''' by Microsoft, is based on [[IBM|IBM's]] [[Power Architecture|PowerPC]] [[instruction set architecture]], consisting of three independent [[Multi-core (computing)|processor cores]] on a single die. These cores are slightly modified versions of the [[Cell_(microprocessor)#Power_Processor_Element_.28PPE.29|PPE]] in the [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell processor]] used on the [[PlayStation 3]].<ref>"[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3904/processing_the_truth_an_interview_.php Processing The Truth: An Interview With David Shippy]", Leigh Alexander, ''Gamasutra'', January 16, 2009</ref><ref>"[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123069467545545011.html Playing the Fool]", Jonathan V. Last, ''Wall Street Journal'', December 30, 2008</ref> Each core has two symmetric hardware threads ([[Simultaneous multithreading|SMT]]), for a total of six hardware threads available to games. Each individual core also includes 32 [[KiB]] of [[CPU cache|L1 instruction cache]] and 32 KiB of L1 data cache.

The processors are labelled "XCPU" on the [[Chip carrier|packaging]] and are manufactured by [[Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing|Chartered]] (now part of [[GlobalFoundries]]). Chartered reduced the fabrication process in 2007 to [[65 nanometer|65 nm]], thus reducing manufacturing costs for Microsoft.

The name "Xenon" was repurposed from the code name for the Xbox 360 in early development.

== XCGPU ==
The [[Xbox_360_s#Xbox_360_S|Xbox 360 S]] introduced the '''XCGPU''', which integrated the Xenon CPU and the [[Xenos (graphics chip)|Xenos GPU]] onto the same die, and the eDRAM into the same package. The XCGPU is the first mass marketed chip that combines a desktop class CPU, a powerful GPU, memory controllers and IO. It also contains a "front side bus replacement block" that connects the CPU and GPU internally in exactly the same manner as the [[Front-side bus|front side bus]] would have done when the CPU and GPU were separate chips, so that the XCGPU doesn't change the hardware characteristics of the Xbox 360. 

XCGPU contains 372 million transistors and is manufactured by [[GlobalFoundries]] on a 45 nm process. Compared to the original [[chipset]] in the Xbox 360 the combined power requirements are reduced by 60% and the physical chip area by 50%.<ref name="ArsXCGPU">{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/08/microsoft-beats-intel-amd-to-market-with-cpugpu-combo-chip.ars|title=Microsoft beats Intel, AMD to market with CPU/GPU combo chip|date=2010-08-24|accessdate=2010-08-24|author=Jon Stokes, Ars Technica}}</ref><ref name="360S-teardown">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcper.com/article.php?aid=940|title=The New Xbox 360 S "Slim" Teardown: Opened and Tested|accessdate=2010-06-24|author=PC Perspective|date=2010-06-21}}</ref>
