A '''language construct''' is a [[syntax|syntactically]] allowable part of a [[Computer program|program]] that may be formed from one or more [[lexical token]]s in accordance with the rules of a [[programming language]].

The term Language Constructs is often used as a synonym for control structure, and should not be confused with a function.

==Examples of language constructs==
In [[PHP]], for example, <code>print</code> is a language construct. According to [http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.print.php]
<source lang="php">
<?php
print 'Hello world';
?>
</source>

is the same as:

<source lang="php">
<?php
print('Hello world');
?>
</source>
