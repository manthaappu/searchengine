<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Button handles.png|thumb|right|The 8 white boxes are adjustment handles.]] -->'''Adjustment handles''' are the small boxes appearing on the corners and edges of a "selected control" that let you change the size and shape of the control. 

By [[dragging and dropping]] the control handle on an edge, you can make the control wider or narrower, taller or shorter. Corner handles let you move two edges at once.
