<html> <head> <title>Joachim Hagenauer</title></head><body>'''Joachim Hagenauer''' (born 1941) is an [[information theorist]] and professor [[emeritus]] at [[Technical University of Munich]]. He pioneered the use of ''soft bits'' (see [[Soft output Viterbi algorithm]]), a [[coding theory]] technique that contributes to the high performance of the [[turbo code]]s.

Professor Hagenauer's work enabled the advancement of turbo coding and led to a significant improvement in channel coding for [[digital signal|digital communications]] and storage. His works have been applied to [[digital radio|digital receiver]] designs, [[communications satellite|satellite transmissions]] and other facets of telecommunications.

Hagenauer received his [[doctorate]] in 1974 from [[Darmstadt University of Technology]] where he also served as an assistant professor. In 1990 he was appointed a director of the Institute for Communication Technology at the [[German Aerospace Center]] DLR in [[Oberpfaffenhofen]]. In 1993 he became the Chair of the University of Technology's Communications Technology department in [[Munich, Germany]].

He has been awarded the Erich Regener and Otto Lilienthal Prizes from the German Aerospace Association, and the [[Armstrong_award#Edwin_Howard_Armstrong_awards|Armstrong Award]] from the [[IEEE Communications Society]], and was also elected to the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities|Bavarian Academy of Science]]. In 2003 he received the [[IEEE Alexander Graham Bell Medal]] for meritorious achievements in telecommunications.
