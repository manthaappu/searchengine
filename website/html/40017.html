<html> <head> <title>Well-posed problem</title></head><body>The [[mathematics|mathematical]] term '''well-posed problem''' stems from a definition given by [[Jacques Hadamard]]. He believed that mathematical models of physical phenomena should have the properties that
# A solution exists
# The solution is unique
# The solution depends continuously on the data, in some reasonable [[topology]].

Examples of [[archetypal]] well-posed problems include the [[Laplace's_equation#Boundary_conditions|Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation]], and the [[heat equation]] with specified initial conditions. These might be regarded as 'natural' problems in that there are physical processes that solve these problems. By contrast the inverse heat equation, deducing a previous distribution of temperature from final data is not well-posed in that the solution is highly sensitive to changes in the final data. Problems that are not well-posed in the sense of Hadamard are termed '''ill-posed'''.  [[Inverse problem]]s are often ill-posed.

Such continuum problems must often be discretized in order to obtain a numerical solution. While in terms of [[functional analysis]] such problems are typically continuous, they may suffer from numerical instability when solved with finite precision, or with errors in the data. Even if a problem is well-posed, it may still be ill-conditioned, meaning that a small error in the initial data can result in much larger errors in the answers.  An ill-conditioned problem is indicated by a large [[condition number]].

If the problem is well-posed, then it stands a good chance of solution on
a computer using a [[numerical stability|stable algorithm]].  If it is not well-posed, it needs to be re-formulated for numerical treatment. Typically this involves including additional assumptions, such as smoothness of solution. This process is known as ''[[Regularization (mathematics)|regularization]]'' and [[Tikhonov regularization]] is one of the most commonly used for regularization of linear ill-posed problems.
