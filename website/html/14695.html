In [[control theory]], '''gain scheduling''' is an approach to control of [[non-linear system]]s that uses a family of [[linear]] [[controller]]s, each of which provides satisfactory control for a different operating point of the system.  

One or more observable variables, called the scheduling variables, are used to determine what operating region the system is currently in and to enable the appropriate linear controller.  For example in an aircraft [[flight control system]], the [[altitude]] and [[Mach number]] might be the scheduling variables, with different linear controller parameters available (and automatically plugged into the controller) for various combinations of these two variables. 

It is one of the simplest and most intuitive forms of [[adaptive control]].
