'''KisMAC''' is a [[wireless network]] discovery tool for [[Mac OS X]].  It has a wide range of features, similar to those of [[Kismet (software)|Kismet]] (its [[Linux]]/[[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] namesake).  The program is geared toward network security professionals, and is not as novice-friendly as similar applications.

KisMAC will scan for networks passively on supported cards - including Apple's [[Apple AirPort|AirPort]], and [[AirPort Extreme]], and many third-party cards, and actively on any card supported by Mac OS X itself.

Cracking of [[Wired Equivalent Privacy|WEP]] and [[Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]] keys, both by [[brute force attack|brute force]], and exploiting flaws such as weak scheduling and badly generated keys is supported when a card capable of monitor mode is used, and packet reinjection can be done with a supported card ([[Prism2]] and some [[Ralink]] cards).  [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] mapping can be performed when an [[NMEA]] compatible GPS receiver is attached.<ref>{{citeweb|title=gpsd â€” a GPS service daemon|url=http://gpsd.berlios.de GPSd|publisher=berlios.de|accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref>

Data can also be saved in pcap format and loaded into programs such as [[Wireshark]].

==KisMAC and Germany==
The project was created and led by [[Michael Rossberg]] until July 27, 2007, when he removed himself from the project due to changes in German law (specifically, [[Strafgesetzbuch|StGB]] Section 202c) that "prohibits the production and distribution of security software".<ref>{{citeweb|title=Germany says goodbye KisMAC!|url=http://www.kismac.de|publisher=kismac.de|accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref>  On this date, project lead was passed on to [[Geoffrey Kruse]], maintainer of KisMAC since 2003, and
active developer since 2001.  KisMAC is actively being developed.  Primary development, and the relocated KisMAC web site are now based in the [[United States]].  The KisMAC project can be found at http://kismac-ng.org/ .

As of August 6, 2007, the former homepage now denounces the new German law.
