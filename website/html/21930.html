The following is a list of [[HTML editor]]s '''with articles on Wikipedia'''.

==Text editors==
{{main|List of text editors}}

===Basic text editors===
Plain [[text editor]]s may be used to produce webpages.<!--Unlike word processors, the software does not insert text formatting elements that may interfere with the parsing of programming languages.-->
The following are some commonly used text editors:

==Word processors==
While [[word processor]]s are not ostensibly HTML editors, many of the major products are capable of exporting document layouts in HTML format.  This offers the ease of use of a word processor, similar to a WYSIWYG product (see below), but has some of the same end product limitations.
 
*[[AbiWord]]
*[[Apple Pages]] (part of the [[iWork]] suite)
*[[AppleWorks]]
*[[Microsoft Word]]
*[[OpenOffice.org Writer]]
*[[WordPerfect]]

== Spreadsheet ==
* [[Microsoft Excel]] can also export a document (.xls) into .html with the correct formatting.
* [[OpenOffice Calc]]

== WYSIWYG editors ==
{{see|Comparison of HTML editors}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Dreamweaver Screenshot.png|thumb|right|250px|Adobe Dreamweaver CS3]] -->
[[WYSIWYG]] (What You See Is What You Get) code generators offer speed and ease of use.

Many of these editors do not require any knowledge of the programming languages generated by the software.

Some of these editors store pages in a proprietary format and then export them as HTML (possibly along with other formats); the user would continue to maintain the website by working with the files in the proprietary format and re-exporting them.  Other, generally simpler WYSIWYG editors are designed to work directly with HTML files.

Exported files tend to be larger than hand-coded pages (those produced with a text-based HTML editor or a plain text editor).

WYSIWYG generators tend to be better than word processors at producing highly graphical and interactive pages.

Although the term WYSIWYG is often used for these editors, they are generally not truly WYSIWYG (see [[HTML editor#Difficulties in achieving WYSIWYG|Difficulties in achieving WYSIWYG]]).

* [[WorldWideWeb]]
{{Multicol-end}}

== WYSIWYM editors ==
[[WYSIWYM]] (what you see is what you mean) is an alternative paradigm to WYSIWYG, in which the focus is on the semantic structure of the document rather than on the presentation.  These editors produce more logically structured markup than is typical of WYSIWYG editors, while retaining the advantage in ease of use over hand-coding using a text editor.
* [[WYMeditor]]

==Discontinued editors==
Editors that have been discontinued, but may be in common use
* [[Adobe GoLive]] – ''Now discontinued. Replaced by [[Adobe Dreamweaver]].''
* [[AOLpress]] – ''Now discontinued.''
* [[Adobe PageMill]] – ''Now discontinued. Replaced by [[Adobe Dreamweaver]].''
* [[Microsoft FrontPage]] – ''Now discontinued. Replaced by [[Microsoft Expression Web]] and [[Microsoft SharePoint Designer]]''
* [[Netscape Composer]] - [[Mozilla Composer]] – ''Not updated or supported.  Replaced by [[Nvu]] then [[KompoZer]], or [[SeaMonkey|SeaMonkey Composer]]''
* [[Nvu]] - Developer [[Daniel Glazman]] is working on replacement called [[BlueGriffon]], not directly derived from Nvu but still based on Mozilla technology.  The [[KompoZer]] project maintains Nvu codebase and fixes bugs until a successor to Nvu is released.
* [[HotDog]] – essentially discontinued with no updates since 2003.
* [[HoTMetaL]] – ''Replaced by [[XMeTaL]], a commercial [[XML]] editor.''
* [[Claris Home Page]] - replaced by iWeb (part of iLife for Mac.)
