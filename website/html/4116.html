'''Blobotics''' is a term describing research into chemical based computer processors based on [[ions]] rather than [[electrons]].  [[Andrew Adamatzky]], a computer scientist at the [[University of the West of England]] in [[Bristol]] used the term in an article in [[New Scientist]] March 28, 2005 [http://www.newscientist.com/channel/fundamentals/mg18524921.000-introducing-the-glooper-computer.html].  

The aim is to create 'liquid logic gates' which would be 'infinitely reconfigurable and self-healing'.  The process relies on the [[Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction]], a repeating cycle of three separate sets of reactions.  Such a processor could form the basis of a [[robot]] which, using artificial sensors, interact with its surroundings in a way which mimics living creatures. 

The coining of the term was featured by [[ABC radio]] in [[Australia]] [http://www.abc.net.au/newsradio/txt/s1363466.htm].
