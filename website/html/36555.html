A systems analyst may:
* Plan a system flow from the ground up.
* Interact with customers to learn and document requirements that are then used to produce business requirements documents.
* Write technical requirements from the business requirements document; this is a critical phase. 
* Interact with designers to understand software limitations.
* Help programmers during system development, ex: provide [[use cases]], [[flowcharts]] or even [[Database design]].
* Perform system testing.
* Deploy the completed system.
* Document requirements or contribute to user manuals.
* Whenever a development process is conducted, the system analyst is responsible for designing components and providing that information to the developer.
