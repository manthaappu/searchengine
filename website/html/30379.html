<html> <head> <title>Protocol implementation conformance statement</title></head><body>A '''Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement''' or most commonly ''PICS'' is a structured document which asserts which specific requirements are met by a given implementation of a [[communications protocol|protocol]] [[Technical standard|standard]].  It is often completed as a record of formal protocol [[conformance testing|conformance test]] results, and some [[automated test]] systems machine-author a PICS as output.  A potential buyer or user of the implementation can consult the PICS to determine if it meets his or her requirements.

[[ETSI]] publish [http://portal.etsi.org/mbs/Referenced%20Documents/ts_101_823_02.pdf an example proforma PICS] showing which information would be completed.
