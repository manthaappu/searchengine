<html> <head> <title>Unix directory structure</title></head><body>In [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s, the '''Unix directory structure''' is a convention for [[filesystem]] layout.

Several attempts exist to standardize the Unix filesystem layout, such as the "[[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard]],"<ref name="Filesystem Hierarchy Standard">{{cite web |url=http://www.pathname.com/fhs/ |title=Filesystem Hierarchy Standard |accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref> however, targeted primarily at [[Linux]]. Also, as part of the "[[Linux Standards Base]]", a common filesystem layout is defined, to encourage interoperability among different Linux distributions.<ref name="Linux Standards Base">{{cite web |url=http://www.linux-foundation.org/en/LSB |title=Linux Standards Base |accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref>

What follows is a generalized overview of common locations of files in a Unix operating system:

* '''<tt>/</tt>''' — the slash <tt>/</tt> character alone denotes the root of the virtual filesystem tree.

:* '''<tt>/bin</tt>''' — stands for "[[computer program|binaries]]" and contains certain fundamental utilities, such as <tt>ls</tt> or <tt>cp</tt>, needed by all users.

:* '''<tt>/sbin</tt>''' — stands for "[[computer program|system (or "superuser") binaries]]" and contains fundamental utilities, such as <tt>init</tt>, usually needed to start, maintain and recover the system.

:* '''<tt>/etc</tt>''' — contains configuration files and system databases.

:* '''<tt>/dev</tt>''' — stands for "devices". Contains file representations of peripheral devices.

::*'''<tt>[[dev-null|/dev/null]]</tt>''' — also known as the "bit bucket" or "black hole", this [[pseudo device]] discards all contents written to it, and is typically used to pipe away unwanted data.

::* '''<tt>[[/dev/random]]</tt>''' — this pseudo device returns [[pseudorandom numbers]] (subject to the limitations of [[random number generator]]s in [[computing]]) when read from. It uses system noise to generate random numbers and blocks if not enough entropy in the noise is available. Random is commonly used by programs such as [[SSH]] that absolutely need cryptographically-strong random data to generate an [[encryption]] key.

::* '''<tt>/dev/urandom</tt>''' — similar to <tt>/dev/random</tt>, except it always returns (less cryptographically-strong) pseudorandom numbers, even if there is not enough entropy in the system noise available.

:* '''<tt>/home</tt>''' — contains the home directories for the users.

:* '''<tt>/mnt</tt>''' — contains filesystem mount points.

:* '''<tt>/lib</tt>''' — contains system libraries.

:* '''<tt>/root</tt>''' — the home directory for the [[superuser]] root.

:* '''<tt>/tmp</tt>''' — a place for temporary files. Many Unices clear this directory upon start up.

:* '''<tt>/usr</tt>''' — originally the directory holding user home directories, its use has changed, and it now holds executables, libraries, and shared resources that are not system critical, like the [[X Window System]], [[KDE]], [[Perl]], etc. (The name "Unix System Resources" is a ''post hoc'' [[backronym]]{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}.) However, on some [[Unix]] systems, some user accounts may still  have a home directory that is a direct subdirectory of /usr, such as the default ast in [[Minix]].

::* '''<tt>/usr/bin</tt>''' — this directory stores all binary programs distributed with the operating system not residing in <tt>/bin</tt>, <tt>/sbin</tt> or (rarely) <tt>/etc</tt>.

::* '''<tt>/usr/include</tt>''' — <tt>/usr/include</tt> stores the development headers used throughout the system.

::* '''<tt>/usr/lib</tt>''' — the required libraries for executables within <tt>/usr</tt> or elsewhere for that matter, live here.

::* '''<tt>/usr/local</tt>''' — resembles <tt>/usr</tt>, except that its subdirectories are used for additions not part of the operating system distribution, such as custom programs or files from a [[BSD]] [[Ports collection]]. Usually has subdirectories such as <tt>/usr/local/lib</tt> or <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>.

:* '''<tt>/var</tt>''' — a short for "variable." A place for files that may change often.

::* '''<tt>/var/log</tt>''' — contains system log files.

::* '''<tt>/var/mail</tt>''' — the place where all the incoming mails are stored. The user can access his/her own mail only, unless he/she has admin rights.

::* '''<tt>/var/spool</tt>''' — [[spooling|spool]] directory; contains print jobs, mail spools and other queued tasks.

::* '''<tt>/var/tmp</tt>''' — A place for temporary files preserved between system reboots.
