<html> <head> <title>IPOPT</title></head><body>'''IPOPT''', short for "'''I'''nterior '''P'''oint '''OPT'''imizer, pronounced I-P-Opt", is a [[software]] [[Library (computing)|library]] for large scale [[nonlinear optimization]] of continuous systems. It is written in [[Fortran]] and [[C (programming language)|C]] and is released under the [[Common Public License|CPL]]. IPOPT implements a [[primal-dual method|primal-dual]] [[interior point method]], and uses line searches based on [[Filter methods (optimization)|Filter methods]] (Fletcher and Leyffer). IPOPT can be called from various modeling environments and [[C (programming language)|C]]. 

IPOPT is part of the [[COIN-OR]] project.

IPOPT is designed to exploit 1st and 2nd derivative ([[Hessian matrix|Hessians]]) information if provided (usually via [[automatic differentiation]] routines in modeling environments such as [[AMPL]]). If no Hessians are provided, IPOPT will approximate them using a [[quasi-Newton method]]s, specifically a [[BFGS method|BFGS update]].

It was originally developed by [http://www.research.ibm.com/people/a/andreasw/ Andreas Wächter], a former [[Ph.D.]] student in department of [[chemical engineering]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], under the supervision of [http://numero.cheme.cmu.edu/ Lorenz T. Biegler]. 

Arvind Raghunathan later created an extension to IPOPT for [[Mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints]] (MPEC) [http://epubs.siam.org/sam-bin/getfile/SIOPT/articles/42908.pdf]. This version of IPOPT is generally known as IPOPT-C (with the 'C' standing for 'complementarity'). While in theory any [[Mixed integer programming|mixed-integer program]] can be recast as an MPEC, it may or may not be solvable with IPOPT-C. Solution of MINLPs (Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programs) using IPOPT is still being explored [http://egon.cheme.cmu.edu/IBM/page.htm] [https://projects.coin-or.org/Bonmin].

[http://www.che.tamu.edu/people/faculty/info?fid=73 Carl Laird] and Andreas Wächter are the developers of IPOPT 3.0, which is a re-implementation of IPOPT in [[C++]].
