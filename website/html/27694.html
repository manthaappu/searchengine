:''This article refers to the character from the original ''[[Transformers]]'' universe. For other uses see [[Optimus Prime (disambiguation)]].''

'''Optimus Prime''' is a [[fictional character]] from the ''[[Transformers]]'' franchise.  Prime is the leader of the [[Autobot]]s, a faction of heroic Transformers from the fictional planet [[Cybertron]] who wage their battles to destroy the evil forces of the [[Decepticon]]s. He is depicted as a heroic, brave, wise and compassionate character who puts all his talent to use to improve the universe around him. Optimus has a strong sense of justice and righteousness, and has dedicated himself to the protection of all life, particularly the inhabitants of Earth; he will battle his foes with unyielding resolve.<ref>{{cite news|title= Transformers: Prime on Prime |work= IGN|date=|url= http://uk.stars.ign.com/articles/827/827682p1.html|accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref> 

The original Optimus Prime transforms into a [[cab over]] truck. The truck's cab transforms into the robot mode of Prime himself, with vast strength and armed with an ion blaster. Contained within his chest is the mystic talisman known as the [[Matrix of Leadership|Autobot Matrix of Leadership]] (or Creation Matrix, depending on the continuity), carried by all Autobot leaders and passed down through the ages.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Transformers: The Ultimate Guide | last=Furman | first=Simon | year=2004 | publisher=DK Publishing Inc.| ISBN=1405304618 | pages= 18–19}}</ref>

The truck's trailer disconnects and transforms into the '''Combat Deck''', a mobile battle-station/command headquarters with an "Auto-Launcher" robot armed with assorted artillery and beam weapons. It can also serve as a radio antenna for battlefield communications between the Autobots. The Combat Deck can launch Prime's third component, '''Roller''', a mobile scout buggy that can easily slip behind enemy lines. Optimus' senses are tied into Roller's, and can perceive what Roller does.<ref>{{cite news|title= Transformers: The Many Looks of Optimus Prime |work= IGN|date=|url= http://uk.stars.ign.com/articles/996/996813p1.html|accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref> Injury to one component is felt by each of the others, and while Prime could survive the destruction of either, despite the slight degree of autonomy they possess, the Combat Deck and Roller would not be able to survive without him.

Additional powers included in the animated series and comics are short-range optic blasts, holographic map projections and deployable [[hydro-foil]]s designed by [[Wheeljack]] which allowed Prime and the other Autobots to traverse bodies of water with ease. One of Prime's abilities was the ability to retract his right hand unit and replace it with a glowing axe.

Across the assorted continuities of the original ''Transformers'' universe, there have been various interpretations of Optimus Prime. One of Prime's most notable characteristics in any form was his adamant commitment to leadership by example, and avoidance of any hypocrisy in his command, but beyond this, the animated series leaned towards Optimus Prime as a straightforward, wise and essentially upbeat battlefield [[general]]. The [[Marvel Comics]] series, on the other hand, in addition to these more obvious characteristics, suggested a Prime secretly plagued by self-doubt and, more importantly, a conflicted sense of [[pacifism]] that often made him an extremely reluctant [[warrior]]. It was occasionally implied that the conflict with the Decepticons lasted as long as it did primarily because of his unwillingness to take a more aggressive stance.

The animated series revealed other minor details about Optimus Prime's personality and personal life — for example, his dislike of [[rap music]] ("Blaster Blues" and "Quest for Survival"), which set him at odds with music-loving characters like [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]] and [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]]. Prime also enjoys televised sports, most notably [[basketball]] which he even plays ("The Master Builder"), as well as setting up a basketball court outside the [[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]]. Though Prime's personality is like that of a human man age 40-50, he is not above watching afternoon [[soap opera]]s (in the episode "Prime Target", he is heard groaning out loud when the soap opera he is watching with the other Autobots gets interrupted for a [[news]] report).

== Marvel Comics ==
''Note: Stories from the U.K. Marvel Transformers series are in italics.''

In [[Marvel Comics]]' comic series, before the Great War broke out on Cybertron, the robot who would be Optimus Prime (before he received the [[Matrix of Leadership]] from [[Sentinel Prime]]) was a Transformer of note, displaying his skills in the Infraformers Sharpshooting Competition. Subsequently, when the war began, Prime quickly made a name for himself as a combat leader of the Autobots.

On a mission with the [[Triggerbots]] to stop Megatron from claiming the [[Underbase]], Prime was forced to jettison the massive databank into space to prevent anyone from acquiring its power, and with this action, he proved his wisdom and skill to the Autobot Council of Elders. This led to even more rapid advancement, eventually leading him to field command over the Autobot armies.

Four million years ago, Cybertron — shaken from its orbit and drifting through space — came under threat when it floated into the path of an asteroid swarm. Prime led a group of elite Autobot warriors on the Autobot starship, the Ark, on a mission to destroy the asteroids, and although successful, in the aftermath of this mission the Ark was attacked by Decepticons, hoping to overcome their weakened foes. Intent on keeping the secrets of the Ark from the Decepticons, Prime set the craft on a suicide course, crashing it into the prehistoric planet Earth.

In 1984 A.D., a [[volcanic eruption]] re-activated the Ark, which in turn brought the Transformers back on-line. Prime led the Autobots in their opening battles to prevent the Decepticons from plundering Earth's resources, but following their initial victory, the Transformers were all deactivated by [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]]. Prime was decapitated by Shockwave, and had the energy of the Creation Matrix leeched from his mind to give life to Shockwave's creations, the [[Constructicons]] (although Shockwave was unaware that the Matrix was not merely a program in Prime's mind, but a physical object in his chest). Before Shockwave could give life to his next Decepticon, [[Jetfire]], Prime transferred the Matrix energy into the mind of [[Witwicky family#Buster Witwicky|Buster Witwicky]], who used the energy to turn Jetfire on Shockwave, allowing Prime to reclaim his body and retake leadership of the Autobots, giving Jetfire true life as a reward.

Around this time, he would even meet [[Ronald Reagan in fiction|Ronald Reagan]] in a story in the 1985 U.K. annual.

Meanwhile, however, the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] offices of Marvel Comics were producing their own storylines. Here, writer [[Simon Furman]] offered a different take on Prime, one that was weary of the war he had been forced to fight. In the "Prey" storyline beginning in U.K. #96 Prime arranged for a [[Wheeljack]] built copy of himself to be destroyed to see how the Autobots could cope without him. Unfortunately the plan was derailed by Megatron and the [[Predacons]], who attacked him. During the battle Prime, Megatron and [[Ultra Magnus]] were transported to Earth — with Prime accidentally interrupting his own funeral service. This theme of war-weariness would again come to the fore in the U.K. strips detailing Prime's U.S. death.

After a period of effective leadership which saw the activation of several new Transformers including the [[Aerialbots]], who Prime infused with life using the Matrix, Prime engaged Megatron in a [[video game]] duel for possession of a super fuel. Prime was victorious, but Megatron implemented a cheat code that killed Prime later. Autobot surgeon [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]]'s subsequent efforts to restore him were unsuccessful, and his body was launched into space, the Autobots unaware of the presence of the physical Matrix object within the corpse. The funeral barge eventually crashed on a giant moon; as it lay there for an untold time, the Matrix reached out to nearby living organisms, studying and recreating them. One such recreated being became known as [[Deathbringer]].

Prime's personality had been copied onto a [[floppy disk]] by the technician running the game, [[Ethan Zachary]], who employed him in various video game scenarios he developed. Prime's damaged mind led him to believe that he himself was a video game character, and in an attempt to bring him back to life, [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Goldbug]], [[Joyride (Transformers)|Joyride]], [[Slapdash (Transformers)|Slapdash]] and [[Getaway (Transformers)|Getaway]] took the disk to the planet [[Nebulos]]. They built a new body for Optimus Prime, and even upgraded it with the ability to combine with the trailer to form a larger robot. In an effort to keep Transformers off their planet, however, the Nebulans had poisoned their fuel, and the sensation of dying convinced Prime that he was truly alive, and not a game character. To save his life, the Nebulan scientist Hi-Q [[binary-bonding|bonded]] with him, creating '''[[Powermasters|Powermaster]] Optimus Prime'''. A UK story set around this time in UK #198 would see Prime as the star of his own [[Christmas]] special, as he returned to Earth and tried to rekindle his feeling for the planet. After a battle between his own forces and an advance force from Cybertron ruined a small town's Christmas festivities he realized bringing the Transformers to Earth was far worse than anything his troops could have done and vowed to protect its inhabitants from Decepticon aggression.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Transformers: The Ultimate Guide | last=Furman | first=Simon | year=2004 | publisher=DK Publishing Inc.| ISBN=1405304618 | pages= 58–59}}</ref>

Optimus Prime's first actions as leader were to ally the Autobots with [[Scorponok]]'s Decepticons in defeating [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]] when the latter gained the power of the [[Underbase]].

''In the U.K. ''Transformers'' stories, Prime and his Autobots later battled a murderous mechanoid named Deathbringer, which Prime recognized as a creation of the Matrix.''

Later, the Transformers were all transported to Cybertron by [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]] to battle Unicron, Prime managed to successfully reacquire and purify the Matrix after [[Unicron]] killed [[Thunderwing]] and his taint upon it. Prime then sacrificed his life one more time to destroy Unicron by plunging the Matrix into his maw. However, the Powermaster process had been working to fully bond Prime and Hi-Q, and with Prime now destroyed, the process completed itself in Hi-Q's body, and the two minds and souls became one. Hi-Q's biomechanical body was stripped down and reconstructed by the [[Last Autobot]], resurrecting Optimus Prime once more with the two minds now one. Prime joined with the other Transformers on the planet Klo and routed [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]]'s Decepticons.

''Prime would appear in the U.K. Marvel comic issue #234, "Prime's Rib!" This story is set in the near future, 1995, where Optimus Prime, [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]] and [[Rodimus|Hot Rod]] introduce the latest Autobot, [[Arcee]], to the human [[feminists]]. She was met with displeasure by the humans, being called a token female and disliked for her pink color. They were then attacked by [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]], [[Fangry]], [[Horri-Bull]] and [[Squeezeplay (Transformers)|Squeezeplay]], who thought the Autobot would be unveiling a new weapon. The Autobots fought off the Decepticons, who escaped, but nothing seemed to please the human feminists.''

An undisclosed period of time later, at the beginning of the ''[[Transformers: Generation 2]]'' comic book sequel series, Prime was restored to a form resembling his original body, and he and the Transformers found themselves caught in the schemes of a "second generation" of Cybertronians led by the icy [[Jhiaxus]], who were colonizing and cyber-forming other worlds. Plagued by nightmarish visions of a life-destroying entity called "the [[Swarm (Transformers)|Swarm]]", Prime looked into Cybertron's past and discovered that Jhiaxus and his kind were the result of further unintentional Transformer reproduction, their nature and intent distilled to the purest, most unemotional form of conquest, and that the Swarm was the by-product of this process. Entering into an alliance with the recreated Megatron's Decepticons to combat the Swarm and Jhiaxus, Prime was consumed by the abomination and destroyed, but at the last moment, unleashed the energies of the Matrix into the Swarm, purifying it. In parting, the Swarm recreated Prime in a new form, (based on his "Hero" toy), and he and Megatron set out to lead the united Autobots and Decepticons into a new age.

==Animated series==
[[Image:Orionpax.jpg|right|thumb|Orion Pax]]
As seen in the episode "War Dawn", Optimus Prime began his life as a robot named Orion Pax, a mostly defenseless dock worker during the Golden Age of Cybertron nine million years ago, with a girlfriend named [[Elita One|Ariel]], and a best friend named Dion. At the time, a new breed of robot had recently appeared on the planet with new flight capabilities in robot mode that made Orion idolize them. Unfortunately for Orion, when [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]], the leader of the new group of robots, approached him with inquiries about using one of the dock warehouses, Orion was swayed by Megatron, and he and Ariel were severely wounded when [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] and his forces then attacked in order to claim the energy stored there. Searching for someone to help them, the time-displaced [[Aerialbots]] took Orion and Ariel to the ancient Autobot, [[Alpha Trion]], who used them as the first subjects for the new reconstruction process he had developed — rebuilding the frail Autobot frames into battle-hardy configurations. With this reconstruction, Orion Pax became Optimus Prime, the first of the Autobot warriors.

Optimus took the mantle of leadership as the civil war against the Decepticons erupted, and would remain in that position for the next four million years. Ariel was rebuilt into [[Elita One]], the commander of the Autobot resistance on Cybertron. The fate of Dion is left unrevealed. It has been speculated by fans that Dion might have become Ironhide or Ultra Magnus just as Orion and Ariel became Optimus and Elita, but this remains fan speculation only, and there is no evidence to support the idea, Ironhide's close friendship with Optimus notwithstanding.

As leader of the Autobots, Prime headed up their mission to search out new worlds with new sources of energy to revitalize the depleted Cybertron. Optimus vowed to Elita that he would return from his mission for her, but just before the launch of the Ark, Optimus was mistakenly led to believe Elita was killed. Shortly after its launch, the Autobots' craft was attacked by the Decepticons' space cruiser, the [[Nemesis (Transformers)|''Nemesis'']], and boarded by Megatron and the Decepticons. In the ensuing struggle, the G-forces of a nearby planet pulled both craft down, and the Autobots' ship crashed into a volcano, thrusting all the occupants into emergency stasis. Four million years later, in the Earth year 1984 A.D., a volcanic eruption jarred the ship's computer, [[Teletraan I]] back to life, and it reactivated the Decepticons, programming them with new Earth-based disguise modes. As a parting gesture, [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]] fired upon the Autobot ship, creating a landslide. The vibrations from that landslide knocked Prime into the path of the computer's restoration beam, restoring him to life, and beginning the war anew on Earth.

Prime was perpetually at the forefront of the action throughout the early years of the war on Earth, usually confronting Megatron, and, in some rare instances, being forced to team up with him for the greater good (or the lesser evil) - such as against the [[Insecticon]]-controlled Decepticons or the [[Combaticons]]. He has suffered his fair share of battlefield scrapes, almost meeting his end when his vital cosmotron component was critically damaged by the [[Seekers (Transformers)|Decepticon jets]] and [[Laserbeak]], having his body be disassembled and turned into Decepticon trophies (such as turning much of his body into a pet "alligaticon" and one of his arms into a defense laser).

Prime suffered a severe — though unfair — defeat when Megatron challenged him to one-on-one combat while imbued with the different abilities of all the Decepticons. The loser would leave Earth. However, Teletraan I discovered the deception in time and the Autobots were able to drive the Decepticons off. In "Prime Problem", Megatron created a clone of him, which cause confusion with the other Autobots which lead to tests. However, [[Windcharger]] and Spike were able to identify the clone before it led the Autobots into their demise.

In "Prime Target", the big game hunter [[Lord Cholmondeley]] set his sights on the ultimate trophy, the head of Optimus Prime. In order to lure Optimus in, Cholmondeley captured the Autobots [[Tracks (Transformers)|Tracks]], [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]], [[Beachcomber (Transformers)|Beachcomber]], [[Grapple (Transformers)|Grapple]], [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]] and [[Inferno (Transformers)|Inferno]]. [[Windcharger]] and [[Huffer (Transformers)|Huffer]] were able to avoid being trapped. When [[Cosmos (Transformers)|Cosmos]] learned of the location Cholmondeley was keeping the captured Transformers, Optimus Prime accepted Cholmondeley's challenge to meet him alone. Although interrupted by the Decepticons [[Astrotrain]] and [[Blitzwing]]'s attempt to ally the Decepticons with Cholmondeley, Optimus defeated the big game hunter and freed the Autobots. Cholmondeley and the stolen jet were handed over to the Soviets by the Autobots as punishment for his actions.

Throughout the first two seasons, Optimus Prime has led the Autobots to many victories, like stopping Megatron from controlling the crystal of power ("Fire on the Mountain"), stopping the [[Dinobots]]' rebellion by saving [[Grimlock]] ("War of the Dinobots"), defeated [[Devastator (Transformers)|Devastator]] with his detach arm ("City of Steel"), helped capture [[Nightbird (Transformers)|Nightbird]] ("Enter the Nightbird"), rescued [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]] and [[Cosmos (Transformers)|Cosmos]] from the Decepticons on the [[Moon]] with the help of [[Omega Supreme]] ("Blaster Blues"), and help saved [[Perceptor]] and the other Transformers from the cosmic rust disease ("Cosmic Rust").

Over the course of the next twenty years, the Decepticons succeeded in seizing control of all of Cybertron, forcing the Autobots to operate from their new city on Earth, and from two bases on Cybertron's moons. In the Earth year 2005 A.D., Prime was stationed on Moonbase One, and dispatched troops to Earth to acquire energy for an upcoming strike on Cybertron. The Decepticons, however, got wind of the plan and used the shuttle run to attack Autobot City; a distress call summoned Prime and support troops to Earth, and in the fearsome ensuing fight with Megatron, Optimus Prime sustained fatal injuries, but not before turning the tide of battle and forcing the Decepticons to flee. Despite the efforts of Perceptor, Optimus Prime went offline. The Matrix, and with it leadership of the Autobots, fell into the hands of [[Ultra Magnus]], [[Galvatron]], and subsequently to [[Rodimus|Rodimus Prime]]. His last words were "''Until that day... 'till all are one.''"

Prime's body was entombed in a massive deep-space mausoleum with the many other fallen Autobots, but his corpse was desecrated by the [[Quintessons]] in 2006, when they reanimated it as part of an attempt to destroy the Autobots by using Prime to lure their space fleet into a trap. However, the Matrix was able to purify Prime of the Quintesson influence, and he ordered the other Autobots to clear out while he piloted his flagship into the Quintessons' detonator, triggering the explosion of a nearby sun. Prime was believed to have been destroyed in the explosion. According to "[[The Return of Optimus Prime]]", Prime's body was recovered from the craft by two human scientists, Jessica Morgan and Gregory Swofford, just minutes before the explosion. However, as their ship departed, it was coated with solar spores released by the explosion of the sun. Jessica's father, Mark Morgan, loathed the Transformers (both Autobot and Decepticon), and his hatred only grew when an attempt by the Decepticons to steal a heat-resistant alloy he had developed resulted in Jessica being paralyzed. Swofford and Morgan reconstructed Optimus Prime's body in an attempt to use it as a delivery system for the spores, which induced [[enmity]] and madness in every sentient being they came into contact with, in order to destroy the Transformers.

However, when they could not reanimate him, they used his body as a lure instead, bringing the Autobots to their lab, where they were infected. As this "[[Hate Plague]]" proceeded to spread across the galaxy, [[Sky Lynx]] retrieved a Quintesson, who fully restored Optimus Prime to life. Coating himself in Morgan's heat-resistant alloy, Prime reclaimed the Matrix from Rodimus and unleashed its concentrated wisdom to destroy the Hate Plague.

In 2007, Prime began to suffer from visions following the release of the Matrix's energy, which foretold a great transformation for Cybertron. Events began with the Decepticons' theft of the key to the [[Plasma Energy Chamber]], which forced Prime to consult Alpha Trion within [[Vector Sigma]], and Prime learned that the mega-computer had orchestrated events in order to restore Cybertron's Golden Age. When the Plasma Energy Chamber was opened and threatened to drive Earth's Sun supernova, [[Spike Witwicky]] and the [[Nebulon|Nebulans]] who had become involved in the conflict as a result of these events were able to drain off the excess solar energy and revitalize Cybertron. With the Decepticons driven off Cybertron, and Nebulon free from tyranny, Cybertron enters into a Golden Age of peace and prosperity under the leadership of Optimus Prime and the Autobots.

The seldom-seen "5th season" re-airing of the show featured the G1 episodes retold by a stop-motion Powermaster Optimus Prime to the live-action youngster Tommy Kennedy. No real back story was ever established for Prime becoming a Powermaster, but the new sequences were said to take place after the four previous seasons, indicating that in the original Sunbow continuity at least, Prime became a Powermaster at some point.

Although the animated series ended in the U.S. after ''The Rebirth'', Optimus Prime continued to appear in animated sequences in the Transformers toy commercials, progressing from Powermaster to Action Master, and even appearing as a computer-generated Combat Hero Optimus Prime. Many episodes of the series are re-aired again to promote ''Transformers: Generation 2''. During these sequences, computer-generated scenes featuring key (recolored) G1 characters are borrowed from Generation 2 commercials to serve as an opening, closing, and commercial bumpers. Optimus Prime is shown in the opening and closing fighting Generation 2's [[Ramjet (Transformers)|Ramjet]].

While the ''Transformers'' animated series came to an end in America with ''The Rebirth'' in 1987, across the [[Pacific]], in Japan, it was decided to continue production of the show with three new, exclusive animated series (spin-offs) to continue the story. The first of these series, ''[[Transformers: The Headmasters]]'', supplanted the events of ''The Rebirth'', picking up one year after the events that saw Optimus Prime's return to life. In the beginning of the series it generally shows Optimus Prime alive again.

In the interim year, with the Decepticons not having been heard from, the Autobots had entered into an even closer relationship with Earth, and had begun the colonization of other worlds, the first of which was the planet Athenia, where Optimus Prime was stationed. It soon became apparent, however, that when Prime had released the energy of the Matrix to cure the Hate Plague, the consequences were more far-reaching than he had anticipated — without the energy of the Matrix to act as a balancing factor, Vector Sigma had become destabilized, and the Decepticons suddenly returned to exploit this, assaulting Cybertron in order to seize control of the mega-computer. Prime took a squad of troops to aid in the battle on the planet, and when the arrival of the Autobot [[Headmaster (Transformers)|Headmasters]] tipped the battle in their favor, Prime broke off from the main attack and headed down into the depths of the planet, planning on stabilizing Vector Sigma at any cost.

Guided through the dangers of the planet's catacombs by the spirit of Alpha Trion while the other Autobots searched for the Matrix on Earth, Prime eventually arrived at the computer, only to find his way barred by [[Cyclonus]] and [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]]. Hot Rod then arrived with the Matrix, with which Alpha Trion merged, re-energizing it and transforming Hot Rod back into Rodimus Prime; for the first time, the two Primes fought side-by-side and defeated Galvatron.

Before Rodimus could implement the Matrix to stabilize Vector Sigma, however, Optimus Prime sacrificed himself to perform the task, merging with the computer and restoring its balance to save the planet — dying again only a few short episodes after his rebirth.

Later Prime would make a final and permanent return in the Japanese Transformers continuity, Battlestars: Return of Convoy. This entry was only available in print form appearing in the Japanese publication, TV Magazine.

=== Beast Wars ===
Although the later storyline of Beast Wars would go on to depict Optimus Primal as a different character than Optimus Prime, the commercials and comic which shipped with the original Beast Wars toy versions of Optimus Primal and Megatron depicted them as new incarnations of Optimus Prime and Megatron. Primal as a bat, Megatron as a crocodile.

[[Optimus Primal]], leader of the Maximal faction in the ''[[Beast Wars]]'' animated series and toy line, is not Optimus Prime — Primal is one of the Maximal descendants of the Autobots, who took the name to honor the Autobot leader. The same applies to the Megatron of this era. However, before the animated series began, Hasbro did actually envision Prime and Megatron as their beast counterparts — design elements such as Prime's mouth-plate (slitted to add an actual mouth for the animated series) suggest it, and the first mini-comic that came packaged with the toys makes it clear. However, once the animated series began, this had already been changed. Nonetheless, Optimus Prime and Megatron were a major reason the Beast Wars began.

The ''Beast Wars'' were waged on prehistoric Earth, eventually leading to the discovery of the buried ''[[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]]''. [[Megatron (Beast Wars and Beast Machines)|Megatron]], following the original Megatron's instructions in a desperate gambit, decided to attempt to change history by killing Optimus Prime, who was still lying in ''The Ark'' in stasis lock. Megatron hoped that this would result in the Decepticons winning ''The Great War'' and eventually the rule of Cybertron by the Predacons, the descendants of the Decepticons. Megatron unleashed a full-power weapon blast at Optimus Prime's face, near-fatally injuring him. However, Optimus Primal proceeded to take Prime's spark into his body to protect it from surgical trauma while his injuries were repaired. The subsequent power increase caused by Prime's spark's connection to the Matrix augmented Primal into the large, transmetal "[[Optimus Primal|Optimal Optimus]]" form with three alternate modes (jet, land vehicle, and transmetal gorilla). Then, with the repairs complete, Prime's spark was restored, and he briefly activated before sinking back into normal stasis.

When animating the scene in which Primal removes Prime's spark, Mainframe's animators consulted ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'' for reference on the interior of Prime's chest. However, not realizing the importance of the Matrix of Leadership, they rendered it as a container for Prime's spark. ''Beast Wars'' writers [[Larry DiTillio]] and [[Bob Forward]] have since claimed that in their view, Prime had not received the Matrix from Alpha Trion at this point, but a later comic produced for [[Botcon]] indicated that the Matrix was in fact stored in a secondary compartment, hidden behind Prime's spark. In this comic, the alien [[Vok]] used the Matrix, the [[Transmetal Driver]] and a control suit once piloted by the Predacon [[Quickstrike]] to create [[Primal Prime]].

=== Beast Machines ===
A giant statue of Optimus Prime holding two [[Golden Disk]]s standing in front of the Cybertron Archives appeared on [[Cybertron]] in the ''[[Beast Machines]]'' series. The statue was destroyed by the [[Vehicon]]s in the episode ''Fires of the Past''. When show writer [[Bob Skir]] was asked what these two disks were he said that neither the statue nor disks were in the script, but he suggested that they were either the disks from [[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2]] probes or that Optimus won them in the 2,395,989th Annual Cybertronian spelling bee.

Later in the series Optimus Primal discovered the ancient city of [[Iacon]] deep within Cybertron where he was approached by a hologram statue of Optimus Prime, but it ended up being Megatron in disguise, who used the opportunity to steal Optimus Primal's access to the [[Vector Sigma#Beast Machines|Oracle]]. [[Obsidian (Transformers)|Obsidian]] also comments on how [[Optimus Primal]] is not as great a leader as Prime.

Based on the ''Classics'' toy line, the Timelines 2007 story is set 15 years after the end of the Marvel Comics story (ignoring all events of the Marvel U.K. and ''Generation 2'' comics). [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] survived the crash of the [[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]] on Earth, reformatted himself into a new form and now leads [[Ramjet (Transformers)|Ramjet]], [[Skywarp]], [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]], [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]] and the [[Constructicons]]. Optimus Prime has also returned to Earth commanding [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], [[Cliffjumper]], [[Grimlock]], [[Jetfire]], [[Mirage (Transformers)|Mirage]] and [[Rodimus]] (formerly Hot Rod).

In ''Crossing Over'' when the Cybertronians [[Skyfall (Transformers)|Skyfall]] and [[Landquake]] arrive on Earth unexpectedly Megatron attempts to destroy them, but Optimus Prime and his Autobots are able to drive Megatron away.

== Convention comics ==
During Simon Furman's "Alignment", a text story available through the British Transformers convention called "Transforce", it is mentioned Prime fell during what was intended to be the final conflict with the Decepticons at Pinea Omicron, long after the events of the ''Generation 2'' comic book. He managed to defeat Galvatron II but in doing so was damaged such that Grimlock had to engage a stasis field around him to save his flickering Spark, making Prime a "living war monument".

Though Prime's ultimate fate is unknown, in a story entitled "The Last Days of Optimus Prime", also from Transforce, Prime laments the new Transformers age without war and it seems he passes on to a Transformers [[afterlife]] referred to as "J'nwan". However the story is vague and may be a metaphor for Prime rejoining the Matrix as his time had come. In this realm, he was approached by the [[Predacon (Transformers)|Predacon]] [[Sandstorm (Transformers)|Sandstorm]], who tried to plead for the help of Prime and the other legendary Transformers in dealing with a [[Unicron]]/Predacon hybrid named Shokaract. Prime refused, but later led a group of Transformers (including Megatron, [[Grimlock]] and [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]]) to distract the creature while [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]] dealt the killing blow.

== Dreamwave Productions ==
In the 21st century reimagining of the original continuity by [[Dreamwave]] Productions, Optimus Prime started life as Optronix (Orion to his friends), a data archivist. After taking note of a battle in which the Autobot leader [[Sentinel Prime]] had been killed by [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]], he was summoned to the Council of Elders and informed that the Matrix had chosen him to be the next leader of the Autobots. He received the [[Matrix of Leadership|Autobot Matrix of Leadership]] shortly thereafter, and almost arranged for the Autobot evacuation of Cybertron, intending to leave the Decepticons to their own devices, until a battle with Megatron beneath the planet's surface, accompanied by visions from the Matrix, stirred him on to fight for the safety of his homeworld. It is interesting to note that in this reimagining, Optimus actually ''was'' physically changed in appearance and size by the Matrix during the events of the first volume of ''War Within''.

Some time into his role as leader, Prime disappeared in a spacebridge experiment along with Megatron, but returned some time later, having spent a period of time on [[Quintessa]]. Events during this period have gone unrecorded as a result of Dreamwave's closure.

The actual events of the Autobots and Decepticon coming to Earth were never printed by Dreamwave comics, but flashbacks of the events were seen which suggest evenkening of the Transformers on Earth, the Autobots allied with humankind and eventually defeated the Decepticons at the turn of the century. They planned to return to Cybertron aboard the newly constructed ''[[Ark (Transformers)|Ark II]]'', but the ship was destroyed as part of a military conspiracy to take control of the Transformers. However, a [[terrorist organization]] run by the enigmatic Lazarus was able to seize control of several of the Transformers that fell back to Earth, while the U.S. military located Prime's body. Before his departure, Prime had entrusted a small portion of the Matrix to [[Spike Witwicky]], who was forced by the product chief, General Hallo, to use it to reactivate Prime. Functional again, Prime used the Matrix to reactivate more of his fallen comrades, and then faced off against Megatron in [[San Francisco]].

Following this, Prime began to experience subconscious urgings, leading both the Autobots and the Decepticons to the Arctic Circle, where [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] arrived to greet them — and arrest them as war criminals. Shockwave had succeeded in ending the war on Cybertron, but Prime soon fell in with a rebel Autobot group that had discovered Shockwave had greater agenda. Rallying Transformers across Cybertron to the cause, Prime faced Shockwave in battle but was defeated and had the Matrix ripped from him and used to activate Vector Sigma. Before Shockwave could make full use of the mega-computer's data, however, [[Ultra Magnus]] (in this continuity, Prime's brother) arrived and bested him. The injuries Prime took in this conflicted necessitated a prolonged restoration period in stasis but Dreamwave's closure meant that Prime never appeared in their pages again.

Art from unreleased issues later showed Optimus Prime awakening from the cryo regeneration chamber and freeing Alpha Trion from Shockwave's lab.

Prime would make one further surprise appearance in Dreamwave's ''Transformers: Armada'' comic series, although it would not be the Prime of the Dreamwave first series. When [[Optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|the Optimus Prime of the ''Armada'' universe]] disappeared, pulled into another dimension by the power of [[Unicron]], the Chaos-Bringer sent something back in his stead — a nearly dead Optimus Prime from that universe, who warned the Transformers of Unicron's coming into their universe before dying.

== Devil's Due Publishing ==
Optimus Prime would also be a major character in [[Devil's Due Publishing]]'s various G.I. Joe meets the Transformers series. Little is known about this Prime's early years, save that he survived an assassination attempt by [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]] soon after receiving the Matrix. From this point the traditional ''[[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]]'' storyline would leave the Transformers crashed on Earth. However, here they were not reactivated of their own accord: ''The Ark'' was discovered by the terrorist organization [[Cobra Command|Cobra]], and all the Transformers inside were reformatted into Cobra vehicles remotely controlled by the Televipers. Prime was turned into a Cobra Sentry Missile System tank (a 1985 [[Sears]] store exclusive red repaint of the HISS tank).<ref>[http://www.yojoe.com/vehicles/85/sms/ Sentry Missile System] - YOJOE.COM</ref> After an attack on a U.N. summit in Washington D.C. he was, however, able to get a message to [[Wheeljack]], alerting G.I. Joe to where the Cobra base was hidden. Subsequently he and the other captive Autobots (and Decepticons) broke free, and he battled and defeated his enemy Megatron. The Transformers then returned to Cybertron in a second Ark Class vessel, but not before gifting their human allies with a surprising technological boon: The ability to build and use [[mecha]] based on Transformers technology.

Sadly, Prime's homecoming was not all he had hoped for: the Decepticon [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] had taken control of the planet. Prime and the other Transformers were forced to go underground, waging a guerrilla war against the Decepticons. Around this time Cobra would attempt to steal Teletran-3, but their attempt to teleport directly into the chamber would set off a catastrophic malfunction, one that threatened to crack open time itself. Optimus Prime and the [[Stunticon]]s were amongst those who found themselves sent back in time. He was reformatted into a 1920s semi-truck. He was eventually rescued by [[Roadblock (G.I. Joe)|Roadblock]], [[Beach Head]] and the [[Baroness (G.I. Joe)|Baroness]] and helped to capture the Stunticons.

In the wake of this incident the Transformers managed to reclaim much of Cybertron. Mindful of the dangers of allowing humans like Cobra access to Cybertronian technology, Prime sent [[Perceptor]], [[Grimlock]], [[Arcee]] and [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] on a mission to Earth. As it turned out Prime's fears were well founded: the U.S. government had used parts from Megatron to create [[Serpentor|Serpent O.R.]], a cyborg designed to be a perfect weapon. A raid by Cobra allowed it to escape and gather an army of Decepticons on Cybertron, killing [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] in the process. Despite the grief of losing Bumblebee, Prime continued on and rallied his comrades to do the same. Attacking the Autobot capital city, Serpentor's forces proved overwhelming, and Prime voluntarily to surrender to ensure the Decepticons would cease fire. Realizing Serpentor wanted the [[Autobot Matrix of Leadership]], Prime broke free as Serpentor was distracted, but was unable to kill him, promptly being attacked and beaten near death by [[Razorclaw]] and [[Stunticon|Motormaster]]. He was subsequently forced to watch as Serpentor opened the Matrix. The result was not what anyone expected — Serpentor was not only reformatted into a Transformers-size mechanoid but was shown the futility of the fighting by the Matrix. At this point [[Cobra Commander]] was able to take control of Serpentor's body, only being defeated by [[Hawk (G.I. Joe)|Hawk]] opening the Matrix, transforming him into a great leader and rendering Cobra Commander comatose. As the Joes prepared to head home, Prime promised to record the Hawk-led humans' future.

Prime appeared again in the fourth crossover "Black Horizon". With the Matrix afflicted Hawk receiving dire visions of a new threat, Prime journeyed to Earth personally, taking Hawk and [[Flint (G.I. Joe)|Flint]] to Tibet to discover the source of the problem — only to encounter Bludgeon once again. The two battled, with Prime only being saved by Hawk's intervention. Fighting their way into a secret city beneath the [[Himalaya]]s, the trio realized the extent of the threat — the impending destruction of humanity by [[Unicron]], and the world being taken over by [[Cobra-La]]. However at that point they were discovered by Bludgeon and a group of Cobra-La troops. Prime defeated Bludgeon, although the warrior plummeted to his death despite Prime's best efforts. Prime, Hawk and Joe Colton (the original G.I. Joe) then gatecrashed the Cobra-La ceremony to sacrifice Firewall to Unicron in Prime's truck mode. Prime was then mobbed by Cobra-La warriors, and pinned down by a monstrous insectoid creature. Prime demolished them in time to save Hawk from [[Golobulus]]. With Cobra-La arrested by G.I. Joe, Prime checked his troops would recover — and then sat down to watch TV with [[Eject (Transformers)|Eject]] and Firewall.

In the third series both Prime and Serpentor indicate that the Matrix had transformed Prime from "''a simple archivist''" into a great warrior, indicating that the history of this incarnation of Prime is roughly in line with that of the Dreamwave version.

== IDW Publishing ==
When [[IDW Publishing]] received the comic rights to ''The Transformers'', author Simon Furman was hired to oversee the line. Furman decided that the Generation 1 continuity "was in need of ... a contemporary restart" so that the comic could retain a modern audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/features/112210635439697.htm |title=Transformers from IDW with Simon Furman: Interviews & Features Archive - Comics Bulletin |publisher=Silverbulletcomicbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref> Furman's revised continuity establishes Optimus Prime as the present-day leader of an Autobot army spread across the galaxy in small units, waging a covert war against teams of Decepticon infiltrators over resource-rich worlds. The ''[[The Transformers: Stormbringer|Stormbringer]]'' miniseries explains that the Transformer homeworld of Cybertron is a dead planet, ravaged by an ancient cataclysm caused by the Autobot-Decepticon War, one which forced Prime to ally with his arch-rival [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] to eventually halt. In the series, the interference of [[Jetfire]] and the [[Technobots]] in a plot organized by the Decepticon [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]] alerts Prime to the possibility that the Cybertronian cataclysm might be re-ignited and spread to other planets. Prime calls in the [[Wreckers (Transformers)|Wreckers]], meeting them on the surface of Cybertron in time to witness the return of the being called [[Thunderwing]], the focal point of the apocalypse. The combined efforts of Prime, the Wreckers, Jetfire, [[Predacons|Predacon]]-led Decepticons and a unit of aging Centurion drones are barely enough to render [[Thunderwing]] inert.

Bludgeon's recovered files bring Optimus Prime to Earth, where an Autobot detachment led by [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]] has discovered that a Decepticon infiltration unit led by [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]] has broken standard protocol after discovering a new form of Energon. This [[Energon (power source)|Ore-13]] appears to be the same "Ultra-Energon" that Bludgeon used to restore Thunderwing, dormant for millennia after the apocalypse, to life, and Starscream has already used it to fuel a failed attempt to usurp Megatron's leadership (as detailed in the ''[[The Transformers: Infiltration|Infiltration]]'' miniseries).

In the ''[[The Transformers: Escalation|Escalation]]'' miniseries, Megatron himself engages Prime and, boosted by Ore-13, overcomes him. Believing their leader dead, the rest of the Autobots attempt to buy the newly-arrived [[Hot Rod (Transformers)|Hot Rod]] time to collect the clone, but Prime — who has transferred his consciousness to a backup memory in his trailer command post — advises them to exploit Ore-13's weakness and assault Megatron all-out, catalyzing the Decepticon leader's Energon supply and crippling him.

===New Avengers/Transformers===
Bumblebee, Jazz, Optimus Prime, Prowl and Ratchet appeared in [[New Avengers/Transformers]] crossover by Marvel Comics and IDW Publishing in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0702/28/crossover.htm |title=New Avengers/Transformers |publisher=Comics Continuum |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref>

==Kiss Players==
This Japanese series, told through radio plays, and using the ''[[Transformers: Alternators]]'' (''Binaltech'' in Japan) Optimus Prime toy mold (see "Toys"), branches off from the original animated series, and is set in a different universe than the both the original ''G1'' and ''Binaltech'' continuities. Set in the year 2006 (which, in Japanese continuity, is one year after Prime's death in ''The Transformers: The Movie'', but four years before the third season), it sees Prime's corpse covertly transported to Japan by the government organization, the [[Earth Defense Command]]. The convoy transporting his body was then attacked by a group of female commandos, led by [[Marissa Faireborn]], who had known Prime years ago as a child. Believing they had secured Prime's body, the commandos were taken by surprise by EDC "[[Kiss Players|Kiss Player]]" operative Ringo and her Autrooper mechanoid partner, who killed them all except Marissa. Marissa went to Prime's body, just as an Autrooper began to fuse with it; reflecting on her childhood memories of Prime, she gave his faceplate a final kiss, which initiated an amazing transformation — Marissa and Prime were fused together, and Prime was reborn with a new body, now transforming into a Dodge Ram SRT-10.

Marissa and Prime are now on the run from the EDC, and are also frequently opposed by the mysterious "Legion" Transformers. Faced with such foes, Marissa unleashes her "Kiss Player" ability by kissing Prime, fusing with him once again, and increasing his power so that he can best their opponents. Prime is armed with the "Surf Blade", a weapon formed out of Marissa's surfboard, wielded expertly thanks to the knife skills Marissa passes on to him when they merge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toyvey.com/kisskiss |title=Transformers: KissKiss, a Transformers KissPlay information site |publisher=Toyvey.com |date=2007-07-11 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref>

==Binaltech==
Due to the interference of Ravage (the same future Ravage who appears in the [[Beast Wars]]), most of the events of the [[The Transformers: The Movie|original animated feature]] do not transpire; most importantly the Battle of Autobot City does not occur, and Optimus Prime and [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] do not have their final showdown, meaning that Optimus Prime does not die, and Megatron is never reformatted into Galvatron. As a result, Optimus Prime is present to lead the Transformers during the Binaltech saga.

Equipped with knowledge of the future and the danger that would soon be threatening the Transformers, Ravage's machinations included trapping Megatron and a large army of Decepticons in a spacial rift, with the intention of protecting the Decepticons from the approaching [[Unicron]], and forcing the Autobots to face the planet-eater unaided. The Decepticons would then be in a position to conquer whoever was the victor of that battle.

Aware of the changes to the timestream, as well as the potential for the entire Autobot race to be annihilated by Unicron, Optimus put into motion Operation Distant Thunder, a plan to undo the damage to the timeline caused by Ravage, restoring the events that were seen in the movie. In a damned-if-they-do, damned-if-they-don't situation, it would mean that saving all the Autobots from Unicron would result in Prime and others such as Prowl, Wheeljack, Ironhide and Ratchet still dying per the original events. But it was hoped they may be able to at least partly avoid such an outcome by sending a "ship in a bottle" back in time — a message to their past selves about all they had learned.

Upon discovering that the Matrix was the key to destroying Unicron, Optimus Prime and [[Ultra Magnus]] went on alone to face Unicron, while the rest of the Autobots executed the plan to restore the original timeline, Operation Distant Thunder. It was hoped that at least one of these plans would be successful. Prime was injured in the confrontation with Unicron, and although his injuries were not mortal, he passed the Matrix to Magnus, who shed his outer armor and managed to successfully complete the mission, resulting in the destruction of Unicron.

Distant Thunder was ultimately unsuccessful, however as the universe started to rip apart, a black Optimus Prime clone appeared, splitting the Binaltech universe into its own separate continuity, while also restoring the original timeline and stabilizing the multiverse. The clone, obviously friendly to the Transformers, proclaimed that the Binaltech universe must be allowed to continue, as it was important to the future. Optimus Prime questioned the black doppelganger, who explained only that he carried "the Protector's" spark, but refused to reveal any more detailed information than that. Soon after however, the clone, who was originally developed by Dr Archeville as a weapon of evil, ejected the "good" spark that had invaded and taken over the black figure, reverted to its original evil programming and, now no longer just a black version of Optimus but the malevolent Nemesis Prime (Black Convoy), escaped.

Per Ravage's original plan, with Unicron defeated, the Decepticons returned to conquer the Transformers. However, Optimus Prime also planned for this event, and sent Mirage to press a switch, buried deep within Cybertron, that would render all Transformers inert. (This was seen at the conclusion of the "Five Faces of Darkness" story arc from the original animated series.) Optimus hoped that although all the Transformers would be rendered inoperative, the war would be stopped, and that the humans would be able to reactivate the Transformers in the future. However, this plan had the surprising side-effect that only those with original Cybertronian bodies were deactivated — those with Earth-made Binaltech bodies continued to function. And thus, the Autobots effectively won the war, with the large army of Binaltech Autobots easily outnumbering the few Decepticons who had managed to procure Binaltech upgrades (effectively just Nemesis Prime and Shockwave, who escaped with Megatron and their other inert comrades).

With the major threats taken care of, Optimus Prime turned his and the Autobots' attention to identifying and shutting down the rogue projects taking place across Earth using stolen Binaltech technology and secrets. It was during one of these missions that Optimus Prime faced off against Nemesis Prime, with both of them in Binaltech [[Dodge Ram]] forms. Initially, things looked bad for Optimus Prime, as he was no match for his opponent's spectral armor. However, the Protector merged with Prime, and the enormous power that resulted allowed Prime to reflect Nemesis Prime's final attack, obliterating the evil Decepticon. Optimus Prime recalls the union of the two sparks being familiar, from an event in the distant past, and is also reassured by the Protector about "the seeds of the future", revealing the Protector to be [[Optimus Primal]].

== Toys ==
[[image:optimusprime.png|right|thumb|The original Optimus Prime toy patent design]]

Through the years, there have been many action figures representing the original incarnation of Optimus Prime; some of which have featured in fiction, others of which have not. Additionally, some toy makers have made unlicensed toys in his image, or accessories for the existing toys.

The original 1984 Optimus Prime toy was part of [[Takara]]'s 1983 [[Diaclone]] toy line under the name "Battle Convoy." Designed by Hiroyuki Obara and [[Shoji Kawamori]] (famous for his work in ''[[Macross]]'').,<ref>{{cite book|last= Igarashi|first= Kouji|authorlink= Kouji Ogarashi|title= タカラSFランド大全集|publisher= Kodansha|date= 1999.11|location= Tokyo|isbn= 4-06-330086-2}}</ref> the toy's characteristics such as the head design and cab front end as the upper torso have become design elements in nearly every incarnation and variant of Optimus Prime. This particular toy has been reissued multiple times; mostly to commemorate the anniversary of the Transformers franchise. Optimus Prime was also released as an [[Action Master]] and [[Powermaster]] toy in the original Transformers toy line. 

The original Optimus Prime toy was altered somewhat and an electronic sound maker was added for the ''Generation 2'' toy line.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=mbTUorcuXkoC&pg=PA321&dq=%22generation+2%22+transformers&hl=en&ei=woyoTPq8KI7hnQeIwOWjDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22generation%202%22%20transformers&f=false The African American entrepreneur: then and now By W. Sherman Rogers page 321</ref> Later ''Generation 2'' toys for Optimus were completely new toys, such as Combat Hero Optimus Prime, Laser Optimus Prime and [[Gobot]] Optimus Prime, who became a red [[Lamborgini]] car.  

In 2003, Takara introduced the [[Transformers: Masterpiece|Masterpiece]] MP-01 Convoy/Optimus Prime. While retaining the original concept of a transforming semi-trailer truck, this [[Die-cast toy|die-cast figure]] incorporated modern toy manufacturing techniques for improved detail and articulation, while at the same time, captured the look of the cartoon character. It has since been released by both [[Hasbro]] and [[Takara Tomy]] in different variations.

In 2006 Hasbro introduced ''Alternators'' Optimus Prime, which turned into a licensed 1:24 scale model Dodge Ram SRT-10. <ref>{{Cite book | title=Transformers: The Fantasy, The Fun, The Future| last=Brereton | first=Erin | year=2006 | publisher=Triumph Books| ISBN=1572439831 | page= 7}}</ref>

In 2010 a version of the Masterpiece toy called Masterpiece Convoy Sleep Mode was released, painted in dark colors to match the appearance of Optimus Prime after his death in the 1986 film.<ref>Masterpiece Convoy Sleep Mode, Lee's Toy Review magazine issue #213, Fall 2010, page 14</ref>

==Other merchandise==
Optimus Prime, Ironhide and Grimlock are the three Autobot figures available to play in the [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] Transformers Collectors Edition game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.80stees.com/products/Transformers-Monopoly.asp |title=Collectors Edition Transformers Monopoly |publisher=80stees.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref>

As the figurehead of the entire Transformers franchise, Optimus Prime has been on more pieces of merchandise than one can comfortably count, with one of the most outrageous being the "Optimus Prime Oral Care Station". Several statues and busts of Prime have been released by various companies since the return of Transformers to prominence, and other figures released include various PVCs as part of Takara's "Super Collection Figure" line, which were later imported as part of Hasbro's "[[Heroes of Cybertron]]" series. Larger "Mega Collection Figure" PVCs were articulated and came with energy axe and gun figures.
