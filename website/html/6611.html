<html> <head> <title>Co-occurrence matrix</title></head><body>A '''co-occurrence matrix''' or '''co-occurrence distribution''' (less often '''coöccurrence matrix''' or '''coöccurrence distribution''') is a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] or [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] that is defined over an [[Digital image|image]] to be the distribution of co-occurring values at a given offset. Mathematically, a co-occurrence matrix '''C''' is defined over an '''n x m''' image '''I''', parameterized by an offset '''(Δx,Δy)''', as:

<math>C_{\Delta x, \Delta y}(i,j)=\sum_{p=1}^n\sum_{q=1}^m\begin{cases} 1, & \mbox{if }I(p,q)=i\mbox{ and }I(p+\Delta x,q+\Delta y)=j \\ 0, & \mbox{otherwise}\end{cases}</math>

The 'value' of the image originally referred to the [[grayscale]] value of the specified [[pixel]]. The value could be anything, from a [[binary numeral system|binary]] on/off value to 32-bit color and beyond. Note that 32-bit color will yield a <math>2^{32} \times 2^{32}</math> co-occurrence matrix!

Really any matrix or pair of matrices can be used to generate a co-occurrence matrix, though their main applicability has been in the measuring of [[Texture (computer graphics)|texture]] in images, so the typical definition, as above, assumes that the matrix is in fact an image.

It is also possible to define the matrix across two different images. Such a matrix can then be used for [[color mapping]].

Note that the '''(Δx,Δy)''' parameterization makes the co-occurrence matrix sensitive to rotation. We choose one offset vector, so a rotation of the image not equal to 180 degrees will result in a different co-occurrence distribution for the same (rotated) image. This is rarely desirable in the applications co-occurrence matrices are used in, so the co-occurrence matrix is often formed using a set of offsets sweeping through 180 degrees (i.e. 0, 45, 90, and 135 degrees) at the same distance to achieve a degree of [[rotational invariance]].

==Aliases==

Co-occurrence matrices have been referred to as:

:* GLCM (Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices)
:* spatial dependence matrix

==Scripts==

A [[Matlab]] function for calculating a co-occurrence matrix across two binary images (containing only values 0 and 1) with offsets of 0:

<source lang="matlab">
function M=getCoMatrix(M1,M2)
  M = zeros(2); % 2x2 result matrix for binary image.
  [r,c] = size(M1);

  for i=1:r
      for j=1:c
          v1 = M1(i,j)+1; % Add one to binary image values to get Matlab indices.
          v2 = M2(i,j)+1;
          M(v1,v2) = M(v1,v2)+1; % Increment co-occurrence value.
      end
  end
</source>

==Application to image analysis==

Whether considering the intensity or [[grayscale]] values of the image or various dimensions of color, the co-occurrence matrix can measure the texture of the image. Because co-occurrence matrices are typically large and sparse, various metrics of the matrix are often taken to get a more useful set of features. Features generated using this technique are usually called [[Haralick features]], after [[R M Haralick]], attributed to his paper ''Textural features for image classification (1973)''.

Texture measures like the co-occurrence matrix, [[wavelet transforms]], and [[model fitting]] have found application in medical image analysis in particular.
