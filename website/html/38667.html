'''uXu''', Underground eXperts United (1991-2002), [[underground ezine]] formed in Sweden by ex-members of the [[Swedish Hackers Association]], writing [[ASCII]] text files, influenced by [[Cult of the Dead Cow|cDc]]. When the group folded they had written and published 617 textfiles in English and more than 100 in Swedish.

''Founded in 1991, based in Sweden, uXu is a good example of a textfile endeavor where you can actually track the progression of a small social group through nearly a decade. The files begin with descriptions of the computer "scene" of Sweden, bombs, technology and eventually expands over the years to journal entries, musings about philosophy, song lyrics, interviews, and a bunch of nice fellows just letting you know what they're up to. All in all, good solid quality and a fascinating study.''
