A '''console application''' is a [[computer program]] designed to be used via a text-only computer interface, such as a [[text terminal]], the [[command line interface]] of some [[operating system]]s ([[Unix]], [[DOS]], etc.) or the text-based interface included with most [[Graphical user interface|Graphical User Interface]] (GUI) operating systems, such as the [[Win32 console]] in [[Microsoft Windows]], the Terminal in [[Mac OS X]], and [[xterm]] in Unix. A user typically interacts with a console application using only a [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[computer display|display screen]], as opposed to GUI applications, which normally require the use of a [[mouse (computing)|mouse]] or other [[pointing device]]. Many console applications such as [[command line interpreter]]s are [[command line interface|command line]] tools, but numerous [[Text user interface|Text User Interface]] (TUI) programs also exist.

As the speed and ease-of-use of GUI applications have improved over time, the use of console applications has greatly diminished, but not disappeared. Some users simply prefer console based applications, while some organizations still rely on existing console applications to handle key data processing tasks.
