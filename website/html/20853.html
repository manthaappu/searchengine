<html> <head> <title>Kronecker sum of discrete Laplacians</title></head><body>In mathematics, the '''Kronecker sum of discrete Laplacians''', named after [[Leopold Kronecker]], is a discrete version of the [[separation of variables]] for the continuous [[Laplacian]] in a [[Cuboid#Rectangular_cuboid|rectangular cuboid]] domain.

==General form of the [[Kronecker_product#Kronecker_sum_and_exponentiation|Kronecker sum]] of discrete Laplacians==

In a general situation of the [[separation of variables]] in the discrete case, the  multidimensional [[Discrete Laplace operator|discrete Laplacian]] is a [[Kronecker_product#Kronecker_sum_and_exponentiation|Kronecker sum]] of 1D discrete Laplacians.

===Example: 2D [[Discrete Laplace operator|discrete Laplacian]] on a [[regular grid]] with the homogeneous [[Dirichlet boundary condition]]===

Mathematically, using the [[Kronecker_product#Kronecker_sum_and_exponentiation|Kronecker sum]]:

:<math>L = \mathbf{D_{xx}}\oplus\mathbf{D_{yy}}=\mathbf{D_{xx}}\otimes\mathbf{I}+\mathbf{I}\otimes\mathbf{D_{yy}}, \,</math>

where <math>\mathbf{D_{xx}} </math> and <math>\mathbf{D_{yy}} </math> are 1D discrete Laplacians in the ''x''- and ''y''-directions, correspondingly, and <math>\mathbf{I} </math> are the identities of appropriate sizes. Both <math>\mathbf{D_{xx}} </math> and <math>\mathbf{D_{yy}} </math> must correspond to the case of the homogeneous [[Dirichlet boundary condition]] at end points of the ''x''- and ''y''-intervals, in order to generate the 2D discrete Laplacian ''L'' corresponding to the homogeneous [[Dirichlet boundary condition]] everywhere on the boundary of the rectangular domain. 

Here is a sample [[OCTAVE]]/[[MATLAB]] code to compute ''L'' on the regular 10&times;15 2D grid: 
: nx = 10; % number of grid points in the x-direction;
: ny = 15; % number of grid points in the y-direction;
: ex = ones(nx,1); ; 
: Dxx = spdiags([ex -2*ex ex], [-1 0 1], nx, nx); %1D discrete Laplacian in the x-direction ;
: ey = ones(ny,1); '
: Dyy = spdiags([ey, -2*ey ey], [-1 0 1], ny, ny); %1D discrete Laplacian in the y-direction ;
: L = kron(speye(ny, ny), Dxx) + kron(Dyy, speye(nx, nx)) ;

==[[eigenvalue|Eigenvalues]] and [[eigenvector|eigenvectors]] of multidimensional [[Discrete Laplace operator|discrete Laplacian]] on a [[regular grid]]==

Knowing all [[eigenvalue|eigenvalues]] and [[eigenvector|eigenvectors]] of the factors, all [[eigenvalue|eigenvalues]] and [[eigenvector|eigenvectors]] of the [[Kronecker product]] can be [[Kronecker_product#Spectrum|explicitly calculated]]. Based on this, [[eigenvalue|eigenvalues]] and [[eigenvector|eigenvectors]] of the [[Kronecker_product#Kronecker_sum_and_exponentiation|Kronecker sum]]
can also be explicitly calculated. 

The [[eigenvalue|eigenvalues]] and [[eigenvector|eigenvectors]] of the standard [[Central_difference#Higher-order_differences|central difference approximation of the second derivative]] on an interval for traditional combinations of boundary conditions at the interval end points are [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the second derivative|well known]]. Combining these expressions with the formulas of [[eigenvalue|eigenvalues]] and [[eigenvector|eigenvectors]] for the [[Kronecker_product#Kronecker_sum_and_exponentiation|Kronecker sum]], one can easily obtain the required answer. 

===Example: 3D [[Discrete Laplace operator|discrete Laplacian]] on a [[regular grid]] with the homogeneous [[Dirichlet boundary condition]]===

:<math>L = \mathbf{D_{xx}}\otimes\mathbf{I}\otimes\mathbf{I}+\mathbf{I}\otimes\mathbf{D_{yy}}\otimes\mathbf{I}+\mathbf{I}\otimes\mathbf{I}\otimes\mathbf{D_{zz}}, \,</math>

where <math>\mathbf{D_{xx}},\,\mathbf{D_{yy}}</math> and <math>\mathbf{D_{zz}} </math> are 1D discrete Laplacians in every of the 3 directions, and <math>\mathbf{I} </math> are the identities of appropriate sizes. Each 1D discrete Laplacian must correspond to the case of the homogeneous [[Dirichlet boundary condition]], in order to generate the 3D discrete Laplacian ''L'' corresponding to the homogeneous [[Dirichlet boundary condition]] everywhere on the boundary. The eigenvalues are

:<math> \lambda_{jx,jy,jz} = 
-\frac{4}{h_x^2} \sin(\frac{\pi j_x}{2(n_x + 1)})^2
-\frac{4}{h_y^2} \sin(\frac{\pi j_y}{2(n_y + 1)})^2
-\frac{4}{h_z^2} \sin(\frac{\pi j_z}{2(n_z + 1)})^2
</math>

where <math> j_x=1,\ldots,n_x,\,j_y=1,\ldots,n_y,\,j_z=1,\ldots,n_z,\,</math>, and the corresponding eigenvectors are

:<math>v_{ix,iy,iz,jx,jy,jz} = 
\sqrt{\frac{2}{n_x+1}} \sin(\frac{i_x j_x \pi}{n_x+1})
\sqrt{\frac{2}{n_y+1}} \sin(\frac{i_y j_y \pi}{n_y+1})
\sqrt{\frac{2}{n_z+1}} \sin(\frac{i_z j_z \pi}{n_z+1})
</math>

where the multi-index <math>{jx,jy,jz}</math> pairs the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors, while the multi-index
<math>{ix,iy,iz}</math> determines the location of the value of every eigenvector at the [[regular grid]]. The boundary points, where 
the homogeneous [[Dirichlet boundary condition]] are imposed, are just outside of the grid.

==Available software==
An [[OCTAVE]]/[[MATLAB]] code http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27279-laplacian-in-1d-2d-or-3d is available under a [[BSD License]], which computes the sparse matrix of the 1, 2D, and 3D negative Laplacians on a rectangular grid for combinations of Dirichlet, Neumann, and Periodic boundary conditions using [[Kronecker sum]]s of discrete 1D Laplacians. The code also provides the exact [[eigenvalue]]s and [[eigenvector]]s using the explicit formulas given above.
