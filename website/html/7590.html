'''Computer surveillance''' is the act of performing [[surveillance]] of computer activity, and of data stored on a [[hard drive]] or being transferred over the [[Internet]].

Computer surveillance programs are widespread today, and almost all Internet traffic is closely monitored for clues of illegal activity.

Supporters{{Who|date=May 2010}} say that watching all Internet traffic is important, because by knowing everything that everyone is reading and writing, they can identify terrorists and criminals, and protect society from them.

Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} cite concerns over privacy and the possibility of a totalitarian state where political dissent is impossible and opponents of state policy are removed in [[COINTELPRO]]-like purges. Such a state may be referred to as an [[Electronic Police State]], in which the government aggressively uses electronic technologies to record, organize, search and distribute forensic evidence against its citizens.

==Network surveillance==

The vast majority of computer surveillance involves the monitoring of [[data mining|data]] and [[traffic analysis|traffic]] on the [[Internet]].<ref name="sciam-internet">{{cite news|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=internet-eavesdropping|title=Internet Eavesdropping: A Brave New World of Wiretapping |last=Diffie|first=Whitfield|coauthors=Susan Landau|date=August, 2008|work=Scientific American|accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref> In the United States for example, under the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]], all phone calls and broadband internet traffic (emails, web traffic, instant messaging, etc.) are required to be available for unimpeded real-time monitoring by Federal law enforcement agencies.<ref name="eff-calea-archive">{{cite web|url=http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/CALEA/?f=archive.html|title=CALEA Archive -- Electronic Frontier Foundation|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website)|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref><ref name="eff-calea-summary">{{cite web|url=http://www.eff.org/issues/calea|title=CALEA: The Perils of Wiretapping the Internet|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website)|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref><ref name="eff-calea-faq">{{cite web|url=http://www.eff.org/pages/calea-faq|title=CALEA: Frequently Asked Questions|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website)|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref> 

''[[Packet sniffer|Packet sniffing]]'' is the monitoring of data traffic on a [[computer network]]. Computers communicate over the [[Internet]] by breaking up messages (emails, images, videos, web pages, files, etc.) into small chunks called "packets", which are routed through a network of computers, until they reach their destination, where they are assembled back into a complete "message" again. Packet sniffers are programs that intercept these packets as they are travelling through the network, in order to examine their contents using other programs. A packet sniffer is an information ''gathering'' tool, but not an ''analysis'' tool. That is it gathers "messages" but it does not analyze them and figure out what they mean. Other programs are needed to perform [[traffic analysis]] and sift through intercepted data looking for important/useful information. Under the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]] all U.S. telecommunications providers are required to install packet sniffing technology to allow Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept all of their customers' broadband Internet traffic. 

There is far too much data gathered by these packet sniffers for human investigators to manually search through all of it. So automated Internet surveillance computers sift through the vast amount of intercepted Internet traffic, and filter out and report to human investigators those bits of information which are "interesting" -- such as the use of certain words or phrases, visiting certain types of web sites, or communicating via email or chat with a certain individual or group.<ref name="usatoday-chatroom">{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2004-10-11-chatroom-surv_x.htm|title=Government funds chat room surveillance research|last=Hill|first=Michael|date=October 11, 2004|work=Associated Press|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref> Billions of dollars per year are spent, by agencies such as the [[Information Awareness Office]], [[NSA]], and the [[FBI]], to develop, purchase, implement, and operate systems which intercept and analyze all of this data, and extract only the information which is useful to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.<ref name="zdnet-fbi">{{cite news|url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-151059.html|title=FBI turns to broad new wiretap method|last=McCullagh|first=Declan|date=January 30, 2007|work=ZDNet News|accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>

Similar systems are now operated by [[Ministry of Intelligence and National Security of Iran|Iranian secret police]] to identify and suppress dissidents.

==Corporate surveillance==
Corporate surveillance of computer activity is very common. The data collected is most often used for marketing purposes or sold to other corporations, but is also regularly shared with government agencies. It can be used as a form of [[business intelligence]], which enables the corporation to better tailor their products and/or services to be desirable by their customers. Or it the data can be sold to other corporations, so that they can use it for the aforementioned purpose. Or it can be used for direct marketing purposes, such as targeted advertisements, where ads are targeted to the user of the search engine by analyzing their search history and emails<ref name="nytimes-onlineads">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/technology/01Privacy.html?_r=1|title=F.T.C. to Review Online Ads and Privacy|last=Story|first=Louise|date=November 1, 2007|work=New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-17}}</ref> (if they use free webmail services), which is kept in a database.<ref name="surv-in-society"/>

For instance, [[Google]], the world's most popular search engine, stores identifying information for each web search. An [[IP address]] and the search phrase used are stored in a database for up to 18 months.<ref name="cnet-googlelogs">{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13739_3-10038963-46.html|title=Debunking Google's log anonymization propaganda|last=Soghoian|first=Chris|date=September 11, 2008|work=CNET News|accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref> Google also scans the content of emails of users of its Gmail webmail service, in order to create targeted advertising based on what people are talking about in their personal email correspondences.<ref name="joshi">{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/every-move-you-make-google-will-be-watching-you/57071/on|title=  Every move you make, Google will be watching you|last=Joshi|first=Priyanki|date=March 21, 2009|work=Business Standard|accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref> Google is, by far, the largest Internet advertising agency—millions of sites place Google's advertising banners and links on their websites, in order to earn money from visitors who click on the ads. Each page containing Google ads adds, reads, and modifies [[HTTP cookie|"cookies"]] on each visitor's computer.<ref name="google-adprivacy">{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html|title=Advertising and Privacy|year=2009|work=Google (company page)|accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref> These cookies track the user across all of these sites, and gather information about their web surfing habits, keeping track of which sites they visit, and what they do when they are on these sites. This information, along with the information from their email accounts, and search engine histories, is stored by Google to use for build a profile of the user to deliver better-targeted advertising.<ref name="joshi"/>

The United States government often gains access to these databases, either by producing a warrant for it, or by simply asking. The [[Department of Homeland Security]] has openly stated that it uses data collected from consumer credit and direct marketing agencies for augmenting the profiles of individuals that it is monitoring.<ref name="surv-in-society">{{cite news|url=http://www.thestarphoenix.com/Technology/Surveillance+society/1322333/story.html|title=Surveillance in society|last=Butler|first=Don|date=February 24, 2009|work=The Star Phoenix|publisher=CanWest|accessdate=2009-03-17}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

==Malicious software==

''For a more detailed discussion of topics mentioned in this section see: [[Spyware]], [[Computer virus]], [[Trojan (computer security)]], [[Keylogger]], [[Backdoor (computing)]]''

In addition to monitoring information sent over a computer network, there is also the need to examine data stored on a computer's [[hard drive]], and to monitor the activities of a person using the computer. A surveillance program installed on a computer can search the contents of the hard drive for suspicious data, can monitor computer use, collect [[password]]s, and/or report back activities in real-time to its operator through the Internet connection.

There are multiple ways of installing such software. The most common is remote installation, using a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] created by a [[computer virus]] or [[Trojan (computer security)|trojan]]. This tactic has the advantage of potentially subjecting multiple computers to surveillance.  Viruses often spread to thousands or millions of computers, and leave "backdoors" which are accessible over a network connection, and enable an intruder to remotely install software and execute commands. These viruses and trojans are sometimes developed by government agencies, such as [[CIPAV]] and [[Magic Lantern (software)|Magic Lantern]]. More often, however, viruses created by other people or [[spyware]] installed by marketing agencies can be used to gain access through the security breaches that they create.

Another method is [[Security cracking|"cracking"]] into the computer to gain access over a network. An attacker can then install surveillance software remotely. [[Server (computing)|Server]]s and computers with permanent [[broadband]] connections are most vulnerable to this type of attack.

One can also physically place surveillance software on a computer by gaining entry to the place where the computer is stored and install it from a [[compact disc]], [[floppy disk]], or [[thumbdrive]].  This method shares a disadvantage with hardware devices in that it requires [[physical access]] to the computer.

==Social network analysis==
One common form of surveillance is to create maps of [[social network]]s based on data from [[social networking sites]] as well as from [[traffic analysis]] information from phone call records such as those in the [[NSA call database]],<ref name="keefe">{{cite news|title=, Can Network Theory Thwart Terrorists?|last=Keefe|first=Patrick|date=March 12, 2006|work=New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref> and internet traffic data gathered under [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act|CALEA]]. These [[social network]] "maps" are then [[data mining|data mined]] to extract useful information such as personal interests, friendships & affiliations, wants, beliefs, thoughts, and activities.<ref name="part-surv">{{cite journal|last=Albrechtslund|first=Anders|date=March 3, 2008|title=Online Social Networking as Participatory Surveillance |journal=First Monday|volume=13|issue=3|url=http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2142/1949|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}</ref><ref name="fuchs">{{cite book|last=Fuchs|first=Christian|title=Social Networking Sites and the Surveillance Society.

Many U.S. government agencies such as the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)]], the [[National Security Agency (NSA)]], and the [[Department of Homeland Security (DHS)]] are currently investing heavily in research involving social network analysis.<ref name="pentagon-social-networks">{{cite news|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19025556.200?DCMP=NLC-nletter&nsref=mg19025556.200|title=Pentagon sets its sights on social networking websites |last=Marks|first=Paul|date=June 9, 2006|work=New Scientist|accessdate=2009-03-16}}</ref><ref name="nsa-myspace">{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-6082047-7.html|title=Is the NSA reading your MySpace profile?|last=Kawamoto|first=Dawn|date=June 9, 2006|work=CNET News|accessdate=2009-03-16}}</ref> The intelligence community believes that the biggest threat to U.S. power comes from decentralized, leaderless, geographically dispersed groups of [[terrorists]], [[subversives]], and [[extremists]]. These types of threats are most easily countered by finding important nodes in the network, and removing them. To do this requires a detailed map of the network.<ref name="ethier"/><ref name="ressler">{{cite journal|last=Ressler|first=Steve|date=July 2006|title=Social Network Analysis as an Approach to Combat Terrorism: Past, Present, and Future Research |journal=Homeland Security Affairs|volume= II|issue=2|url=http://www.hsaj.org/?fullarticle=2.2.8|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}</ref>

Jason Ethier of Northeastern University, in his study of modern social network analysis, said the following of the Scalable Social Network Analysis Program developed by the [[Information Awareness Office]]:

{{quote|''The purpose of the SSNA algorithms program is to extend techniques of social network analysis to assist with distinguishing potential terrorist cells from legitimate groups of people ... In order to be successful SSNA will require information on the social interactions of the majority of people around the globe. Since the Defense Department cannot easily distinguish between peaceful citizens and terrorists, it will be necessary for them to gather data on innocent civilians as well as on potential terrorists.''|Jason Ethier<ref name="ethier"/>}}

==Emanations==
It has been shown that it is possible to surveil computers from a distance, with only commercially available equipment, by detecting  the [[radiation]] emitted by the [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] [[Computer display|monitor]]. This form of computer surveillance, known as [[TEMPEST]], involves reading electromagnetic emanations from computing devices in order to extract data from them at distances of hundreds of meters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eskimo.com/~joelm/tempest.html|title=Complete, Unofficial Tempest Page|last=McNamara|first=Joel|accessdate=2009-03-12}}</ref><ref name="emr">{{cite journal | author=Van Eck, Wim | title=Electromagnetic Radiation from Video Display Units: An Eavesdropping Risk? | journal=Computers & Security | volume=4 | year=1985 | pages=269–286 | url=http://jya.com/emr.pdf | doi=10.1016/0167-4048(85)90046-X }}</ref><ref name=Kuhn2004>{{cite journal | author = Kuhn, M.G. | year = 2004 | title = Electromagnetic Eavesdropping Risks of Flat-Panel Displays | journal = 4th Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies | pages = 23–25 | url = http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/pet2004-fpd.pdf }}</ref>

IBM researchers have also found that, for most computer keyboards, each key emits a slightly different noise when pressed. The differences are individually identifiable under some conditions, and so it's possible to log key strokes without actually requiring logging software to run on the associated computer.

And it has also been shown, by [[Adi Shamir]] et al., that even the high frequency [[noise]] emitted by a [[Central processing unit|CPU]] includes information about the instructions being executed.
