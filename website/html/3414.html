'''Bashir Iskandarovich Rameyev''' ({{lang-ru|Баши́р Исканда́рович Раме́ев}}; May 1, 1918 – May 16, 1994) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] inventor and scientist, one of the founders of Soviet computing, author of 23 [[patent]]s,<ref>Л.Н. Ефремов. (1985). ''Справка об изобретательной деятельности Рамеева Башира Искандаровича.'' Архив Московского Политехнического Музея. Стр.1.</ref> including the first officially registered in the USSR patent in the field of electronic computers—a patent for the Automatic Electronic Digital Machine (1948).<ref>Авторское свидетельство # 10475 от 4 декабря 1948 г., Архив Политехнического Музея, Москва.</ref> Rameyev's inventions paved the way for the development of a new field in Soviet science—electronic computing—and for the formation of a new branch of industry that supported it.

The central ideas incorporated in Rameyev's invention of the electronic computer included: storing programs in [[computer memory]], using [[binary code]], utilizing external devices, and deploying [[electronic circuits]] and [[semiconductor]] [[diode]]s. The first publication about similar technology outside of the USSR appeared in 1949-1950.<ref>Л.Н. Ефремов. (1985). ''Справка об изобретательной деятельности Рамеева Башира Искандаровича.'' Архив Московского Политехнического Музея. Стр.1.; Борис Николаевич Малиновский. (1995). ''История Вычислительной Техники в Лицах.'' Киев: Фирма Кит, ПТОО А.С.К., стр.240-242. </ref> Rameyev also suggested that intermediate computation data be automatically printed on [[punched tape]] and sent into the computer's arithmetic device for subsequent processing, meaning that the processing of commands would be performed in the computer’s arithmetic device; this is usually referred to as the [[Von Neumann architecture]].<ref>Georg Trogemann; Alexander Nitussov, Wolfgang Ernst, eds. (2001) ''Computing in Russia: The History of Computer Devices and Information Technology Revealed.'' Braunschweig and Wiesbaden: Vieweg & Sohn Verlagsgesellsschaft mbH,. p. 149.</ref>

Of particular note is Rameyev's invention of diode-matrix control circuits, which were used to build his first brainchild, the first serially manufactured Soviet mainframe "[[Strela]]" (1954).<ref>Л.Н. Ефремов. (1985). ''Справка об изобретательной деятельности Рамеева Башира Искандаровича. Архив Московского Политехнического Музея.'' Стр.3.</ref> In the 1950s, the diode-matrix control circuits were not widespread due to their significant dimensions and high power consumption. However, with subsequent development of [[microelectronics]] and the emergence of large-scale [[integrated circuit]]s, which made possible to deploy tens or hundreds of thousands of [[diode]]s and [[transistors]] in a single piece of [[silicon]], the concept of control circuits became viable and commonly used.

"[[Strela]]" computers carried out calculations in [[nuclear physics]], rocketry and space research.<ref>Л.Н. Ефремов. (1985). Ibid, стр.2.</ref>Notably, one of “[[Strela]]s" was used to calculate “[[Sputnik]]” orbit trajectory. For the development of "[[Strela]]" Rameyev and his team were awarded the [[Stalin Prize]] of 1st degree, which was the highest Soviet award at that time.<ref>Georg Trogemann; Alexander Nitussov, Wolfgang Ernst, eds. (2001) ''Computing in Russia: The History of Computer Devices and Information Technology Revealed.'' Braunschweig and Wiesbaden: Vieweg & Sohn Verlagsgesellsschaft mbH,. p. 150.</ref>

Between 1956 and 1969, Rameyev designed and oversaw the manufacturing of 14 different computers including: the multi-purpose "[[Ural]]" computer series and the specialized machines “Weather” (“Погода”) , "Crystal" (“Кристалл”), "Granite" (“Гранит”), and “Coordinate” (“Координата”).<ref>Л.Н. Ефремов. (1985). ''Справка об изобретательной деятельности Рамеева Башира Искандаровича. Архив Московского Политехнического Музея.'' Стр.2.</ref> Rameyev's "famous computer family '[[Ural]]' existed more than 15 years and had good chances to be one of the corner stones of future Russian computer engineering".<ref>Georg Trogemann; Alexander Nitussov, Wolfgang Ernst, eds. (2001) ''Computing in Russia: The History of Computer Devices and Information Technology Revealed.'' Braunschweig and Wiesbaden: Vieweg & Sohn Verlagsgesellsschaft mbH,. p. 151.</ref>

Rameyev's mother died when he was two. His father was targeted by the Soviets and perished in [[labor camp]]s during [[Stalinist purges]]. <ref>Борис Николаевич Малиновский. (1995). ''История Вычислительной Техники в Лицах.'' Киев: Фирма Кит, ПТОО А.С.К., стр. 237.</ref> This branded Rameyev, who was by then a sophomore at the [[Moscow Power Engineering Institute]], as a son of “the [[enemy of the people]]”. As a result, he faced coarse, overt and systematic discrimination, which began with university expulsion and job rejections and lasted until the breakout of [[WWII]]. <ref>Малиновский. (1995). Ibid, стр. 238.</ref>Despite his impeccable record of service in the [[Soviet Army]] during WWII, Rameyev encountered the same unfounded discrimination when he returned from the front. As the last resort, he wrote a letter to [[Stalin]] asking for help. Instead of helpful intervention, he was summoned to a phone call with a bureaucrat who told him “to live quietly and to not write again”.<ref>Малиновский. (1995). Ibid.</ref> It is then, at the age of 29, that Rameyev realized that he had to do something extraordinary good for his country to prove that he and his family were not “the enemies of the people”.
