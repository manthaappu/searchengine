The '''''G'''rid enabled '''R'''emote '''I'''nstrumentation with '''D'''istributed '''C'''ontrol and '''C'''omputation'' ('''GRIDCC''') is a project funded by the [[European Community]], aimed to provide access to and control of distributed complex instrumentation.
The goal of GRIDCC is to exploit grid opportunities for the secure and collaborative work of distributed teams, in order to remotely operate and monitor scientific equipment using the grid’s massive memory and computing resources for storing and processing data generated by this kind of equipment.

[[Image:GRIDCC_Services.jpg|thumb|right|250px|GRIDCC Services]]

# '''[[Virtual Control Room]] (VCR)''': Provides a common set of collaboration tools and allows users to build complex workflows, which are then submitted to the Execution Services, and to directly monitor and control remote instruments in real-time.
# '''Compute Elements (CE)''' and '''Storage Elements (SE)''': Provide access to computing and storage resources, which are common place in [[Grid computing|Grid]] infrastructures.
# '''Execution Services (ES)''': They control the execution of the workflows defined by the user in the VCR, maintaining the status of the tasks that make up the workflow. Also, they support the advance reservation of resources. This information is passed to the user in the VCR upon request.
# '''Problem Solver (PS)''': Offers automated problem solving in a [[Grid computing|Grid]] environment at two levels. The first, local to a given Instrument Element, allows to solve problems related to functionalities of a given instrument. The second, which is global, allows to solve system-wide problems.
# '''Security Services (SS'''): GRIDCC uses a split security system. When interacting with components of other [[Grid computing|Grids]] the GSI security will be used and the users identified by their [[X.509]] proxy certificate. When interacting with the IE the user will be identified by a [[Kerberos protocol|Kerberos]] ticket.
# '''Information Service (IS'''): It stores information about resources and provides such information to the ES and VCR to discover available and appropriate resources.
# '''Monitoring Service (MS)''': This service uses a publish/subscribe system to disseminate monitoring data. Candidates include RGMA, [http://www.naradabrokering.org/ NaradaBrokering], [[Java Message Service|Sun Message Queue-JMS]], [[Globus project|Globus]] Toolkit 4.0 WSRF and IBM RMM-JMS.
# '''[[Instrument Element]] (IE'''): This is a unique concept to GRIDCC. It consists of a coherent collection of services which provide all the functionality to configure, partition and control the physical instrument. In other words we define the term ‘Instrument Element’ (IE) as a set of services that provides the needed interface and implementation that enables the remote control and monitoring of physical instruments. The IE needs to be really flexible; in the simplest scenario this abstraction can represent a simple geospatial sensor or an FPGA card that performs a specific function, while in a more complex network of sensors it can be used as a bridge between the sensors and the computational grid. Finally, the IE can be part of the device instrumentation, permitting the organisation of the instrument into a network that allows grid interaction.
