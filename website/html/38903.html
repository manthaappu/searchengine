'''Universal Home API''', or UHAPI, is an [[application programming interface]] (API) for consumer electronics appliances, created by the [[UHAPI Forum]]. The objective of UHAPI is to enable standard [[middleware]] to run on audio/video streaming platforms via a hardware-independent industry standard API. UHAPI is complementary to most operating systems just as [[VxWorks]], [[pSOS]], [[eCos]] and [[Linux]]. UHAPI is currently being proposed as Audio/Video Streaming API in the CE Linux Forum ([[CELF]]) [http://www.celinuxforum.org]. 

The UHAPI Forum was established in November 2004 by [[Samsung]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Philips]], [[Access Co.|Access Co. Ltd.]] and the Digital TV Industry Alliance of China ([[DTVIA]]). It released the UHAPI 1.0 spec in January 2005, targeting Analogue TV, Digital TV and Set Top Box applications. In January 2006, the UHAPI 1.1 specification was released, which added - among others - PVR functionality. Currently, work is in progress to define APIs to support Digital Media Adaptors.
