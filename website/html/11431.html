'''EMBRACE''' (A European Model for Bioinformatics Research and Community Education) is a project with the objective of drawing together a wide group of experts throughout [[European Union|Europe]] who are involved in the use of information technology in the [[biomolecule|biomolecular]] sciences. The EMBRACE Network of Excellence will optimise informatics and information exploitation by pure and applied biological scientists in both the academic and commercial sectors.<ref>{{cite web

The EMBRACE network will work to integrate the major databases and software tools in [[bioinformatics]], using existing methods and emerging Grid service technologies. The integration efforts will be driven by an expanding set of test problems representing key issues for bioinformatics service providers and end-user biologists. As a result, groups throughout Europe will be able to use the EMBRACE service interfaces for their own local or proprietary data and tools. 

EMBRACE makes many ready-to-go [[bioinformatics]] [[web services]] freely available to the international research community.

The project is run from the [[European Bioinformatics Institute|EBI]] in [[Hinxton]], [[England]].  Fred Marcus is its [[EU]] project coordinator.

The EMBRACE project is funded by the [[European Commission]] within its FP6 Programme, under the thematic area "Life sciences, genomics and biotechnology for health", contract number LHSG-CT-2004-512092.
