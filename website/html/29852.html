<html> <head> <title>Prefix header</title></head><body>In [[computer programming]], a '''prefix [[header]]''' is a feature found in some [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[C++]] [[compilers]] used to simplify code and/or to reduce compilation time.

== Overview ==

In the [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] programming languages, a [[header file]] is a [[computer file|file]] whose text is automatically included in another source file by the [[compiler]], usually by the use of [[compiler directive]]s at the beginning of the source file. A prefix header differs from a normal header file in that it is ''automatically'' included at the beginning of every source file by the compiler, without the use of any compiler directives.

Prefix headers are usually [[precompiled header|pre-compiled]] in order to reduce compilation times.

== Example ==

On [[Mac OS X]], the [[Xcode]] build system generates prefix headers automatically for new projects. A new [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] project, for instance, gets a prefix header that looks like this:

<source lang="objc">
#ifdef __OBJC__
    #import <Cocoa/Cocoa.h>
#endif
</source>

As a result, it is unnecessary to explicitly include any of the above files in any [[Objective-C]] code in the program, although doing so is harmless, in the case of Objective-C because of the semantics of the <code>#import</code> directive, but more generally with <code>#include</code> because of the use of [[include guard]]s.

Similar prefix headers are generated for other types of project.
