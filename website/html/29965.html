'''Print screen''' (often abbreviated '''Prt Scr''', '''Print Scrn''', '''Prt Scn''', '''Prt Sc''', '''Prt Scrn''', or '''Prnt Scrn''') is a key present on most [[Keyboard (computing)|PC keyboard]]s. It is typically situated in the same section as the [[break key]] and [[scroll lock]] key. The print screen may share the same key as [[system request]].

==Original use==

Under [[Command line interface|command-line]] based [[operating system]]s such as [[MS-DOS]], this key causes the contents of the current [[text mode]] [[Computer display|screen]] memory buffer to be copied to the standard printer [[Computer port (hardware)|port]], usually [[LPT]]1. In essence, whatever is currently on the screen when the key was pressed (as long as it is text) was printed. There is also a [[Unicode]] character “Print Screen Symbol”, U+2399:
:<span style="font-size: 48pt; line-height: 1.3">{{Unicode|&#x2399;}}</span>

== Modern use ==
Newer-generation operating systems using a [[GUI|graphical interface]] tend to copy a [[bitmap]] image of the current screen to their [[Clipboard (software)|clipboard]] or comparable storage area, which can be inserted into documents as a [[screenshot]]. Some [[shell (computing)|shells]] allow modification of the exact behavior using modifier keys such as the [[control key]].

In [[Microsoft Windows]], pressing print screen will capture the entire screen, while pressing the [[alt key]] in combination with print screen will capture the currently selected window. With alt printscreen on Windows XP Pro only the monitor area is copied rather than the true window. The captured image can then be [[Cut and paste|pasted]] into an editing program such as a [[word processor]], [[email]], or [[graphics software]]. On keyboards that have an [[F Lock]] key, you may have to press F Lock first. Pressing print screen, with both the left alt key and left [[shift key]] pressed, turns on a high contrast mode for people with [[visual impairment]]s.

In [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]] [[desktop environment]]s, print screen behavior is similar to that of Microsoft Windows by default. However, a window will additionally pop up, prompting to save the screenshot to a file (in the [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] format by default).

==Print screen, screen capture on Macintosh==

[[Macintosh]] does not use a print screen key.  Instead key combinations are used that start with [[Command key|command]] - [[Shift key| shift]].  The key combinations are used to provide more advanced functionality including the ability to select screen objects.

=="Windows-like" print screen function on Macintosh==

Unlike [[Microsoft_Windows|Windows]], the standard print screen functions described above save the image to the [[Desktop metaphor|desktop]], rather than to the [[Clipboard (software)|clipboard]]. However, using any of the key sequences described above, but additionally pressing the '''[[control key]]''' will modify the behavior to copy the image to the system [[Clipboard (software)|clipboard]] instead.

For example : '''[[Command key|command]]-[[Shift key|shift]]-[[control key]]-[[3 (number)|3]]'''  or ''[[Command key|command]]-[[Shift key|shift]]-[[control key]]-[[4 (number)|4]]'''
