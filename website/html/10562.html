'''Microsoft DirectX''' is a collection of [[application programming interface]]s (APIs) for handling tasks related to [[multimedia]], especially [[game programming]] and video, on [[Microsoft]] platforms. Originally, the names of these APIs all began with Direct, such as [[Direct3D]], [[DirectDraw]], [[DirectMusic]], [[DirectPlay]], [[DirectSound]], and so forth. The name Direct''X'' was coined as shorthand term for all of these APIs (the X standing in for the particular API names) and soon became the name of the collection. When Microsoft later set out to develop a gaming console, the X was used as the basis of the name [[Xbox]] to indicate that the console was based on DirectX technology.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5037/is_200511/ai_n18254735/ The meaning of Xbox; Microsoft.(Xbox 360) | Economist (US), The]</ref> The X initial has been carried forward in the naming of APIs designed for the Xbox such as [[XInput]] and the [[Cross-platform Audio Creation Tool]] (XACT), while the DirectX pattern has been continued for Windows APIs such as [[Direct2D]] and [[DirectWrite]].

Direct3D (the 3D graphics API within DirectX) is widely used in the development of [[video game]]s for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox]], and Microsoft [[Xbox 360]]. Direct3D is also used by other software applications for visualization and graphics tasks such as CAD/CAM engineering. As Direct3D is the most widely publicized component of DirectX, it is common to see the names "DirectX" and "Direct3D" used interchangeably.

The DirectX [[software development kit|software development kit (SDK)]] consists of [[runtime library|runtime libraries]] in redistributable binary form, along with accompanying documentation and [[header file|headers]] for use in coding. Originally, the runtimes were only installed by games or explicitly by the user. [[Windows 95]] did not launch with DirectX, but DirectX was included with Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2.<ref>[http://www.computerhope.com/directx.htm DirectX Help<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Windows 98]] and [[Windows NT 4.0]] both shipped with DirectX, as has every version of Windows released since. The SDK is available as a free download. While the runtimes are proprietary, closed-source software, source code is provided for most of the SDK samples.

Direct3D 9Ex, Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 11 are only available for [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]] because each of these new versions were built to depend upon the new [[Windows Display Driver Model]] that was introduced for Windows Vista. The new Vista/WDDM graphics architecture includes a new video memory manager that supports virtualizing graphics hardware to multiple applications and services such as the [[Desktop Window Manager]].

==History==
[[Image:DxDiag 4.06.02.0436 showing DirectX 1.0.png|thumb|271px|[[DxDiag]] from DirectX 6.1 (4.06.02.0436) running on<br/>[[Windows 95]] and DirectX 1.0]]

In late 1994 Microsoft was on the verge of releasing its next [[operating system]], [[Windows 95]]. The main factor that would determine the value consumers would place on their new operating system very much rested on what programs would be able to run on it. Three Microsoft employees – Craig Eisler, [[Alex St. John]], and Eric Engstrom – were concerned because [[game programmer|programmers]] tended to see Microsoft's previous operating system, [[MS-DOS]], as a better platform for game programming, meaning few games would be developed for Windows 95 and the operating system would not be as much of a success.
 		 
DOS allowed direct access to video cards, [[computer keyboard|keyboards]], [[computer mouse|mice]], [[sound card|sound devices]], and all other parts of the system, while Windows 95, with its protected memory model, restricted access to all of these, working on a much more standardized model. Microsoft needed a way that would let programmers get what they wanted, and they needed it quickly; the operating system was only months away from being released. Eisler (development lead), St. John, and Engstrom (program manager) worked together to fix this problem, with a solution that they eventually named DirectX.
 		 
The first version of DirectX was released in September 1995 as the Windows Games SDK. It was the [[Windows API|Win32]] replacement for the DCI<ref>[http://stason.org/TULARC/pc/video-faq/54-What-is-DCI.html What is DCI?]</ref> and [[WinG]] APIs for [[Windows 3.1]]. Simply put, DirectX allowed all versions of Microsoft Windows, starting with Windows 95, to incorporate high-performance multimedia. Eisler wrote about the frenzy to build DirectX 1 through 5 in his blog.<ref>[http://craig.theeislers.com/2006/02/directx_then_and_now_part_1.php Craig Eisler's blog post about the frenzy to build DirectX 1 through 5] on craig.theeislers.com</ref>  

DirectX 2.0 became a component of Windows itself with the releases of [[Windows 95]] OSR2 and  [[Windows NT 4.0]] in mid-1996.  As Windows 95 was itself still new and few games had been released for it, Microsoft engaged in heavy promotion of DirectX to developers who were generally distrustful of Microsoft's ability to build a gaming platform in Windows.  Alex St. John, working as an evangelist for DirectX, staged an elaborate event at the 1996 [[Game Developers Conference|Computer Game Developers Conference]] which game developer [[Jay Barnson]] described as a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] theme, including real [[lion]]s, togas, and something resembling an indoor carnival.<ref>{{cite web

|title=Wildest Birthday Party EVER
|author=Jay Barnson
|date=July 13, 2006
}}</ref>  It was at this event that Microsoft first introduced [[Direct3D]] and [[DirectPlay]], and demonstrated multi-player [[MechWarrior 2]] being played over the Internet.

The DirectX team faced the challenging task of testing each DirectX release against an array of hardware and software.  A variety of different graphics cards, audio cards, motherboards, CPUs, input devices, games, and other multimedia applications were tested with each beta and final release. The DirectX team also built and distributed tests that allowed the hardware industry to confirm that new hardware designs and driver releases would be compatible with DirectX.

Prior to DirectX, Microsoft had included [[OpenGL]] on their [[Windows NT]] platform.<ref>{{cite web|title=Windows NT 3.51 Product Overview|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/124814|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=16 September 2010|date=31 October 2006 }}</ref> At the time, [[OpenGL]] required "high-end" hardware and was focused on [[engineering]] and [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] uses.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Direct3D was intended to be a lightweight partner to OpenGL, focused on game use. As 3D gaming grew, OpenGL evolved to include better support for programming techniques for interactive multimedia applications like games, giving developers choice between using OpenGL or Direct3D as the 3D graphics API for their applications. At that point a "battle" began between supporters of the cross-platform OpenGL and the Windows-only Direct3D. Incidentally, OpenGL was supported at Microsoft by the DirectX team.  If a developer chose to use OpenGL 3D graphics API, the other APIs of DirectX are often combined with OpenGL in [[computer games]] because OpenGL does not include all of DirectX's functionality (such as sound or joystick support).

In a console-specific version, DirectX was used as a basis for Microsoft's [[Xbox]] and [[Xbox 360]] [[video game console|console]] API. The API was developed jointly between Microsoft and [[Nvidia]], who developed the custom graphics hardware used by the original Xbox. The Xbox API is similar to DirectX version 8.1, but is non-updateable like other console technologies. The Xbox was code named DirectXbox, but this was shortened to Xbox for its commercial name.<ref>J. Allard, [http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/55995/games-interview-xbox-supremo-allard-on-the-future-of-microsofts-console-part-ii.html PC Pro Interview], April 2004</ref>

In 2002 Microsoft released DirectX 9 with support for the use of much longer shader programs than before with pixel and vertex shader version 2.0. Microsoft has continued to update the DirectX suite since then, introducing shader model 3.0 in DirectX 9.0c, released in August 2004. 	 
		 
As of April 2005, [[DirectShow]] was removed from DirectX and moved to the [[Microsoft Platform SDK]] instead. The DirectX SDK is, however, still required to build the DirectShow samples.<ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/sdk/readmepage/default.aspx DirectX SDK Release Notes] on [[MSDN]]</ref>

;Notes:

# DirectX 4 was never released. [[Raymond Chen]] explained in his book, ''The Old New Thing'', that after DirectX 3 was released, Microsoft began developing versions 4 and 5 at the same time. Version 4 was to be a shorter-term release with small features, whereas version 5 would be a more substantial release. The lack of interest from game developers in the features stated for DirectX 4 resulted in it being shelved, and the corpus of documents that already distinguished the two new versions resulted in Microsoft choosing to not re-use version 4 to describe features intended for version 5.<ref>{{cite book

The logo originally resembled a deformed [[Hazard symbol#Radioactive sign|radiation warning symbol]]. Controversially, the original name for the DirectX project was the "Manhattan Project", a reference to the [[Manhattan Project|US nuclear weapons initiative]]. [[Alex St. John]], creator of the original Microsoft DirectX specification, claims that the connotation with the ultimate outcome of the Manhattan Project (the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear bombing of Japan]]) is intentional, and that DirectX and its sister project, the [[Xbox]] (which shares a similar logo), are meant to displace Japanese videogame makers from their dominance of the industry.<ref name="stjohn">{{cite web | url=http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=283&page=2 | title=Alex St John Interview, page 2 | author=David Craddock | work=Shack News | month=March | year=2007 | accessdate=2008-06-03}}</ref> However, this meaning is publicly denied by Microsoft, which instead claims that it is merely artistic design.<ref name="stjohn"/>

==Components==
The components of DirectX are
*'''
*[[DirectDraw]]: for drawing 2D Graphics ([[raster graphics]]). Now deprecated (in favor of [[Direct2D]]), though still in use by a number of games and as a video renderer in media applications.
*[[Microsoft Direct3D|Direct3D]] (D3D): for drawing [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].
*[[DXGI]]: for enumerating adapters and monitors and managing swap chains for Direct3D 10 and up.
*[[Direct2D]] for 2D Graphics
*[[DirectWrite]] for Fonts
*[[DirectCompute]] for [[GPU]] Computing
*[[DirectInput]]: for interfacing with input devices including [[computer keyboard|keyboards]], [[computer mouse|mice]], [[joystick]]s, or other [[game controller]]s. Deprecated after version 8 in favor of [[XInput]] for [[Xbox 360]] controllers or standard [[WM INPUT]] window message processing for keyboard and mouse input.
*[[DirectPlay]]: for communication over a local-area or wide-area network. Deprecated after version 8.
*[[DirectSound]]: for the playback and recording of waveform sounds.
**[[DirectSound3D]] (DS3D): for the playback of [[3D audio effect|3D sounds]].
*[[DirectMusic]]: for playback of soundtracks authored in [[DirectMusic|DirectMusic Producer]].
*[[DirectX Media]]: comprising DirectAnimation for 2D/3D<ref>[http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~RB6K-IID/space.html 3D Animation of SPACE FIGHTER by DIRECT ANIMATION]</ref> web animation, [[DirectShow]] for multimedia playback and [[streaming media]], DirectX Transform for web interactivity, and Direct3D Retained Mode for higher level 3D graphics. DirectShow contains [[DirectX plugin]]s for [[audio signal processing]] and [[DXVA|DirectX Video Acceleration]] for accelerated video playback.
*DirectX Diagnostics (DxDiag): a tool for diagnosing and generating reports on components related to DirectX, such as audio, video, and input drivers.
*[[DirectX Media Objects]]: support for streaming objects such as encoders, decoders, and effects.
*DirectSetup: for the installation of DirectX components, and the detection of the current DirectX version.

DirectX functionality is provided in the form of [[Component Object Model|COM]]-style objects and interfaces. Additionally, while not DirectX components themselves, [[Managed code|managed]] objects have been built on top of some parts of DirectX, such as Managed Direct3D<ref>[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc164112.aspx Introducing the New Managed Direct3D Graphics API in the .NET Framework]</ref> and the XNA graphics library<ref>[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.graphics.aspx Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics namespace]</ref> on top of Direct3D 9.

===DirectX 10===
{{See also|Direct3D#Direct3D 10|Direct3D#Direct3D and Vista|List of games with DirectX 10 support|l1=Direct3D 10|l2=Direct3D and Vista}}
[[File:DirectX10 logo.png|DirectX 10 Logo|thumb]]
A major update to DirectX API, DirectX 10 ships with and is only available with [[Windows Vista]] and later; previous versions of Windows such as Windows XP are not able to officially run DirectX 10-exclusive applications. Rather, programs that are run on a Windows XP system with DirectX 10 simply resort to using the code from DirectX 9.0c, the latest version for Windows XP computers.<ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb219721.aspx#Will_DirectX_10_be_available_for_Windows_XP DirectX Frequently Asked Questions]</ref> There are unofficial ports of DirectX 10 to XP.<ref>[http://www.techmixer.com/download-directx-10-for-windows-xp/ Download DirectX 10 for Windows XP] TechMixer</ref> [[Features new to Windows Vista#DirectX|Changes for DirectX 10]] were extensive.

Many former parts of DirectX API were deprecated in the latest DirectX SDK and will be preserved for compatibility only: [[DirectInput]] was deprecated in favor of [[XInput]], [[DirectSound]] was deprecated in favor of the [[Cross-platform Audio Creation Tool]] system (XACT) and lost support for hardware accelerated audio, since [[Technical features new to Windows Vista#Audio|Vista audio stack]] renders sound in software on the CPU. The DirectPlay DPLAY.DLL was also removed and was replaced with dplayx.dll; games that rely on this DLL must duplicate it and rename it to dplay.dll.

In order to achieve backwards compatibility, DirectX in Windows Vista contains several versions of Direct3D:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee417756.aspx | title=Graphics APIs in Windows | author=Chuck Walbourn | month=August | year=2009 | work=MSDN | accessdate=2009-10-03}}</ref>

*'''Direct3D 9''': emulates Direct3D 9 behavior as it was on Windows XP. Details and advantages of Vista's [[Windows Display Driver Model]] are hidden from the application if WDDM drivers are installed. This is the only API available if there are only XP graphic drivers (XDDM) installed, after an upgrade to Vista for example.

This help keep backwards compatibility to previous versions of DirectX.

Microsoft released the Final Platform Update for Windows Vista on October 27, 2009, which was 5 days after the initial release of Windows 7 (launched with Direct3D 11 as a base standard).

==Compatibility==
Various releases of Windows have included and supported various versions of DirectX, allowing newer versions of the operating system to continue running applications designed for earlier versions of DirectX until those versions can be gradually phased out in favor of newer APIs, drivers, and hardware.

APIs such as Direct3D and DirectSound need to interact with hardware, and they do this through a [[device driver]]. [[Hardware]] manufacturers have to write these drivers for a particular DirectX version's device driver interface (or DDI), and test each individual piece of hardware to make them DirectX compatible. Some hardware devices have only DirectX compatible drivers (in other words, one must install DirectX in order to use that hardware). Early versions of DirectX included an up-to-date library of all of the DirectX compatible drivers currently available. This practice was stopped however, in favor of the web-based [[Windows Update]] driver-update system, which allowed users to download only the drivers relevant to their hardware, rather than the entire library.

Prior to DirectX 10, DirectX runtime was designed to be ''backward compatible'' with older drivers, meaning that newer versions of the APIs were designed to interoperate with older drivers written against a previous version's DDI. The application programmer had to query the available hardware capabilities using a complex system of "cap bits" each tied to a particular hardware feature. For example, a game designed for and running on Direct3D 9 with a graphics adapter driver designed for Direct3D 6 would still work, albeit most likely with degraded functionality.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

However, the Direct3D 10 runtime in Windows Vista cannot run on older hardware drivers due to the significantly updated DDI, which requires a unified feature set and abandons the use of "cap bits".

Direct3D 11 runtime introduces Direct3D 9, 10, and 10.1 "feature levels", compatibility modes which allow use of only the hardware features defined in the specified version of Direct3D. For Direct3D 9 hardware, there are three different feature levels, grouped by common capabilities of "low", "med" and "high-end" video cards; the runtime directly uses Direct3D 9 DDI provided in all WDDM drivers.

==.NET Framework==
In 2002 Microsoft released a version of DirectX compatible with the Microsoft [[.NET Framework]], thus allowing programmers to take advantage of DirectX functionality from within .NET applications using compatible languages such as managed C++ or the use of the [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] programming language. This API was known as "[[Managed DirectX]]" (or MDX for short), and claimed to operate at 98% of performance of the underlying native DirectX APIs. In December 2005, February 2006, April 2006, and August 2006, Microsoft released successive updates to this library, culminating in a beta version called Managed DirectX 2.0. While Managed DirectX 2.0 consolidated functionality that had previously been scattered over multiple assemblies into a single assembly, thus simplifying dependencies on it for software developers, development on this version has subsequently been discontinued, and it is no longer supported. The Managed DirectX 2.0 library expired on October 5, 2006.

During the [[Game Developers Conference|GDC]] 2006 Microsoft presented the [[Microsoft XNA|XNA Framework]], a new managed version of DirectX (similar but not identical to Managed DirectX) that is intended to assist development of games by making it easier to integrate DirectX, [[High Level Shader Language]] (HLSL) and other tools in one package. It also supports the execution of managed code on the Xbox 360. The XNA Game Studio Express RTM was made available on December 11, 2006, as a free download for Windows XP. Unlike the DirectX runtime, [[Managed DirectX]], [[Microsoft XNA|XNA Framework]] or the [[Xbox 360]] APIs (XInput, XACT etc.) have not shipped as part of Windows. Developers are expected to redistribute the runtime components along with their games or applications.

No Microsoft product including the latest XNA releases provides DirectX 10 support for the .NET Framework.

The other approach for DirectX in managed languages is to use third-party libraries like [[SlimDX]] for Direct3D. [http://code.google.com/p/sharpdx/ SharpDX], DirectInput (including Direct3D 10), [http://sourceforge.net/projects/directshownet Direct Show .NET] for DirectShow subset or [http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/WindowsAPICodePack Windows API CodePack for .NET Framework] which is an open source library from Microsoft.

==Alternatives==
{{Expand section|date=September 2010}}
<!--what api is better? more common? etc... User:mabdul-->
There are alternatives to the DirectX family of [[API]]s, with [[OpenGL]] having the most features. Examples of other APIs include [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]], [[Allegro library|Allegro]], [[OpenMAX]], [[OpenML]], [[OpenAL]], [[OpenCL]], [[FMOD]], etc. Many of these libraries are cross-platform or have open codebases.

There are also alternative implementations that aim to provide the same API, such as the one in [[Wine (software)|Wine]].

The developers of [[ReactOS]] are trying to reinvent DirectX with the same features and calling it [[ReactX]].
