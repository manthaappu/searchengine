'''expr''' is a [[command line interface|command line]] [[Unix]] utility which evaluates an [[expression (mathematics)|expression]] and outputs the corresponding value.

Syntax:  expr ''(expression)''

''expr'' evaluates [[integer]] or [[String (computer science)|string]] expressions, including pattern matching [[regular expression]]s.  Most of the challenge posed in writing expressions is preventing the command line shell from acting on characters intended for ''expr'' to process.

The operators available
* for integers:  addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus
* for strings:  find substring, find regular expression, find a set of characters in a string, length of string
* for either:  comparison (equal, not equal, less than, etc.)
Also, [[Boolean logic|boolean]] expressions involving ''and'' and ''or'', such as
 expr length  "abcdef"  "<"  5  "|"  15  -  4  ">"  8
outputs "1".  This is because length "abcdef"  is 6, which is not less than 5 (so the left side of the | returns zero).  But 15 minus 4 is 11 and is greater than 8, so the right side is true, which makes the ''or'' true, so 1 is the result. The program exit status is zero for this example.

For pure arithmetic, it may be more convenient to use [[Bc_programming_language|bc]], e.g.
 echo "3*4+14/2" | bc
since it accepts the expression as a single argument.
