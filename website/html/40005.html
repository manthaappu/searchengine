A '''weighted network''' is a network where the ties among nodes have weights assigned to them. A [[Network (mathematics)|network]] is a system whose elements are somehow connected (Wasserman and Faust, 1994)<ref>Wasserman, S., Faust, K., 1994. Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications. Cambridge University Press, New York, NY.</ref>. The elements of a system are represented as nodes (also known as actors or vertices) and the connections among interacting elements are known as ties, edges, arcs, or links. The nodes might be neurons, individuals, groups, organisations, airports, or even countries, whereas ties can take the form of friendship, communication, collaboration, alliance, flow, or trade, to name a few.

In a number of real-world networks, not all ties in a network have the same capacity. In fact, ties are often associated with weights that differentiate them in terms of their strength, intensity or capacity (Barrat et al., 2004)<ref name="barrat04">{{Cite journal

American Journal of Sociology 78(6), 1360-1380</ref> argued that the strength of social relationships in [[social networks]] is a function of their duration, emotional intensity, intimacy, and exchange of services. On the other, for non-social networks, weights often refer to the function performed by ties, e.g., the carbon flow (mg/m²/day) between species in [[food webs]] (Luczkowich et al., 2003)<ref>Luczkowich, J.J., Borgatti, S.P., Johnson, J.C., Everett, M.G., 2003.

By [http://toreopsahl.com/2009/02/06/operationalisation-of-tie-strength/ recording the strength of ties], a weighted network can be created (also known as a valued network). Below is an example of such a network:

==Measures for weighted networks==
Although weighted networks are more difficult to analyse than if ties were simply present or absent, a number of network measures has been proposed for weighted networks:
* Node degree: The sum of weights attached to ties belonging to a node (Barrat et al., 2004)<ref name="barrat04" />
* Closeness: Redefined by using Dijkstra's distance algorithm (Newman, 2001)<ref>{{Cite journal

==Software for analysing weighted networks==
There are a number of software packages that can analyse weighted networks, see [[Social network analysis software]]. Among these are the proprietary software UCINET and the open-source package [http://opsahl.co.uk/tnet tnet].
