<html> <head> <title>Semelfactive</title></head><body>'''Semelfactives''' are a class of [[aktionsart]] or verbal [[aspect (linguistics)|aspect]] that deal with events that are instantaneous (momentive, or [[punctual]]).  It is a type of [[perfective]] aspect that is [[lexical]] rather than grammatical.  

An English example of a semelfactive aktionsart verb (a verb describing an action that only occurs once by [[semantic]] definition) is ''blink''. 
 
Semelfactives were posited as a fifth class of aktionsart by [[Bernard Comrie]] (1976) <ref>Carlota Smith, The parameter of aspect, Kluwer 1991</ref>.  
States (e.g. "know"), activities or processes (e.g. "run"), and accomplishments ("paint a picture") are seen as durative, while semelfactives and achievements (e.g. "recognize") are punctual. Like achievements and accomplishments, semelfactives are viewed as [[telic]], i.e. having a fixed end point.

Semelfactives, as a lexical aspect, is proposed by Carlotta S. Smith in 1991. According to Smith, semelfactives are instantaneous atelic events, e.g. [knock], [cough]. Atelic refers to those processes which are seen not having a natural completion.
