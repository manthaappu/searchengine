'''GameSWF''' ''(pronounced "game swiff")'' is an [[open source]] [[public domain]] [[Library (computing)|library]] for parsing and rendering [[SWF]] movies, using 3D hardware APIs for rendering. It is designed to be used as a [[User interface|UI]] library for [[Personal computer game|computer]] and [[console games]].

It is written in [[C++]], and compiles under [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Linux]], using [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] and [[MSVC]]. It includes code for rendering with [[OpenGL]]. The rendering module is factored out so that the code can ported to other [[Application programming interface|APIs]]. 

GameSWF is used by other open source projects such as [[Gnash]]. It is also used in [[Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath]] [http://www.tulrich.com/geekstuff/gameswf_stranger_postmortem.html] and many [[Gameloft]] games to display user interface screens and menus such as the player's inventory.
