'''ESET NOD32 Antivirus''', commonly known as '''NOD32''', is an [[antivirus software|antivirus]] [[software]] package made by the [[Slovakia|Slovak]] company [[ESET]].

==History==
===ESET NOD32 Antivirus===
NOD32 was created in the early 1990s when [[computer virus]]es were becoming increasingly prevalent.

Initially the program gained popularity with IT workers in Eastern European countries, as ESET was based in Slovakia. Though the program's abbreviation was originally pronounced as individual letters, recent worldwide use of the program has led to the more common single-word pronunciation, sounding like the English word ''nod''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderssecurity.com/showthread.php?t=25585 |title=NOD32 - What does it mean? - Wilders Security Forums |publisher=Wilderssecurity.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-10}}</ref> The company reached its 5000th update to virus definitions on April 5, 2010.

The acronym NOD stands for ''Nemocnica na Okraji Disku'' ("Hospital at the end of the disk"), a pun related to the [[Czechoslovakia]]n [[medical drama]] series ''[[Hospital at the End of the City|Nemocnice na okraji města]]'' (''Hospital at the End of the City'').
