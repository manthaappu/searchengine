'''Vector NTI''' is a [[bioinformatics]] software package. Until Dec 15, 2008 it was free to academic, governmental, and non-profit researchers. From version 11, free license was no longer supported. The current versions are v11 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]/PCs and v7.1 for Macs, but only supporting [[Mac OS X v10.3]] (Panther).  
== Features ==

* create, annotate, analyse, and share [[DNA]]/[[protein]] sequences
* perform and save [[BLAST]] searches
* design [[primer (molecular biology)|primers]] for [[PCR]], [[cloning]], [[sequencing]] or [[nucleic acid hybridization|hybridisation]] experiments
* plan cloning and run [[Gel electrophoresis|gels]] ''[[in silico]]'' 
* align multiple protein or DNA sequences
* search [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBIâ€™s]] [[Entrez]], view, and save DNAs, proteins, and citations
* edit [[chromatogram]] data, assemble into [[contigs]]
