In computing, a '''temporary folder''' or '''temporary directory''' is a [[directory (file systems)|directory]] used to hold [[temporary file]]s. Many [[operating system]]s and some [[software]] automatically delete the contents of this directory at [[booting|bootup]] or at regular intervals.

For [[Computer security|security]] reasons, it is best for each [[User (computing)|user]] to have his own temporary directory, since there has been a history of [[Vulnerability (computing)|security vulnerabilities]] with temporary files due to programs incorrect [[file permission]]s or [[Race hazard|race conditions]].

A standard procedure for [[system administration]] is to reduce the amount of storage space used (typically, on a disk drive) by removing temporary files. In multi-user systems, this can potentially remove ''active'' files, disrupting users' activities. To avoid this, some space-reclaiming procedures remove only files which are inactive or "old", those which have not been read or modified in several days.

==Traditional locations==
In [[MS-DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]], the temporary directory is set by the [[environment variable]] <tt>TEMP</tt>. Originally, the default was <tt>c:\Temp</tt>, then <tt>%Windows%\Temp</tt>. In modern versions, the temporary directory is set per-user as <tt>Local Settings\Temp</tt>, although it is still user-relocatable.

In [[Unix]] and [[Linux]], the global temporary directories are <tt>/tmp</tt> and <tt>/var/tmp</tt>.  Websites periodically write data to the tmp directory during page views and downloads. Typically, <tt>/var/tmp</tt> is for persistent files (as it may be preserved over reboots), and <tt>/tmp</tt> is for more temporary files. See [[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard]]. In addition, a user can set his [[TMPDIR]] [[environment variable]] to point to a preferred directory (where the creation and modification of files is [[File system permissions#Basic Permissions|allowed]]).
