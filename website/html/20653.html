<html> <head> <title>Kibibyte</title></head><body>The '''kibibyte''' is a multiple of the unit [[byte]] for quantities of digital [[information]]. The [[binary prefix]] ''[[kibi-|kibi]]'' means 1024, therefore 1 kibibyte is {{gaps|1024|bytes}}. The unit symbol for the kibibyte is '''KiB'''.<ref>{{cite web | author= International Electrotechnical Commission | title= Prefixes for binary multiples | url= http://www.iec.ch/zone/si/si_bytes.htm | date= 2007 | accessdate= 2007-05-06}}</ref>  The unit was established by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) in 1999<ref>International Electrotechnical Commission (January 1999), IEC 60027-2 ''Amendment 2: Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology - Part 2: Telecommunications and electronics''</ref> and has been accepted for use by all major standards organizations. It was designed to replace the [[kilobyte]] used in some computer science contexts to mean 1024 bytes, which conflicts with the SI definition of the prefix [[kilo-|kilo]].

{{Quantities of bytes}}

==Definition==
:1 kibibyte = 2<sup>10</sup> bytes = 1024 bytes.

The prefix ''kibi'' is derived as a [[portmanteau]] of the words kilo and binary, indicating its origin in the closeness in value to the [[SI prefix]] kilo (1000). While the SI prefix is written with lowercase ([[kilo-|k]]), the IEC prefix starts with an uppercase letter.

==History==
The kibibyte is closely related to the [[kilobyte]]. The latter may be used in some contexts as a synonym for the kibibyte, but formally refers to 10<sup>3</sup> bytes = 1000 bytes, as the prefix is defined in the [[International System of Units]].  

The binary interpretation of the metric prefixes causes relatively small differences with the smallest prefixes in the series, i.e. for kilo and mega, but grows to substantial differences beyond (see [[Binary_prefix#Deviation_between_powers_of_1024_and_powers_of_1000|Deviation between powers of 1024 and powers of 1000]]).

In ''[[Introduction to MMIX]]'', [[Donald Knuth]] proposed that this unit be called a ''large kilobyte'' (abbreviated ''KKB'')<ref name=kilobyte>{{cite web

}}</ref>.  Other early proposals included using the Greek lowercase letter [[Kappa|''κ'' (kappa)]] for 1024 bytes (and using ''k'' exclusively for 1000), ''bK'', ''KB'', and others. See [[Binary prefix#Early suggestions]].

Adoption of the binary prefixes has been limited, primarily being used in [[open source software]]. In most cases the kilobyte continues to be used to refer to a power of ten as well as a power of two.<ref name=lawsuit>{{cite web
