'''PR''' is the complexity class of all [[primitive recursive function]]s – or, equivalently, the set of all [[formal language]]s that can be decided by such a function. This includes addition, multiplication, exponentiation, tetration, etc.

The [[Ackermann function]] is an example of a function that is ''not'' primitive recursive, showing that '''PR''' is strictly contained in '''[[R (complexity)|R]]'''.

'''PR''' functions can be explicitly enumerated, whereas not all functions '''R''' can be.  This shows that ''''PR'''' has a ''syntactic'' definition, whereas ''R'' lacks one.

On the other hand, we can "enumerate" any [[recursively enumerable set]] (see also its complexity class '''[[RE (complexity)|RE]]''') by a primitive-recursive function in the following sense: given an input (''M'', ''k''), where ''M'' is a Turing machine and ''k'' is an integer, if ''M'' halts within ''k'' steps then output ''M''; otherwise output nothing.  Then the union of the outputs, over all possible inputs (''M'', ''k''), is exactly the set of ''M'' that halt.

'''PR''' strictly contains [[ELEMENTARY]].
