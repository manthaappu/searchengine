The system was born on Amiga Systems in 1987 and available on BBS program called Skyline BBS.<ref name=Skyline>{{Cite web| title = BBSDocumentary, An Overview of BBS Programs | url = http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/expanded.html | publisher=[[Jason Scott Sadofsky|Jason Scott]] for [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] Magazine (?) | author=Scott Lee | accessdate = 2005}} <blockquote>Scott Lee writes: "Skyline BBS, for the Amiga, was originally marketed under the name "Atredes BBS". It was written by someone named Michael Cox who lived in El Paso, TX in the mid/late 80s. He had contracted with a company, which I can't remember the name of, to market and sell the software and they did so under the name Atredes. Michael Cox eventually wound up selling the software himself and he renamed it Skyline. After about two years he grew tired of working on it and looked for a buyer. During that search, I did maintenance and housekeeping on the code for a few months before a user of the software that ran Omnilink BBS in Queens, NY bought the rights."
"It was, BTW, cool software which allowed for plain text, ANSI graphics, as well as a proprietary graphical point and click "SkyPix" UI using special terminal software ("SkyTerm"). This was all around the '87 time frame which I think pegs it as the first graphical point & click BBS UI..."</blockquote></ref>

Skypix was probably the world's first modern, fully interactive online graphics-and-sound [[Communications protocol|protocol]]. Released as part of the Atredes [[Bulletin Board System]] system (later renamed Skyline) in 1987, Skypix for the first time allowed BBS [[sysop]]s to run systems with graphics, fonts, mouse-controlled actions, animations and sound. It predated [[Mosaic]] - and thus the [[World Wide Web]] itself - by several years, though it had most of the same capabilities.

Technically a proprietary extension of [[ANSI]] codes, Skypix had a rich command set and featured the first "authoring program", Skypaint, which could generate Skypix files directly from a familiar-looking paint program. All a sysop had to do was insert these files in his system, and suddenly people with Skypix-enabled terminal programs were presented with a rich, completely interactive graphics interface, as opposed to the ANSI graphics that were the state of the art until then.

Skypix might have remained a curiosity if creator Michael Cox hadn't thought to include a programming interface. Sysops who were conversant with the [[ARexx]] language (a variant of [[REXX]] for the Amiga) could write games and other programs using Skypix graphics and include them anywhere in their systems. This resulted in an enthusiastic group of Skypix hobbyists and many firsts, from the world's first fully-graphical online chess games to the first online graphic adventure games, to the first online paint and photo galleries. These were widely traded and the average Skyline sysop had many of them on their systems.

Skypix was available only on the [[Amiga]] computer, running on the program [[Skyline]] over the BBS and from BBS service side and a terminal called [[Skyterm]] from the side of the customer. Amiga at that time was the only computer with sufficient graphics capabilities to make the project a reality. At one time over a thousand Skyline systems were operating the world over, thanks to the Amiga's international popularity. Amiga inventor [[Jay Miner]] himself ran a Skyline system for a time.
