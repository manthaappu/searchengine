<html> <head> <title>Metric space</title></head><body>In [[mathematics]], a '''metric space''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] where a notion of [[distance]] (called a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]) between elements of the set is defined.

The metric space which most closely corresponds to our intuitive understanding of space is the 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. In fact, the notion of "metric" is a generalization of the [[Euclidean metric]] arising from the four long-known properties of the Euclidean distance. The Euclidean metric  defines the distance between two points as the length of the [[Straight line|straight]] [[line segment]] connecting them.

The [[geometric properties]] of the space depend on the metric chosen, and by using a different metric we can construct interesting [[non-Euclidean geometries]] such as those used in the theory of [[general relativity]].

A metric space also induces [[topological properties]] like [[open set|open]] and [[closed set]]s which leads to the study of even more abstract [[topological space]]s.

== History ==
[[Maurice Fréchet]] introduced metric spaces in his work ''Sur quelques points du calcul fonctionnel'', Rendic. Circ. Mat. Palermo 22 (1906) 1–74.

== Definition ==
A '''metric space''' is an [[ordered pair]] <math>(M,d)</math> where <math>M</math> is a [[empty set|non-empty]] set and <math>d</math> is a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] on <math>M</math>, i.e., a function

:<math>d : M \times M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</math>

such that for any <math>x, y, z \in M</math>, the following holds:

# <math>d(x,y) \ge 0</math>     (''non-negativity'') ,
# <math>d(x,y) = 0</math> [[if and only if|iff]] <math>x = y</math>     (''[[identity of indiscernibles]]'') ,
# <math>d(x,y) = d(y,x)</math>     (''symmetry'') and
# <math>d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y,z)</math>     (''[[triangle inequality]]'') .

The first condition follows from the other three, since:
: <math>2d(x,y) = d(x,y) + d(y,x) \ge d(x,x) = 0.</math>

The function <math>d</math> is also called ''distance function'' or simply ''distance''. Often, <math>d</math> is omitted and one just writes <math>M</math> for a metric space if it is clear from the context what metric is used.

== Examples of metric spaces == <!-- [[Finite Metric space]] redirects here-->
* Ignoring mathematical details, for any system of roads and terrains the distance between two locations can be defined as the length of the shortest route connecting those locations. To be a metric there shouldn't be any one-way roads. The triangle inequality expresses the fact that detours aren't shortcuts. Many of the examples below can be seen as concrete versions of this general idea.
* The [[real number]]s with the distance function <math>d(x,y) = \vert y - x \vert</math> given by the [[absolute difference]], and more generally [[Euclidean space|Euclidean <math>n</math>-space]] with the [[Euclidean distance]], are [[complete space|complete]] metric spaces. The [[rational number]]s with the same distance also form a metric space, but are not complete.
* Any [[normed vector space]] is a metric space by defining <math>d(x,y) = \lVert y - x \rVert</math>, see also {{ml|Metric_%28mathematics%29|Relation_of_norms_and_metrics|relation of norms and metrics}}. (If such a space is complete, we call it a [[Banach space]]). Examples:
** the [[Norm (mathematics)#Taxicab norm or Manhattan norm|Manhattan norm]] gives rise to the [[Manhattan distance]], where the distance between any two points, or vectors, is the sum of the differences between corresponding coordinates.
** The [[maximum norm]] gives rise to the [[Chebyshev distance]] or chessboard distance, the minimal number of moves a [[king (chess)|chess king]] would take to travel from <math>x</math> to <math>y</math>.
* The [[British Rail]] metric (also called the [[Post Office]] metric or the [[SNCF]] metric) on a [[normed vector space]] is given by <math>d(x,y) = \lVert x \rVert + \lVert y \rVert</math> for distinct points <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>, and <math>d(x,x) = 0</math>. More generally <math>\lVert . \rVert</math> can be replaced with a function <math>f</math> taking an arbitrary set <math>S</math> to non-negative reals and taking the value <math>0</math> at most once:  then the metric is defined on <math>S</math> by <math>d(x,y) = f(x) + f(y)</math> for distinct points <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>, and <math>d(x,x) = 0</math>.  The name alludes to the tendency of railway journeys (or letters) to proceed via [[London]] (or [[Paris]]) irrespective of their final destination.
* If <math>(M,d)</math> is a metric space and <math>X</math> is a [[subset]] of <math>M</math>, then <math>X</math> becomes a metric space by restricting <math>d</math> to <math>X \times X</math>.
* The [[discrete metric]], where <math>d(x,y) = 0</math> if <math>x=y</math> and <math>d(x,y) = 1</math> otherwise, is a simple but important example, and can be applied to all non-empty sets. This, in particular, shows that for any non-empty set, there is always a metric space associated to it. Using this metric, any point is an [[open ball]], and therefore every subset is open and the space has the [[discrete topology]].
* A finite metric space is a metric space having a [[finite set|finite]] number of points.  Not every finite metric space can be [[isometric|isometrically]] embedded in a [[Euclidean space]].<ref>[[Nati Linial|Nathan Linial]]. [http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0304466 ''Finite Metric Spaces—Combinatorics, Geometry and Algorithms'', Proceedings of the ICM, Beijing 2002, vol. 3, pp573–586]</ref><ref>[http://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~matousek/metrop.ps''Open problems  on embeddings  of finite  metric  spaces'', edited by Jirīı Matoušek, 2007]</ref>
* The [[hyperbolic geometry#Models of the hyperbolic plane|hyperbolic plane]] is a metric space. More generally:
* If <math>M</math> is any [[connectedness|connected]] [[Riemannian manifold]], then we can turn <math>M</math> into a metric space by defining the distance of two points as the [[infimum]] of the lengths of the paths (continuously differentiable [[curve]]s) connecting them.
* If <math>X</math> is some set and <math>M</math> is a metric space, then the set of all [[bounded function]]s <math>f : X \rightarrow M</math> (i.e. those functions whose image is a [[bounded subset]] of <math>M</math>) can be turned into a metric space by defining <math>d(f,g) = \sup_{x \in X} d(f(x),g(x))</math> for any two bounded functions <math>f</math> and <math>g</math>. Here <math>\sup</math> is [[supremum]]. If <math>M</math> is complete, then this space is complete as well.
* If <math>X</math> is a [[topological space|topological]] (or metric) space and <math>M</math> is a metric space, then the set of all bounded [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] functions from <math>X</math> to <math>M</math> forms a metric space if we define the metric as above: <math>d(f,g) = \sup_{x \in X} d(f(x),g(x))</math> for any two bounded continuous functions <math>f</math> and <math>g</math>. If <math>M</math> is complete, then this space is complete as well.
* If <math>G</math> is an [[graph theory|undirected connected graph]], then the set <math>V</math> of vertices of <math>G</math> can be turned into a metric space by defining <math>d(x,y)</math> to be the length of the shortest path connecting the vertices <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>. In [[geometric group theory]] this is applied to the [[Cayley graph]] of a group, yielding the [[word metric]].
* The [[Levenshtein distance]] is a measure of the dissimilarity between two [[string (computer science)|strings]] <math>u</math> and <math>v</math>, defined as the minimal number of character deletions, insertions, or substitutions required to transform <math>u</math> into <math>v</math>. This can be thought of as a special case of the shortest path metric in a graph and is one example of an [[edit distance]].
* Given a metric space <math>(X,d)</math> and an increasing [[concave function]] <math>f : [0,\infty) \rightarrow [0,\infty)</math> such that <math>f(x) = 0</math> if and only if <math>x=0</math>, then <math>f \circ d</math> is also a metric on <math>X</math>.
* Given an [[injective function]] <math>f</math> from any set <math>A</math> to a metric space <math>(X,d)</math>, <math>d(f(x), f(y))</math> defines a metric on <math>A</math>.
* Using [[T-theory]], the [[tight span]] of a metric space is also a metric space. The tight span is useful in several types of analysis.
* The set of all <math>m</math> by <math>n</math> [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over some [[field (mathematics)|field]] is a metric space with respect to the [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] distance <math>d(X,Y) = rank(Y - X)</math>.
* The [[Helly metric]]  is used in [[game theory]].

== Open and closed sets, topology and convergence ==
Every metric space is a [[topological space]] in a natural manner, and therefore all definitions and theorems about general topological spaces also apply to all metric spaces.

About any point <math>x</math> in a metric space <math>M</math> we define the '''[[open ball]] of radius <math>r > 0</math> about <math>x</math> ''' as the set
:<math>B(x;r) = \{y \in M : d(x,y) < r\}.</math>
These open balls generate a topology on ''M'', making it a [[topological space]].

Explicitly, a subset <math>U</math> of <math>M</math> is called [[open set|'''open''']] if to every <math>x</math> in <math>U</math> there exists an <math>r > 0</math> such that <math>B(x;r)</math> is contained in <math>U</math>. The [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of an open set is called [[closed set|'''closed''']]. A [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] of the point <math>x</math> is any subset of <math>M</math> that contains an open ball about <math>x</math> as a subset.

A topological space which can arise in this way from a metric space is called a '''metrizable''' space; see the article on [[metrization theorems]] for further details.

A [[sequence]] (<math>x_n</math>) in a metric space <math>M</math> is said to [[limit of a sequence|converge]] to the limit <math>x \in M</math> [[iff]] for every <math>\epsilon>0</math>, there exists a natural number ''N'' such that <math>d(x_n,x) < \epsilon </math> for all <math>n > N</math>. Equivalently, one can use the general definition of convergence available in all topological spaces.

A subset <math>A</math> of the metric space <math>M</math> is closed iff every sequence in <math>A</math> that converges to a limit in <math>M</math> has its limit in <math>A</math>.

== Types of metric spaces ==
===Complete spaces===
A metric space <math>M</math> is said to be ''[[Complete metric space|complete]]'' if every [[Cauchy sequence]] converges in <math>M</math>. That is to say: if <math>d(x_n, x_m) \to 0</math> as both <math>n</math> and <math>m</math> independently go to infinity, then there is some <math>y\in M</math> with <math>d(x_n, y) \to 0</math>.

Every [[Euclidean space]] is complete, as is every closed subset of a complete space. The rational numbers, using the absolute value metric <math>d(x,y) = \vert x - y \vert</math>, are not complete.

Every metric space has a unique (up to [[isometry]]) completion, which is a complete space that contains the given space as a [[dense set|dense]] subset. For example, the real numbers are the completion of the rationals.

If <math>X</math> is a complete subset of the metric space <math>M</math>, then <math>X</math> is closed in <math>M</math>. Indeed, a space is complete [[iff]] it is closed in any containing metric space.

Every complete metric space is a [[Baire space]].

===Bounded and totally bounded spaces===
A metric space ''M'' is called '''bounded''' if there exists some number ''r'', such that ''d''(''x'',''y'') ≤ ''r'' for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''M''.  The smallest possible such ''r'' is called the [[diameter]] of ''M''. The space ''M'' is called '''precompact''' or '''[[totally bounded]]''' if for every ''r'' > 0 there exist finitely many open balls of radius ''r'' whose union covers ''M''. Since the set of the centres of these balls is finite, it has finite diameter, from which it follows (using the triangle inequality) that every totally bounded space is bounded.  The converse does not hold, since any infinite set can be given the discrete metric (one of the examples above) under which it is bounded and yet not totally bounded.

Note that in the context of [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]]s in the space of [[real number]]s and occasionally regions in a Euclidean space '''R'''<sup>n</sup> a bounded set is referred to as "a finite interval" or "finite region". However boundedness should not in general be confused with "finite", which refers to the number of elements, not to how far the set extends; finiteness implies boundedness, but not conversely.

===Compact spaces===
A metric space ''M'' is compact if every sequence in ''M'' has a [[subsequence]] that converges to a point in ''M''. This is known as [[sequentially compact space|sequential compactness]] and, in metric spaces (but not in general topological spaces), is equivalent to the topological notions of [[countably compact space|countable compactness]] and [[compact space|compactness]] defined via [[open cover]]s.

Examples of compact metric spaces include the closed interval [0,1] with the absolute value metric, all metric spaces with finitely many points, and the [[Cantor set]]. Every closed subset of a compact space is itself compact.

A metric space is compact [[iff]] it is complete and totally bounded.  This is known as the [[Heine–Borel theorem]]. Note that compactness depends only on the topology, while boundedness depends on the metric.

[[Lebesgue's number lemma]] states that for every open cover of a compact metric space ''M'', there exists a "Lebesgue number" δ such that every subset of ''M'' of [[diameter]] < δ is contained in some member of the cover.

Every compact metric space is [[second countable]],<ref>[http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/CompactMetricSpacesAreSecondCountable.html PlanetMath: a compact metric space is second countable<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and is a continuous image of the [[Cantor set]]. (The latter result is due to [[Pavel Alexandrov]] and [[Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn|Urysohn]].)

===Locally compact and proper spaces===
A metric space is said to be [[locally compact]] if every point has a compact neighborhood. Euclidean spaces are locally compact, but infinite-dimensional Banach spaces are not.

A space is [[proper space|proper]] if every closed ball {''y'' : ''d''(''x'',''y'') ≤ ''r''} is compact. Proper spaces are locally compact, but the converse is not true in general.

===Connectedness===
A metric space ''M'' is [[connected space|connected]] if the only subsets that are both open and closed are the empty set and ''M'' itself.

A metric space ''M'' is [[connectedness|path connected]] if for any two points ''x'', ''y'' in ''M'' there exists a continuous map ''f'':[0,1]→''M'' with ''f''(0)=''x'' and ''f''(1)=''y''.
Every path connected space is connected, but the converse is not true in general.

There are also local versions of these definitions: [[locally connected space]]s and [[connectedness|locally path connected spaces]].

[[Simply connected space]]s are those that, in a certain sense, do not have "holes".

===Separable spaces===
A metric space is [[separable space]] if it has a [[countable]] [[dense set|dense]] subset. Typical examples are the real numbers or any Euclidean space. For metric spaces (but not for general topological spaces) separability is equivalent to [[second countable space|second countability]] and also to the [[Lindelöf space|Lindelöf]] property.

==Types of maps between metric spaces==
Suppose (''M''<sub>1</sub>,''d''<sub>1</sub>) and (''M''<sub>2</sub>,''d''<sub>2</sub>) are two metric spaces.

===Continuous maps===
{{Main|Continuous function (topology)}}

The map ''f'':''M''<sub>1</sub>→''M''<sub>2</sub> is [[continuous map|continuous]]
if it has one (and therefore all) of the following equivalent properties:
;General topological continuity: for every open set ''U'' in ''M''<sub>2</sub>, the [[preimage]] ''f''<sup> -1</sup>(''U'') is open in ''M''<sub>1</sub>
:This is the general definition of [[Continuity (topology)|continuity in topology]].
;Sequential continuity: if (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) is a sequence in ''M''<sub>1</sub> that converges to ''x'' in ''M''<sub>1</sub>, then the sequence (''f''(''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)) converges to ''f''(''x'') in ''M''<sub>2</sub>.
:This is [[sequential continuity]], due to [[Eduard Heine]].
;ε-δ definition: for every ''x'' in ''M''<sub>1</sub> and every ε>0 there exists δ>0 such that for all ''y'' in ''M''<sub>1</sub> we have
::<math>d_1(x,y)<\delta \implies d_2(f(x),f(y))< \epsilon.</math>
:This uses the [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit]], and is due to [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]].

Moreover, ''f'' is continuous if and only if it is continuous on every compact subset of ''M''<sub>1</sub>.

The [[image (mathematics)|image]] of every compact set under a continuous function is compact, and the image of every connected set under a continuous function is connected.

===Uniformly continuous maps===
The map ''ƒ'' : ''M''<sub>1</sub> → ''M''<sub>2</sub> is [[uniform continuity|uniformly continuous]] if for every ''ε'' > 0 there exists ''δ'' > 0 such that

:<math>d_1(x,y)<\delta \implies d_2(f(x),f(y))< \varepsilon \quad\mbox{for all}\quad x,y\in M_1.</math>

Every uniformly continuous map ''ƒ'' : ''M''<sub>1</sub> → ''M''<sub>2</sub> is continuous.  The converse is true if ''M''<sub>1</sub> is compact ([[Heine–Cantor theorem]]).

Uniformly continuous maps turn Cauchy sequences in ''M''<sub>1</sub> into Cauchy sequences in ''M''<sub>2</sub>. For continuous maps this is generally wrong; for example, a continuous map
from the open interval (0,1) ''onto'' the real line turns some Cauchy sequences into unbounded sequences.

===Lipschitz-continuous maps and contractions===
Given a number ''K'' > 0, the map ''ƒ'' : ''M''<sub>1</sub> → ''M''<sub>2</sub> is [[Lipschitz continuity|''K''-Lipschitz continuous]] if

:<math>d_2(f(x),f(y))\leq K d_1(x,y)\quad\mbox{for all}\quad x,y\in M_1.</math>

Every Lipschitz-continuous map is uniformly continuous, but the converse is not true in general.

If ''K'' < 1, then ''ƒ'' is called a [[contraction mapping|contraction]]. Suppose ''M''<sub>2</sub> = ''M''<sub>1</sub> and ''M''<sub>1</sub> is complete. If ''ƒ'' is a contraction, then ''ƒ'' admits a unique fixed point ([[Banach fixed point theorem]]). If ''M''<sub>1</sub> is compact, the condition can be weakened a bit: ''ƒ'' admits a unique fixed point if
:<math>d(f(x), f(y)) < d(x, y)</math>
for all <math>x \ne y \in M_1</math>.

===Isometries===
The map ''f'':''M''<sub>1</sub>→''M''<sub>2</sub> is an [[isometry]] if
:<math>d_2(f(x),f(y))=d_1(x,y)\quad\mbox{for all}\quad x,y\in M_1</math>
Isometries are always [[injective]]; the image of a compact or complete set under an isometry is compact or complete, respectively. However, if the isometry is not [[surjective]], then the image of a closed (or open) set need not be closed (or open).

===Quasi-isometries===
The map ''f'':''M''<sub>1</sub>→''M''<sub>2</sub> is a [[quasi-isometry]] if there exist constants ''A''≥1 and ''B''≥0 such that
:<math>\frac{1}{A} d_2(f(x),f(y))-B\leq d_1(x,y)\leq A d_2(f(x),f(y))+B\quad\mbox{for all}\quad x,y\in M_1</math>
and a constant ''C''≥0 such that every point in ''M''<sub>2</sub> has a distance at most ''C'' from some point in the image ''f''(''M''<sub>1</sub>).

Note that a quasi-isometry is not required to be continuous. Quasi-isometries compare the "large-scale structure" of metric spaces; they find use in [[geometric group theory]] in relation to the [[word metric]].

==Notions of metric space equivalence==
Given two metric spaces (''M''<sub>1</sub>, ''d''<sub>1</sub>) and (''M''<sub>2</sub>, ''d''<sub>2</sub>):

*They are called '''homeomorphic''' (topologically isomorphic) if there exists a [[homeomorphism]] between them (i.e., a [[bijection]] continuous in both directions).

*They are called '''uniformic''' (uniformly isomorphic) if there exists a [[uniform isomorphism]] between them (i.e., a [[bijection]] uniformly continuous in both directions).

*They are called '''isometric''' if there exists a [[bijective]] isometry between them. In this case, the two metric spaces are essentially identical.

*They are called '''quasi-isometric''' if there exists a quasi-isometry between them.

==Topological properties==
Metric spaces are [[paracompact]]<ref>Rudin, Mary Ellen.  [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-9939%28196902%2920%3A2%3C603%3AANPTMS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-W A new proof that metric spaces are paracompact].  Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 20, No. 2. (Feb., 1969), p. 603.</ref> [[Hausdorff space]]s<ref>{{planetmath reference|id=5838|title=metric spaces are Hausdorff}}</ref> and hence [[normal space|normal]] (indeed they are perfectly normal). An important consequence is that every metric space admits [[partitions of unity]] and that every continuous real-valued function defined on a closed subset of a metric space can be extended to a continuous map on the whole space ([[Tietze extension theorem]]). It is also true that every real-valued [[Lipschitz maps|Lipschitz-continuous]] map defined on a subset of a metric space can be extended to a Lipschitz-continuous map on the whole space.

Metric spaces are [[first countable]] since one can use balls with rational radius as a neighborhood base.

The metric topology on a metric space ''M'' is the coarsest topology on ''M'' relative to which the metric ''d'' is a continuous map from the product of ''M'' with itself to the non-negative real numbers.

==Distance between points and sets; Hausdorff distance and Gromov metric==
A simple way to construct a function separating a point from a closed set (as required for a [[completely regular]] space) is to consider the {{ml|Distance|Distances_between_sets_and_between_a_point_and_a_set|distance between the point and the set}}. If (''M'',''d'') is a metric space, ''S'' is a [[subset]] of ''M'' and ''x'' is a point of ''M'', we define the distance from ''x'' to ''S'' as
:''d''(''x'',''S'') = [[infimum|inf]] {''d''(''x'',''s'') : ''s'' ∈ ''S''}
Then ''d''(''x'', ''S'') = 0 if and only if ''x'' belongs to the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of ''S''. Furthermore, we have the following generalization of the triangle inequality:
:''d''(''x'',''S'') ≤ ''d''(''x'',''y'') + ''d''(''y'',''S'')
which in particular shows that the map <math>x\mapsto d(x,S)</math> is continuous.

Given two subsets ''S'' and ''T'' of ''M'', we define their [[Hausdorff distance]] to be
:''d''<sub>H</sub>(''S'',''T'') = max { [[supremum|sup]] {''d''(''s'',''T'') : ''s'' ∈ ''S''}, sup {''d''(''t'',''S'') : ''t'' ∈ ''T''} }
In general, the Hausdorff distance ''d''<sub>H</sub>(''S'',''T'') can be infinite. Two sets are close to each other in the Hausdorff distance if every element of either set is close to some element of the other set.

The Hausdorff distance ''d''<sub>H</sub> turns the set ''K''(''M'') of all non-empty compact subsets of ''M'' into a metric space. One can show that ''K''(''M'') is complete if ''M'' is complete.
(A different notion of convergence of compact subsets is given by the [[Kuratowski convergence]].)

One can then define the [[Gromov–Hausdorff convergence|Gromov–Hausdorff distance]] between any two metric spaces by considering the minimal Hausdorff distance of isometrically embedded versions of the two spaces. Using this distance, the set of all (isometry classes of) compact metric spaces becomes a metric space in its own right.

==Product metric spaces==
If <math>(M_1,d_1),\ldots,(M_n,d_n)</math> are metric spaces, and ''N'' is the Euclidean norm on ''R<sup>n</sup>'', then <math>\Big(M_1\times \ldots \times M_n, N(d_1,\ldots,d_n)\Big)</math> is a metric space, where the '''product metric''' is defined by

:<math>N(d_1,...,d_n)\Big((x_1,\ldots,x_n),(y_1,\ldots,y_n)\Big) = N\Big(d_1(x_1,y_1),\ldots,d_n(x_n,y_n)\Big)</math> ,

and the induced topology agrees with the [[product topology]].  By the equivalence of norms in finite dimensions, an equivalent metric is obtained if ''N'' is the [[Norm_(mathematics)#Taxicab_norm_or_Manhattan_norm|taxicab norm]], a [[Norm_(mathematics)#p-norm|p-norm]], the [[Norm_(mathematics)#Infinity_norm_or_maximum_norm|max norm]], or any other norm which is non-decreasing as the coordinates of a positive ''n''-tuple increase (yielding the triangle inequality).

Similarly, a countable product of metric spaces can be obtained using the following metric

:<math>d(x,y)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac1{2^i}\frac{d_i(x_i,y_i)}{1+d_i(x_i,y_i)}</math>.

An uncountable product of metric spaces need not be metrizable. For example, <math>\mathbf{R}^\mathbf{R}</math> is not [[first-countable space|first-countable]] and thus isn't metrizable.

===Continuity of distance===
It is worth noting that in the case of a single space <math>(M,d)</math>, the distance map <math>d:M\times M \rightarrow R^+</math> (from the [[Metric_space#Definition|definition]]) is uniformly continuous with respect to any of the above product metrics <math>N(d,d)</math>, and in particular is continuous with respect to the product topology of <math>M\times M</math>.

==Quotient metric spaces==
If ''M'' is a metric space with metric ''d'', and ''~'' is an [[equivalence relation]] on ''M'', then we can endow the quotient set ''M/~'' with the following (pseudo)metric. Given two equivalence classes [''x''] and [''y''], we define
:<math>d'([x],[y]) = \inf\{d(p_1,q_1)+d(p_2,q_2)+...+d(p_{n},q_{n})\}</math>

where the [[infimum]] is taken over all finite sequences <math>(p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n)</math> and <math>(q_1, q_2, \dots, q_n)</math> with <math>[p_1]=[x]</math>, <math>[q_n]=[y]</math>, <math>[q_i]=[p_{i+1}], i=1,2,\dots n-1</math>. In general this will only define a [[pseudometric space|pseudometric]], i.e. <math>d'([x],[y])=0</math> does not necessarily imply that [''x'']=[''y'']. However for nice equivalence relations (e.g., those given by gluing together polyhedra along faces), it is a metric. Moreover if ''M'' is a [[compact space]], then the induced topology on ''M/~'' is the [[quotient space|quotient topology]].

The quotient metric ''d'' is characterized by the following [[universal property]]. If <math>f:(M,d)\longrightarrow(X,\delta)</math> is a [[metric map]] between metric spaces (that is, <math>\delta(f(x),f(y))\le d(x,y)</math> for all ''x'', ''y'') satisfying ''f''(''x'')=''f''(''y'') whenever <math>x\sim y,</math> then the induced function <math>\overline{f}:M/\sim\longrightarrow X</math>, given by <math>\overline{f}([x])=f(x)</math>, is a metric map <math>\overline{f}:(M/\sim,d')\longrightarrow (X,\delta).</math>

A topological space is [[sequential space|sequential]] if and only if it is a quotient of a metric space.<ref>Goreham, Anthony. [http://at.yorku.ca/p/a/a/o/51.pdf Sequential convergence in Topological Spaces]. Honours' Dissertation, Queen's College, Oxford (April, 2001), p. 14</ref>

==Generalizations of metric spaces==
*Every metric space is a [[uniform space]] in a natural manner, and every uniform space is naturally a [[topological space]]. Uniform and topological spaces can therefore be regarded as generalizations of metric spaces.

*If we consider the first definition of a metric space [[#Definition|given above]] and relax the second requirement, or remove the third or fourth, we arrive at the concepts of a [[pseudometric space]], a [[quasimetric space]], or a [[semimetric space]].

*If the distance function takes values in the [[extended real number line]] '''R'''∪{+∞}, but otherwise satisfies all four conditions, then it is called an ''extended metric'' and the corresponding space is called an ''<math>\infty</math>-metric space''.

*[[Approach space]]s are a generalization of metric spaces, based on point-to-set distances, instead of point-to-point distances.

*A [[continuity space]] is a generalization of metric spaces and [[poset]]s, that can be used to unify the notions of metric spaces and [[Domain theory|domain]]s.
