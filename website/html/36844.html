The '''tangram''' ({{zh|c=七巧板|p=qī qiǎo bǎn|l=seven boards of skill}}) is a [[dissection puzzle]] consisting of seven flat shapes, called ''tans'', which are put together to form shapes.  The objective of the puzzle is to form a specific shape (given only an outline or silhouette) using all seven pieces, which may not overlap.  It was originally invented in [[China]] at some unknown point in history, and then carried over to [[Europe]] by trading ships in the early 19th century.  It became very popular in Europe for a time then, and then again during [[World War I]].  It is one of the most popular [[dissection puzzle]]s in the world.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Tao of Tangram|last=Slocum|first=Jerry|year=2001|publisher=Barnes & Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0156-2|page=9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Manual of Play|last=Forbrush|first=William Byron|year=1914|publisher=Jacobs|page=315|url=http://books.google.com/?id=FpoWAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA315&dq=%22The+Anchor+Puzzle%22#v=onepage&q=%22The%20Anchor%20Puzzle%22&f=false|accessdate=10/13/10}}</ref>

==History==
===Reaching the Western world (1815–1820s)===
[[File:Tangram caricature France 1818.jpg|thumb|290px|left|A caricature published in France in 1818, when the Tangram craze was at its peak. The caption reads: " 'Take care of yourself, you're not made of steel. The fire has almost gone out and it is winter.' 'It kept me busy all night. Excuse me, I will explain it to you. You play this game, which is said to hail from China. And I tell you that what Paris needs right now is to welcome that which comes from far away.' "]]
The tangram had already been around in China for a long time when it was first brought to America by Captain M. Donnaldson, on his ship, ''Trader'', in 1815.  When it docked in Canton, the captain was given a pair of Sang-hsia-k'o's Tangram books from 1815.<ref name="tanbook1">{{cite book |title=The Tangram Book|last=Slocum|first=Jerry|year=2003|publisher=Sterling|isbn=049725504134|page=30}}</ref>  They were then brought with the ship to Philadelphia, where it docked in February 1816.  The first Tangram book to be published in America was based on the pair brought by Donnaldson.

The puzzle was originally popularized by ''The Eighth Book Of Tan'', a fictitious history of Tangram, which claimed that the game was invented 4,000 years prior by a god named Tan. The book included 700 shapes, some of which are impossible to solve.<ref name="isbn0-486-29225-8">{{cite book|author=Costello, Matthew J. |title=The Greatest Puzzles of All Time |publisher=Dover Publications |location=New York |isbn=0-486-29225-8|year=1996}}</ref> [[File:The 8th Book of Tan Part I.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Cover art from "The 8th Book of Tan", by [[Sam Loyd]], a spoof of the puzzle's history that began the Tangram Craze in the Western World]]

The puzzle eventually reached England, where it became very fashionable indeed.<ref name="tanbook1"/>  The craze quickly spread to other European countries.<ref name="tanbook1"/>  This was mostly due to a pair of British Tangram books, ''The Fashionable Chinese Puzzle'', and the accompanying solution book, ''Key''.<ref name="tanbook2">{{cite book |title=The Tangram Book|last=Slocum|first=Jerry|year=2003|publisher=Sterling|isbn=049725504134|page=31}}</ref>  Soon, tangram sets were being exported in great number from China, made of various materials, from glass, to wood, to tortoise shell.<ref name="tanbook3">{{cite book |title=The Tangram Book|last=Slocum|first=Jerry|year=2003|publisher=Sterling|isbn=049725504134|page=49}}</ref> 

Many of these unusual and exquisite tangram sets made their way to [[Denmark]].  Danish interest in tangrams skyrocketed around 1818, when two books on the puzzle were published, to much enthusiasm.<ref name="tanbook5">{{cite book |title=The Tangram Book|last=Slocum|first=Jerry|year=2003|publisher=Sterling|isbn=049725504134|pages=99–100}}</ref>  The first of these was ''Mandarinen'' (About the Chinese Game).  This was written by a student at [[Copenhagen University]], which was a non-fictional work about the history and popularity of tangrams.  The second, ''Der nye chinesisre Saadespil'' (The new Chinese Puzzle Game), consisted of 339 puzzles copied from [[The 8th Book of Tan]], as well as one original.<ref name="tanbook5"/>

One contributing factor in the popularity of the game in Europe was that although the [[Catholic Church]] forbade many forms of recreation on the sabbath, they made no objection to puzzle games such as the tangram.<ref name="tanbook4">{{cite book |title=The Tangram Book|last=Slocum|first=Jerry|year=2003|publisher=Sterling|isbn=049725504134|page=51}}</ref>

===The second craze in Germany and America (1891–1920s)===

Tangrams were first introduced to the German public by industrialist [[Freidrich Richter]] around 1891.<ref name="arclab">http://www.archimedes-lab.org/tangramagicus/pagetang1.html</ref> The sets were made out of stone or false [[earthenware]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Treasury Decisions Under customs and other laws, Volume 25|first=United States Department Of The Treasury|year=1890–1926|publisher=United States Department Of The Treasury|page=1421|url=http://books.google.com/?id=MeUWAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA1421&lpg=PA1421&dq=%22The+Anchor+Puzzle%22#v=onepage&q=%22The%20Anchor%20Puzzle%22&f=false|accessdate=9/16/10}}</ref> and marketed under the name "The Anchor Puzzle".<ref name="arclab"/> 

More internationally, the First World War saw a great resurgence of interest in Tangrams, on the homefront and trenches of both sides.  During this time, it occasionally went under the name of "The [[Sphinx]]", an alternate title for the "Anchor Puzzle" sets.<ref name="bbc">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A10423595|title=Tangram – The Chinese Puzzle|author=Wyatt|date=26 April 2006 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=3 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Kids Around The World Play!|last=Braman|first=Arlette|year=2002|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn= 9780471409847|page=10|url=http://books.google.com/?id=fNnoxIfJg5UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Kids+Around+The+World+Play!&q|accessdate=9/5/2010}}</ref>

== Paradoxes==
[[Image:squares.GIF|right|160px|thumb|Loyd's paradox]]
A tangram [[paradox]] is an apparent dissection fallacy: Two figures composed with the same set of pieces, one of which seems to be a proper subset of the other.<ref name="mathematica">[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TangramParadox.html Tangram Paradox], by Barile, Margherita, From MathWorld – A Wolfram Web Resource, created by Eric W. Weisstein.</ref> One famous paradox is that of the two [[monk]]s, attributed to [[Dudeney]], which consists of two similar shapes, one with and the other missing a foot.<ref name="dudeney">{{cite book |author=Dudeney, H. |title=Amusements in Mathematics |publisher=Dover Publications |location=New York |year=1958}}</ref>
Another is proposed by [[Sam Loyd]] in ''The Eighth Book Of Tan'':  
{{quote|The seventh and eighth figures represent the mysterious square, built with seven pieces: then with a corner clipped off, and still the same seven pieces employed.<ref name="loyd">{{cite book |author=Loyd, Sam |title=The eighth book of Tan – 700 Tangrams by Sam Loyd with an introduction and solutions by Peter Van Note |publisher=Dover Publications |location=New York |year= 1968|page=25 |isbn=|oclc= |doi=}}</ref>}}

Other similar, but possible, apparent paradoxes are in fact fallacious.  For example, in the case of the two monks mentioned above, the foot is actually compensated for in the second figure by a subtly larger body.<ref name="mathematica"/>

== Number of configurations ==
[[Image:13convexesTangram.png|thumb|The 13 convex shapes matched with Tangram set]]
Over 5,900 different tangram problems have been compiled from 19th century texts alone, and the current number is ever-growing.<ref name="taonum">{{cite book |title=The Tao of Tangram|last=Slocum|first=Jerry|year=2001|publisher=Barnes & Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0156-2|page=37}}</ref>  The number is finite, however.  Fu Traing Wang and Chuan-chin Hsiung proved in 1942 that there are only thirteen [[convex polygon|convex]] tangram configurations (configurations such that a line segment drawn between any two points on the configuration's edge always pass through the configuration's interior, i.e., configurations with no recesses in the outline).<ref>
{{cite journal |author1=Fu Traing Wang |author2=Chuan-Chih Hsiung |year=1942 |month=November |title=A Theorem on the Tangram |journal=[[The American Mathematical Monthly]] |volume=49 |issue=9 |pages=596–599 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2303340 |accessdate=2009-02-06 |doi=10.2307/2303340}}</ref><ref name="isbn0-486-21483-4">{{cite book |author=Read, Ronald C. |title=Tangrams : 330 Puzzles |publisher=Dover Publications |location=New York |page=53 |isbn=0-486-21483-4 |year=1965}}</ref>

==Pieces==
Choosing a unit of measurement so that the seven pieces can be assembled to form a square of side one unit and having area one square unit, the seven pieces are:

* 2 large [[Right Angle Triangle|right triangles]] (hypotenuse <math>\scriptstyle{1}</math>, sides <math>\scriptstyle{\sqrt{2}/2}</math>, area <math>\scriptstyle{1/4}</math>)
* 1 medium right triangle (hypotenuse <math>\scriptstyle{\sqrt{2}/2}</math>, sides <math>\scriptstyle{1/2}</math>, area <math>\scriptstyle{1/8}</math>)
* 2 small right triangle (hypotenuse <math>\scriptstyle{1/2}</math>, sides <math>\scriptstyle{\sqrt{2}/4}</math>, area <math>\scriptstyle{1/16}</math>)
* 1 [[Square (geometry)|square]] (sides <math>\scriptstyle{\sqrt{2}/4}</math>, area <math>\scriptstyle{1/8}</math>)
* 1 [[parallelogram]] (sides of <math>\scriptstyle{1/2}</math> and <math>\scriptstyle{\sqrt{2}/4}</math>, area <math>\scriptstyle{1/8}</math>)

Of these seven pieces, the parallelogram is unique in that it has no [[reflection symmetry]] but only [[rotational symmetry]], and so its [[mirror image]] can only be obtained by flipping it over. Thus, it is the only piece that may need to be flipped when forming certain shapes.
