'''Metro''' is an [[opensource]] [[web service]] stack that is a part of the [[GlassFish]] project, though it can also be used in a stand-alone configuration.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://metro.dev.java.net/discover/|title=metro: Discover Metro}}</ref>  Components of metro include [[JAXB]] RI, [[JAX-WS]] RI, [[SAAJ]] RI, [[SJSXP]], and [[WSIT]].  It is available under the [[CDDL]] and [[GPLv2]] (with classpath exception.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metro.java.net/discover/faq.html|title=metro: Metro FAQ}}</ref>

It is supported by [[Sun Microsystems]].

== History ==
Originally, the Glassfish project developed two semi-independent project :
*JAX-WS RI, the Reference implementation of the [[JAX-WS]] specification
*[[WSIT]], a Java implementation of some of the [[WS-*]] and an enhanced support for interoperability with the [[.NET Framework]]. It is based on JAX-WS RI as "Web Service layer".

In June 2007, it has been decided to bundle these two components as a single component named '''Metro'''[http://blogs.sun.com/arungupta/entry/announcing_metro_naming_the_web].

== Market share ==
Metro is bundled with [[Java Platform, Standard Edition|Java SE]] 6 in order to allow consumers of Java SE 6 to consume Web Services [https://jax-ws.dev.java.net/faq/index.html#different_versions]

Metro is bundled with numerous Application Servers [http://blogs.sun.com/theaquarium/entry/metro_now_on_tomcat_6] such as :
* [[GlassFish]]
* [[Sun Java System Application Server]]  Platform Edition 9.x
* [[Oracle Weblogic Server|Oracle WebLogic Server]]
* [[JBoss]] (version 5.x only)
* [[TmaxSoft]] JEUS 6.x

The [[JAXB]] reference implementation developed for Metro is used in virtually every Java Web Services framework ([[Apache Axis2]], [[Codehaus XFire]], [[Apache CXF]]) and Application Servers.

== Features ==
Metro compares well with other web service frameworks in terms of functionality. A comparison is provided by Codehaus at [http://xfire.codehaus.org/Stack+Comparison], which compares [[Apache Axis]] 1.x, Axis 2.x, Celtix, Glue, JBossWS, Xfire 1.2 and JAX-WS RI + WSIT (the bundle was not yet named Metro at this time).
