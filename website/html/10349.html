The '''Digital Economy Act 2010''' (c. 24) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] regulating digital media.  Introduced by [[Peter Mandelson|Peter Mandelson, Lord Mandelson]], it received [[Royal Assent]] on 8 April 2010, and came into force on 8 June 2010 (with the exception of certain sections that came into force on 8 April; and certain other sections that will be brought into force by [[statutory instrument]]).<ref name="dea_sec47">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/47?view=plain|title=Digital Economy Act, section 16: Commencement|publisher=[[UK Government]]|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref>

On 10 November 2010 the [[High Court of Justice]] granted permission for a [[Judicial review in English law|judicial review]] of Section 3 to 18 of the Act.

== Contents ==
=== Online infringement of copyright ===
==== Section 3 to 16 ====
The Act's provisions against the act of [[copyright infringement]] proved controversial.<ref name="guardian_dea">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/digital-economy-bill|title=Digital Economy Bill on The Guardian|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=July 2, 2010 | location=London}}</ref> It establishes a system of law which aims to first increase the ease of tracking down and suing persistent infringers, and after a minimum of one year permit the introduction of "technical measures" to reduce the quality of, or potentially terminate, those infringers' Internet connections. It also creates a new ex-[[judicial]] process to handle appeals.<ref name="dea_sec10" />

The new process, which will come into force when [[Ofcom]]'s regulatory code is approved by Parliament, begins with [[rightsholder]]s gathering lists of [[Internet Protocol]] addresses which they believe have infringed their copyrights. (This data could be gathered most easily by a rightsholder connecting to a [[Peer-to-Peer]] download of a work they own, and noting the other IP addresses to which their computer connects.) They would then send each IP number to the appropriate [[Internet Service Provider]] (newly-defined in the Act as a provider of IP addresses<ref name="dea_sec16">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/16?view=plain|title=Digital Economy Act, section 16: Interpretation and consequential provision|publisher=[[UK Government]]|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref>) along with a "copyright infringement report".

The ISP must then send a notification to the subscriber in question. The conditions under which this is required (i.e. the standard of evidence required) are not specified in the Act, but left to [[#Ofcom's code|Ofcom's regulatory code]]. The report and its recipient is noted by the ISP, if valid, but no further action is taken.<ref name="dea_sec3">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/3?view=plain|title=Digital Economy Act, section 3: Obligation to notify subscribers of reported infringements|publisher=[[UK Government]]|accessdate=July 2, 2010}}</ref>

The next stage in proceedings involves the rightsholder requesting a "copyright infringement list" from the ISP. This contains an anonymous list of all subscribers who have "reached the threshold set in the [Ofcom] code" with regard to infringement reports for their works.<ref name="dea_sec4">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/4?view=plain|title=Digital Economy Act, section 4: Obligation to provide infringement lists to copyright owners|publisher=[[UK Government]]|accessdate=July 2, 2010}}</ref> The rightsholder can then approach a judge to gain a [[court order]] to identify some or all of the subscribers on the list, and with that information launch standard copyright infringement litigation against them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===== Ofcom's code =====

Most operational details of the copyright infringement provisions are not defined in the Act, but left to a series of regulatory codes produced by [[Ofcom]]. The Act defines only the utmost limits within which these codes can work. On May 28, 2010 Ofcom published a draft initial obligations code for consultation.<ref>[http://www.Ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/copyright-infringement/ a consultation draft of their initial obligations code]</ref>

According to the Act Ofcom must produce "progress reports" once every three months on the levels of copyright infringement in the country, with a larger report coming once every 12 months.<ref name="dea_sec8">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/8?view=plain|title=Digital Economy Act, section 8: Progress reports|publisher=[[UK Government]]|accessdate=July 2, 2010}}</ref>

===== Technical measures =====

After [[#Ofcom's code|Ofcom's code]] has been in force for one year, the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]]<!-- which one? could be business or media! --> becomes able to lay down an order for ISPs to impose "technical measures" on subscribers who meet the copyright infringement report threshold (see above). These measures may limit Internet access in any way, including suspending it entirely. Unlike other areas of the Act Ofcom do not produce a code that defines what the measures are (though they are responsible for enforcing them): instead the Secretary of State decides all specifics, needing only to "take into account" Ofcom's recommendations.<ref name="dea_sec10" />

===== Appeals =====

The Act requires the provision of an independent [[appeal]]s process, covering the grounds on which infringement reports are made. Cases are heard by a body set up by [[Ofcom]], or if a technical measure has been applied a [[First-tier Tribunal]].<ref name="dea_sec13">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/13|title=Digital Economy Act, section 13: Subscriber appeals|publisher=[[UK Government]]|accessdate=July 2, 2010}}</ref>

Unlike in judicial appeals, the subscriber is [[innocent until proven guilty]]: the Act states that "an appeal on any grounds must be determined in favour of the subscriber unless the copyright owner or internet service provider shows that a) the apparent infringement was an infringement of copyright, and b) the report relates to the subscriber’s IP address at the time of that infringement". An appeal will also succeed if the subscriber can show that the rightsholder or ISP broke Ofcom's regulatory code in any way.<ref name="dea_sec13" />

===== Obligations on ISPs and copyright holders =====

The Act gives Ofcom the responsibility of enforcing ISPs' obligations. A fine of up to £250,000 can be levied on those in contravention; that limit can be raised by the Secretary of State with Parliament's consent.<ref name="dea_sec14">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/14?view=plain|title=Digital Economy Act, section 14: Enforcement of obligations|publisher=[[UK Government]]|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref>

The Act also allows the Secretary of State to define, with the consent of Parliament, the "sharing of costs" incurred from the Act's legal processes. The order can require reimbursements to be made by rightsholders and/or ISPs, and in the case of appeals, subscribers.<ref name="dea_sec15">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/15?view=plain|title=Digital Economy Act, section 15: Sharing of costs|publisher=[[UK Government]]|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref>

==== Section 17 and 18 - Blocking Internet locations ====

The Act allows the Secretary of State - with the consent of the [[Lord Chancellor]], [[House of Lords|upper]] and [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom |lower]] houses of Parliament and a court of law - to block access to a location on the Internet "from which a substantial amount of material has been, is being or is likely to be made available in infringement of copyright", or a location which "facilitates" such behaviour.<ref name="dea_sec17">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/17?view=plain|title=Digital Economy Act, section 17: Power to make provision about injunctions preventing access to locations on the internet|publisher=[[UK Government]]|accessdate=July 2, 2010}}</ref>

In deciding whether to grant an injunction, the court is required to consider:

* Steps taken by the operator of the location to prevent infringement
* Steps taken by the copyright owner to facilitate lawful access to the material
* Any representations made by a Minister of the Crown
* Whether the injunction would be likely to have a disproportionate effect on any person’s legitimate interests
* The importance of freedom of expression

The Secretary of State must be satisfied before making the request that the location is "having a serious adverse effect on businesses or consumers", that the injunction "is a proportionate way to address that effect", and that "making the regulations would not prejudice national security or the prevention or detection of crime".{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

=== Other provisions ===
Other provisions in the Act include an amendment to the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] to increase the criminal liability for "making or dealing with infringing articles" and "making, dealing with or using illicit recordings" to a maximum of £50,000, so long as it is done during the course of a business.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Regulation of content is also in the Act, which adopts the [[Pan European Game Information]] (PEGI) standard for video game ratings. The UK government is also able directly to intervene to control the use of the UK's domain name space, currently overseen by the independent body [[Nominet]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The Act also includes changes to [[Digital radio in the United Kingdom|DAB radio in the United Kingdom]] including the reorganisation and merging of some of the local [[DAB ensemble]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3i0040e099982664b6b69422dd757955dd|title=Race Against Time For U.K. Digital Bill|date=2010-02-10|last=Paine|first=Andre|accessdate=2010-03-14|publisher=Billboard}}</ref> and a requirement for a digital switchover of terrestrial radio in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/6616161/Digital-Economy-Bill-No-date-for-radio-digital-switchover.html|title=Digital Economy Bill: No date for radio digital switchover|accessdate=2010-03-14|date=2009-11-20|last=Barnett|first=Emma|publisher=The Telegraph | location=London}}</ref>

Further measures included:

* The management of <code>[[.uk]]</code> Internet domain registries
* The functions of the [[Channel4#Channel Four Television Corporation|Channel Four Television Corporation]]
* The regulation of television and radio services
* The regulation of the use of the electromagnetic spectrum
* The [[Video Recordings Act 1984]]
* Public lending right in relation to electronic publications (Authors receive a 10p royalty for physical books lent from UK libraries but not ebooks. This act extends that royalty to cover some ebooks and audio books lent by libraries electronically. However the appropriate legislation has not yet been amended for this to take place. http://www.plr.uk.com/registrationservice/faq.htm#sound )

== History ==

The Digital Economy Act itself followed the [[Digital Britain]] report<ref>http://interactive.bis.gov.uk/digitalbritain/final-report/ "Digital Britain final report"</ref> of June 2009 and contained many of its suggestions. It was announced in the 2009 [[speech from the throne|Queen's Speech]] before the United Kingdom parliament.<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/91118-0001.htm#09111813000012 "Ensure the communications infrastructure is fit for the digital age"] in the Queen's Speech</ref> The first reading of the bill was presented to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] on 16 March 2010.<ref>http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2009-10/digitaleconomy.html</ref> The bill received its second reading on the 6 April 2010 in a Commons debate and was given support by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] front bench<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/apr/06/digital-economy-bill-conservative-support | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Digital economy bill gets reluctant Conservative support | first=Mark | last=Sweney | date=2010-04-06}}</ref> and as expected<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/mar/25/digital-economy-bill-commons | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Digital economy bill to be pushed through parliament next month | first=Charles | last=Arthur | date=2010-03-25}}</ref> was not debated at length in the Commons, and was instead pushed through in the "[[Dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|wash up]]". It passed [[third reading]] on 7 April<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2010/apr/07/digital-economy-bill-internet | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Digital Economy bill: liveblogging the crucial third reading | first=Charles | last=Arthur | date=2010-04-07}}</ref> with [[Royal Assent]] granted on 8 April. As of 12 June 2010, the Act is now in force.

==Criticism==
=== Copyright infringement ===
The Act has attracted criticism from consumer rights and privacy groups<ref name="orgblog">[http://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/2009/digital-economy-bill Open Rights Group comments]</ref> due partly to its proposal of a [[graduated response]] scheme, which, if regulators and parliament feel the Act is not having enough impact, may eventually reach as far as disconnecting Internet accounts used for persistent [[copyright infringement]].<ref name="dea_sec10">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/10?view=plain|title=Digital Economy Act, section 10: Obligations to limit internet access|publisher=[[UK Government]]|accessdate=July 2, 2010}}</ref> Concerns have also been raised that protection offered to businesses offering Internet access to their customers, such as libraries and universities, would not be enough.<ref>http://news.zdnet.co.uk/communications/0,1000000085,40057470,00.htm</ref>

[[TalkTalk]], Britain's second-largest ISP, has been a vociferous critic of the Act. They opposed it from its earliest stages by staging media events,<ref name="bbc09_talktalk-stunt">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8305379.stm|title=ISP in file-sharing wi-fi theft|date=October 16, 2009|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref> declaring that they would fight against the new laws in court, and commissioning research to demonstrate that music fans would simply transition to other, non-P2P tools (such as "applications which scan thousands of internet radio stations and download the desired tracks").<ref name="talktalk_sidestep">{{cite web|url=http://www.talktalkgroup.com/press-centre/news/press-office/173/music-fans-will-sidestep-filesharing-clampdown-says-talktalk|title=Music fans will sidestep filesharing clampdown says TalkTalk |date=March 15, 2010|publisher=[[TalkTalk]]}}</ref>

TalkTalk have also argued that the requirement in Ofcom's draft code of conduct that only ISPs with 400,000 customers or more would initially be subject to the Act "could [lead to] huge swathes of customers moving to smaller ISPs to avoid detection". BT were cooler in their criticism of the act than TalkTalk, saying only that they felt compelled to act "for our customers who otherwise run the risk of being treated unfairly".

==== Judicial review ====

On July 8 2010 TalkTalk were joined by [[BT Group|BT]], Britain's biggest ISP, in seeking a [[judicial review]] of the Act on the grounds of it receiving "insufficient scrutiny" and having the potential to "harm citizens and impact both businesses".<ref name="bbc10_judicialreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/news/Articles/ShowArticle.cfm?ArticleID=98284B3F-B538-4A54-A44F-6B496AF1F11F|title=BT and TalkTalk in legal challenge to Digital Economy Act|date=July 8, 2010|publisher=[[BT Group]]}}</ref> They questioned whether the provisions were proportionate, respected privacy law, complied with EU law on ISP liability, and suggested that they would hinder a single European market in telecommunications services.<ref name="jr-docs">{{Cite web|title=Statement of facts and grounds|url=http://www.talktalkblog.co.uk/download/sfg-final.pdf|date=July 8 2010|author=[[TalkTalk]]}}</ref> The [[High Court of Justice]] granted the review permission on November 10 2010.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Digital Economy Act to be reviewed by courts and Parliament| publisher = Out-Law.com Prinsent Masons| date = 10 November 2010| url = http://www.out-law.com/page-11538| accessdate = 12 November 2010}}</ref>

=== Orphan works ===
Clause 43 (formerly Clause 42) of the bill on [[extended collective licensing]] by collecting societies and the licensing of [[orphan works]]. Photographers and authors criticised the clause.<ref>[http://www.stop43.org.uk/ stop43.org.uk Photographers' case against Clause 43]</ref><ref>[http://www.gillianspraggs.com/deb/deb_briefing.pdf Briefing on Copyright Clauses of the Digital Economy Bill]</ref> The clause was removed during wash-up.

=== Wash-up ===
{{See also|Wash-up period}}
[[Image:Stop-mandelson-fb.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stop Disconnection image used by the [[Open Rights Group]] during the campaign against the Digital Economy Bill, now the Digital Economy Act 2010]]
The Bill was debated at a brief committee stage during the "wash up" period after the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|general election]] was announced in April 2010, and a few controversial clauses were dropped. [[38 Degrees]], who are working with the [[Open Rights Group]] to mobilise opposition to the bill, state that over 22,000 people have emailed their MPs through their web site.  38 Degrees have also raised over £20,000 in donations to fund newspaper ads against the bill.<ref>http://blog.38degrees.org.uk</ref> More than 35,000 people signed a Number 10 petition,<ref>http://www.dontdisconnect.us</ref> started by Andrew Heaney at ISP [[TalkTalk]], objecting to being disconnected without fair trial. Over 100 people protested outside Parliament on 24 March 2010, including Labour MPs [[Tom Watson (politician)|Tom Watson]] and [[John Grogan (UK politician)|John Grogan]], [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] [[prospective parliamentary candidate]] [[Bridget Fox]], and writer and activist [[Cory Doctorow]].<ref>http://www.eweekeurope.co.uk/news/uk-digital-bill-enters-wash-up-despite-protest-6089. Almost 35,000 people have signed a petition calling for the Bill's disconnection provisions to be dropped.</ref><ref>http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/819096-web-blocking-bill-set-to-become-law-without-full-debate</ref>

=== Political opposition ===
Although all three of the UK's major parties played a part in the passing of the bill into law, the [[Pirate Party UK]] were (and remain) strongly opposed to it.<ref>http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/blog/2010/apr/9/digital-economy-bill-has-passed/</ref> The [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]], whose [[Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs) sit with the two Swedish Pirate Party MEPs in the same group, opposed the bill. "The Digital Economy Bill is deeply flawed and illiberal. ...  Any Green MPs will provide a rallying point for opposition to the Digital Economy Bill." <ref>http://www.greenparty.org.uk/news/19-04-2010-greens-debill-opposition.html</ref>

The [[Liberal Democrats]] pledged before the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]] to repeal the bill, stating that they oppose the parts that relate to the blocking of people's Internet connections, and that the Lib Dems would "take [disconnection] off the statute book and replace it with something better".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2010/apr/16/digital-economy-bill-nick-clegg | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Repeal the digital economy act – Nick Clegg | first=Simon | last=Jeffery | date=2010-04-16}}</ref>
However, there was no reference to the Act in the [[Conservative – Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement]] written after the election.<ref>http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/409088/pfg_coalition.pdf</ref>

==Support==
=== Orphan works ===
The [[Design and Artists Copyright Society]] and the [[British Association of Picture Libraries and Agencies]]<ref>[http://www.bapla.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=46&Itemid=89&favm=3613&stype=story]</ref> support the Act for its modernisation of the copyright licensing system and access to [[orphan works]] (the latter of which was ultimately dropped).<ref>[http://www.dacs.org.uk/index.php?m=21&s=21&c=156 DACS]</ref>

=== Digital radio ===
The [[Community Media Association]] supports the Act for the radio clauses stated to bring significant benefits to the community broadcasting sector as FM spectrum becomes available following digital radio switchover.<ref>[http://www.commedia.org.uk/2010/01/20/digital-economy-bill-community-radio/ Digital Economy Bill Benefits Community Radio]</ref>

=== ISPs ===
Attitudes of [[Internet Service Provider]]s (ISPs) towards the bill have been mixed, with generally conditional and restricted support. In interviews with ISPs by TechRadar, [[Virgin Media]] said that they shared the commitment to address copyright infringement, but that persuasion not coercion is the key; a heavy-handed, punitive regime would simply alienate Internet users. [[British Sky Broadcasting|Sky]], which is both an ISP and a content provider, was supportive of the government's commitment to underpin the fight against illegal file sharing through legislation, but not directly of the 'website banning' proposal.<ref>[http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/sky-virgin-and-talktalk-respond-to-digital-economy-bill-change-675082 TechRadar interviews with Virgin Media, TalkTalk, Sky]</ref><ref>[http://www.cable.co.uk/news/sky-everyone-must-tackle-filesharing-19386739/ Sky: Everyone must tackle filesharing] cable.co.uk, September 30, 2009.</ref>

== Parliamentary inquiry ==

On 10 November 2010 (the same day as the judicial review), the [[Culture, Media and Sport Committee of Parliament]] announced an inquiry into the act. The inquiry will consider "the implementation, practicality and likely effectiveness of the relevant measures contained in the act", and "the scope for additional and new approaches to ensure that original work is appropriately rewarded in online". <ref name="select-committee">{{cite web|title=Committee launches a new inquiry into the Protection of Intellectual Property Rights Online |url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/committee-announces-new-inquiry/|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=5 January 2011|date=10 November 2010}}</ref>
