<html> <head> <title>Anomaly-based intrusion detection system</title></head><body>An '''Anomaly-Based''' [[intrusion-detection system|Intrusion Detection System]], is a system for detecting computer intrusions and misuse by monitoring system activity and classifying it as either ''normal'' or ''anomalous''. The classification is based on [[heuristics]] or rules, rather than patterns or [[signature]]s, and will detect any type of misuse that falls out of normal system operation. This is as opposed to signature based systems which can only detect attacks for which a signature has previously been created.

In order to determine what is attack traffic, the system must be taught to recognise normal system activity. This can be accomplished in several ways, most often with [[artificial intelligence]] type techniques. Systems using [[neural networks]] have been used to great effect. Another method is to define what normal usage of the system comprises using a strict mathematical model, and flag any deviation from this as an attack. This is known as strict anomaly detection.
