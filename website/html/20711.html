'''Kismet''' is a [[network detector]], [[packet sniffer]], and [[Intrusion-detection system|intrusion detection system]] for [[802.11]] [[wireless LAN]]s. Kismet will work with any wireless card which supports [[Monitor mode|raw monitoring mode]], and can sniff [[802.11a]], [[802.11b]], [[802.11g]], and [[802.11n]] traffic. The program runs under [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], and [[Mac OS X]]. The client can also run on [[Microsoft Windows]], although, aside from external drones{{Clarify|date=November 2010}}, there's only one supported  wireless hardware available as packet source.

==Features==
Kismet is unlike most other wireless network detectors in that it works passively.  This means that without sending any loggable packets, it is able to detect the presence of both [[wireless access point]]s and wireless clients, and associate them with each other.

Kismet also includes basic wireless [[Intrusion-detection system|IDS]] features such as detecting ''active'' wireless sniffing programs including [[NetStumbler]], as well as a number of wireless network attacks.

Kismet has the ability to log all sniffed packets and save them in a [[tcpdump]]/[[Wireshark]] or [[Airsnort]] compatible fileformat.  Kismet also captures PPI headers.

Kismet also has the ability to detect default or "not configured" networks, probe requests, and determine what levels of wireless encryptions is used on a given access point.

To find as many networks as possible, kismet supports channelhopping. This means that it constantly changes from channel to channel non-sequentially, in a user-defined sequence with a default value that leaves big holes between channels (for example 1-6-11-2-7-12-3-8-13-4-9-14-5-10). The advantage with this method is that it will capture more packets because adjacent channels overlap.

Kismet also supports logging of the geographical coordinates of the network if the input from a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receiver is additionally available.

== Server / Drone / Client infrastructure ==
Kismet has three separate parts.  A ''drone'' can be used to collect packets, and then pass them on to a ''server'' for interpretation.  A server can either be used in conjunction with a drone, or on its own, interpreting packet data, and extrapolating wireless information, and organizing it.  The ''client'' communicates with the server and displays the information the server collects.

==Plugins==
With the updating of Kismet to -ng, Kismet now supports a wide variety of scanning plugins including [[Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications]], Bluetooth, and others.
