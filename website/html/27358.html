Thus, any of the vast number of tools for handling zip files and XML data can be used to handle OpenDocument.  Nearly all programming languages have libraries (built-in or available) for processing XML files and zip files.

===Microsoft===
In October 2005, one year before the Microsoft Office 2007 suite was released, Microsoft declared that there is not sufficient demand from Microsoft customers for international standard OpenDocument format support and therefore it will not be included in Microsoft Office 2007. This statement was repeated also in next months.<ref name="office12-pdf">[http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39225406,00.htm Office 12 to support PDF creation, 03 Oct 2005]</ref><ref name="odf-must">[http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39226547,00.htm Microsoft 'must support OpenDocument', 06 Oct 2005]</ref><ref name="gates-odf">23 March 2006, Gates: Office 2007 will enable a new class of application [http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-148675.html]</ref><ref name="odf">[http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/software/soa/Microsoft_Office_to_get_a_dose_of_OpenDocument/0,130061733,139255766,00.htm May 08, 2006 - Microsoft Office to get a dose of OpenDocument]</ref> As an answer, on October 20, 2005 an online petition was created to demand ODF support from Microsoft.<ref name="petition">[http://opendocumentfellowship.com/press/2005-10-20 OpenDocument Support: Tell Microsoft You Want It!, 20 October 2005]</ref> The petition was signed by circa 12000 people.<ref>[http://opendocumentfellowship.com/petition ODF Fellowship Petition]</ref>

In July 2006 Microsoft announced the creation of the Open XML Translator project—tools to build a technical bridge between the Microsoft Office Open XML Formats and the OpenDocument Format (ODF). This work was started in response to government requests for interoperability with ODF. The goal of project is not to implement ODF direct to Microsoft Office, but only to create plugin and external tools.<ref name="ms-odf-plugin">[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/jul06/07-06OpenSourceProjectPR.mspx Microsoft Expands Document Interoperability, July 5, 2006]</ref><ref>Open XML Translator project announced (ODF support for Office),

Independent analysis has, however, reported several concerns with these plugins, including lack of support for Office 2007.<ref>{{Cite web

====Third party support: Two ODF plug-ins for Microsoft Office====
There are currently two third-party plug-ins:
#''Sun Microsystems' ODF Plugin for Microsoft Office users'' <ref>http://www.sun.com/software/star/odf_plugin/</ref> — gives users of Microsoft Office Word, Excel and PowerPoint the ability to read, edit and save to the ISO-standard Open Document Format (ODF). It works with Microsoft Office 2007 (with service pack 1 or higher), Microsoft Office 2003, Microsoft Office XP, and even Microsoft Office 2000.<ref>{{Cite web

#''ooo-word-filter'' <ref>http://sourceforge.net/projects/ooo-word-filter</ref> — enables users of Microsoft Word 2003 to open OpenDocument files.

A third plug-in, OpenOpenOffice (O3),<ref>http://sourceforge.net/projects/openopenoffice/</ref> is apparently inactive. ''OpenOpenOffice'' was developed by Phase-n, a [[free software|free]] and [[open source software]] [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] to enable [[Microsoft Office]] to read and write OpenDocument files (and any other formats supported by [[OpenOffice.org]]). Instead of installing a complete office application or even a large plug-in, O3 intended to install a tiny plug-in to the Microsoft Office system. This tiny plug-in intended to automatically send the file to some server, which would then do the conversion, returning the converted file. The server could be local to an organization (so private information doesn't go over the Internet) or accessed via the Internet (for those who do not want to set up a server). A beta of the server half has been completed, and further expected announcements have not occurred. Phase-n argued that the main advantage of their approach is simplicity. Their website <ref>http://o3.phase-n.com/ {{Dead link|July 2009|date=July 2009}}</ref> announces that O3 “requires no new concepts to be explored, no significant development, and leverages the huge existing body of work already created by the OpenOffice.org developers, the [[CPAN]] module authors, and the [[Microsoft .NET]] and Office teams. They also argue that this approach significantly simplifies maintenance; when a new version of OpenOffice.org is released, only the server needs to be upgraded.

A fourth plug-in was announced by the [[OpenDocument Foundation]] in May 2006<ref>http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060504015438308</ref> but development was stopped in October 2007.<ref>http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/23/odf_davinci_code/</ref>

====Microsoft Office 2007 SP2 support controversy====
Microsoft supports OpenDocument format in Office 2007 SP2.<ref>{{Cite web

This is because the formulas used to perform calculations within a spreadsheet (e.g., adding numbers in a column of cells) are simply removed in MS Excel 2007. Instead of performing the calculations, what is left is when the spreadsheet is loaded in MS Excel 2007 is the last value that cell had, when previously saved.  The same test spreadsheet, when loaded and saved in all the other applications besides MS Excel 2007 (e.g., between KSpread and Google Docs), does process correctly. Most other ODF spreadsheet applications are able to interoperate just fine. The correct approach would have been for Microsoft to do the same to ensure that MS Office users can share spreadsheets with other ODF-supporting office suites.''

Before SP2, Microsoft had sponsored the creation of the Open XML translator<ref name="Microsoft"/> project to allow the conversion of documents between [[OOXML]] and OpenDocument. As a result of this project, Microsoft financed the ODF add-in for Word project on [[SourceForge]]. This project is an effort by several of Microsoft's partners to create a plugin for Microsoft Office that will be freely available under a [[BSD license]]. The project released [http://odf-converter.sourceforge.net/download.html version 1.0] for [[Microsoft Word]] of this software in January 2007 followed by versions for [[Microsoft Excel]] and [[Microsoft PowerPoint]] in December of the same year. [[Sun Microsystems]] has created the competing OpenDocument plugin for Microsoft Office 2007 (Service Pack 1 or higher), 2000, XP, and 2003 that supports Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents.<ref name="Heise Online"/>
The [[ODF Alliance]] has claimed that third-party plug-ins “provide better support for ODF than the recently released
Microsoft Office 2007 SP2”.

==Accessibility==
One important issue raised in the discussion of [[OpenDocument]] is whether the format is [[accessible]] to those with [[disabilities]]. There are two issues: does the specification support accessibility, and are implementations accessible?

===Specification===
While the [[specification]] of OpenDocument is going through an extensive accessibility review, many of the components it is built on (such as [[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language|SMIL]] for audio and multimedia and [[SVG]] for vector graphics) have already gone through the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C)'s [[Web Accessibility Initiative]] processes.

There are already applications that currently read/write OpenDocument that export Tagged [[PDF]] files (to support PDF accessibility); this suggests that much or all of the necessary data for accessibility is already included in the OpenDocument format.

The OASIS OpenDocument technical committee released a draft of OpenDocument 1.1 on 2006-07-27, for public comment through 2006-09-25.<ref>http://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/office/email/archives/200607/msg00114.html</ref>
This is a very minor update to the specification to add accessibility information, mainly soft page break markings, table header markings, presentation navigation markings, alternative text and captions, and specifically stating that spreadsheets may be embedded in presentations.
Peter Korn (an accessibility expert) reviewed version 1.1 “to satisfy myself that all of our accessibility concerns have been addressed”, and declared “I am so satisfied.”<ref>http://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/office/email/archives/200607/msg00089.html</ref><ref>http://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/office-accessibility/download.php/19301/ODF-v1.1-draft7_a11y_requirements_review.odt</ref>

===Implementations===
[[Peter Korn]] gave an in-depth report<ref>{{Cite web
 | title =   Massachusetts, Open Document, and Accessibility
  | publisher = Sun
  | date = 2005-11-13
  | url = http://blogs.sun.com/korn/date/20051113

He noted that there are many kinds of impairments, including visual (minor, major, or blind), physical (minor, major with vocal control, major without vocal control), auditory, and [[cognitive]]. He then noted that the situation varies, depending on the specific disability. For a vast number of disabilities, there are no known problems, though.

* OpenOffice.org is expected to work well with existing solutions in MS Windows' [[on-screen keyboard]]s (etc.) when driven by single-[[switch access]], [[head-mouse]], and [[eye-gaze]] systems.  On Unix-like systems, [[GNOME]]'s “On-screen Keyboard” goes far beyond Microsoft Windows' capabilities, because it can use the [http://projects.gnome.org/accessibility/ GNOME accessibility project] architecture. Also available on both Linux and Windows systems is [[Dasher]], a [[GPL]]ed text-entry alternative for head-mouse and eye-gaze users (35+ word-per-minute typing speeds using nothing but [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]] are possible).

* If those with disabilities are already using Microsoft Office, then a [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] enabling them to load and save OpenDocument files using Microsoft Office may give them the same capabilities they already have (assuming the opening/saving cycle is accessible).  So from that perspective, OpenDocument is at least as accessible as Microsoft Office. The primary problem is that Microsoft Windows does not have a real accessibility infrastructure compared to UNIX-like systems with [[GNOME]], the [[Java platform]], or [[Mac OS X]].

* For users using alternatives to Microsoft Office there may be problems, not necessarily due to the ODF file format but rather due to the lower investment to date by assistive technology vendors on these platforms, though there is ongoing work. For example, [[IBM]] has stated that its “Workplace productivity tools available through Workplace Managed Client including word processing, spreadsheet and presentation editors are currently planned to be fully accessible on a Windows platform by 2007. Additionally, these productivity tools are currently planned to be fully accessible on a Linux platform by 2008” (Sutor, November 10, 2005).

It is important to note that since OpenDocument is an [[Open Standard]] file format, there is no need for everyone to use the same program to read and write OpenDocument files; someone with a disability is free to use whatever program works best for them.
