'''Freshman studies''' is a required course at many [[liberal arts]] colleges in the [[United States]]. In general, it is mandatory for all freshman to take at least one or two terms.  Most programs seek to panoptically introduce students to a variety of material outside of their immediate interests, foster academic debate, and encourage students to become better writers.

The idea was created by [[Lawrence University]] President [[Nathan M. Pusey]] in 1945  and first implemented by Professor Waple, who chaired the Freshman Studies Committee at that school.
