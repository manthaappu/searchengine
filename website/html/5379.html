<html> <head> <title>Cambridge Computer Lab Ring</title></head><body>The '''Cambridge Computer Lab Ring''' is a not-for-profit independent members' association that campaigns on behalf of Cambridge computer scientists to build the Cambridge community in computing. It was launched in October 2002 to provide graduates of the [[Cambridge University Computer Laboratory]] with a lifetime benefit from their Cambridge degrees.

The association was cited by [[Richard Lambert]] in the [[Lambert Review]] of Business-University Collaboration (3.8, p32) as an example of how "universities, departments and faculties should develop their alumni networks in order to build closer relationships with their graduates working in the business community."
