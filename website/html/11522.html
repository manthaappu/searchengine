'''''EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]], [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] journal.
It was previously known as the EURASIP Journal on Applied Signal Processing.

The overall aim of the journal is to bring science and applications together with emphasis on both theoretical and practical aspects of [[signal processing]] in new and [[emerging technologies]]. It is directed as much at the practicing engineer as at the academic researcher. The journal highlights the extended reach and the diverse applications of signal processing and encourage a cross-fertilization of techniques.

All papers should attempt to bring theory to life with practical simulations and examples. The journal employs paperless, electronic review process to foster fast and speedy turnaround in review process.

Application areas include (but are not limited to): communications, networking, sensors and actuators, radar and sonar, [[medical imaging]], biomedical applications, [[remote sensing]], [[consumer electronics]], [[computer vision]], [[pattern recognition]], robotics, [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]] sensing/transducers, [[Automation|industrial automation]], transportation, [[stock market]] and [[financial analysis]], seismography, avionics.
