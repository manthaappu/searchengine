<html> <head> <title>Federated Naming Service</title></head><body>In [[computing]], the '''Federated Naming Service''' ('''FNS''') or '''XFN''' ('''X/Open Federated Naming''') is a system for uniting various name services under a single interface for the basic naming operations. It is produced by [[X/Open]] and included in various Unix operatings systems such as [[Solaris Operating Environment]] versions 2.5 to 9.

The purpose of XFN and FNS is to allow applications to use widely heterogeneous naming services (such as [[Network Information Service|NIS]], [[Domain Name System|DNS]] and so on) via a single interface, to avoid duplication of programming effort.

Unlike the similar [[LDAP]], neither XFN nor FNS were ever popular nor widely used.  FNS was last included in Solaris 9 and was not included with Solaris 10.
