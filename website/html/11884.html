'''Electronic Letters on Computer Vision and Image Analysis''' (usually abbreviated '''ELCVIA''') is a [[peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] focusing on [[computer vision]], [[image analysis]] (subfields of [[artificial intelligence]]) as well as [[image processing]] (a subfield of [[signal processing]]). It was founded in [[2002]], and published by the [[Computer Vision Center]] at [[Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona]], Spain.
