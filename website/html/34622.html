'''Slate''' is a [[prototype-based]] [[object-oriented]] [[programming language]] with [[multiple dispatch]]. It uses the syntax of [[Smalltalk]] and some ideas of the [[Self programming language]]. Slate also aims to provide an [[operating system]] like environment (e.g. graphics interface). It was once featured on [[Slashdot]].<ref>[http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/04/03/27/1627220.shtml Article on Slashdot]</ref>
