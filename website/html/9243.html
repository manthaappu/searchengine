'''Darwin''' is an [[Architecture Description Language]] (ADL). It can be used in a [[software engineering]] context to describe the organization of a piece of software in terms of components, their interfaces, and the bindings between components.
In comparison to others ADLs, such as [[Wright (ADL)|Wright]], the language does not provide the notion of connectors as a first-class concept.
The [[FSP]]{{dn}} language can be used to describe the behaviour modelling, and [[LTSA]]{{dn}} can be used for analysis.
The idea is to include the FSP code in the Darwin code like this:<!-- like what? -->

Its use of FSP language allow the verification of the temporal properties of the architecture.

It was developed at [[Imperial College London]].
