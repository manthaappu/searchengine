'''Darnell Wilson''' (b. 1974, September 22 in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] ) is a US-American [[Boxing|boxer]]. Graduated from [[Quince Orchard High School]] in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]].

==Amateur career==
Most people confuse Darnell Wilson with the outstanding amateur [[Darnell Wilson (middleweight boxer)|Darnell Wilson]] who won the [[United States Amateur Light Middleweight Championship]] three years in a row (1997-99).<ref>[http://www.boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=101533&cat=boxer BoxRec.com: Darnell Wilson]</ref>

==Professional career==
Known as "Ding-A-Ling Man", Wilson turned pro in 2000 as a [[light heavyweight]].  He showed a world-class punch and a good chin but couldn't outbox his opponents.
His best results were draws with George Jones (record 19-2) and James Lubwama (record 18-1).

In 2005 he moved up to [[Cruiserweight (boxing)|cruiserweight]].
There he was outpointed by prospects/fringe contenders [[Vadim Tokarev]] (17-0), [[Felix Cora Jr.]] (17-0-2), and veteran [[Andre Purlette]] (record 38-2) and also lost to [[heavyweight]] [[Owen Beck]].

In late 2006 he at least managed to KO another former light heavyweight in [[Southpaw stance |southpaw]] [[Daniel Judah]] (21-1-3), but at age 32 seemed to be going nowhere. He says of this time: "I was diagnosed. My [[adrenal glands]] were being worn down. I would go flat after a few rounds of sparring because of a bad effect from [[energy drink]]s."

His career direction changed dramatically in 2007 when he scored a sensational KO2 over Canadian contender [[Dale Brown (boxer)|Dale Brown]] in [[Edmonton]].
He quickly added another upset KO3 over [[Kelvin Davis (boxer)|Kelvin Davis]] who had put him on the deck before in the second round.
Wilson is now rated in the Top 10 by the [[Ring Magazine]].

Wilson knocked out hard-punching [[Emmanuel Nwodo]] on June 29, 2007.  [[ESPN]] announcer [[Teddy Atlas]] proclaimed it the most devastating knockout ever on ESPN's [[Friday Night Fights]] series.

He finally got a shot at the WBA cruiserweight title on May 3, 2008, but lost a unanimous decision to [[Firat Arslan]].

Wilson lost his first fight of Season 4 of [[The Contender (TV series)|The Contender]] to  [[Ehinomen Ehikhamenor]].

==Life Outside the Ring==
Darnell Wilson owns and operates a digital infrastructure firm as a technology [[systems engineer]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2916215|title=Ding-A-Ling-Man ready to sound the alarm on another challenger|first=Joe|last=Tessitore|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2007-06-28|accessdate=2009-10-23}}</ref>
