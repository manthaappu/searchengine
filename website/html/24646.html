<html> <head> <title>Minification (programming)</title></head><body>'''Minification''' (very often just '''minify''', and sometimes also '''minimisation''' or '''minimization'''), in computer [[programming languages]] and especially [[JavaScript]], is the process of removing all unnecessary characters from [[source code]], without changing its functionality. These unnecessary characters usually include [[Whitespace (computer science)|white space characters]], [[Newline|new line characters]], [[source code comment|comments]], and sometimes [[Curly bracket programming language|block delimiters]], which are used to add readability to the code but are not required for it to execute.

Minified source code is especially useful for [[interpreted language]]s deployed and transmitted on the Internet (such as [[JavaScript]]), because it reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred. Minified source code may also be used as a kind of [[Obfuscated code|obfuscation]]. In Perl culture, aiming at extremely minified source code is the purpose of the [[Perl#Perl golf|Perl golf]] game.

Minified source code is also very useful for HTML code. All white space in HTML is reduced to only one space on the surface of a web page, so it's often quite possible to halve the size of a web page, by removing all excessive white space.

===Tools===
Reputed JavaScript optimizers such as JSMin<ref>[http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html JSMin]</ref> and Packer,<ref>[http://dean.edwards.name/packer/ Packer]</ref> themselves programmed in JavaScript, are specially designed for modern web programming techniques, and are able to understand and preserve [[conditional comments]], and similar. Packer, for instance, can optionally [[Base62]] compress the given source code in a manner that can be decompressed by regular [[web browsers]], as well as shrink variable names that are typically 5-10 characters to single letters, which reduces the [[file size]] of the script and, therefore, makes it download faster.<ref>[http://dean.edwards.name/weblog/2007/04/packer3/ Packer version 3.0 feature list]</ref> Google has released their Closure Compiler,<ref>[http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/gettingstarted_ui.html Closure Compiler]</ref> which also provides minification as well as the ability to introduce more aggressive renaming, removing dead code, and providing function inlining. In addition, certain online tools, such as the [[Yahoo!]] YUI Compressor<ref>[http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/ YUI Compressor]</ref> or Pretty Diff,<ref>[http://prettydiff.com/ Pretty Diff]</ref> can compress [[CSS]] files.

===Web development===
Components and libraries for [[Web applications]] and websites have been developed to optimize file requests and quicken page load times by reducing the size of various files.

[[JavaScript]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] resources may be minified, preserving their behavior while considerably reducing their file size. Libraries such as JavaScript Optimizer,<ref>[http://js-optimizer.sourceforge.net JavaScript Optimizer]</ref> pack:tag,<ref>[http://sf.net/projects/packtag pack:tag]</ref> Minify,<ref>[http://code.google.com/p/minify/ Minify]</ref> Lightweight,<ref>[http://razorsharpcode.blogspot.com/2010/02/lightweight-javascript-and-css.html Lightweight]</ref> CssMin,<ref>[http://code.google.com/p/cssmin/ CssMin]</ref> jsmin-php,<ref>[http://github.com/rgrove/jsmin-php/ jsmin-php]</ref> MiniME,<ref>[http://www.toptensoftware.com/minime MiniME]</ref> and ShrinkSafe<ref>[http://shrinksafe.dojotoolkit.org/ ShrinkSafe]</ref> are capable of such on-the-fly optimizations.

Some libraries (such as JAWR<ref>[https://jawr.dev.java.net JAWR]</ref> and CombineAndMinify<ref name="cam">[http://www.codeproject.com/KB/aspnet/CombineAndMinify.aspx CombineAndMinify]</ref>) also merge multiple script files into a single file for client download. This fosters a modular approach to development.

A novel approach to server-side minification is taken by [[Ziproxy]], a forwarding, non-caching, compressing [[Proxy server|HTTP proxy]] targeted for traffic optimization. It minifies and optimizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript resources and, in addition, re-compresses pictures.

Content encoding is an approach taken by compatible [[web servers]] and modern [[web browsers]] to compress HTML and related textual content, often in the [[gzip]] format.
