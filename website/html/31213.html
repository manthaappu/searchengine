'''Randal L. Schwartz''' (born November 22, 1961), also known as '''merlyn''', is an [[United States|American]] author, system administrator and programming consultant.

==Career==
Schwartz is the co-author of several widely used books about [[Perl]], a programming language, and has written regular columns about Perl for several computer magazines. He popularized the [[Just another Perl hacker]] [[signature]] programs. He is a founding board member of the [[Perl Mongers]], the worldwide Perl grassroots advocacy organization. Schwartz is currently a co-host on [[FLOSS Weekly]], a [[free software]]/[[open source]] ([[alternative terms for free software|FLOSS]]) themed [[podcast]].<ref>[http://twit.tv/FLOSS] FLOSS Weekly show page</ref>

Schwartz's name is also associated with the ''[[Schwartzian transform]]'', an [[algorithm]] to efficiently sort a list according to a computation, without repeating the computation many times for each element of the list. Since 1985, Schwartz has owned and operated Stonehenge Consulting Services, Inc.

=== Intel case ===

In July 1995, Schwartz was prosecuted in the case of ''State of Oregon vs. Randal Schwartz'', which dealt with compromised computer security during his time as a system administrator for [[Intel]]; he cracked a number of passwords on Intel's systems.<ref>http://www.lightlink.com/spacenka/fors/police/report-lazenby.html</ref> Schwartz was originally convicted on three felony counts, with one reduced to a misdemeanor, but on February 1, 2007 his arrest and conviction records were sealed through an official [[expungement]] and he is legally no longer a felon.<ref>[http://www.lightlink.com/spacenka/fors/ State of Oregon vs. Randal Schwartz] - Case summary</ref>
