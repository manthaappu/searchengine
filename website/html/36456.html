The '''SystemRDL''' language, supported by the [[SPIRIT Consortium]], was specifically designed to describe and implement a wide variety of [[Control Status Register|control status registers]]. Using SystemRDL, developers can automatically generate and synchronize register views for specification, hardware design, software development, verification, and documentation.
