A '''hard disk drive'''<ref>Other terms used to describe hard disk drives include ''hard drive'',''hard disk'',''disk drive'', ''disk file'', ''[[DASD]]'' (direct-access storage device''), ''fixed disk'', ''CKD disk'', and ''Winchester Disk Drive'' (after the [[Early IBM disk storage|IBM 3340]]). The term DASD includes other devices besides disks.</ref>  (HDD) is a [[non-volatile storage|non-volatile]], [[random access]] device for digital data. It features rotating [[hard disk platters|rigid platters]] on a motor-driven [[spindle (computer)|spindle]] within a protective enclosure. Data is magnetically read and written on the platter by [[Disk read-and-write head|read/write heads]] that float on a film of air above the platters.

Introduced by IBM in 1956, hard disk drives have fallen in cost and physical size over the years while dramatically increasing in capacity. Hard disk drives have been the dominant device for [[computer data storage#Secondary storage|secondary storage]] of data in [[History of general purpose CPUs|general purpose computers]] since the early 1960s.<ref name="Mee">Magnetic Storage Handbook 2nd Ed., Section 2.1.1, Disk File Technology, Mee and Daniel, (c)1990,</ref> They have maintained this position because advances in their areal recording density have kept pace with the requirements for secondary storage.<ref name="Mee" /> Today's HDDs operate on high-speed serial interfaces; i.e., [[serial ATA]] (SATA) or [[serial attached SCSI]] (SAS).

==History==
{{Main|History of hard disk drives}}
Hard disk drives were introduced in 1956 as data storage for an IBM [[accounting]] computer<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_350.html|title=IBM 350 disk storage unit|author=|publisher=[[IBM]]|date=|accessdate=2010-06-24}}</ref> and were developed for use with general purpose [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] and [[minicomputer|mini]] [[computer]]s.

Driven by areal density doubling every two to four years since their invention, HDDs have changed in many ways, a few highlights include:

===Magnetic recording===
{{see also|Magnetic storage}}
[[Image:Hard drive-en.svg|thumb|300px|Diagram of a computer hard disk drive]]
HDDs record data by magnetizing [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] material directionally. Sequential changes in the direction of magnetization represent patterns of binary data bits. The data are read from the disk by detecting the transitions in magnetization and decoding the originally written data. Different encoding schemes, such as [[Modified Frequency Modulation]], [[group code recording]], [[run-length limited]] encoding, and others are used.

A typical HDD design consists of a [[spindle (computer)|spindle]] that holds flat circular disks called [[hard disk platter|platters]], onto which the data are recorded. The platters are made from a non-magnetic material, usually aluminum alloy or glass, and are coated with a shallow layer of magnetic material typically 10–20 [[nanometer|nm]] in depth, with an outer layer of carbon for protection. For reference, standard copy paper is {{convert|0.07|-|0.18|mm|nm}}.<ref>[http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/JuliaSherlis.shtml "Thickness of a Piece of Paper", HyperTextbook.com]</ref>


[[Image:magneticMedia.png|thumb|left|250px|A cross section of the magnetic surface in action. In this case the binary data are encoded using [[frequency modulation]].]]
[[File:Perpendicular Recording Diagram.svg|thumb|right|Perpendicular recording]]

The platters are spun at speeds varying from 3,000 [[RPM]] in energy-efficient portable devices, to 15,000 RPM for high performance servers. Information is written to, and read from a platter as it rotates past devices called [[disk read-and-write head|read-and-write head]]s that operate very close (tens of nanometers in new drives) over the magnetic surface. The read-and-write head is used to detect and modify the magnetization of the material immediately under it. In modern drives there is one head for each magnetic platter surface on the spindle, mounted on a common arm. An actuator arm (or access arm) moves the heads on an arc (roughly radially) across the platters as they spin, allowing each head to access almost the entire surface of the platter as it spins. The arm is moved using a [[voice coil]] actuator or in some older designs a [[stepper motor]].

The magnetic surface of each platter is conceptually divided into many small sub-[[micrometer]]-sized magnetic regions referred to as [[magnetic domains]]. In older disk designs the regions were oriented horizontally and parallel to the disk surface, but beginning about 2005, the orientation was changed to [[perpendicular recording|perpendicular]] to allow for closer magnetic domain spacing. Due to the [[polycrystal]]line nature of the magnetic material each of these magnetic regions is composed of a few hundred magnetic [[crystallite|grains]]. Magnetic grains are typically 10 nm in size and each form a single [[Magnetic domains|magnetic domain]]. Each magnetic region in total forms a [[magnetic dipole]] which generates a [[magnetic field]].

For reliable storage of data, the recording material needs to resist self-demagnetization, which occurs when the magnetic domains repel each other. Magnetic domains written too densely together to a weakly magnetizable material will degrade over time due to physical rotation of one or more domains to cancel out these forces. The domains rotate sideways to a halfway position that weakens the readability of the domain and relieves the magnetic stresses. Older hard disks used [[iron(III) oxide]] as the magnetic material, but current disks use a [[cobalt]]-based alloy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnetasia.com/a-divide-over-the-future-of-hard-drives-39393818.htm|title=A divide over the future of hard drives|author=Kanellos, Michael|publisher=CNETNews.com|date=2006-08-24 |accessdate=2010-06-24}}</ref>

A write head magnetizes a region by generating a strong local magnetic field. Early HDDs used an [[electromagnet]] both to magnetize the region and to then read its magnetic field by using [[electromagnetic induction]]. Later versions of inductive heads included metal in Gap (MIG) heads and [[thin film]] heads. As data density increased, read heads using [[magnetoresistance]] (MR) came into use; the electrical resistance of the head changed according to the strength of the magnetism from the platter. Later development made use of [[spintronics]]; in these heads, the magnetoresistive effect was much greater than in earlier types, and was dubbed [[giant magnetoresistance|"giant" magnetoresistance]] (GMR). In today's heads, the read and write elements are separate, but in close proximity, on the head portion of an actuator arm. The read element is typically [[giant magnetoresistance|magneto-resistive]] while the write element is typically thin-film inductive.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www1.hitachigst.com/hdd/technolo/gmr/gmr.htm|title=IBM OEM MR Head &#124; Technology &#124; The era of giant magnetoresistive heads |publisher=Hitachigst.com|date=2001-08-27|accessdate=2010-09-04}}</ref>

The heads are kept from contacting the platter surface by the air that is extremely close to the platter; that air moves at or near the platter speed. The record and playback head are mounted on a block called a slider, and the surface next to the platter is shaped to keep it just barely out of contact. This forms a type of air bearing.

In modern drives, the small size of the magnetic regions creates the danger that their magnetic state might be lost because of thermal effects. To counter this, the platters are coated with two parallel magnetic layers, separated by a 3-atom layer of the non-magnetic element [[ruthenium]], and the two layers are magnetized in opposite orientation, thus reinforcing each other.<ref>Brian Hayes, [http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/14750 Terabyte Territory], ''[[American Scientist]]'', Vol 90 No 3 (May–June 2002) p. 212</ref> Another technology used to overcome thermal effects to allow greater recording densities is [[perpendicular recording]], first shipped in 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2004_12/pr1401.htm |title=Press Releases December 14, 2004 |publisher=Toshiba |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref> and as of 2007 the technology was used in many HDDs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/products/laptops/momentus/|title=Seagate Momentus 2½" HDDs per webpage Jan 2008 |publisher=Seagate.com |date=2008-10-24 |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/products/desktops/barracuda_hard_drives/|title=Seagate Barracuda 3½" HDDs per webpage January 2008 |publisher=Seagate.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdc.com/en/company/investor/q108remarks.asp|title=Western Digital Scorpio 2½" and Greenpower 3½" HDDs per quarterly conference, July 2007|publisher=Wdc.com|date=|accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>

===Components===
[[Image:Hard disk dismantled.jpg|thumb|left|A hard disk drive with the disks and motor hub removed showing the copper colored stator coils surrounding a bearing at the center of the spindle motor. The orange stripe along the side of the arm is a thin printed-circuit cable. The spindle bearing is in the center. The actuator is in the upper left.]]
A typical hard disk drive has two electric motors; a disk motor to spin the disks and an actuator (motor) to position the read/write head assembly across the spinning disks. 

The disk motor has an external rotor attached to the disks; the stator windings are fixed in place. 

Opposite the actuator at the end of the head support arm is the  read-write head (near center in photo); thin printed-circuit cables connect the read-write heads to amplifier electronics mounted at the pivot of the actuator. A flexible, somewhat U-shaped, ribbon cable, seen edge-on below and to the left of the actuator arm continues the connection to the controller board on the opposite side.

The head support arm is very light, but also stiff; in modern drives, acceleration at the head reaches 550 [[g-force|''G''s]].

The silver-colored structure at the upper left of the first image is the top plate of the actuator, a permanent-magnet and moving coil motor that swings the heads to the desired position (it is shown removed in the second image). The plate supports a squat [[neodymium magnet|neodymium-iron-boron]] (NIB) high-flux [[magnet]]. Beneath this plate is the moving coil, often referred to as the ''[[voice coil]]'' by analogy to the coil in [[loudspeaker]]s, which is attached to the actuator hub, and beneath that is a second NIB magnet, mounted on the bottom plate of the motor (some drives only have one magnet).

The voice coil itself is shaped rather like an arrowhead, and made of doubly coated copper [[magnet wire]]. The inner layer is insulation, and the outer is thermoplastic, which bonds the coil together after it is wound on a form, making it self-supporting. The portions of the coil along the two sides of the arrowhead (which point to the actuator bearing center) interact with the [[magnetic field]], developing a tangential force that rotates the actuator. Current flowing radially outward along one side of the arrowhead and radially inward on the other produces the [[magnetic field#Force on a charged particle|tangential force]]. If the magnetic field were uniform, each side would generate opposing forces that would cancel each other out. Therefore the surface of the magnet is half N pole, half S pole, with the radial dividing line in the middle, causing the two sides of the coil to see opposite magnetic fields and produce forces that add instead of canceling. Currents along the top and bottom of the coil produce radial forces that do not rotate the head.

===Error handling===
Modern drives also make extensive use of [[Error Correcting Code]]s (ECCs), particularly [[Reed–Solomon error correction]]. These techniques store extra bits for each block of data that are determined by mathematical formulas. The extra bits allow many errors to be fixed. While these extra bits take up space on the hard drive, they allow higher recording densities to be employed, resulting in much larger storage capacity for user data.<ref>[http://www.storagereview.com/guide2000/ref/hdd/geom/errorECC.html Error Correcting Code], Storage Review</ref> In 2009, in the newest drives, [[low-density parity-check code]]s (LDPC) are supplanting Reed-Solomon. LDPC codes enable performance close to the [[Shannon Limit]] and thus allow for the highest storage density available.<ref>[http://www.hitachigst.com/tech/techlib.nsf/techdocs/FB376A33027F5A5F86257509001463AE/$file/IDRC_WP_final.pdf "Iterative Detection Read Channel Technology in Hard Disk Drives"], Hitachi</ref>

Typical hard drives attempt to "remap" the data in a physical sector that is going bad to a spare physical sector—hopefully while the errors in that bad sector are still few enough that the ECC can recover the data without loss. The [[S.M.A.R.T.]] system counts the total number of errors in the entire hard drive fixed by ECC, and the total number of remappings, in an attempt to predict hard drive failure.

===Future development===
Because of bit-flipping errors and other issues, perpendicular recording densities may be supplanted by other magnetic recording technologies. Toshiba is promoting [[bit-patterned recording]] (BPR),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2368023,00.asp |title=Will Toshiba's Bit-Patterned Drives Change the HDD Landscape?|publisher=PC Magazine|date=2010-08-19|accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref> whiles Xyratex are developing [[heat-assisted magnetic recording]] (HAMR).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/05/24/xyratex_hamr/ |title=Xyratex no-go for bit-patterned media |publisher=The Register |date=2010-04-24 |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref>

==Capacity ==
[[Image:Hard drive capacity over time.svg|right|thumb|[[personal computer|PC]] hard disk drive capacity (in [[gigabytes|GB]]) over time. The vertical axis is [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]], so the fit line corresponds to [[exponential growth]].]]

===Capacity measurements===
[[Image:HardDiskAnatomy.jpg|right|thumb|A disassembled and labeled 1997 hard drive. All major components were placed on a mirror, which created the symmetrical reflections.]]

Hard disk manufacturers quote disk capacity in  multiples of [[SI prefix|SI]]-standard powers of 1000, where a ''terabyte'' is 1000 gigabytes and a ''gigabyte'' is 1000 megabytes. With [[file system]]s that report capacity in powers of 1024, available space appears somewhat less than advertised capacity. The discrepancy between the two methods of reporting sizes had serious financial consequences for at least one hard drive manufacturer when a [[class action suit]] argued the different methods effectively misled consumers.<ref>http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,201269,00.html Western Digital Settles Hard-Drive Capacity Lawsuit, Associated Press June 28, 2006 retrieved 2010 Nov 25</ref>

Semiconductor memory chips are organized so that memory sizes are expressed in multiples of powers of two. Hard disks by contrast have no inherent binary size. Capacity is the product of the number of heads, number of tracks, number of sectors per track, and the size of each sector. Sector sizes are standardized for convenience at 256 or 512 and more recently 4096 bytes, which are powers of two. This can cause some confusion because operating systems may report the formatted capacity of a hard drive using [[binary prefix]] units which increment by powers of 1024. For example, [[Microsoft Windows]] reports disk capacity both in a decimal [[integer]] to 12 or more digits and in binary prefix units to three significant digits.

A one terabyte (1 TB) disk drive would be expected to hold around 1 trillion bytes (1,000,000,000,000) or 1000 GB; and indeed most 1 TB hard drives will contain slightly more than this number. However some operating system utilities would report this as around 931 GB or 953,674 MB. (The actual number for a formatted capacity will be somewhat smaller still, [[comparison of file systems|depending on the file system]].) Following are the several ways of reporting one Terabyte.

===Addressing data on large drives===
The capacity of an HDD can be calculated by multiplying the number of [[Cylinder (disk drive)|cylinders]] by the number of heads by the number of [[Disk sector|sectors]] by the number of bytes/sector (most commonly 512). Drives with the [[AT Attachment|ATA]] interface and a capacity of eight gigabytes or more behave as if they were structured into 16383 cylinders, 16 heads, and 63 sectors, for compatibility with older operating systems. Unlike in the 1980s, the [[Cylinder-head-sector|cylinder, head, sector]] (C/H/S) counts reported to the CPU by a modern ATA drive are no longer actual physical parameters since the reported numbers are constrained by historic operating-system interfaces and with [[zone bit recording]] the actual number of sectors varies by zone. Disks with [[SCSI]] interface address each sector with a unique integer number; the operating system remains ignorant of their head or cylinder count.

The old C/H/S scheme has been replaced by [[logical block addressing]]. In some cases, to try to "force-fit" the C/H/S scheme to large-capacity drives, the number of heads was given as 64, although no modern drive has anywhere near 32 platters.

Not all the space on a hard drive is available for user files. The operating system [[file system]] uses some of the disk space to organize files on the disk, recording their file names and the sequence of disk areas that represent the file.  Examples of data structures stored on disk to retrieve files include the [[MS DOS]] [[file allocation table]] (FAT), and [[UNIX]]  [[inodes]], as well as other operating system data structures. This file system overhead is usually less than 1% on drives larger than 100 MB.

For [[RAID]] drives, data integrity and fault-tolerance requirements also reduce the realized capacity. For example, a RAID1 drive will be about half the total capacity as a result of data mirroring. For RAID5 drives with x drives you would lose 1/x of your space to parity. RAID drives are multiple drives that appear to be one drive to the user, but provides some fault-tolerance.

A general rule of thumb to quickly convert the manufacturer's hard disk capacity to the standard [[Microsoft Windows]] formatted capacity is 0.93*capacity of HDD from manufacturer for HDDs less than a terabyte and 0.91*capacity of HDD from manufacturer for HDDs equal to or greater than 1 terabyte.

=== HDD Formatting ===
{{Main|Disk formatting}}

The presentation of an HDD to its host is determined by its [[disk controller|controller]]. This may differ substantially from the drive's native [[interface]] particularly in [[mainframe computer|mainframes]] or [[server computer|servers]].

Modern HDDs, such as SAS<ref>{{epigraph

logical block on the logical unit.

}}</ref>
and SATA<ref>ISO/IEC 791D:1994, AT Attachment Interface for Disk Drives (ATA-1), section 7.1.2</ref>
drives, appear at their interfaces as a contiguous set of logical blocks; typically 512 bytes long but the industry is in the process of changing to 4,096 byte logical blocks; see [[Advanced Format]].<ref>[http://www.anandtech.com/show/2888 Western Digital's Advanced Format: The 4K Sector Transition Begins]</ref>

The process of initializing these logical blocks on the physical disk platters is called ''low level formatting'' which is usually performed at the factory and is not normally changed in the field.<ref>See: [http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/geom/formatLow-c.html Low-Level Formatting]. However, some enterprise SAS drives (e.g. [http://www.seagate.com/docs/pdf/datasheet/disc/ds_constellation_es.pdf Seagate Constellation ES]) have other block sizes such as 520, 524 and 528 bytes which can be changed in the field.</ref> ''High level formatting'' then writes the [[file system]] structures into selected logical blocks to make the remaining logical blocks available to the host [[Operating system|OS]] and its applications.<ref>[http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/geom/formatHigh-c.html High-Level Formatting]</ref>

==Speed==
The factors that limit the speed of data transfer of a hard drive are mostly related to the mechanical nature of the rotating disks and moving heads. [[Seek time]] is a measure of how long it takes the head assembly to travel to the track of the disk that contains data. [[Rotational delay]] is incurred because the desired disk sector may not be directly under the head when data transfer is requested.  These two delays are on the order of milliseconds each. The [[bit rate]] or data transfer speed once the head is in the right position creates lesser delays. A further delay mechanism occurs when the drive disks are stopped to save energy, such as in a laptop computer when operating on batteries; this can add hundreds of milliseconds of delay until data can be moved.

[[Defragmentation]] is a procedure used to minimize delay in retrieving data by moving related items to physically proximate areas on the disk.<ref name="itworld-2001-04-18">

[[Access time]] can be improved by increasing rotational speed, thus reducing [[rotational delay]] and/or by decreasing seek time.  Increasing areal density increases [[throughput]] by increasing data rate and by increasing the amount of data under a set of heads, thereby potentially reducing seek activity for a given amount of data. Based on historic trends, analysts predict a future growth in HDD areal density (and therefore capacity) of about 40% per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardwarezone.com.ph/articles/view.php?cid=1&id=1805&pg=2|title=Seagate Outlines the Future of Storage :: Articles :: www.hardwarezone.com|publisher=www.hardwarezone.com|date=2006-01-27|accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref> [[Access time]]s have not kept up with throughput increases, which themselves have not kept up with growth in storage capacity.

===Seek time===
[[Seek time]] for non-sequential data ranges from 3 [[millisecond|ms]]<ref name="WD-VRaptor Specs">{{cite web|date=June 2010|url=http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=20|title=WD VelicoRaptor: Drive Specifications|publisher=[[Western Digital]]|accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref> for high-end server drives, to 15 ms for mobile drives, with the most common mobile drives at about 12 [[Millisecond|ms]]<ref name="WD-Scorpio Blue-specs">{{cite web|date=June 2010|url=http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=140|title=WD Scorpio Blue Mobile: Drive Specifications|publisher=[[Western Digital]]|accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref> and the most common desktop type typically being around 9 ms.
The [http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_350.html first HDD] had an average seek time of about 600 ms and by the middle 1970s HDDs were available with seek times of about [http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/storage/storage_3350.html 25 ms]. Some early PC drives used a [[stepper motor]] to move the heads, and as a result had seek times as slow as 80–120 ms, but this was quickly improved by [[voice coil]] type actuation in the 1980s, reducing seek times to around 20 ms. Seek time has continued to improve slowly over time.

==Form factors==
[[Image:5.25 inch MFM hard disk drive.JPG|thumb|5¼″ full height 110 MB HDD,<br />2½″ (8.5 mm) 6495 MB HDD,<br />US/UK pennies for comparison.]]

[[Image:SixHardDriveFormFactors.jpg|thumb|Six hard drives with 8″, 5.25″, 3.5″, 2.5″, 1.8″, and 1″ disks, partially disassembled to show platters and read-write heads, with a ruler showing inches.]]

Mainframe and minicomputer hard disks were of widely varying dimensions, typically in free standing cabinets the size of washing machines (e.g. [http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/rp06.html DEC RP06 Disk Drive]) or designed so that dimensions enabled placement in a [[19 inch rack|19" rack]] (e.g. [http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/diablo/81502A_Model30descr_Sep75.pdf Diablo Model 31]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}). In 1962, IBM introduced its model 1311 disk, which used 14 inch (nominal size) platters. This became a standard size for mainframe and minicomputer drives for many years,<ref>Emerson W. Pugh, Lyle R. Johnson, John H. Palmer ''IBM's 360 and early 370 systems'' MIT Press, 1991 ISBN 0262161230, page 266</ref> but such large platters were never used with microprocessor-based systems. 

With increasing sales of microcomputers having built in [[floppy disk|floppy-disk drives (FDDs)]], HDDs that would fit to the FDD mountings became desirable, and this led to the evolution of the market towards drives with certain '''Form factors''', initially derived from the sizes of 8-inch, 5.25-inch, and 3.5-inch floppy disk drives. Smaller sizes than 3.5 inches have emerged as popular in the marketplace and/or been decided by various industry groups.

*'''8 inch:''' {{val|9.5|u=in}} × {{val|4.624|u=in}} × {{val|14.25|u=in}} ({{val|241.3|u=mm}} × {{val|117.5|u=mm}} × {{val|362|u=mm}})<br/>In 1979, [[Shugart Associates]]' SA1000 was the first form factor compatible HDD, having the same dimensions and a compatible interface to the 8″ FDD.

3.5-inch and 2.5-inch hard disks currently dominate the market.

By 2009 all manufacturers had discontinued the development of new products for the 1.3-inch, 1-inch and 0.85-inch form factors due to falling prices of [[flash memory]].<ref>[http://www.eetasia.com/ART_8800474064_499486_NT_3335be30.HTM Flash price fall shakes HDD market], EETimes Asia, August 1, 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.samsung.com/global/business/hdd/newsView.do?b2b_bbs_msg_id=143 In 2008 Samsung] introduced the 1.3-inch SpinPoint A1 HDD but by March 2009 the family was listed as [http://www.samsung.com/global/business/hdd/products/Product_EOLProducts.html End Of Life Products] and new new 1.3-inch models were not available in this size.</ref>

The inch-based nickname of all these form factors usually do not indicate any actual product dimension (which are specified in millimeters for more recent form factors), but just roughly indicate a size relative to disk diameters, in the interest of historic continuity.

==Performance characteristics==
===Data transfer rate===
As of 2010, a typical 7200 rpm desktop hard drive has a sustained "disk-to-[[disk buffer|buffer]]" data transfer rate up to 1030
Mbits/sec. <ref> Seagate Web Site [http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/support/before_you_buy/speed_considerations "Speed Considerations" , ''[[Seagate Web Site]'',  Retrieved on 2011-01-22.</ref>
This rate depends on the track location, so it will be higher for data on the outer tracks (where there are more data sectors) and lower toward the inner tracks (where there are fewer data sectors); and is generally somewhat higher for 10,000 rpm drives. A current widely used standard for the "buffer-to-computer" interface is 3.0 Gbit/s SATA, which can send about 300 megabyte/s from the buffer to the computer, and thus is still comfortably ahead of today's disk-to-buffer transfer rates. Data transfer rate (read/write) can be measured by writing a large file to disk using special file generator tools, then reading back the file. Transfer rate can be influenced by [[file system fragmentation]] and the layout of the files.<ref name="itworld-2001-04-18"/>

The mechanical nature of hard disks introduces certain performance compromises. The manipulation of sequential data depends upon the rotational speed of the platters and the data recording density. Because heat and vibration limit rotational speed, advancing density becomes the sole method to improve sequential transfer rates.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} While these advances increase both storage capacity and performance, the performance gains are on a far slower curve than that of capacity improvement.

===Power consumption===
[[Power consumption]] has become increasingly important, not just in mobile devices such as laptops but also in server and desktop markets. Increasing data center machine density has led to problems delivering sufficient power to devices (especially for spin up), and getting rid of the waste heat subsequently produced, as well as environmental and electrical cost concerns (see [[green computing]]). Heat dissipation directly tied to power consumption, and as drive age, disk failure rates increase at higher drive temperatures.<ref name="xbit-2007-12-06">

}}</ref> Similar issues exist for large companies with thousands of desktop PCs. Smaller form factor drives often use less power than larger drives. One interesting development in this area is actively controlling the seek speed so that the head arrives at its destination only just in time to read the sector, rather than arriving as quickly as possible and then having to wait for the sector to come around (i.e. the rotational latency).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Many of the hard drive companies are now producing Green Drives that require much less power and cooling. Many of these Green Drives spin slower (<5,400 rpm compared to 7,200, 10,000 or 15,000 rpm) and also generate less waste heat.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Power consumption can also be reduced by parking the drive heads when the disk is not in use reducing friction, adjusting spin speeds according to transfer rates, and disabling internal components when not in use.<ref>

Also in systems where there might be multiple hard disk drives, there are various ways of controlling when the hard drives spin up since the highest current is drawn at that time.

*On SCSI hard disk drives, the SCSI controller can directly control spin up and spin down of the drives.

*On [[Parallel ATA]] (aka PATA) and [[Serial ATA]] (SATA) hard disk drives, some support [[power-up in standby]] or PUIS. The hard disk drive will not spin up until the controller or system BIOS issues a specific command to do so. This limits the power draw or consumption upon power on.

*Some SATA II hard disk drives support staggered spin-up, allowing the computer to spin up the drives in sequence to reduce load on the power supply when booting.<ref>

To further control or reduce power consumption, the hard disk drive can be spun down when not in use to reduce its power consumption.

===Audible noise===
Measured in [[A-weighting|dBA]], audible noise is significant for certain applications, such as [[digital video recorder|PVR]]s, digital audio recording and [[quiet PC|quiet computers]]. Low noise disks typically use [[fluid bearing]]s, slower rotational speeds (usually 5,400 rpm) and reduce the seek speed under load ([[Automatic Acoustic Management|AAM]]) to reduce audible clicks and crunching sounds. Drives in smaller form factors (e.g. 2.5 inch) are often quieter than larger drives.

===Shock resistance===
Shock resistance is especially important for mobile devices. Some laptops now include [[active hard drive protection]] that parks the disk heads if the machine is dropped, hopefully before impact, to offer the greatest possible chance of survival in such an event. Maximum shock tolerance to date is 350 [[Gravitational acceleration|g]] for operating and 1000 g for non-operating.<ref>[http://www.seagate.com/ww/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=5fb658a3fd20a110VgnVCM100000f5ee0a0aRCRD Momentus 5400.5 SATA 3Gb/s 320-GB Hard Drive]</ref>

==Access and interfaces==
{{Ref improve section|date=July 2009}}

Hard disk drives are accessed over one of a number of bus types, including parallel [[Advanced Technology Attachment|ATA]] (P-ATA, also called IDE or [[AT Attachment#EIDE and ATA-2|EIDE]]), [[Serial ATA]] (SATA), [[SCSI]], [[Serial Attached SCSI]] (SAS), and [[Fibre Channel]]. Bridge circuitry is sometimes used to connect hard disk drives to buses that they cannot communicate with natively, such as [[IEEE 1394 interface|IEEE 1394]], [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] and [[Small Computer System Interface|SCSI]].

For the [[ST-506]] interface, the data [[encoder|encoding]] scheme as written to the disk surface was also important. The first ST-506 disks used [[Modified Frequency Modulation]] (MFM) encoding, and transferred data at a rate of 5 [[megabit]]s per second. Later controllers using 2,7 [[Run Length Limited|RLL]] (or just "RLL") encoding caused 50% more data to appear under the heads compared to one rotation of an MFM drive, increasing data storage and data transfer rate by 50%, to 7.5 megabits per second.

Many ST-506 interface disk drives were only specified by the manufacturer to run at the 1/3rd lower MFM data transfer rate compared to RLL, while other drive models (usually more expensive versions of the same drive) were specified to run at the higher RLL data transfer rate. In some cases, a drive had sufficient margin to allow the MFM specified model to run at the denser/faster RLL data transfer rate (not recommended nor guaranteed by manufacturers). Also, any RLL-certified drive could run on any MFM controller, but with 1/3 less data capacity and as much as 1/3rd less data transfer rate compared to its RLL specifications.

[[Enhanced Small Disk Interface]] (ESDI) also supported multiple data rates (ESDI disks always used 2,7 RLL, but at 10, 15 or 20 megabits per second), but this was usually negotiated automatically by the disk drive and controller; most of the time, however, 15 or 20 megabit ESDI disk drives weren't downward compatible (i.e. a 15 or 20 megabit disk drive wouldn't run on a 10 megabit controller). ESDI disk drives typically also had jumpers to set the number of sectors per track and (in some cases) sector size.

Modern hard drives present a consistent interface to the rest of the computer, no matter what data encoding scheme is used internally. Typically a [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] in the electronics inside the hard drive takes the raw analog voltages from the read head and uses [[Partial Response Maximum Likelihood|PRML]] and [[Reed–Solomon error correction]]<ref>[http://gaussianwaves.blogspot.com/2008/06/reed-solomon-codes-introduction.html "Reed Solomon Codes - Introduction"] <!-- I wish I had a better reference --></ref> to decode the sector boundaries and sector data, then sends that data out the standard interface. That DSP also watches the error rate detected by [[error detection and correction]], and performs [[bad sector]] remapping, data collection for [[Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology]], and other internal tasks.

[[SCSI]] originally had just one signaling frequency of 5 [[Hertz|MHz]] for a maximum data rate of 5 [[megabyte]]s/second over 8 parallel conductors, but later this was increased dramatically. The SCSI bus speed had no bearing on the disk's internal speed because of buffering between the SCSI bus and the disk drive's internal data bus; however, many early disk drives had very small buffers, and thus had to be reformatted to a different interleave (just like ST-506 disks) when used on slow computers, such as early [[Amiga#Peripherals|Commodore Amiga]], [[IBM PC compatible]]s and [[Apple Macintosh]]es.

ATA disks have typically had no problems with interleave or data rate, due to their controller design, but many early models were incompatible with each other and couldn't run with two devices on the same physical cable in a master/slave setup. This was mostly remedied by the mid-1990s, when ATA's specification was standardized and the details began to be cleaned up, but still causes problems occasionally (especially with CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks, and when mixing [[Ultra DMA]] and non-UDMA devices).

Serial ATA does away with master/slave setups entirely, placing each disk on its own channel (with its own set of I/O ports) instead.

FireWire/IEEE 1394 and USB(1.0/2.0) HDDs are external units containing generally ATA or SCSI disks with ports on the back allowing very simple and effective expansion and mobility. Most FireWire/IEEE 1394 models are able to [[Daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy-chain]] in order to continue adding peripherals without requiring additional ports on the computer itself. USB however, is a point to point network and doesn't allow for daisy-chaining. USB hubs are used to increase the number of available ports and are used for devices that don't require charging since the current supplied by hubs is typically lower than what's available from the built-in USB ports.

===Disk interface families used in personal computers===
Notable families of disk interfaces include:
[[Image:Pata hdds.jpg|thumb|300px|Several Parallel ATA hard disk drives]]

*Historical '''bit serial interfaces''' connect a hard disk drive (HDD) to a hard disk controller (HDC) with two cables, one for control and one for data. (Each drive also has an additional cable for power, usually connecting it directly to the power supply unit). The HDC provided significant functions such as serial/parallel conversion, data separation, and track formatting, and required matching to the drive (after formatting) in order to assure reliability. Each control cable could serve two or more drives, while a dedicated (and smaller) data cable served each drive.
**ST506 used [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]] (Modified Frequency Modulation) for the data encoding method.
**ST412 was available in either MFM or [[Run Length Limited|RLL]] (Run Length Limited) encoding variants.
**[[Enhanced Small Disk Interface]] (ESDI) was an industry standard interface similar to ST412 supporting higher data rates between the processor and the disk drive.

*Modern '''bit serial interfaces''' connect a hard disk drive to a host bus interface adapter (today typically integrated into the "[[Southbridge (computing)|south bridge]]") with one data/control cable. (As for historical ''bit serial interfaces'' above, each drive also has an additional power cable, usually direct to the power supply unit.)
**[[Fibre Channel]] (FC), is a successor to parallel SCSI interface on enterprise market. It is a serial protocol. In disk drives usually the [[Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop]] (FC-AL) connection topology is used. FC has much broader usage than mere disk interfaces, and it is the cornerstone of [[storage area network]]s (SANs). Recently other protocols for this field, like [[iSCSI]] and [[ATA over Ethernet]] have been developed as well. Confusingly, drives usually use ''copper'' twisted-pair cables for Fibre Channel, not fibre optics. The latter are traditionally reserved for larger devices, such as servers or [[disk array controller]]s.
**[[Serial ATA]] (SATA). The SATA data cable has one data pair for differential transmission of data to the device, and one pair for differential receiving from the device, just like [[EIA-422]]. That requires that data be transmitted serially. Similar [[differential signaling]] system is used in [[RS485]], [[LocalTalk]], [[USB]], [[Firewire]], and differential [[SCSI]].
**[[Serial Attached SCSI]] (SAS). The SAS is a new generation serial communication protocol for devices designed to allow for much higher speed data transfers and is compatible with SATA. SAS uses a mechanically identical data and power connector to standard 3.5-inch SATA1/SATA2 HDDs, and many server-oriented SAS RAID controllers are also capable of addressing SATA hard drives. SAS uses serial communication instead of the parallel method found in traditional SCSI devices but still uses SCSI commands.

[[File:Seagate ST33232A hard disk inner view.jpg|thumb|right|Inner view of a 1998 [[Seagate Technology|Seagate]] hard disk drive which used [[Parallel ATA]] interface]]
*'''Word serial interfaces''' connect a hard disk drive to a host bus adapter (today typically integrated into the "[[Southbridge (computing)|south bridge]]") with one cable for combined data/control. (As for all ''bit serial interfaces'' above, each drive also has an additional power cable, usually direct to the power supply unit.) The earliest versions of these interfaces typically had a 8 bit parallel data transfer to/from the drive, but 16-bit versions became much more common, and there are 32 bit versions. Modern variants have serial data transfer. The word nature of data transfer makes the design of a host bus adapter significantly simpler than that of the precursor HDD controller.
**[[Integrated Drive Electronics]] (IDE), later renamed to ATA, with the alias P-ATA ("parallel ATA") retroactively added upon introduction of the new variant [[Serial ATA]]. The original name reflected the innovative integration of HDD controller with HDD itself, which was not found in earlier disks. Moving the HDD controller from the interface card to the disk drive helped to standardize interfaces, and to reduce the cost and complexity. The 40-pin IDE/ATA connection transfers 16 bits of data at a time on the data cable. The data cable was originally 40-conductor, but later higher speed requirements for data transfer to and from the hard drive led to an "ultra DMA" mode, known as [[AT Attachment#Parallel ATA interface|UDMA]]. Progressively swifter versions of this standard ultimately added the requirement for a 80-conductor variant of the same cable, where half of the conductors provides [[ground (electricity)|grounding]] necessary for enhanced high-speed signal quality by reducing [[crosstalk (electronics)|cross talk]]. The interface for 80-conductor only has 39 pins, the missing pin acting as a key to prevent incorrect insertion of the connector to an incompatible socket, a common cause of disk and controller damage.
**EIDE was an unofficial update (by Western Digital) to the original IDE standard, with the key improvement being the use of [[direct memory access]] (DMA) to transfer data between the disk and the computer without the involvement of the [[central processing unit|CPU]], an improvement later adopted by the official ATA standards. By directly transferring data between memory and disk, DMA eliminates the need for the CPU to copy byte per byte, therefore allowing it to process other tasks while the data transfer occurs.
**[[Small Computer System Interface]] (SCSI), originally named SASI for Shugart Associates System Interface, was an early competitor of ESDI. SCSI disks were standard on servers, workstations, [[Amiga#Peripherals|Commodore Amiga]], and [[Apple Macintosh]] computers through the mid-1990s, by which time most models had been transitioned to IDE (and later, SATA) family disks. Only in 2005 did the capacity of SCSI disks fall behind IDE disk technology, though the highest-performance disks are still available in SCSI and Fibre Channel only. The range limitations of the data cable allows for external SCSI devices. Originally SCSI data cables used single ended (common mode) data transmission, but server class SCSI could use differential transmission, either [[low-voltage differential signaling|low voltage differential]] (LVD) or [[Differential signaling#High-voltage differential signaling|high voltage differential]] (HVD). ("Low" and "High" voltages for differential SCSI are relative to SCSI standards and do not meet the meaning of low voltage and high voltage as used in general electrical engineering contexts, as apply e.g. to statutory electrical codes; both LVD and HVD use low voltage signals (3.3 V and 5 V respectively) in general terminology.)

==Integrity==
[[Image:Hdhead.jpg|thumb|right|An IBM HDD head resting on a disk platter. Since the drive is not in operation, the head is simply pressed against the disk by the suspension.]]
[[Image:Hard disk head.jpg|thumb|left|Close-up of a hard disk head resting on a disk platter. A reflection of the head and its suspension is visible on the mirror-like disk.]]

Due to the extremely close spacing between the heads and the disk surface, hard disk drives are vulnerable to being damaged by a [[head crash]]—a [[hard disk failure|failure]] of the disk in which the head scrapes across the platter surface, often grinding away the thin magnetic film and causing data loss. Head crashes can be caused by electronic failure, a sudden power failure, physical shock, contamination of the drive's internal enclosure, wear and tear, [[corrosion]], or poorly manufactured platters and heads.

The HDD's spindle system relies on air pressure inside the [[disk enclosure]] to support the heads at their proper ''flying height'' while the disk rotates. Hard disk drives require a certain range of air pressures in order to operate properly. The connection to the external environment and pressure occurs through a small hole in the enclosure (about 0.5 mm in breadth), usually with a filter on the inside (the ''breather filter'').<ref>[http://www.alasir.com/books/hards/022-024.html Micro House PC Hardware Library Volume I: Hard Drives, Scott Mueler, Macmillan Computer Publishing]</ref> If the air pressure is too low, then there is not enough lift for the flying head, so the head gets too close to the disk, and there is a risk of head crashes and data loss. Specially manufactured sealed and pressurized disks are needed for reliable high-altitude operation, above about 3,000 m (10,000 feet).<ref>[http://www.waea.org/committees/technology/other_tech_documents/harddisk.pdf Waea.org], Ruggedized Disk Drives for Commercial Airborne Computer Systems</ref> Modern disks include temperature sensors and adjust their operation to the operating environment.
Breather holes can be seen on all disk drives—they usually have a sticker next to them, warning the user not to cover the holes. The air inside the operating drive is constantly moving too, being swept in motion by friction with the spinning platters. This air passes through an internal recirculation (or "recirc") filter to remove any leftover contaminants from manufacture, any particles or chemicals that may have somehow entered the enclosure, and any particles or outgassing generated internally in normal operation.
Very high humidity for extended periods can corrode the heads and platters.

For [[giant magnetoresistive effect|giant magnetoresistive]] (GMR) heads in particular, a minor head crash from contamination (that does not remove the magnetic surface of the disk) still results in the head temporarily overheating, due to friction with the disk surface, and can render the data unreadable for a short period until the head temperature stabilizes (so called "thermal asperity", a problem which can partially be dealt with by proper electronic filtering of the read signal).

===Actuation of moving arm===
{{Refimprove|section|date=November 2010}}
The hard drive's electronics control the movement of the actuator and the rotation of the disk, and perform reads and writes on demand from the [[disk controller]]. Feedback of the drive electronics is accomplished by means of special segments of the disk dedicated to servo feedback. These are either complete concentric circles (in the case of dedicated servo technology), or segments interspersed with real data (in the case of embedded servo technology). The servo feedback optimizes the signal to noise ratio of the GMR sensors by adjusting the voice-coil of the actuated arm. The spinning of the disk also uses a servo motor. Modern disk firmware is capable of scheduling reads and writes efficiently on the platter surfaces and remapping sectors of the media which have failed.

===Landing zones and load/unload technology===
[[Image:Rwheadmacro.jpg|thumb|right|A read/write head from a circa-1998 Fujitsu 3.5-inch hard disk. The area pictured is approximately 2.0 mm x 3.0mm.]]
[[Image:Rwheadmicro.JPG|thumb|right|[[Micrograph|Microphotograph]] of an older generation hard disk head and slider (1990s). The size of the front face (which is the "trailing face" of the slider) is about 0.3 mm × 1.0 mm. It is the location of the actual head (magnetic sensors). The non-visible bottom face of the slider is about 1.0 mm × 1.25 mm (so-called "nano" size) and faces the platter. It contains the lithographically micro-machined air bearing surface (ABS) that allows the slider to fly in a highly controlled fashion. One functional part of the head is the round, orange structure visible in the middle—the [[photolithography|lithographically]] defined copper coil of the write [[transducer]]. Also note the electric connections by wires bonded to gold-plated pads.]]

Modern HDDs prevent power interruptions or other malfunctions from landing its heads in the data zone by '''parking''' the heads either in a '''landing zone''' or by unloading (i.e., '''load/unload''') the heads. Some early PC HDDs did not park the heads automatically and they would land on data. In some other early units the user manually parked the heads by running a program to park the HDD's heads.

A '''landing zone''' is an area of the platter usually near its inner diameter (ID), where no data are stored. This area is called the Contact Start/Stop (CSS) zone. Disks are designed such that either a [[spring (device)|spring]] or, more recently, rotational [[inertia]] in the platters is used to park the heads in the case of unexpected power loss. In this case, the [[brushless DC electric motor|spindle motor]] temporarily acts as a [[electrical generator|generator]], providing power to the actuator.

Spring tension from the head mounting constantly pushes the heads towards the platter. While the disk is spinning, the heads are supported by an air bearing and experience no physical contact or wear. In CSS drives the sliders carrying the head sensors (often also just called ''heads'') are designed to survive a number of landings and takeoffs from the media surface, though wear and tear on these microscopic components eventually takes its toll. Most manufacturers design the sliders to survive 50,000 contact cycles before the chance of damage on startup rises above 50%. However, the decay rate is not linear: when a disk is younger and has had fewer start-stop cycles, it has a better chance of surviving the next startup than an older, higher-mileage disk (as the head literally drags along the disk's surface until the air bearing is established). For example, the Seagate Barracuda 7200.10 series of desktop hard disks are rated to 50,000 start-stop cycles, in other words no failures attributed to the head-platter interface were seen before at least 50,000 start-stop cycles during testing.<ref>[http://www.seagate.com/support/disc/manuals/sata/100402371a.pdf Barracuda 7200.10 Serial ATA Product Manual]</ref>

Around 1995 IBM pioneered a technology where a landing zone on the disk is made by a precision laser process (''Laser Zone Texture'' = LZT) producing an array of smooth nanometer-scale "bumps" in a landing zone,<ref>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=490199 IEEE.org], Baumgart, P.; Krajnovich, D.J.; Nguyen, T.A.; Tam, A.G.; IEEE Trans. Magn.</ref> thus vastly improving [[stiction]] and wear performance. This technology is still largely in use today (2008), predominantly in desktop and enterprise (3.5 inch) drives. In general, CSS technology can be prone to increased stiction (the tendency for the heads to stick to the platter surface), e.g. as a consequence of increased humidity. Excessive stiction can cause physical damage to the platter and slider or spindle motor.

'''Load/Unload''' technology relies on the heads being lifted off the platters into a safe location, thus eliminating the risks of wear and stiction altogether. The first HDD [[IBM 305 RAMAC|RAMAC]] and most early disk drives used complex mechanisms to load and unload the heads. Modern HDDs use ramp loading, first introduced by [[Memorex]] in 1967,<ref>Pugh et al.; "IBM's 360 and Early 370 Systems"; MIT Press, 1991, pp.270</ref> to load/unload onto plastic "ramps" near the outer disk edge.

All HDDs today still use one of these two technologies listed above. Each has a list of advantages and drawbacks in terms of loss of storage area on the disk, relative difficulty of mechanical tolerance control, non-operating shock robustness, cost of implementation, etc.

Addressing shock robustness, [[International Business Machines|IBM]] also created a technology for their [[ThinkPad]] line of laptop computers called the Active Protection System. When a sudden, sharp movement is detected by the built-in [[accelerometer]] in the Thinkpad, internal hard disk heads automatically unload themselves to reduce the risk of any potential data loss or scratch defects. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] later also utilized this technology in their [[PowerBook]], [[iBook]], [[MacBook Pro]], and [[MacBook]] line, known as the [[Sudden Motion Sensor]]. [[VAIO|Sony]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://b2b.sony.com/Solutions/lpage.do?page=/vaio_smb/index.html&name=VAIO%20SMB|title=Sony &#124; For Business &#124; VAIO SMB|publisher=B2b.sony.com|date=|accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref> HP with their [[HP 3D DriveGuard]]<ref>[http://www.hp.com/sbso/solutions/pc_expertise/professional_innovations/hp-3d-drive-guard.pdf HP.com]</ref> and [[Toshiba]]<ref>[http://eu.computers.toshiba-europe.com/Contents/Toshiba_teg/EU/WORKSHOP/files/EXP-2005-04-HDD-Protection-EN.pdf Toshiba HDD Protection measures.]</ref> have released similar technology in their notebook computers.<!-- Now if manufacturers could agree on a common name.. *whish* -->

This accelerometer-based shock sensor has also been used for building cheap [[earthquake]] sensor networks.<ref name="qcn_stanford_edu">{{cite web|title=Quake-Catcher Network|url=http://qcn.stanford.edu/}} 090128 qcn.stanford.edu</ref>

===Disk failures and their metrics=== <!-- NOTE: Some articles link to this exact section name. Do not change it. -->
Most major hard disk and motherboard vendors now support [[S.M.A.R.T.]] (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology), which measures drive characteristics such as [[operating temperature]], spin-up time, data error rates, etc. Certain trends and sudden changes in these parameters are thought to be associated with increased likelihood of drive failure and data loss.

However, not all failures are predictable. Normal use eventually can lead to a breakdown in the inherently fragile device, which makes it essential for the user to periodically back up the data onto a separate storage device. Failure to do so can lead to the loss of data. While it may sometimes be possible to recover lost information, it is normally an extremely costly procedure, and it is not possible to guarantee success. A 2007 study published by [[Google]] suggested very little correlation between failure rates and either high temperature or activity level; however, the correlation between manufacturer/model and failure rate was relatively strong. Statistics in this matter is kept highly secret by most entities. Google did not publish the manufacturer's names along with their respective failure rates,<ref name=google>
{{cite conference|author=Eduardo Pinheiro, Wolf-Dietrich Weber and Luiz André Barroso|year=2007|month=February|title=Failure Trends in a Large Disk Drive Population|conference=5th USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies (FAST 2007)|conferenceurl=http://www.usenix.org/event/fast07/|url=http://labs.google.com/papers/disk_failures.html|booktitle=[[USENIX]] Conference on File and Storage Technologies|accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref> though they have since revealed that they use Hitachi Deskstar drives in some of their servers.<ref>[http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-10209580-92.html CNet.com]</ref> While several S.M.A.R.T. parameters have an impact on failure probability, a large fraction of failed drives do not produce predictive S.M.A.R.T. parameters.<ref name=google/> S.M.A.R.T. parameters alone may not be useful for predicting individual drive failures.<ref name=google/>

A common misconception is that a colder hard drive will last longer than a hotter hard drive.
The Google study seems to imply the reverse—"lower temperatures are associated with higher failure rates". Hard drives with S.M.A.R.T.-reported average temperatures below 27 °C (80.6 °F) had higher failure rates than hard drives with the highest reported average temperature of 50 °C (122 °F), failure rates at least twice as high as the optimum S.M.A.R.T.-reported temperature range of 36 °C (96.8 °F) to 47 °C (116.6 °F).<ref name=google/>

[[Small Computer System Interface|SCSI]], [[Serial attached SCSI|SAS]], and [[Fibre Channel|FC]] drives are typically more expensive and are traditionally used in [[server (computing)|server]]s and [[disk array]]s, whereas inexpensive ATA and SATA drives evolved in the [[home computer]] market and were perceived to be less reliable. This distinction is now becoming blurred.

The [[mean time between failures]] (MTBF) of SATA drives is usually about 600,000 hours (some drives such as [[Western Digital Raptor]] have rated 1.4 million hours MTBF),<ref>[http://www.wdc.com/wdproducts/library/SpecSheet/ENG/2879-701284.pdf WD VelociRaptor Drive Specification Sheet (PDF)]</ref> while SCSI drives are rated for upwards of 1.5 million hours.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} However, independent research indicates that MTBF is not a reliable estimate of a drive's longevity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://storagemojo.com/?p=383|title=Everything You Know About Disks Is Wrong|publisher=StorageMojo|date=February 20, 2007|accessdate=2007-08-29}}</ref> MTBF is conducted in laboratory environments in test chambers and is an important metric to determine the quality of a disk drive before it enters high volume production. Once the drive product is in production, the more valid metric is [[annualized failure rate]] (AFR).{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} AFR is the percentage of real-world drive failures after shipping.

SAS drives are comparable to SCSI drives, with high MTBF and high reliability.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Enterprise S-ATA drives designed and produced for enterprise markets, unlike standard S-ATA drives, have reliability comparable to other enterprise class drives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.synology.com/wiki/index.php/Differences_between_an_Enterprise-Class_HDD_and_a_Desktop-Class_HDD|title=Differences between an Enterprise-Class HDD and a Desktop-Class HDD|publisher=Synology.com|date=2008-09-04|accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref><ref>[http://download.intel.com/support/motherboards/server/sb/enterprise_class_versus_desktop_class_hard_drives_.pdf Intel Whitepaper on Enterprise-class versus Desktop-class Hard Drives]</ref>

Typically enterprise drives (all enterprise drives, including SCSI, SAS, enterprise SATA, and FC) experience between 0.70%–0.78% annual failure rates from the total installed drives.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Eventually all mechanical hard disk drives fail, so to mitigate loss of data, some form of redundancy is needed, such as [[Redundant Array of Independent Disks|RAID]]<ref name="NotEnuf">As discussed in their articles neither [[RAID]] nor [[backup]] are fool proof.</ref> or a regular [[backup]]<ref name="NotEnuf" /> system.

==External removable drives==
External removable hard disk drives connect to the computer using a USB cable or other means. External drives are used for:
* [[Backup]] of files and information
* [[Data recovery]]
* [[Disk cloning]]
* Running [[virtual machine]]s
* Scratch disk for [[video editing]] applications and [[personal video recorder|video recording]].

[[Image:Seagate 6gb.jpg|150px|thumb|right|A 6 GB Seagate Pocket hard drive with USB cable extended next to a 2 GB [[CompactFlash]] card.]]
Larger models often include full-sized 3.5" PATA or SATA desktop hard drives.  Features such as biometric security or multiple interfaces generally increase cost.

==Market segments==
*{{As of|2010|July}}, the highest capacity consumer HDDs are 3 [[terabyte|TB]].<ref name="2TB">{{cite web|url=http://www.thinq.co.uk/2010/6/29/seagate-releases-worlds-first-3tb-hard-drive/ |title=Seagate releases world's first 3TB hard drive |publisher=THINQ.co.uk |accessdate=2010-07-15}}</ref>
*'''"[[desktop computer|Desktop]] HDDs"''' typically store between 120 [[gigabyte|GB]] and 2 TB and rotate at 5,400 to 10,000 [[revolutions per minute|rpm]], and have a media transfer rate of 0.5 Gbit/s or higher. (1 GB = 10<sup>9</sup> bytes; 1 Gbit/s = 10<sup>9</sup> bit/s)
*'''Enterprise HDDs''' are typically used with multiple-user computers running [[enterprise software]]. Examples are
**transaction processing databases;
**internet infrastructure (email, webserver, e-commerce);
**scientific computing software;
**nearline storage management software.
:The fastest enterprise HDDs spin at 10,000 or 15,000 rpm, and can achieve sequential media transfer speeds above 1.6 Gbit/s.<ref name = "erwpnw">[http://www.seagate.com/docs/pdf/datasheet/disc/ds_cheetah_15k_5.pdf Seagate Cheetah 15K.5]</ref> and a sustained transfer rate up to 1 Gbit/s.<ref name = "erwpnw"/> Drives running at 10,000 or 15,000 rpm use smaller platters to mitigate increased power requirements (as they have less [[air drag]]) and therefore generally have lower capacity than the highest capacity desktop drives.
:Enterprise drives commonly operate continuously ("24/7") in demanding environments while delivering the highest possible performance without sacrificing reliability. Maximum capacity is not the primary goal, and as a result the drives are often offered in capacities that are relatively low in relation to their cost.<ref>[http://www.articlesbase.com/data-recovery-articles/enterprise-hard-drives-825563.html Enterprise Hard Drives]</ref>
* '''Mobile HDDs''' or [[laptop]] HDDs, smaller than their desktop and enterprise counterparts, tend to be slower and have lower capacity. A typical mobile HDD spins at either 4200 rpm, 5200 rpm, 5400 rpm, or 7200 rpm, with 5400 rpm being the most prominent. 7200 rpm drives tend to be more expensive and have smaller capacities, while 4200 rpm models usually have very high storage capacities. Because of smaller platter(s), mobile HDDs generally have lower capacity than their greater desktop counterparts.

The [[exponential growth|exponential]] increases in disk space and data access speeds of HDDs have enabled the commercial viability of consumer products that require large storage capacities, such as [[digital video recorder]]s and [[digital audio player]]s.<ref>{{cite news|first=Chip|last=Walter|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000B0C22-0805-12D8-BDFD83414B7F0000&ref=sciam&chanID=sa006|title=Kryder's Law|work=Scientific American|publisher=Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH|date=July 25, 2005|accessdate=2006-10-29}}</ref> In addition, the availability of vast amounts of cheap storage has made viable a variety of web-based services with extraordinary capacity requirements, such as free-of-charge web search, [[web archiving]], and video sharing ([[Google]], [[Internet Archive]], [[YouTube]], etc.).

==Sales==
Worldwide revenue from shipments of HDDs is expected to reach $27.7 billion in 2010, up 18.4% from $23.4 billion in 2009<ref>[http://www.informationweek.com/news/storage/data_protection/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=223800072 Storage Demand, Revenue On The Rise]</ref> corresponding to a 2010 unit shipment forecast of 674.6 million compared to 549.5 million units in 2009.<ref>[http://www.emsnow.com/npps/story.cfm?pg=story&id=42187 RSS iSuppli issues fast facts on Seagate's earnings]</ref>

==Icons==
Hard drives are traditionally symbolized as either a stylized stack of platters (in [[orthographic projection]]) or, more abstractly, as a cylinder. This is particularly found in [[schematic]] diagrams or on indicator lights, as on laptops, to indicate hard drive access. In most modern operating systems, hard drives are instead represented by an illustration or photograph of a hard drive enclosure. These are illustrated below.
