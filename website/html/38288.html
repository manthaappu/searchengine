The '''Trojan Room coffee pot''' was the inspiration for the world's first [[webcam]]. The [[coffee pot]] was located in the so-called Trojan Room within the old [[University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory|Computer Laboratory]] of the [[University of Cambridge]] in [[Cambridge, England]]. The webcam was created to help people working in other parts of the building avoid pointless trips to the coffee room by providing, on the user's desktop computer, a live 128×128 [[grayscale]] picture of the state of the coffee pot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/coffee/coffee.html|title=The Trojan Room Coffee Machine|author=Daniel Gordon, Martyn Johnson|accessdate=2006-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/coffee/qsf/|title=Trojan Room Coffee Pot resources|author=[[Quentin Stafford-Fraser]]|accessdate=2006-10-26}}</ref>

The camera was installed on a [[Local area network|local network]] in 1991 using a video capture card on an [[Acorn Archimedes]] computer. Employing the [[X Window System]] protocol, [[Quentin Stafford-Fraser]] wrote the [[Client (computing)|client]] software, and [[Paul Jardetzky]] wrote the server. When web browsers gained the ability to display images in March 1993, it was clear this would be an easier way to make the picture available. The camera was connected to the [[Internet]] in November 1993 by Daniel Gordon and Martyn Johnson. It therefore became visible to any Internet user and grew into a popular landmark of the early web.

At 09:54 [[UTC]] on August 22, 2001, the camera was finally switched off, and the pot (a [[Germany|German]] [[Krups]] model, actually the fourth or fifth seen online) was auctioned on [[eBay]] for [[Pound Sterling|£]]3,350 to [[Der Spiegel#Spiegel Online|Spiegel Online]], the Internet version of the German ''Der Spiegel'' magazine. Coverage of the event included front-page mentions in ''[[The Times]]'' of London and ''[[The Washington Post]]'', as well as articles in ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statusq.org/archives/2001/04/18|author=[[Quentin Stafford-Fraser]]|accessdate=2006-10-26|title=Blog post listing media coverage of the shutdown}}</ref>

After being refurbished by employees of Krups free of charge, the pot has been switched on again in the editorial office of Spiegel Online.
