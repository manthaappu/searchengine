'''Robert G. Adamson III''' (born 19 October 1947, [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]) is an American software pioneer.

Adamson graduated in Computer Science from the [[University of Utah]] in 1971. In 1981, he founded Software Generation Technology Corp.<ref>Incorporated 29 Jan 1981, state of utah, file# 90569, notary Becky Garlick</ref> and wrote, one of the first fully interpretive languages for IBM mainframe computers. STG was sold to Pansophic Systems<ref>Continental Bank, Cashiers's Check cr 611575, 9 Feb 1983, 2.4 million dollars.</ref> and later acquired by [[Computer Associates]] where the product was renamed GENER/OL.<ref>Pansophic, Oak Brook, Illinois, GENER/OL Guide GN103.0-8311</ref>

Later he founded Nostradamus Inc. and wrote Instant Replay,<ref>Third Edition, Copyright 1993</ref> one of the first multimedia tools for personal computers. Instant Replay combined software demos with photos and audio for distribution on floppy diskettes. Instant Replay was used by thousands of large companies such as Intel, Microsoft and Novel, and competed for years with Dan Bricklinâ€™s Demo Maker. Adamson also wrote well known utilities such as [http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/noblink.html Noblink] and Hardrunner, both of which received PC Magazines Editors Choice Awards.

Adamson wrote [http://www.xmlauthor.com MediaForge], one of the first multimedia authoring tools for Windows. Mediaforge was sold to Strata<ref>Strata Acquires Instant Replay Corp. St. George Utah, 31 Aug 1994</ref> and was awarded Best of Comdex finalist in the area of Development Software in 1994.<ref>Comdex Fall, 1994, BYTE Mag, "Development Software:MediaForge, a Windows multimedia authoring system"</ref> Over 50 million MediaForge runtimes were distributed through various vendors including [http://www.download.com/3120-20_4-0.html?qt=morpheus Morpheus] and [http://www.myfamily.com MyFamily]. MediaForge is currently in use by [http://www.xmlauthor.com XMLAuthor Inc.] for custom development of internet applications such as [http://www.download.com/CinemaForge/3000-13631_4-10373646.html?tag=lst-1 CinemaForge].

Adamson is still involved in software development with his own software development company [http://www.xmlauthor.com XMLAuthor Inc.] He is working on new RIA and internet video technologies. In 2007 Adamson published [http://www.rainhut.com Rainhut], a science fiction novel. The novel contains references to DTK (dare to know), a [[Chaos theory|chaos]] based software system used to assist in the invention of advanced technologies. Development of the DTK software system is far too radical and expensive to attract serious investors at this time, so perhaps the concept remains for future generations to build, according to Adamson.
