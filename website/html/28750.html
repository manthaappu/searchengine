<html> <head> <title>Pelmanism (system)</title></head><body>{{Cleanup|date=June 2010}}'''Pelmanism''' was a system of training the mind which was popular in the [[United Kingdom]] during the first half of the twentieth century.

Originally devised as a memory system in the [[1890s]] by [[William Joseph Ennever]], the system was taught via [[Distance education|correspondence]] from the [[Pelman Institute]] in London. It was advertised as a system of scientific mental training which strengthened and developed your mind just as physical training strengthened your body.  It was developed to expand "Mental Powers in every direction" and "remove those tendencies to indolence and inefficiency".

The system promised to cure a range of problems such as [[forgetfulness]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[phobia]], [[procrastination]], and "Lack of System".<ref>[http://www.ennever.com/histories/history386p.php The Pelman School of Memory, The Pelman Institute and Pelmanism | Ennever family history website, accessed 2010.06.01]</ref>
