'''Location based authentication''' is a special procedure to prove an individual's identity and authenticity on appearance simply by detecting its presence at a distinct location.

To enable location based authentication, a special combination of objects is required. 
* Firsthand, the individual that applies for being identified and authenticated has to present a sign of identity.
* Secondly, the individual has to carry at least one human authentication factor that may be recognized on the distinct location.
* Thirdly, the distinct location must be equipped with a resident means that is capable to determine the coincidence of individual at this distinct location.

== Distinctiveness of locating ==

Basic requirement for safe location based authentication is a well defined separation of locations as well as an equally well defined proximity of the applying individual to this location.

== Applications ==

* Location based authentication is a standard procedure to grant access to an area by detecting a person at an entrance. Then of course a discrimination is recommended to recognise a person entering or leaving, just to prevent two persons gaining access on one ticket only.

* Location based authentication is a standard procedure to get access to a machine, especially a working position with a computer and the functions of this computer <ref>[http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?wo=2006103387&IA=GB2006000856&DISPLAY=DESC LOCATION BASED AUTHENTICATION]</ref>.

* Location based authentication is a novel procedure to provide additional information about the authenticity of a product <ref>[http://www.autoidlabs.org/single-view/dir/article/6/284/page.html Probabilistic Approach for Location-Based Authentication]</ref>.

== Challenges ==

{{As of|2008}}, no offered technical solution for simple location based authentication includes a method for limiting the granted access to the presence, hence terminating the granted authentication on leave. This defines a mandate either to include a new or an additional procedure for 

* detecting the leave and closing the granted access,
* limiting the granted time for access
* combining the method with another specially suited authentication factor
