A '''scheduled-task pattern''' is a type of [[design pattern (computer science)|software design pattern]] used with real-time systems. It is not to be confused with the "[[scheduler pattern]]".

While the [[scheduler pattern]] delays access to a resource (be it a function, variable, or otherwise) only as long as absolutely needed, the scheduled-task pattern delays execution until a determined time. This is important in real-time systems for a variety of reasons.
