'''mk''' is the build tool replacing [[make (software)|make]] in [[Version 10 Unix]], [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs]], and [[Inferno (operating system)|Inferno]]. It improves upon its predecessor by introducing a completely new [[syntax]] that is both easier to read and more powerful. It has been ported back to Unix as part of [[Plan 9 from User Space]].

Mk is licensed under the [[MIT License]] and the [[Lucent Public License]], both of which are [[free software licenses]], approved by both [[Free Software Foundation]] and [[Open Source Initiative]].
