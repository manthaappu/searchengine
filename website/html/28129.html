'''PMD''' is a static ruleset based [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[source code]] [[Code analyzer|analyzer]] that identifies potential problems like:
* ''Possible bugs'' - Empty try/catch/finally/switch blocks.
* ''Dead code'' - Unused [[local variable]]s, [[parameter]]s and [[private method]]s.
* Empty if/while statements.
* ''Overcomplicated expressions'' - Unnecessary if statements, for loops that could be while loops.
* ''Suboptimal code'' - Wasteful String/StringBuffer usage.
* Classes with high [[Cyclomatic complexity|Cyclomatic Complexity]] measurements.
* ''Duplicate code'' - Copied/pasted code can mean copied/pasted bugs, and decreases maintainability.

While PMD doesn't officially stand for anything, it has several unofficial names, the most appropriate probably being ''Programming Mistake Detector''.

Typically, PMD errors are not true errors, but rather inefficient code, i.e. the application could still function properly even if they were not corrected.

==Rulesets==
PMD includes a set of built-in rules and supports the ability to write custom rules. The custom rules can be written in two ways:<br>
1. Using [[XPath]]<br>
2. Using Java classes

==Copy/Paste Detector (CPD)==
The '''Copy/Paste Detector (CPD)''' is an add-on to PMD that uses the [[Rabinâ€“Karp string search algorithm]] to find [[Duplicate code|duplicated code]].
CPD works with [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JSP]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Fortran]] and [[PHP]] code.

==Plugins==
PMD has [[plugins]] for [[JDeveloper]], [[Eclipse (computing)|Eclipse]], [[JEdit]], [[JBuilder]], Omnicore's CodeGuide, [[NetBeans]]/[[Sun Studio (software)|Sun Studio]], [[IntelliJ IDEA]], [[TextPad]], [[Maven]], [[Ant (software)|Ant]], Gel, [[JCreator]], [[Hudson (software)|Hudson]], [[Sonar (software quality)|Sonar]] and [[Emacs]].
