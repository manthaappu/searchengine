<html> <head> <title>Extended Enterprise</title></head><body>An '''Extended Enterprise''' is a loosely coupled, self-organizing network of firms that combine their [[economic output]] to provide products and services offerings to the [[market]]. Firms in the extended enterprise may operate independently, for example, through market mechanisms, or cooperatively through agreements and contracts.

Alternatively referred to as a "[[supply chain]]" or a "[[value chain]]", the extended enterprise describes the community of participants involved with provisioning a set of service offerings.  The extended enterprise associated with "[[McDonald's]]", for example, includes not only [[McDonald's Corporation]], but also [[franchisee]]s and [[joint venture]] partners of McDonald's Corporation, the [[3PL]]'s that provide food and materials to McDonald's restaurants, the [[advertising agencies]] that produce and distribute McDonald's advertising, the [[Distributor (business)|supplier]]s of McDonald's food [[ingredients]], kitchen equipment, [[building services]], [[utilities]], and other goods and services, the designers of [[Happy Meal]] toys, and others.

Extended Enterprise is a more descriptive term than supply chain, in that it permits the notion of different types and degrees and permanence of [[connectivity]].  Connections may be by [[contract]], as in [[partnership]]s or [[alliance]]s or [[trade agreement]]s, or by [[open market]] exchange or participation in public [[tariff]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is the Extended Enterprise?|author=James P.

How the Extended Enterprise is organized and structured and its policies and mechanisms for the exchange of information, goods, services and money is described by the [[Enterprise Architecture]].<ref>Jeanne Ross et al. (2006) ''Enterprise Architecture As Strategy: Creating a Foundation for Business Execution'', Cambridge, Harvard Business School Press.  ISBN 1-591398-39-8</ref>

The notion of the Extended Enterprise has taken on more importance as firms have become more specialized and inter-connected, trade has become more global, processes have become more standardized and information has become ubiquitous.  The standardization of [[business process]]es has permitted companies to purchase as services many of the activities that previously had been provided directly by the [[business entity|firm]].  By [[outsourcing]] certain business functions that had been previously self-provided, such as [[transportation]], [[warehousing]], [[procurement]], [[public relations]], [[information technology]], firms have been able to concentrate their resources on those investments and activities that provide them the greatest rate of return.  The remaining "[[core competencies]]" determine the firm's unique [[value proposition]].<ref>[[Chris Zook]] with James Allen (2001).
