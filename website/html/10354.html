'''Digital Equipment Corporation''' was an [[United States|American]] company in the [[computer]] industry and a leading vendor of computer systems, [[software]] and [[computer peripheral|peripherals]] from the 1960s to the 1990s. Also known as '''DEC''' <ref>"DEC used by Digital itself:" ''PDP11 Processor Handbook'' (1973): page 8, "DEC, PDP, UNIBUS are registered trademarks of Digital Equipment Corporation;" page 1-4, "Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) designs and manufactures many of the peripheral devices offered with [[PDP-11]]'s. As a designer and manufacturer of peripherals, DEC can offer extremely reliable equipment... The LA30 DECwriter, a totally DEC-designed and built teleprinter, can serve as an alternative to the Teletype."</ref> and using the trademark '''DIGITAL''', its [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] and [[VAX]] products were arguably the most popular [[minicomputer]]s for the scientific and engineering communities during the 1970s and 1980s.

From 1957 until 1992 its headquarters was located in an old wool mill in [[Maynard, Massachusetts]]. DEC was acquired in June 1998 by [[Compaq]], which subsequently merged with [[Hewlett-Packard]] in May 2002.

Digital Equipment Corporation should not be confused with the unrelated companies [[Digital Research|Digital Research, Inc]] or [[Western Digital]] (despite the latter manufacturing the [[LSI-11]] chipsets used in DEC's low end [[PDP-11]]/03 computers).

==Overview==
Initially focusing on the small-end of the computer market allowed DEC  to grow without its potential competitors making serious efforts to compete with them. Their PDP series of machines became popular in the 1960s, especially the [[PDP-8]], widely considered to be the first successful [[minicomputer]]. Looking to simplify and update their line, DEC replaced most of their smaller machines with the [[PDP-11]] in 1970, eventually selling over 600,000 units and cementing DECs position in the industry. Originally designed as a follow-on to the PDP-11, DEC's [[VAX|VAX-11]] series was the first widely-used [[32-bit]] minicomputer, sometimes referred to as "[[Superminicomputer|superminis]]". These were able to compete in many roles with larger [[mainframe computer]]s, such as the [[IBM System/370]]. The VAX was a best-seller, with over 400,000 sold, and its sales through the 1980s propelled the company into the second largest in the industry. At its peak, DEC was the second largest employer in Massachusetts, second only to the state government.

The rapid rise of the business [[microcomputer]] in the late 1980s, and especially the introduction of powerful 32-bit systems in the 1990s, quickly eroded the value of DEC's systems. DEC's last major attempt to find a space in the rapidly-changing market was the [[DEC Alpha]] [[64-bit]] [[RISC]] [[processor architecture]]. DEC initially started work on Alpha as a way to re-implement their VAX series, but also employed it in a range of high-performance [[workstations]]. Although the Alpha processor family met both of these goals, and, for most of its lifetime, was the fastest processor family on the market, it did little to affect the bottom line or repair the company's status.

The company was acquired in June 1998 by [[Compaq]], in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry. At the time, Compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors. DEC was a major player overseas where Compaq had less presence. However, Compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions, and soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own. The company subsequently merged with [[Hewlett-Packard]] in May 2002.  {{As of|2007}} some of DEC's product lines were still produced under the HP name.

==History==
===Origins===
[[Ken Olsen]] and [[Harlan Anderson]] were two engineers who had been working at [[MIT]] [[Lincoln Laboratory]] on the lab's various computer projects. The Lab is best known for their work on what would today be known as "interactivity", and their machines were among the first where operators had direct control over programs running in real-time. These had started in 1944 with the famed [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]] which was originally developed to make a [[flight simulator]] for the [[US Navy]], although this was never completed.<ref>[http://www.mitre.org/news/releases/09/whirlwind_07_01_2009.html "MITRE's Project Whirlwind Computer Collection Transferred to MIT"], MITRE, 1 July 2009</ref> Instead, this effort evolved into the [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] system for the [[US Air Force]], which used large screens and [[light gun]]s to allow operators to interact with [[radar]] data stored in the computer.<ref>[http://www.mitre.org/about/sage.html "Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE)"], MITRE, 25 January 2005</ref>

When the Air Force project wound down, the Lab turned their attention to an effort to build a version of the Whirlwind using [[transistor]]s in place of [[vacuum tube]]s. In order to test their new circuitry, they first built a small [[18-bit]] machine known as [[TX-0]] which first ran in 1956.<ref>[http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/accession/XD154.75 "TX-0 Computer"], Computer History Museum</ref> When the TX-0 successfully proved the basic concepts, attention turned to a much larger system, the [[36-bit word length|36-bit]] [[TX-2]] with a then-enormous 64 kWords of [[core memory]]. Core was so expensive that parts of TX-0's memory were stripped for the TX-2, and what remained of the TX-0 was then given to [[MIT]] on permanent loan.<ref name=cm>[http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/TheCompMusRep/TCMR-V08.html Highlights from ''The Computer Museum Report'' Volume 8 Spring 1984], [[The Computer Museum]], Boston, MA, archived at ed-thelen.org, retrieved 2010-2-19</ref>

At MIT, Olsen and Anderson noticed something odd: students would line up for hours to get a turn to use the stripped-down TX-0, while largely ignoring a faster [[IBM]] machine that was also available. The two decided that the draw of interactive computing was so strong that they felt there was a market for a small machine dedicated to this role, essentially a commercialized TX-0. They could sell this to users where graphical output or realtime operation would be more important than outright performance. Additionally, as the machine would cost much less than the larger systems then available, it would also be able to serve users that needed a lower-cost solution dedicated to a specific task, where a larger 36-bit machine wouldn't be needed.<ref name=companyhistory/>

In 1957 when the pair and Ken's brother Stan went looking for capital, they found that the American business community was hostile to investing in computer companies. Many smaller computer companies had come and gone in the 1950s, wiped out when new technical developments rendered their platforms obsolete, and even large companies like [[RCA]] and [[General Electric]] were failing to make a profit in the market. The only serious expression of interest came from [[Georges Doriot]] and his [[American Research and Development Corporation]] (AR&D). Worried that a new computer company would find it difficult to arrange further financing, Doriot suggested the fledgling company change its business plan to focus less on computers, and even change their name from "Digital Computer Corporation".<ref name=companyhistory/>

The pair returned with an updated [[business plan]] that outlined two-phases for the company's development. They would start by selling [[computer module]]s as stand-alone devices that could be purchased separately and wired together to produce a number of different digital systems for lab use. Then, if these "digital modules" were able to build a self-sustaining business, the company would be free to use them to develop a complete computer in their Phase II.<ref name=proposal>[http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/dec/pdp-1/DEC.pdp_1.1957.102664472.pdf "A Proposal to American Research and Development Corporation 27 May 1957"]</ref> The newly christened DEC received $70,000 from AR&D for a 70% share of the company,<ref name=companyhistory/> and began operations in a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] era textile mill in [[Maynard, Massachusetts]], where plenty of inexpensive manufacturing space was available.

===Digital modules===
[[Image:Dec SYSTEM BUILDING BLOCKS 1103.jpg|thumb|System Building Blocks 1103 hex-inverter card (both sides)]]
In early 1958 DEC shipped its first products, the "Digital Laboratory Module" line. The Modules consisted of a number of individual electronic components and [[Bipolar_junction_transistor#Germanium_transistors|germanium transistors]] mounted to a [[circuit board]], the actual circuits being based on those from the TX-2.<ref name=modules>Richard Best, Russell Doane and John McNamara, [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/computer_engineering/00000125.htm"Digital Modules, The Basis for Computers"], ''Computer Engineering, A DEC view of hardware systems design", Digital Press, 1978</ref>

The Laboratory Module were packaged in an extruded aluminum housing,<ref>[http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/accession/102633142 "DEC Laboratory Module – FLIP-FLOP 201"], Computer History Museum</ref> intended to sit on an engineer's workbench. They were then connected together using [[4 mm plug|banana plug]] [[patch cord]]s inserted at the front of the modules. Three versions were offered, running at 5 MHz (1957), 500 kHz (1959), or 10 MHz (1960).<ref name=modules>Richard Best, Russell Doane and John McNamara, [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/computer_engineering/00000125.htm"Digital Modules, The Basis for Computers"], in ''Computer Engineering, A DEC view of hardware systems design", Digital Press, 1978</ref> The Modules proved to be in high demand in other computer companies, who used them to build equipment to test their own systems. Despite the recession of the late 1950s, the company sold $94,000 worth of these modules during 1958 alone, turning a profit at the end of its first year.<ref name=companyhistory/>

The original Laboratory Modules were soon supplemented with the "Digital Systems Module" line, which were identical internally but packaged differently. The Systems Modules were designed with all of the connections at the back of the module using 22-pin Amphenol connectors, and were attached to each other by inserting them into a custom [[19-inch rack]]. These versions allowed 25 modules be to inserted into a single 5-1/4 inch section of racking, and allowed the high densities needed to build a computer.<ref name=modules/> DEC used the Systems Modules to build their "Memory Test" machine for testing core memory systems, selling about 50 of these pre-packaged units over the next eight years.<ref name=present3>''Present'' 1978, pg. 3</ref>

Modules were part of DEC's product line into the 1970s, although they went through several evolutions during this time as technology changed. The same circuits were then packaged as the first "R" (red) series "[[Flip Chip (trademark)|Flip-Chip]]" modules. Later, other module series provided additional speed, much higher logic density, and industrial I/O capabilities.<ref name=present10/> Digital published extensive data about the modules in free catalogs that became very popular.

===PDP-1 family===
[[Image:Vs-dec-pdp-1.jpg|thumb|PDP-1|220px|right|One of the Computer History Museum's [[PDP-1]] systems. This is a canonical example of the type, with the CPU and main control panel on the left, the Type 30 display in the center, and the Soroban typewriter console on the right.]]

With the company established and a successful product on the market, DEC turned its attention to the computer market once again as part of its planned "Phase II".<ref name=proposal/> In August 1959, Ben Gurley started design of the company's first computer, the [[PDP-1]]. In keeping with Doriot's instructions, the name was an [[initialism]] for "[[Programmable Data Processor]]", leaving off the term "computer". As Gurley put it, "We aren't building computers, we're building 'Programmable Data Processors'." The prototype was first shown publicly at the Joint Computer Conference in Boston in December 1959.<ref>[http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/accession/102634161 Eastern Joint Computer Conference and Exhibition], official program of 1959 meeting in Boston</ref>

The PDP-1 design was based on a number of System Building Blocks packaged into several 19-inch racks to form an [[18-bit]] word computer, supplied standard with 4 kWords of [[core memory]] and running at a basic speed of 100,000 operations per second. The racks were themselves packaged into a single large mainframe case, with a hexagonal control panel containing switches and lights mounted to lay at table-top height at one end of the mainframe. Above the control panel was the system's standard [[input/output]] solution, a [[punch tape]] reader and writer. Most systems were purchased with two [[peripherals]], the Type 30 [[vector graphics]] display, and a [[Soroban Engineering]] modified [[IBM Electric typewriter|IBM Model B Electric typewriter]] that was used as a [[printer]]. The Soroban system was notoriously unreliable, and often replaced with a modified [[Friden Flexowriter]], which also contained its own punch tape system. A variety of more-expensive add-ons followed, including [[magnetic tape]] systems, [[punched card]] readers and writers, and faster punch tape and printer systems.

The first PDP-1 was delivered to [[Bolt, Beranek and Newman]] in November 1960,<ref>[http://vt100.net/timeline/1960.html "DIGITAL Computing Timeline, 1960"]</ref> and formally accepted the next April.<ref>''Computers and Automation'', April 1961, pg. 8B</ref> In 1962 DEC donated the prototype PDP-1 to MIT, where it was placed in the room next to the TX-0. In this setting the PDP-1 quickly replaced the TX-0 as the favourite machine among the budding [[hacker]] culture, and served as the platform for a wide variety of "firsts" in the computing world. Perhaps best known among these is the first computerized video game, ''[[Spacewar!]]'', but among the list are the first [[text editor]], [[word processor]], interactive [[debugger]], the first credible [[computer chess]] program, and some of the earliest computerized music.<ref>Judith Strebel and Rebekah Kim,[http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/FindingAids/102660913.PDP_1.pdf "Guide to the Collection of Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-1 Computer Materials"], Computer History Museum, 2006</ref>

The PDP-1 sold in basic form for $120,000, or about $780,000 in 2005-era USD.<ref>[http://www.westegg.com/inflation/infl.cgi "Inflation Calculator, 1961–2005"]</ref> BBN's system was quickly followed by orders from [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Lawrence Livermore]] and [[Atomic Energy of Canada]] (AECL), and eventually 53 PDP-1s were delivered until production ended in 1969.<ref name=present3/><ref>"History of Computing", Lexikon Services, ISBN 0944601782</ref> All of these machines were still being actively used in 1970, and several were eventually saved. MIT's example was donated to [[The Computer Museum, Boston]], and from there ended up at the [[Computer History Museum]] (CHM). A late version of ''Spacewar!'' on paper tape was still tucked into the case. PDP-1 #44 was found in a barn in [[Wichita, Kansas]] in 1988, apparently formerly owned by one of the many aviation  companies in the area, and rescued for the Digital Historical Collection, also eventually ending up at the CHM.<ref>Thomas Bergin, [http://www.computinghistorymuseum.org/teaching/lectures/pptlectures/10-dec.ppt "Digital Equipment Corporation"], Computer History Museum</ref> AECLs was sent to [[Science North]], but was later scrapped.

When DEC introduced the PDP-1, they also mentioned larger machines at 24, 30 and 36-bits, based on the same design.<ref>''Datamation'', Volume 5 Number 6 (November/December), pg. 24</ref> During construction of the prototype PDP-1, some design work was carried out on a 24-bit PDP-2, and the 36-bit PDP-3. Although the PDP-2 never proceeded beyond the initial design, the PDP-3 found some interest and was designed in full.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/29461 "Preliminary Specifications: Programmed Data Processor Model Three (PDP-3)"], DEC, October 1960</ref> Only one PDP-3 appears to have been built, in 1960, by the CIA's Scientific Engineering Institute (SEI) in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]]. According to the limited information available, they used it to process radar cross section data for the [[Lockheed A-12]] [[reconnaissance aircraft]]. [[Gordon Bell]] remembered that it was being used in [[Oregon]] some time later, but could not recall who was using it.<ref>Posting in [http://www.decconnection.org/announcements.htm "Announcements from The DEC Connection"], ''The DEC Connection'', 14 January 2007</ref>

In November 1962 DEC introduced the $65,000 [[PDP-4]]. The PDP-4 was similar to the PDP-1 and used a similar instruction set, but used slower memory and different packaging to lower the price. Like the PDP-1, about 54 PDP-4's were eventually sold, most to a customer base similar to the original PDP-1.<ref>Gordon Bell, [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/digital/timeline/1962-1.htm "DIGITAL Computing Timeline, 1962, PDP-4"]</ref>

In 1964 DEC introduced its new [[Flip Chip (trademark)|Flip Chip]] module design, and used it to re-implement the PDP-4 as the [[PDP-7]]. The PDP-7 was introduced in December 1964, and about 120 were eventually produced.<ref>Gordon Bell, [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/digital/timeline/1964-3.htm "DIGITAL Computing Timeline, 1964, PDP-7"]</ref> An upgrade to the Flip Chip led to the R series, which in turn led to the PDP-7A in 1965.<ref>Gordon Bell, [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/digital/timeline/1964-3.htm "DIGITAL Computing Timeline, 1965, PDP-7A"]</ref> The PDP-7 is most famous as the original machine for the [[Unix]] operating system.<ref>Eric Steven Raymond, [http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch02s01.html "Origins and History of Unix, 1969–1995"], 19 September 2003</ref>

A more dramatic upgrade to the PDP-1 series was introduced in August 1966, the [[PDP-9]].<ref>Gordon Bell, [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/digital/timeline/1966-1.htm "DIGITAL Computing Timeline, 1965, PDP-9"]</ref> The PDP-9 was instruction compatible with the PDP-4 and −7, but ran about twice as fast as the −7 and was intended to be used in larger deployments. At only $19,900 in 1968,<ref>DEC Advertisement, ''Chemical and Engineering News'', Volume 46 (1968), pg. 85</ref>  the PDP-9 was a big seller, eventually selling 445 machines, more than all of the earlier models combined.<ref name=miller452>Miller 1997, pg. 452</ref>

Even while the PDP-9 was being introduced, its replacement was being designed, and was introduced as 1969's [[PDP-15]], which re-implemented the PDP-9 using [[integrated circuits]] in place of modules. Much faster than the PDP-9 even in basic form, the PDP-15 also included a [[floating point unit]] and a separate [[input/output]] processor for further performance gains. Over 400 PDP-15's were ordered in the first eight months of production, and production eventually amounted to 790 examples in twelve basic models.<ref name=miller452/> However, by this time other machines in DEC's lineup could fill the same niche at even lower price points, and the PDP-15 would be the last of the 18-bit series.

===PDP-8 family===
[[Image:PDP-8.jpg|thumb|right|A PDP-8 on display at the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Museum of American History]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. This example is from the first generation of PDP-8s, built with discrete transistors and later known as the ''Straight 8''.]]

In 1962, [[Lincoln Laboratory]] used a selection of System Building Blocks to implement a small 12-bit machine, and attached it to a variety of [[analog-to-digital]] (A to D) [[input/output]] (I/O) devices that made it easy to interface with various analog lab equipment. The [[LINC]] proved to attract intense interest in the scientific community, and has since been referred to as the first real [[minicomputer]],<ref>Wesley Clark, [http://www.historyofscience.com/G2I/timeline/index.php?id=1006 "The Linc, Perhaps the First Mini-Computer"], From Cave Paintings to the Internet</ref> a machine that was small and inexpensive enough to be dedicated to a single task even in a small lab.

Seeing the success of the LINC, in 1963 DEC took the basic logic design but stripped away the extensive A to D systems to produce the [[PDP-5]]. The new machine, the first outside the PDP-1 mould, was introduced at [[WESTCON]] on 11 August 1963. A 1964 ad expressed the main advantage of the PDP-5, "Now you can own the PDP-5 computer for what a core memory alone used to cost: $27,000"<ref name=faqpdp8>[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/dec-faq/pdp8-models/section-1.html "DEC FAQ: What is a PDP-8?"]</ref> 116 PDP-5s were produced until the lines were shut down in early 1967. Like the PDP-1 before it, the PDP-5 inspired a series of newer models based on the same basic design that would go on to be more famous than its parent.

On 22 March 1965, DEC introduced the [[PDP-8]], which replaced the PDP-5's modules with the new R-series modules using Flip Chips. The machine was re-packaged into a small tabletop case, which remains distinctive for its use of smoked plastic over the CPU which allowed one to easily see the wire-wrapped internals of the CPU. Sold standard with 4 kWords of 12-bit core memory and a [[ASR-33 Teletype]] for basic input/output, the machine listed for only $18,000. The PDP-8 is referred to as the first ''real'' [[minicomputer]] because of its sub-$25,000 price.<ref>[http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/computing_and_data_processing/1982-960.aspx "DEC PDP-8 minicomputer, 1965"], ''The Science Museum''</ref><ref>[http://www.computerhistory.org/internet_history/ "Internet History:1965"], Computer History Museum</ref> Sales were, unsurprisingly, very strong, and helped by the fact that several competitors had just entered the market with machines aimed directly at the PDP-5's market space, which the PDP-8 trounced. This gave the company two years of unrestricted leadership,<ref>''Present'' 1978, pg. 7</ref> and eventually 1450 "straight eight" machines were produced before it was replaced by newer implementations of the same basic design.<ref name=faqpdp8/>

DEC hit an even lower price-point with the PDP-8/S, the S for "serial". As the name implies the /S used a serial arithmetic unit, which was much slower but reduced costs so much that the system sold for under $10,000.<ref>''Present'' 1978, pg. 8</ref> DEC then used the new PDP-8 design as the basis for a new LINC, the two-processor [[LINC-8]]. The LINC-8 used one PDP-8 CPU and a separate LINC CPU, and included instructions to switch from one to the other. This allowed customers to run their existing LINC programs, or "upgrade" to the PDP-8, all in software. Although not a huge seller, 142 LINK-8s were sold starting at $38,500.<ref name=faqpdp8/> Like the original LINC to PDP-5 evolution, the LINC-8 was then modified into the single-processor [[PDP-12]], adding another 1000 machines to the 12-bit family.<ref name=faqpdp8/><ref name=miller456>Miller 1997, pg. 456</ref> Newer circuitry designs led to the PDP-8/I and PDP-8/L in 1968.<ref name=present10>''Present'' 1978, pg. 10</ref> In 1975, one year after an agreement between Digital and [[Intersil]], the [[Intersil 6100]] chip was launched, effectively a PDP-8 on a chip. This was a way to allow PDP-8 software to be run even after the official end-of-life announcement for the Digital PDP-8 product line.

===PDP-10 family===
[[Image:KA10 mod end.jpg|thumb|right|A "B" (blue) series Flip Chip module containing nine transistors, 1971]]

While the PDP-5 introduced a lower-cost line, 1963's [[PDP-6]] was intended to take DEC into the [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] market with a [[36-bit]] machine. However, the PDP-6 proved to be a "hard sell" with customers, as it offered few advantages over similar machines from the better established vendors like [[IBM]] or [[Honeywell]], in spite of its low cost around $300,000. Only 23 were sold,<ref name=miller457>Miller 1997, pg. 457</ref> or 26 depending on the source,<ref>Gordon Bell, [http://research.microsoft.com/~gbell/Digital/timeline/1964-1.htm "DIGITAL Computing Timeline, 1964, PDP-6"]</ref> and unlike earlier models the low sales meant the PDP-6 was not improved with intermediate versions. However, the PDP-6 is historically important as the platform that introduced "Monitor", an early [[time-sharing]] [[operating system]] that would evolve into the widely used [[TOPS-10]].<ref>[http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp6/PDP-6_TimsharingBroch.pdf "PDP-6 Timesharing Software"], DEC Publication F-61B</ref>

In spite of the PDP-6's limited commercial success, it introduced many features that clearly had commercial benefit. When the Flip Chip packaging allowed the PDP-6 to be re-implemented at a much lower cost, DEC took the opportunity to carry out a similar evolution of their 36-bit design and introduced the [[PDP-10]] in 1968. The PDP-10 was as much a success as the PDP-6 was a failure; during its lifetime about 700 mainframe PDP-10's were sold before production ended in 1984.<ref name=miller457/> The PDP-10 was widely used in university settings, and thus was the basis of many advances in computing and operating system design during the 1970s. DEC later re-branded all of the models in the 36-bit series as the "DECsystem-10", and PDP-10's are generally referred to by the model of their CPU, like "KA10". Later upgrades produced the compatible [[DECSYSTEM-20]], along with [[TOPS-20]] that included [[virtual memory]].

One of the most unusual peripherals produced for the PDP-10 was the [[DECtape]]. The DECtape was a length of standard magnetic tape wound on 5-in reels. However, the recording format was a 10-track approach using fixed-length numbered 'blocks' organized into a standard file structure, including a directory. Files could be written, read, changed, and deleted on a DECtape as though it were a disk. In fact, some PDP-10 systems had no disks at all, using DECtapes alone for their primary data storage. For greater efficiency, the DECtape drive could read and write to a DECtape in both directions.

===PDP-11===
In 1968 DEC was working on a PDP machine that would be based on 8-bit [[byte]]s instead of 6-bit characters. Known as the "PDP-X", the project was eventually cancelled. Several team members decamped and set up [[Data General]] in May 1968, and rapidly brought the 16-bit [[Data General Nova|NOVA]] minicomputer to market. DEC immediately found itself behind in the industry transition to 8-bit bytes, and soon lost its crown as the largest minicomputer vendor.

The [[PDP-11]] 16-bit computer was designed in a crash program by Harold McFarland, [[Gordon Bell]], Roger Cady, and others.<ref name=birth>Larry McGowan, [http://hampage.hu/pdp-11/birth.html "How the PDP-11 Was Born (according to Larry McGowan)], 19 August 1998</ref> The project was able to leap forward in design with the arrival of Harold McFarland, who had been researching 16-bit designs at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. One of his simpler designs became the PDP-11, although when they first presented it, management was not impressed and almost cancelled it.<ref name=birth/>

In particular, the new design did not include many of the addressing modes that were intended to make programs smaller in memory, a technique that was widely used on other DEC machines and [[CISC]] designs in general. This would mean the machine would spend more time accessing memory, which would slow it down. However, the machine also introduced the idea of "General Registers", which gave the programmer flexibility to use these high-speed memory caches as they needed, potentially addressing the performance issues.

A major advance in the PDP-11 design was [[UNIBUS]], which supported all peripherals through [[memory mapping]]. This allowed new devices to be added easily, generally only requiring some sort of hardware interface and then writing software that examined the mapped memory to control them. This spawned a huge market of 3rd party add-ons for the PDP-11, which made the machine even more useful.

Its numerous architectural innovations proved superior to all competitors and the "11" architecture was soon the industry leader, propelling DEC back to their leadership position. The design was later expanded to allow [[Paging|paged physical memory]] and [[memory protection]] features, useful for [[multitasking]] and [[time-sharing]], and some models supported separate instruction and data spaces for an effective virtual address size of 128 kB within a physical address size of up to 4 MB. PDP-11s, implemented as single-chip CPUs, continued to be produced until 1996, by which time over 600,000 had been sold.<ref name=miller452/>

The PDP-11 supported several operating systems, including [[Bell Labs|Bell Labs']] new [[Unix]] operating system as well as DEC's [[DOS-11]], [[RSX-11]], IAS, [[RT-11]], DSM-11, and [[RSTS/E]]. Many early PDP-11 applications were developed using standalone paper-tape utilities. DOS-11 was the PDP-11's first disk operating system, but was soon supplanted by more capable systems. RSX provided a general-purpose [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] environment and supported a wide variety of [[programming language]]s. IAS was a [[time-sharing]] version of RSX-11D. Both RSTS and Unix were time-sharing systems available to educational institutions at little or no cost, and these PDP-11 systems were destined to be the sandbox for a generation of engineers and computer scientists. Large numbers of 11/70s were deployed in telecommunications and industrial control applications.  AT&T became DEC's largest customer.

RT-11 provided a practical real-time operating system, allowing the PDP-11 to continue Digital's critical role as a computer supplier for [[embedded system]]s.  RT-11 served as the inspiration for many microcomputer OS's, as these were generally being written by programmers who cut their teeth on one of the many PDP-11 models. [[CP/M]] used a command syntax similar to RT-11's, and even retained the awkward [[Peripheral Interchange Program|PIP]] program used to copy other programs. DEC's use of "/" for "switches" (command-line options) would lead to the adoption of "\" for pathnames in [[MS-DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] as opposed to "/" in [[Unix]].<ref name="afu-faq">[http://www.netwhatever.com/faq/inicio.html#queIII15 alt.folklore.computers List of Frequently Asked Questions]</ref>

The evolution of the PDP-11 followed earlier systems, eventually evolving into a single-user deskside [[personal computer]] form in the microPDP. 600,000 PDP-11's of all models were eventually sold. Many PDP-11-like machines were also introduced, and a wide variety of peripheral vendors entered the ecosystem. The PDP-11 series was cloned in [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance|COMECON]] countries as the [[SM EVM]] series, and was produced in quantities comparable to original PDP-11 production.

===VAX===
[[Image:Vax780 small.jpeg|thumb|right|A representative VAX-11/780 system configuration]]

In 1976, DEC decided to extend the [[PDP-11]] architecture to [[32-bit]]s while adding a complete [[virtual memory]] system to the simple paging and memory protection of the PDP-11. The result was the [[VAX]] architecture. The first computer to use a VAX CPU was the [[VAX-11/780]], which DEC referred to as a ''[[superminicomputer]]''. Although it was not the first 32-bit minicomputer, the VAX-11/780's combination of features, price, and marketing almost immediately propelled it to a leadership position in the market after it was released in 1978. VAX systems were so successful that in 1983, DEC canceled its [[Jupiter project]], which had been intended to build a successor to the PDP-10 mainframe, and instead focused on promoting the VAX as their the single computer architecture for the company.<ref>[http://books.google.ca/books?id=W7skAQAAIAAJ&q=dec+Jupiter+project+vax&dq=dec+Jupiter+project+vax&client=safari&cd=4 "The day Jupiter went out of orbit"], ''Electronic Business'', Volume 10 (1984), pg. 76–79</ref>

Supporting the VAX's success was the [[VT52]], one of the most successful [[smart terminal]]s. Building on earlier less successful models (the [[VT05]] and [[VT50]]), the VT52 was the first terminal that did everything one might want in a single chassis. The VT52 was followed by the even more successful [[VT100]] and its follow-ons, making DEC one of the largest terminal vendors in the industry. With the VT series, DEC could now offer a complete top-to-bottom system from computer to all peripherals, which formerly required collecting the required devices from different suppliers.

The VAX processor architecture  and family of systems evolved and expanded through several generations during the 1980s, culminating in the [[NVAX]] [[microprocessor]] implementation and [[VAX 7000/10000]] series in the early 1990s.<ref name="nvax">[http://simh.trailing-edge.com/semi/nvax.html DEC Microprocessors: NVAX (1991)]</ref>

===Early microcomputers===
The introduction of the first general purpose [[microprocessor]]s inevitably led to the first [[microcomputers]] around 1975. At the time these systems were of limited utility, and Ken Olsen famously derided them in 1977, stating "There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home."<ref>Olsen later claimed he was referring to home automation, see [http://www.snopes.com/quotes/kenolsen.asp "Ken Olsen"]</ref> Unsurprisingly, DEC did not put much effort into the microcomputer area in the early days of the market. In the 1980s, DEC built the [[VT180]] (codenamed "Robin"), which was a [[VT100]] terminal with a [[Zilog Z80|Z80]]-based microcomputer running [[CP/M]].

It was only after IBM had successfully launched the [[IBM PC]] that DEC responded with their own systems. Digital responded by introducing not one, but three incompatible machines which were tied to [[Proprietary hardware|proprietary]] architectures. The first, the [[DEC Professional (computer)|DEC Professional]], was based on the PDP-11/23 (the 11/73) running the RSX-11M+ derived, menu-driven, P/OS. The idea was to introduce a machine that outperformed the PC, but in doing so they created one that was more difficult to learn and use{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} than PC-DOS or [[CP/M]] which were more commonly used on the 8080 and 8088 based microcomputers of the time. The [[DECmate]] was the latest version of the PDP-8 based word processors, but not really suited to general computing, nor competitive with [[Wang Laboratories]] word processing that was becoming popular.

The best known of DEC's early microcomputers is the [[Rainbow 100]], which ran an 8086 implementation of [[CP/M-86|CP/M]]. Applications from standard CP/M could be re-compiled for the Rainbow, but, by this time, users were expecting custom-built applications such as [[Lotus 1-2-3]], which was eventually ported along with [[MS-DOS]] 2.0 and introduced in late 1983. Users also objected to having to buy preformatted floppy disks. Although the Rainbow generated some press, it was unsuccessful due to its high price and lack of marketing and sales support.<ref name="rainbow-faq">{{cite web|title=The Rainbow 100 Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://rainbow-100.com/faq/question/1/|work=Drive W|publisher=Approximatrix, LLC|accessdate=15 December 2010|year=2009}}</ref>

A further system was introduced in 1986 as the [[VAXmate]], which included [[Microsoft Windows 1.0]] and used [[VAX/VMS]]-based file and print servers  along with integration into DEC's own [[DECnet]]-family, providing LAN/WAN connection from PC to mainframe or supermini. The VAXmate replaced the Rainbow and in its standard form was the first diskless workstation.

===Networking and clusters===
In 1984, DEC launched its first 10 Mbit/s Ethernet. Ethernet allowed scalable networking, and [[VAXcluster]] allowed scalable computing. Combined with [[DECnet]] and Ethernet-based terminal servers ([[Local Area Transport|LAT]]), DEC had produced a networked storage architecture which allowed them to compete directly with IBM. Ethernet replaced [[token ring]], and went on to become the dominant networking model in use today.

In September 1985, DEC became the [[List of the oldest currently-registered Internet domain names|fifth company to register]] a [[.com]] [[domain name]] (dec.com).

Along with the hardware and protocols, DEC also introduced the [[VAXcluster]] concept, which allowed several VAX machines to be tied together into a single larger storage system. VAXclusters allowed a DEC-based company to scale their services by adding new machines to the cluster at any time, as opposed to buying a faster machine and using that to replace a slower one. The flexibility this offered was compelling, and allowed DEC to attack high-end markets formerly out of their reach.

===Diversification===
Although their microcomputer efforts were eventually considered failures, the PDP-11 and VAX lines continued to sell in record numbers. Better yet, DEC was competing very well against the market leader, IBM, taking an estimated $2 billion away from them in the mid-80s. In 1986, Digital's profits rose 38 percent when the rest of the computer industry experienced a downturn, and by 1987 the company was threatening IBM's number one position in the computer industry.<ref name=companyhistory>[http://www.answers.com/topic/digital-equipment-corporation "Digital Equipment Corporation"], ''International Directory of Company Histories'', Volume 6, St. James Press, 1992</ref>

At its peak, Digital was the second-largest computer company in the world, with over 100,000 employees. It was during this time that the company branched out development into a wide variety of projects that were far from its core business in computer equipment. The company invested heavily in custom software. In the 1970s and earlier most software was custom-written to serve a specific task, but by the 1980s the introduction of [[relational databases]] and similar systems allowed powerful software to be built in a modular fashion, potentially saving enormous amounts of development time. Software companies like [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] became the new darlings of the industry, and DEC started their own efforts in every "hot" niche, in some cases several projects for the same niche. Some of these products competed with DEC's own partners, notably [[Rdb]] which competed with Oracle's products on the VAX, part of a major partnership only a few years earlier.

Although many of these products were well designed, most of them were DEC-only or DEC-centric, and customers frequently ignored them and used third-party products instead. This problem was further exacerbated by Olsen's aversion to traditional advertising and his belief that well-engineered products would sell themselves. Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on these projects, at the same time that workstations using [[RISC]] microprocessors were starting to approach VAX CPUs in performance.

===Faltering in the market===
As microprocessors continued to improve in the 1980s, it soon became clear that the next generation would offer performance and features equal to the best of DECs low-end minicomputer lineup. Worse, the [[Berkeley RISC]] and [[MIPS architecture|Stanford MIPS]] designs were aiming to introduce 32-bit designs that would outperform the fastest members of the VAX family, DEC's [[cash cow]].<ref>John Hennessy, David Patterson and David Goldberg, [http://books.google.com/books?id=XX69oNsazH4C&pg=PA152 "Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach"], Morgan Kaufmann, 2003, pg. 152</ref>

Constrained by the huge success of their [[VAX]]/[[OpenVMS|VMS]] products, which followed the proprietary model, the company was very late to respond to these threats. In the early 1990s, DEC found its sales faltering and its first layoffs followed. The company that created the minicomputer, a dominant networking technology, and arguably the first computers for personal use, had abandoned the "low end" market, whose dominance with the PDP-8 had built the company in a previous generation. Decisions about what to do about this threat led to infighting within the company that seriously delayed their responses.

One group suggested that every possible development in the industry be poured into the construction of a new VAX family that would leapfrog the performance of the existing machines. This would limit the market erosion in the top-end segment, where [[profit margin]]s were maximized and DEC could continue to survive as a minicomputer vendor. This line of thought led, eventually, to the [[VAX 9000]] series, which were plagued with problems when they were first introduced in October 1989, already two years late.<ref>John Markoff, "Market Place; Digital Finally Follows a Trend", ''The New York Times'', 16 July 1990</ref> The problems took so long to work out, and the prices of the systems were so high, that DEC was never able to make the line the success they hoped.

Others within the company felt that the proper response was to introduce their own RISC designs and use those to build new machines. However, there was little official support for these efforts, and no less than four separate small projects ran in parallel at various labs around the US. Eventually these were gathered into the [[DEC PRISM]] project, which delivered a credible 32-bit design with some unique features allowing it to serve as the basis of a new VAX implementation.<ref>Dileep Bhandarkar et al., [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=63667 "High performance issue oriented architecture"], ''Proceedings of Compcon Spring '90'', pg. 153–160</ref> Infighting with teams dedicated to DEC's big iron made funding difficult, and the design was not finalized until April 1988, and then cancelled shortly thereafter.<ref>Mark Smotherman, [http://www.cs.clemson.edu/~mark/prism.html "PRISM (Parallel Reduced Instruction Set Machine)"], Clemson University School of Computing, October 2009</ref>

Another group concluded that new [[workstation]]s like those from [[Sun Microsystems]] and [[Silicon Graphics]] would take away a large part of DEC's existing customer base before the new VAX systems could address the issues, and that the company needed its own Unix workstation as soon as possible. Fed up with slow progress on both the RISC and VAX fronts, a group in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] started a [[skunkworks project]] to introduce their own systems. Selecting the MIPS processor, which was widely available, introducing the new [[DECstation]] series with the model 3100 on 11 January 1989.<ref>Thomas Furlong et al., [http://www.dtjcd.vmsresource.org.uk/pdfs/dtj_v02-02_1990.pdf "Development of the DECstation 3100"], ''Digital Technical Journal'', Volume 2 Number 2 (Spring 1990), pg. 84–88</ref> These systems would see some success in the market, but were later displaced by similar models running the Alpha.

===32-bit MIPS and 64-bit Alpha systems===
[[Image:AlphaServer-2100-guts.jpg|thumb|Inside view of AlphaServer 2100.]]

Eventually, in 1992, DEC launched the [[Alpha 21064|DECchip 21064]] processor, the first implementation of their [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] [[instruction set architecture]], initially named Alpha AXP (the "AXP" was a "non-acronym" and was later dropped). This was a [[64-bit]] [[RISC]] architecture (as opposed to the 32-bit [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] architecture used in the VAX) and one of the first "pure" (not an extension of an earlier 32-bit architecture) 64-bit [[microprocessor]] architectures and implementations. The Alpha offered class-leading performance at its launch, and subsequent variants continued to do so into the 2000s. An AlphaServer SC45 supercomputer was still ranked #6 in the world in November 2004.<ref>[http://www.top500.org/lists/2004/11 www.top500.org Top 10 Supercomputing Sites, November 2004]</ref> Alpha-based computers (the DEC AXP series, later the [[AlphaStation]] and [[AlphaServer]] series) superseded both the VAX and MIPS architecture in DEC's product lines, and could run [[OpenVMS]], DEC [[OSF/1]] AXP (later, Digital Unix or Tru64 UNIX) and Microsoft's then-new operating system, [[Windows NT]].

In 1998, following the takeover by Compaq Computers, a decision was made that Microsoft would no longer support and develop Windows NT for the Alpha series computers, a decision that was seen as the beginning of the end for the Alpha series computers.

DEC tried to compete in the Unix market by adding [[POSIX]]-compatibility features to the VAX/VMS operating system (becoming "OpenVMS") and by selling its own version of Unix ([[Ultrix]] on PDP-11, VAX and MIPS architectures; OSF/1 on Alpha), and began to advertise more aggressively. DEC was simply not prepared to sell into a crowded Unix market however, and the low end PC-servers running NT (based on [[Intel]] processors) took market share from Alpha-based computers. DEC's workstation and server line never gained much popularity beyond former DEC customers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===StrongARM===
In the mid-1990s, Digital Semiconductor collaborated with [[ARM Limited]] to produce the [[StrongARM]] microprocessor.  This was based in part on ARM7 and in part on DEC technologies like Alpha, and was targeted at [[embedded system]]s and portable devices. It was highly compatible with the ARMv4 architecture and was very successful, competing effectively against rivals such as the [[SuperH]] and [[MIPS architecture]]s in the [[portable digital assistant]] market. [[Microsoft]] subsequently dropped support for these other architectures in their [[Pocket PC]] platform. In 1997, as part of a lawsuit settlement, the [[StrongARM]] intellectual property was sold to [[Intel]]. They continued to produce [[StrongARM]], as well as developing it into the [[XScale]] architecture. Intel subsequently sold this business to [[Marvell Technology Group]] in 2006.

===Designing solutions===
Beyond DECsystem-10/20, PDP, VAX and Alpha, Digital was well respected for its communication subsystem designs, such as Ethernet, DNA (Digital Network Architecture – predominantly DECnet products), DSA (Digital Storage Architecture – disks/tapes/controllers), and its "dumb terminal" subsystems including VT100 and DECserver products.<ref>For in-depth articles regarding Digital technologies, refer to the archived [http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/dtj/past.htm Digital Technical Journal]</ref>

===Final years===
[[Image:Digital Equipment Corporation 1993 logo.png|New 1993 corporate logo|thumb]]
In June 1992, [[Ken Olsen]] was replaced by [[Robert Palmer (computer businessman)|Robert Palmer]] as the company's president.  Digital's board of directors also granted Palmer the title of chief executive officer ("CEO"), a title that had never been used during Digital's 35-year existence. Palmer had joined DEC in 1985 to run Semiconductor Engineering and Manufacturing. His relentless campaign to be CEO, and success with the Alpha microprocessor family, made him a candidate to succeed Olsen. At the same time a more modern logo was designed<ref>[[Ned Batchelder]] and [http://vt100.net/dec/logo Vt100.net].</ref>

During the profitable years up until the early 1990s, DEC was a company that boasted that it never had a general layoff;<ref>Schein, ''et al'', pp. 67, 109.</ref> following the 1992 economic downturn, layoffs became regular events as the company continually downsized to try to stay afloat.<ref>Schein, ''et al'', p. 233.</ref> Palmer was tasked with the goal of bringing DEC back to profitability, which he attempted to do by changing the established DEC business culture, hiring new executives from outside the company, and selling off various non-core business units:<ref>Schein, ''et al'', pp. 128, 144, 234.</ref>

This included DEC's [[StrongARM]] implementation of the [[ARM architecture|ARM computer architecture]], which Intel sold as the [[Intel XScale|XScale]] processors commonly used in [[Pocket PC]]s.

By 1997 Digital had subsidiary companies in more than two dozen countries including Austria, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China (People's Republic), Colombia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Jersey States, New Zealand, Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom.<ref>[http://www.secinfo.com/dsvRx.83Pe.7.htm SEC Web site] retrieved January 22, 2008</ref>

Eventually, on January 26, 1998, what remained of the company (including Digital's multivendor global services organization and customer support centers) was sold to [[Compaq]], which was acquired by [[Hewlett-Packard]] in 2002. The remainder of Digital Semiconductor (the Alpha microprocessor group) was sold to Intel, which placed those employees back in their Hudson, Mass. office which they had vacated when the site was sold to Intel in 1997. Compaq, and later HP, continued to sell many of the former Digital products but rebranded with their own logos. For example, HP now sells what were formerly Digital's StorageWorks disk/tape products,<ref>[http://h18006.www1.hp.com/storage/ HP StorageWorks – Data and Network Storage Products and Solutions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> as a result of the Compaq acquisition.

The Digital logo survived for a while after the company ceased to exist, as the logo of Digital GlobalSoft, an IT services company in India (which was a 51 percent subsidiary of Compaq). Digital GlobalSoft was later renamed "HP GlobalSoft" (also known as the "HP Global Delivery India Center" or HP GDIC) and no longer uses the Digital logo.

The digital.com and DEC.com domain names are now owned by Hewlett-Packard and redirect to their US website.<ref>[http://www.digital.com/ Digital.com], [http://www.Dec.com/ DEC.com]</ref> Digital held the [[Classful network|Class A]] [[IP address]] block 16.0.0.0/8.

The [[Digital Federal Credit Union]] (DCU), which was chartered in 1979 for employees of DEC, is now open to essentially everyone, with over 700 different sponsors, including the companies that acquired pieces of DEC.

==Research==
DEC's Research Laboratories (or Research Labs, as they were commonly known) conducted Digital's corporate research.  Some of them were operated by [[Compaq]] and are still operated by [[Hewlett-Packard]].  The laboratories were:

* [[Western Research Laboratory]] (WRL) in [[Palo Alto, California]], USA
* [[DEC Systems Research Center|Systems Research Center]] (SRC) in [[Palo Alto, California]], USA
* [[Network Systems Laboratory]] (NSL) in [[Palo Alto, California]], USA
* [[Cambridge Research Laboratory]] (CRL) in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], USA
* [[Paris Research Laboratory]] (PRL) in [[Paris, France]]
* [[MetroWest Technology Campus]] (MTC) in [[Maynard, Massachusetts]], USA

Some of the former employees of Digital's Research Labs or Digital's R&D in general include:

* [[Gordon Bell]]

==Accomplishments==
Digital supported the [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] standards, especially the [[ASCII]] character set, which survives in [[Unicode]] and the [[ISO 8859]] character set family. Digital's own [[Multinational Character Set]] also had a large influence on [[ISO 8859-1]] (Latin-1) and, by extension, [[Unicode]].

The first versions of the [[C (programming language)|C]] language and the [[Unix]] operating system ran on Digital's [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] series of computers (first on a PDP-7, then the [[PDP-11]]'s), which were among the first commercially viable [[minicomputer]]s, although for several years Digital itself did not encourage the use of Unix.

Digital also produced the popular [[VAX]] computer family, the first pure 64-bit microprocessor architecture ([[DEC Alpha|Alpha AXP]]), the first commercially successful workstation (the VT-78), and some commercially unsuccessful personal computers. The central computing system of the Soviet reusable [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] spaceship was based on two MicroVAX computers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Digital produced widely used interactive operating systems, including [[OS/8|OS-8]], [[TOPS-10]], [[TOPS-20]], [[RSTS/E]], [[RSX-11]], [[RT-11]], and [[OpenVMS]].  PDP computers, in particular the [[PDP-11]] model, inspired a generation of programmers and software developers. Some [[PDP-11]] systems more than 25 years old (software and hardware) are still being used to control and monitor factories, transportation systems and nuclear plants. Digital was an early champion of [[time-sharing]] systems.

Digital was to the command-line interface (CLI) what Apple was to the GUI {{Dubious|date=March 2009}}: there was history before and innovation after, but it was Digital's operating systems that put it together in a complete and definitive form {{Dubious|date=March 2009}}. The command-line interfaces found in Digital's systems, eventually codified as [[DIGITAL Command Language|DCL]], would look familiar to any user of modern microcomputer CLIs; those used in earlier systems, such as [[Compatible Time-Sharing System|CTSS]], [[IBM]]'s [[Job Control Language|JCL]], or [[Univac]]'s time-sharing systems, would look utterly alien. Many features of the CP/M and MS-DOS CLI show a recognizable family resemblance to Digital's OSes, including command names such as DIR and HELP and the "name-dot-extension" file naming conventions.

VAX and [[MicroVAX]] computers (very widespread in the 1980s) running [[Virtual Memory System|VMS]] formed one of the most important proprietary networks, [[DECnet]], which linked business and research facilities. The [[DECnet]] protocols formed one of the first peer-to-peer networking standards, with DECnet phase I being released in the mid-1970s. Email, file sharing, and distributed collaborative projects existed within the company long before their value was recognized in the market.

Digital, Intel and Xerox through their collaboration to create the DIX standard, were champions of [[Ethernet]], but Digital is the company that made Ethernet commercially successful. Initially, Ethernet-based DECnet and [[Local Area Transport|LAT]] protocols interconnected VAXes with DECserver terminal servers. Starting with the UNIBUS to Ethernet adapter, multiple generations of Ethernet controllers from Digital were the de facto standard. The CI "computer interconnect" adapter was the industry's first network interface controller to use separate transmit and receive "rings".

Digital also invented [[Computer cluster|clustering]], an operating system technology that treated multiple machines as one logical entity. Clustering permitted sharing of pooled disk and tape storage via the HSC50/70/90 and later series of Hierarchical Storage Controllers. HSCs delivered the first hardware RAID 0 and 1 capabilities and the first serial interconnects of multiple storage technologies.  This technology was the forerunner to systems like [[Network of Workstations]] which are used for massively cooperative tasks such as web-searches and drug research.

The LA36 and LA120 dot matrix printers became industry standards and may have hastened the demise of the [[teleprinter|Teletype Corporation]].

The [[VT100]] [[computer terminal]] became the industry standard, implementing a useful subset of the [[ANSI X3.64]] standard, and even today terminal emulators such as [[HyperACCESS|HyperTerminal]], [[PuTTY]] and [[Xterm]] still emulate a VT100 (or its more capable successor, the [[VT220]]).

The [[X Window System]], the network transparent window system used on UNIX and Linux, and also available on other operating systems, was developed at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] jointly between [[Project Athena]] and the [[Laboratory for Computer Science]]. Digital was the primary sponsor for this project, which was one of the first large scale free software projects,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}<!-- need reliable sources for "one of the first", and "free software", the latter since "free" was perhaps not an original goal --> a contemporary of the [[GNU Project]] but not associated with it.

[[Dave Cutler]], who led the development of [[RSX-11]]M, [[RSX-11]]M+, [[Virtual Memory System|VMS]] and then [[VAXeln]], left Digital in 1988 to lead the development of [[Windows NT]] which was initially intended to be an "open" [[operating system]] that would run on more powerful processors than the existing predominant [[x86]] architecture. While DEC did see value in continuing its [[X Window System]] environment to support engineering customers, it understood that future mid-range based customers would demand a faster and more user friendly [[Graphical User Interface]] (GUI), potentially offered through the Windows environment.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} As Microsoft had experience, technology and patents that would give them upper hand in advancing GUI technology, DEC opted to partner with Microsoft's development of Windows NT for mid-range processors and share in the R&D process of creating faster computers using their [[RISC]] [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] processors.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Microsoft was not exclusively bound to the Alpha chip so it pursued other processor makers such as IBM with the [[PowerPC]] architecture and eventually capitalized on the emerging strength of the Intel x86 based processors. While most would say that the market determined its own course through the more cost efficient processors produced by Intel, DEC quickly came to realize that its loose partnership with Microsoft would lead to its own undoing in terms of being a major player in the mid-range processor market.

Notes-11 and its follow-on product, VAXnotes, were two of the first examples of online collaboration software, a category that has become to be known as [[Collaborative software|groupware]]. [[Len Kawell]], one of the original Notes-11 developers later joined [[Lotus Development Corporation]] and contributed to their [[Lotus Notes]] product.

Digital was one of the first businesses connected to the [[Internet]] with ''dec.com'', registered in 1985,<ref>[http://research.microsoft.com/Users/gbell/Digital/timeline/1985-6.htm dec.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> being one of the first of the now ubiquitous ''.com'' domains.  ''gatekeeper.dec.com'' was a well-known software repository during the pre-[[WWW|World Wide Web]] days, and Digital was also the first computer vendor to open a public website, on October 1, [[1993]].<ref>[http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9402&L=dectei-l&T=0&P=200 DECTEI-L Archives – February 1994 (#2)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The popular [[AltaVista]], created by Digital, was one of the first comprehensive Internet [[Search engine (computing)|search engine]]s. (Although [[Lycos]] was earlier, it was much more limited.)

DEC invented [[Digital Linear Tape]] (DLT), formerly known as CompacTape, which began as a compact backup medium for MicroVAX systems, and later grew to capacities of 800 gigabytes.

Work on the first hard-disk-based [[MP3]]-player, the [[Personal Jukebox]], started at the [[DEC Systems Research Center]]. (The project was started about a month before the merger into [[Compaq]] was completed.)

DEC's Western Research Lab created the [[Itsy Pocket Computer]]. This was developed into the Compaq [[iPaq]] line of [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s, which replaced the [[Compaq Aero]] PDA.

==User organizations==
Originally the [[users' group]] was called [[DECUS]] (Digital Equipment Computer User Society) during the 1960s to 1990s. When [[Compaq]] acquired Digital in 1998, the users group was renamed CUO, the Compaq Users' Organisation. When [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] acquired [[Compaq]] in 2002, CUO became [[HP-Interex]], although there are still DECUS groups in several countries. In the [[United States]], the organization is represented by the [[Encompass]] organization.
