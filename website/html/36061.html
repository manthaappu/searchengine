A '''subscriber identity module''' or '''subscriber identification module''' ('''SIM''') on a removable '''SIM card''' securely stores the [[International Mobile Subscriber Identity|service-subscriber key (IMSI)]] used to identify a subscriber on mobile [[telephony]] devices (such as [[mobile phone]]s and [[computer]]s). The SIM card allows users to change phones by simply removing the SIM card from one mobile phone and inserting it into another mobile phone or broadband telephony device.

A SIM card contains its unique serial number, internationally unique number of the mobile user ([[IMSI]]), security authentication and ciphering information, temporary information related to the local network, a list of the services the user has access to and two passwords ([[Personal identification number|PIN]] for usual use and [[Personal Unblocking Code|PUK]] for unlocking).

SIM cards are available in three standard sizes. The first is the size of a [[credit card]] (85.60 mm × 53.98 mm x 0.76 mm). The newer, most popular miniature version has the same thickness, but has a length of 25 mm and a width of 15 mm, and has one of its corners truncated (chamfered) to prevent misinsertion. The newest incarnation known as the 3FF or micro-SIM has dimensions of 15 mm × 12 mm. Most cards of the two smaller sizes are supplied as a full-sized card with the smaller card held in place by a few plastic links; it can easily be broken off to be used in a device that uses the smaller SIM.

The first SIM card was made in 1991 by Munich smart card maker [[Giesecke & Devrient]], who sold the first 300 SIM cards to Finnish wireless network operator [[Radiolinja]].<ref name="test">[http://www.gi-de.com/portal/page?_pageid=44,62528&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL History of Giesecke & Devrient]</ref><!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:First Radiolinja SIM card.jpg|thumb|The First SIM Card made in 1991, Munich smart card maker Giesecke & Devrient sold the first 300 SIM cards to Finnish wireless network operator Elisa (ex. Radiolinja).]] -->

== Smart card technology ==
[[File:SIM chip structure and packaging.svg|thumb|SIM chip structure and packaging]]
There are three operating voltages for SIM cards: 5 V, 3 V and 1.8 V ([[ISO/IEC 7816]]-3 classes A, B and C respectively). The operating voltage of the majority of SIM cards launched before 1998 was 5 V. SIM cards produced subsequently are compatible with 3 V and 5 V or with 1.8 V and 3 V.

A [[W-SIM]] is a SIM card that incorporates core cellular technology in the card itself.

A ''virtual SIM'' is a mobile phone number provided by a [[mobile network operator]] that does not require a SIM card to terminate phone calls on a user's mobile phone.

===Features added in later releases===
The specification that standardized the micro-SIM form factor continues to evolve.  Some features introduced recently include:

* a micro-SIM form factor
* allow for multiple simultaneous applications accessing the card through [[Virtual circuit|logical channels]];
* introduce mutual authentication as a way to eliminate carrier [[spoofing attack|spoofing]] by allowing the SIM card to authenticate the cell tower to which it is connecting;
* add a new PIN protection with [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] PIN management with a [[superuser|universal PIN]], an application PIN and a local PIN; and
* expand the phonebook storage of the SIM card with entries for email, second name, and groups.<ref name="ETSITechnicalCommittee"/>

SIM cards were first made the same size as a credit card (85.60 mm × 53.98 mm × 0.76 mm). The development of physically smaller mobile devices prompted the development of a smaller SIM card, the mini-SIM card. Mini-SIM cards have the same thickness as full-size cards, but their length and width are reduced to 25 mm × 15 mm.

The mini-SIM card has the same contact arrangement as the full-size SIM card and they are normally supplied within a full-size card carrier, attached by a number of linking pieces. This arrangement (defined in [[ISO/IEC 7810]] as [[ID-1/000]]) allows for such a card to be used in a device requiring a full-size card, or to be used in a device requiring a mini-SIM card after cleanly breaking the scorings manufactured in the outline of a mini-SIM card.

Even smaller device sizes have prompted the development of a yet smaller card size, the ''3FF card'' or ''micro-SIM''. Micro-SIM cards have the same thickness and contact arrangement again, but the length and width are further reduced to 15 mm × 12 mm. The specifications for the 3FF card or micro-SIM also include additional functionality beyond changing the physical card size.

===Development of the micro-SIM ===
The micro-SIM was developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute along with SCP, 3GPP (UTRAN/GERAN), 3GPP2 (CDMA2000), ARIB, GSMAssociaton (GSMA SCaG and GSMNA), GlobalPlatform, Liberty Alliance, and the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) for the purpose of fitting into devices otherwise too small for a mini-SIM card.<ref name="ETSITechnicalCommittee">{{cite web|url=http://docbox.etsi.org//Workshop/2006/Salud%20Mexico/Gaby%20Lenhart%20-%20CENETEC_2006_04.ppt |title=The Smart Card Platform|publisher=''ETSI Technical Committee Smart Card Platform (TB SCP)''|date=2006-04-01|accessdate=30 January 2010|author=Gaby Lenhart, Project leader: ETSI Technical Committee Smart Card Platform (TB SCP)|authorlink=|quote=SCP is co-operating on both technical and service aspects with a number of other committees both within and outside the telecommunications sector.}}</ref><ref name="pcmag">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2358489,00.asp|title=Inside the iPad Lurks the 'Micro SIM'|publisher=''[[PC Magazine]]''|date=2010-01-27|accessdate=30 January 2010|last1=Segan |first1=Sascha |authorlink=http://www.pcmag.com/author_bio/0,1908,a=2974,00.as |quote=A SIM card is the little chip in a GSM cell phone that holds your subscriber information...}}</ref>

The form factor was mentioned in the Dec 1998 [[3GPP]] SMG9 [[UMTS]] Working Party, which is the standards-setting body for GSM SIM cards,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/TSG_T/WG3_USIM/TSGT3_01/docs/t3-99003.pdf |title=DRAFT Report of the SMG9 UMTS Working Party, meeting #7 hosted by Nokia in Copenhagen, 15.-16- December 1998|publisher=''[[3GPP]]''|date=25 January 1999|accessdate=27 January 2010|quote=One manufacturer stated that it may be difficult to meeting ISO mechanical standards for a combined ID-1/micro-SIM card.}}</ref> and the form factor was agreed upon in late 2003.<ref name="SmartCardTrends">{{cite web|url=http://www.smartcardstrends.com/det_atc.php?idu=287|title=New form factor for smart cards introduced|publisher=''SmartCard Trends - The international Smart Security Industry Magazine''|date=2003-12-08|accessdate=30 January 2010|last1=Antipolis |first1=Sophia|authorlink=|quote=The work item for the so-called Third Form Factor, "3FF", was agreed, after intensive discussions, at the SCP meeting held last week in London.}}</ref>

The micro-SIM was created with backwards compatibility in mind.  The major issue with backwards compatibility was the contact area of the chip. Retaining the same contact area allows the micro-SIM to be compatible with the previous, larger SIM readers through the use of plastic cutout surrounds. The SIM was also designed to run at the same speed (5 MHz) as the previous version. The same size and positions of pins resulted in numerous "How-to" tutorials and YouTube video with detailed instructions how to cut a mini-SIM card to micro-SIM size with sharp knife or scissors. These tutorials became very popular among first owners of [[iPad]] 3G after its release on April 30, 2010 and [[iPhone 4]] on June 24, 2010.<ref name="CutMicroSIM">{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B0G_qjebJY|title=How to make MicroSIM}}</ref>

The chairman of EP SCP, Dr. Klaus Vedder, said<ref name="SmartCardTrends"/>
:"With this decision, we can see that ETSI has responded to a market need from ETSI customers, but additionally there is a strong desire not to invalidate, overnight, the existing interface, nor reduce the performance of the cards. EP SCP expect to finalise the technical realisation for the third form factor at the next SCP plenary meeting, scheduled for February 2004."

== Usage in mobile phone standards ==
[[Image:Thuraya sim.jpeg|thumb|right|SIM card for [[Thuraya]] satellite phone]]
The use of SIM cards is mandatory in [[GSM]] devices. The equivalent of a SIM in [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]] is called the Universal Integrated Circuit Card ([[UICC]]), which runs a [[Universal Subscriber Identity Module|USIM]] application, while the Removable User Identity Module ([[R-UIM]]) is more popular in [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]]-based devices e.g. [[CDMA2000]]. The UICC is still colloquially called a ''SIM card''. Many CDMA-based standards do not include any removable card, and the service is bound to a unique identifier contained in the handset itself.

The [[satellite phone]] networks [[Iridium Satellite LLC|Iridium]], [[Thuraya]] and [[Inmarsat]]'s [[BGAN]] also use SIM cards. Sometimes these SIM cards work in regular GSM phones and also allow GSM customers to roam in satellite networks by using their own SIM card in a satellite phone.

The SIM card introduced a new and significant business opportunity of mobile telecoms operator/carrier business of the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) which does not own or operate a cellular telecoms network, but which leases capacity from one of the network operators, and only provides a SIM card to its customers. MVNOs first appeared in Denmark, Hong Kong, Finland and the UK and today exist in over 50 countries including most of Europe, USA, Canada, Australia and parts of Asia and account for approximately 10% of all mobile phone subscribers around the world.

{{Globalize|date=October 2009}}
On some networks, the mobile phone is [[SIM lock|locked to its carrier SIM card]], meaning that only the specific carrier's SIM cards will work. This is more common in markets where mobile phones are heavily subsidised by the carriers, and the business model depends on the the customer staying with the service provider for a minimum term (typically, 12 or 24 months). Common examples are the GSM networks in the USA, Canada, the UK and Poland.

A plethora of [[online shopping|online]] and [[high-street]] (third-party) businesses now offer the ability to remove the SIM-lock from a phone, effectively making it possible to then use the phone on any network by inserting a different SIM card. Some of these resellers  use wholeseller databases.<ref>such as unlockbase or unlockcodesource</ref> This is a useful benefit for travellers that might want to put a local SIM card into their phone when they arrive in a country, in order to minimize roaming charges.  In many countries, now it is possible to buy a pre-pay SIM card just by walking into a store, and these SIM-only deals are a cost effective way to stay in contact when travelling.

Phones sold as [[prepaid mobile phone|pre-pay]] often come with an operator subsidy, especially in competitive mobile markets like the UK. These phones are sold not just through mobile phone stores, but also supermarkets, catalogs, stationery outlets and online; thus the mobile companies are constantly competing to lower the price. Prepay phones come with a bundled SIM, which can be activated by the user in case the phone is bought up. The handsets are often SIM-locked to ensure that the user does not use another operator, allowing the original operator to eventually recoup its subsidy. However, because the units can be unlocked for a small fee (and even the operators themselves offer this service), units can be bought cheaply, separated from the original SIM card and sold on for a profit, perhaps in other markets, perhaps as contract phone. This is known in the industry as ''box breaking'', and often harms the profits of the operator while allowing complicit sales staff and [[box breaker]]s to reap the rewards.  Note that, if a prepaid handset breaks, the SIM card (representing the prepaid account value, plus user's address book, history, etc) can typically be moved to another prepaid handset if the phone-network is the same.  That is,
the account is tied to the portable SIM card, not the handset, on prepaid phones.  This is useful because by 2010, prepaid handsets cost less than the value a user might have stored in an account.

Mostly, GSM and 3G mobile handsets can easily be SIM-unlocked and used on any suitable network with any SIM card. A notable exception is the Apple [[Iphone|iPhone]], where in most markets Apple has gone to extreme lengths to lock-down their phones; thus they can only be used with the partner's network.  This has led to a popular hack called the ''[[Jailbreak (iPhone)|jailbreak]]'', which allows custom software unapproved by Apple to run on the phone. Then software can be run to unlock the phone, which frees the iPhone from the partner network; thus any SIM card can be inserted. (Note that jailbreaking, in itself, does not unlock the phone, and has other uses as well.)  Apple and the hackers are locked in a war of escalation - described by Apple CEO [[Steve Jobs]] as "a game of cat and mouse"<ref>http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9037398/Jobs_says_Apple_will_fight_iPhone_unlocking_hacks?intsrc=hm_list</ref> - with Apple constantly trying to close loopholes in their operating system, and the hackers finding new ways to jailbreak each version when it becomes avai<sup></sup>lable.

In countries where the phones are not subsidised e.g. Italy and Belgium, all phones are unlocked. Where the phone is not locked to its SIM card, the users can easily switch networks by simply replacing the SIM card of one network with that of another while using only one phone. This is typical, for example, among users who may want to optimise their telecoms traffic by different tariffs to different friends on different networks.

[[Dual SIM]] phones are now made by some mobile phone manufacturers, which save the user from carrying around a separate phone for every number. There are two types, the first, that allow one to switch between the SIMs, and the second, that allow both SIMs to be active simultaneously.

== Operating systems ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2010}}
SIM operating systems come in two main types: native and Java Card.
Native SIMs are based on proprietary, vendor specific software whereas the Java Card SIMs are based on standards, particularly [[Java Card]] which is a subset of the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]] specifically targeted at embedded devices.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Java Card allows the SIM to contain programs that are hardware independent and interoperable.

== Data ==
SIM cards store network-specific information used to authenticate and identify subscribers on the network. The most important of these are the [[#Integrated Circuit Card ID (ICC-ID)|ICC-ID]], [[IMSI]], Authentication Key (Ki), Local Area Identity (LAI) and Operator-Specific Emergency Number.  The SIM also stores other carrier specific data such as the SMSC (Short Message Service Center) number, Service Provider Name (SPN), Service Dialing Numbers (SDN), Advice-Of-Charge parameters and Value Added Service (VAS) applications. (look to GSM 11.11)

=== Integrated circuit card identifier (ICC-ID) ===
Each SIM is internationally identified by its ICC-ID. ICC-IDs are stored in the SIM cards and are also engraved or printed on the SIM card body during a process called personalization. The ICC-ID is defined by the ITU-T recommendation E.118.<ref>
    ITU-T,
    ITU-T Recommendation E.118,
    The international telecommunication charge card,
    [http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.118 Revision history],
    [http://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&id=T-REC-E.118-200605-I!!PDF-E&type=items Revision "05/2006"]
</ref> Its layout is based on [[ISO/IEC 7812]]. According to E.118 the number is up to 19 digits long including a single check digit calculated using the [[Luhn algorithm]].  However, the GSM Phase 1<ref>
   ETSI,
   ETSI Recommendation GSM 11.11,
   Specifications of the SIM-ME Interface,
   [http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/11_series/11.11/1111-3G0.ZIP Version 3.16.0]
</ref> defined the ICC-ID length as 10 octets with operator-specific structure.

The number is composed of the following subparts:

==== Issuer identification number (IIN) ====
Maximum of seven digits:
* Major industry identifier (MII), 2 fixed digits, ''89'' for telecommunication purposes.
* [[List of country calling codes|Country code]], 1-3 digits, as defined by [[ITU-T]] recommendation [[E.164]].
* Issuer identifier, 1-4 digits.

==== Individual account identification ====
* Individual account identification number. Its length is variable but every number under one IIN will have the same length.

==== Check digit ====
* Single digit calculated from the other digits using the [[Luhn algorithm]].

==== Total size ====
With the GSM Phase 1 specification using 10 octets into which ICC-ID is stored as packed BCD, the data field has room for 20 digits.

In practice this means that on GSM SIM cards there are 20 digit (19+1) and 19 digit (18+1) ICC-IDs in use, depending upon issuer.  However one issuer uses always same size of ICC-IDs.

To confuse matters more, SIM factories seem to have varying ways of delivering electronic copy of SIM personalization datasets. Some datasets are without the ICC-ID checksum digit, others are with the digit.

=== International mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) ===
SIM cards are identified on their individual operator networks by a unique [[IMSI]].  [[Mobile operators]] connect mobile phone calls and communicate with their market SIM cards using their IMSIs. The format is:
* The first 3 digits represent the [[Mobile country code|Mobile Country Code (MCC)]].
* The next 2 or 3 digits represent the [[Mobile network code|Mobile Network Code (MNC)]]. 3 digit MNC codes are allowed by E.212 but are only implemented in some countries in North America, the Caribbean and Latin America.
* The next digits represent the mobile station identification number. Normally there will be 10 digits but would be fewer in the case of a 3 digit MNC or if national regulations indicate that the total length of the IMSI should be less than 15 digits.

=== Authentication key (K<sub>i</sub>)===
The K<sub>i</sub> is a 128-bit value used in authenticating the SIMs on the mobile network. Each SIM holds a unique K<sub>i</sub> assigned to it by the operator during the personalization process.  The K<sub>i</sub> is also stored on a database (known as [[Authentication Center]] or AuC) on the carrier's network.

The SIM card is designed not to allow the K<sub>i</sub> to be obtained using the [[(U)SIM Interface|smart-card interface]]. Instead, the SIM card provides a function, ''Run GSM Algorithm'', that allows the phone to pass data to the SIM card to be signed with the K<sub>i</sub>. This, by design, makes usage of the SIM card mandatory unless the K<sub>i</sub> can be extracted from the SIM card, or the carrier is willing to reveal the K<sub>i</sub>. In practice, the GSM cryptographic algorithm for computing SRES_2 (see step 4, below) from the K<sub>i</sub> has certain vulnerabilities {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} which can allow the extraction of the K<sub>i</sub> from a SIM card and the making of a [[SIM cloning|duplicate SIM card]].

==== Authentication process====
# When the Mobile Equipment starts up, it obtains the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) from the SIM card, and passes this to the mobile operator requesting access and authentication. The Mobile Equipment may have to pass a PIN to the SIM card before the SIM card will reveal this information.
# The operator network searches its database for the incoming IMSI and its associated K<sub>i</sub>.
# The operator network then generates a Random Number (RAND, which is a [[cryptographic nonce|nonce]]) and signs it with the K<sub>i</sub> associated with the IMSI (and stored on the SIM card), computing another number known as Signed Response 1 (SRES_1).
# The operator network then sends the RAND to the Mobile Equipment, which passes it to the SIM card. The SIM card signs it with its K<sub>i</sub>, producing SRES_2 which it gives to the Mobile Equipment along with encryption key K<sub>c</sub>. The Mobile Equipment passes SRES_2 on to the operator network.
# The operator network then compares its computed SRES_1 with the computed SRES_2 that the Mobile Equipment returned. If the two numbers match the SIM is authenticated and the Mobile Equipment is granted access to the operator's network. K<sub>c</sub> is used to encrypt all further communications between the Mobile Equipment and the network.

=== Location area identity ===
The SIM stores network state information, which is received from the [[Location Area Identity]] (LAI). Operator networks are divided into Location Areas, each having a unique LAI number. When the device changes locations, it stores the new LAI to the SIM and sends it back to the operator network with its new location. If the device is power cycled, it will take data off the SIM, and search for the previous LAI.  This saves time by avoiding having to search the whole list of frequencies that the telephone normally would.

=== SMS messages and contacts ===
Most SIM cards will orthogonally store a number of SMS messages and phone book contacts. The contacts are stored in simple 'Name and number' pairs - entries containing multiple phone numbers and additional phone numbers will usually not be stored on the SIM card. When a user tries to copy such entries to a SIM the handset's software will break them up into multiple entries, discarding any information that isn't a phone number. The number of contacts and messages stored depends on the SIM; early models would store as few as 5 messages and 20 contacts while modern SIM cards can usually store over 250 contacts. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

=== Universal subscriber identity module {{Anchor|USIM}} ===
[[Image:USIM bluefish technologies.jpg|thumb|right|A 64K UICC in its larger carrier card]]
A Universal Subscriber Identity Module is an application for [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]] mobile telephony running on a [[UICC]] [[smart card]] which is inserted in a [[3G]] mobile phone. There is a common misconception to call the [[UICC]] itself a USIM, but the USIM is merely a logical entity on the physical card.

It stores user subscriber information, authentication information and provides [[data storage device|storage]] space for [[Short message service|text messages]] and phone book contacts.  The phone book on a UICC has been greatly enhanced.

For authentication purposes, the USIM stores a long-term [[pre-shared key|pre-shared secret key]] K, which is shared with the Authentication Center (AuC) in the network. The USIM also verifies a sequence number that must be within a range using a window mechanism to avoid replay attacks, and is in charge of generating the session keys CK and IK to be used in the confidentiality and integrity algorithms of the [[KASUMI (block cipher)|KASUMI]] block cipher in [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]].

The equivalent of USIM on [[GSM]] networks is SIM, and on [[CDMA]] networks it is [[CDMA Subscriber Identify Module|CSIM]].

== Japan==
[[Japan]]'s 2G [[Personal Digital Cellular|PDC]] system (which will be completely shut down by 2012; [[SoftBank Mobile]] has already shut down PDC from March 31, 2010) also specifies a SIM, but this has never been implemented commercially. The specification of the interface between the Mobile Equipment and the SIM is given in the [[Association of Radio Industries and Businesses|RCR]] STD-27 annex 4. The Subscriber Identity Module Expert Group was a committee of specialists assembled by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to draw up the specifications ([[GSM]] 11.11) for interfacing between smart cards and mobile telephones. In 1994, the name SIMEG was changed to SMG9.

Japan's current and next generation cellular systems are based on [[W-CDMA (UMTS)]] and [[CDMA2000]] and all use SIM cards.

==Finland==

In July 2005, the [[Finland|Finnish]] government announced that a ''Citizen Certificate'', a government-guaranteed electronic identity included in a SIM card, would be made available to every individual resident in Finland before the end of 2005, allowing mobile phone users to access e-services on the move. The Citizen Certificate has been described as "basically an [[Electronic identity card|e-ID card]] that will be compatible with several [[hardware]] devices, such as mobile phones, [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]], [[personal computer]]s, [[Digital TV|digital TV sets]], and public web kiosks". It is based on open standards and secured public key infrastructure ([[Public key infrastructure|PKI]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

This plan has since been withdrawn.
