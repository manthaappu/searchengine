A '''Telecommunication Control Unit''' was device present in the now outdated mainframes of the past that were attached to a [[multiplexer]] channel. TCUs freed mainframes from handling the data coming in and out of [[RS-232]] ports. The TCU would support multiple terminals, sometimes hundreds. Many of these TCUs could support RS-232 when it was required, although there were other serial interfaces as well.
