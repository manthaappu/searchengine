'''SpaceWire''' is a [[spacecraft]] [[communication network]] based in part on the [[IEEE 1355]] standard of communications.  It is coordinated by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) in collaboration with international space agencies including [[NASA]], [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|JAXA]] and [[Russian Federal Space Agency|RKA]]. Within a SpaceWire network the nodes are connected through low-cost, low-[[Lag|latency]], [[Duplex (telecommunications)#Full-duplex|full-duplex]], [[Point-to-point communication (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] serial links and [[packet switching]] [[wormhole routing]] routers. SpaceWire covers two (physical and data-link) of the seven layers of the [[OSI model]] for communications.

==Architecture==
SpaceWire's modulation and data formats generally follow the [[data strobe encoding]] - [[Differential signaling|differential ended signaling]] (DS-DE) part of the IEEE Std 1355-1995.  SpaceWire utilizes [[asynchronous communication]] and allows speeds between 2 Mbit/s and 400 Mbit/s. DS-DE is well-favored because it describes modulation, bit formats, routing, [[flow control]] and [[error detection]] in hardware, with little need for software.  SpaceWire also has very low error rates, deterministic system behavior, and relatively simple digital electronics.  SpaceWire replaced old [[Positive Emitter Coupled Logic|PECL]] differential drivers in the physical layer of IEEE 1355 DS-DE by [[low-voltage differential signaling]] (LVDS). SpaceWire also proposes the use of space-qualified 9-pin connectors. SpaceWire and IEEE 1355 DS-DE allows for a wider set of speeds for data transmission, and some new features for automatic [[failover]]. The fail-over features let data find alternate routes, so a spacecraft can have multiple data buses, and be made [[Fault-tolerant design|fault-tolerant]]. SpaceWire also allows the propagation of time interrupts over SpaceWire links, eliminating the need for separate time discretes.

==Uses==
SpaceWire is used worldwide.  Its use began primarily in [[European Space Agency|ESA]] projects, but it is currently used by [[NASA]], [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|JAXA]], [[Russian Federal Space Agency|RKA]], and many other organizations and companies.  Some NASA projects using it include the [[James Webb Space Telescope]], [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift's]] [[Burst Alert Telescope]], the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]], [[LCROSS]], the [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite]] (GOES-R), and the Communications, Navigation, and Networking Reconfigurable Testbed (CoNNeCT). It has also been selected by the [[United States Department of Defense]] for Operationally Responsive Space.  SpaceWire initiatives are being coordinated between several Space Agencies in the frame of [[Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems|CCSDS]] in order to extend its communication model to the Network and Transport Layers of the [[OSI model]].

== Protocols ==
The ESA has a draft specification in place for the Protocol ID.

The following Protocol ID's have been assigned in ECSS-E-ST-50-11:
* 1: Remote Memory Access Protocol ([[RMAP]])
* 2: CCSDS Packet Transfer Protocol
* 238: Proposal for Reliable Data Delivery Protocol ([[RDDP]]) (used on [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite|GOES-R]])
* 239: Serial Transfer Universal Protocol ([[STUP]]) (Used on [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?part_id=4206 SMCS-332] [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]])
