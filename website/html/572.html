<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:astar.gif|frame|right|Original appearance of ASTAR]] --> 
ASTAR is a fictional golden [[humanoid]] [[robot]] from ''Planet Danger''. The character was created in the 1980s by the [[Canadian]] [[amputee]] organization [[The War Amps]] and is featured in material for their ''PLAYSAFE'' program to educate children about safety. 

The original televised segment featured a performer in an elaborate costume as ASTAR performing acrobatic stunts in a world full of dangerous machines. After evading various threats such as electrical hazards and moving blades, ASTAR eventually makes a mistake causing his arm to be amputated by a large rotating saw. He then picks up his severed arm and reattaches it with ease. The segment ends with ASTAR giving the warning:

:I am ASTAR, a robot. I can put my arm back on. You can't. So play safe!</blockquote>

The above warning is now part of Canadian [[popular culture]] for those who grew up in the 1980s. In a recent remake of the segment, ASTAR is now an animated [[CG]] character, and the warning is altered slightly to "I am ASTAR, a robot '''from Planet Danger'''. I can put my arm back on. You can't. So play safe!"
