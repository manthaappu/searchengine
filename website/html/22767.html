A '''lunar eclipse''' occurs when the moon passes behind the earth so that the earth blocks the sun's rays from striking the moon. This can occur only when the [[Sun]], [[Earth]], and [[Moon]] are aligned exactly, or very closely so, with the Earth in the middle. Hence, there is always a [[full moon]] the night of a lunar eclipse. The type and length of an eclipse depend upon the Moon's location relative to its [[lunar node|orbital node]]s.  The [[21 December 2010 lunar eclipse|most recent total lunar eclipse]] occurred on December 21, 2010, at 08:17 [[UTC]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Greg|title=Total Lunar Eclipse of December 21, 2010|url=http://www.outerspaceuniverse.org/total-lunar-eclipse-of-december-21-2010.html|publisher=Outer Space Universe|accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref>

Unlike a [[solar eclipse]], which can only be viewed from a certain relatively small area of the world, a lunar eclipse may be viewed from anywhere on the night side of the Earth. A lunar eclipse lasts for a few hours, whereas a total solar eclipse lasts for only a few minutes at any given place. Some lunar eclipses have been associated with important [[Historical Lunar eclipses|historical events]].

==Types of lunar eclipse==
{{Anchor|penumbral eclipse|penumbral lunar eclipse}} <!-- redirects from [[penumbral lunar eclipse]] -->
The shadow of the Earth can be divided into two distinctive parts: the [[umbra]] and [[penumbra]]. Within the umbra, there is no direct solar radiation. However, as a result of the Sun’s large angular size, solar illumination is only partially blocked in the outer portion of the Earth’s shadow, which is given the name penumbra.
A '''penumbral eclipse''' occurs when the Moon passes through the Earth’s penumbra. The penumbra causes a subtle darkening of the Moon's surface. A special type of penumbral eclipse is a '''[[total penumbral eclipse]]''', during which the Moon lies exclusively within the Earth’s penumbra. Total penumbral eclipses are rare, and when these occur, that portion of the Moon which is closest to the umbra can appear somewhat darker than the rest of the Moon.

A '''partial lunar eclipse''' occurs when only a portion of the Moon enters the umbra. When the Moon travels completely into the Earth’s umbra, one observes a '''total lunar eclipse'''.  The Moon’s speed through the shadow is about one kilometer per second (2,300 [[mph]]), and totality may last up to nearly 107 minutes. Nevertheless, the total time between the Moon’s first and last contact with the shadow is much longer, and could last up to 4 hours.<ref>{{cite book |  title=Fundamental Astronomy | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DjeVdb0sLEAC&pg=PA139&lpg=PA139&dq=lunar+eclipse+%22maximum+duration%22&source=web&ots=2g2ku9x57X&sig=x5J8rF3DEVu4-TkJGhYr9LhW_GQ  | last = Hannu Karttunen | publisher = Springer}}</ref> The relative distance of the Moon from the Earth at the time of an eclipse can affect the eclipse’s duration. In particular, when the Moon is near its [[apogee]], the farthest point from the Earth in its orbit, its orbital speed is the slowest.  The diameter of the umbra does not decrease appreciably within the changes in the orbital distance of the moon.  Thus, a totally eclipsed Moon occurring near apogee will lengthen the duration of totality.

The timing of total lunar eclipses are determined by its contacts<ref>{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Kevin|title=On the nature of eclipses|url=http://www.inconstantmoon.com/cyc_ecl1.htm|work=Inconstant Moon|publisher=Cyclopedia Selenica|accessdate=19 December 2010}}</ref>:
:'''P1''' (First contact): Beginning of the penumbral eclipse. The Earth's penumbra makes contact with the outer limb of the Moon.
:'''U1''' (Second contact): Beginning of the partial eclipse. The Earth's umbra touches the outer limb of the Moon.
:'''U2''' (Third contact): Beginning of the total eclipse. The Moon is located completely within the Earth's umbra.
:'''Greatest eclipse''': The peak stage of the total eclipse. The Moon is at its closest to the center of the umbra.
:'''U3''' (Fourth contact): End of the total eclipse. The Moon's outer limb exits Earth's umbra.
:'''U4''' (Fifth contact): End of the partial eclipse. The Earth's umbra leaves the surface of the Moon.
:'''P2''' (Sixth contact): End of the penumbral eclipse. The Earth's shadow no longer makes any contact with the Moon.

A '''selenelion''' or '''selenehelion''' occurs when both the Sun and the eclipsed Moon can be observed at the same time.  This can only happen just before sunset or just after sunrise, and both bodies will appear just above the horizon at nearly opposite points in the sky.  This arrangement has led to the phenomenon being referred to as a '''horizontal eclipse'''.  It happens during every lunar eclipse at all those places on the Earth where it is sunrise or sunset at the time.  Indeed, the reddened light that reaches the Moon comes from all the simultaneous sunrises and sunsets on the Earth.  Although the Moon is in the Earth’s geometrical shadow, the Sun and the eclipsed Moon can appear in the sky at the same time because the [[refraction]] of light through the [[Earth’s atmosphere]] causes objects near the [[horizon]] to appear higher in the sky than their true geometric position.<ref>{{cite news | author=John Hammond | title=Weather Centre: Astronomical event threatened by the Great British weather | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/ukweather/daily_review/news/15052003news.shtml | work=BBC News | date=May 15, 2003 | accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref>

The Moon does not completely disappear as it passes through the umbra because of the [[refraction]] of [[sunlight]] by the Earth’s atmosphere into the shadow cone; if the Earth had no atmosphere, the Moon would be completely dark during an eclipse. The red coloring arises because sunlight reaching the Moon must pass through a long and dense layer of the Earth’s atmosphere, where it is [[Rayleigh scattering|scattered]].  Shorter [[wavelength]]s are more likely to be scattered by the air molecules and the small particles, and so by the time the light has passed through the atmosphere, the longer wavelengths dominate. This resulting light we perceive as [[red]]. This is the same effect that causes [[sunset]]s and [[sunrise]]s to turn the sky a reddish color; an alternative way of considering the problem is to realize that, as viewed from the Moon, the Sun would appear to be setting (or rising) behind the Earth.

The amount of refracted light depends on the amount of dust or clouds in the atmosphere; this also controls how much light is scattered. In general, the dustier the atmosphere, the more that other wavelengths of light will be removed (compared to red light), leaving the resulting light a deeper red color. This causes the resulting coppery-red hue of the Moon to vary from one eclipse to the next.  Volcanoes are notable for expelling large quantities of dust into the atmosphere, and a large eruption shortly before an eclipse can have a large effect on the resulting color.

===Danjon scale===
The following scale (the [[Danjon scale]]) was devised by [[André Danjon]] for rating the overall darkness of lunar eclipses:<ref>{{cite web | title = Observing and Photographing Lunar Eclipses | url = http://skytonight.com/observing/objects/eclipses/3304036.html | last = Paul Deans and Alan M. MacRobert | publisher = Sky and Telescope}}</ref>
:'''L=0''': Very dark eclipse. Moon almost invisible, especially at mid-totality.
:'''L=1''': Dark eclipse, gray or brownish in coloration. Details distinguishable only with difficulty.
:'''L=2''': Deep red or rust-colored eclipse. Very dark central shadow, while outer edge of umbra is relatively bright.
:'''L=3''': Brick-red eclipse. Umbral shadow usually has a bright or yellow rim.
:'''L=4''': Very bright copper-red or orange eclipse. Umbral shadow is bluish and has a very bright rim.

==Eclipse cycles==
{{see also|Saros cycle|Eclipse cycle}}
Every year there are at least two lunar eclipses, although total lunar eclipses are significantly less common. If one knows the date and time of an eclipse, it is possible to predict the occurrence of other eclipses using an [[eclipse cycle]] like the [[Saros cycle]].
