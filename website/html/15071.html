'''Genrikh Saulovich Altshuller''' (Ге́нрих Сау́лович Альтшу́ллер, {{IPA-ru|ˈɡʲɛnrʲɪx sʌ.uləvʲɪtɕ əlʲtʂu.lʲɪr|pron}}) (born [[Tashkent]], [[Uzbek SSR]], [[USSR]], October 15, 1926; died [[Petrozavodsk]], [[Russia]], September 24, 1998), was a [[USSR|Soviet]] [[engineer]], [[inventor]], [[scientist]], [[journalist]] and [[writer]]. He is most notable for the creation of the [[TRIZ|Theory of Inventive Problem Solving]], better known by its Russia acronym TRIZ. He founded the Azerbaijan Public Institute for Inventive Creation, and was the first President of the TRIZ Association. He also wrote science fiction under the [[pen-name]] Genrikh Altov.

==Early life==
He created the ''Teoriya Resheniya Izobreatatelskikh Zadach'' (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving or [[TRIZ]])). Working as a [[patent examiner|clerk]] in a [[patent office]], Altshuller embarked on finding some generic rules that would explain creation of new, inventive, patentable ideas.

==Arrest and imprisonment==
During one of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s purges he was imprisoned for political reasons and continued his studies with his fellow inmates while in a [[labor camp]]. After his release, Altshuller settled in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]].

==The spread of TRIZ in the Soviet Union==
A full-fledged TRIZ movement developed among [[USSR|Soviet]] engineers and other technically inclined people by the 1970s, and Altshuller played the role of its intellectual leader. He lectured at TRIZ congresses, published articles and books and corresponded with various TRIZ practitioners. He became the founding member and president of the Russian TRIZ Association. A number of his close friends and students have become the most prominent thinkers and teachers of the movement, popularizing TRIZ in [[Russia]] and abroad.

For a long time he published articles on TRIZ, with examples and exercises, in the Soviet popular science magazine ''Izobretatel i Ratsionalizator'' (''Inventor and Innovator'').

==After the Soviet collapse==
Altshuller left Baku in the early 1990s amidst post-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-breakup violence in the area. He settled in [[Petrozavodsk]] ([[Karelia]] in north-western [[Russia]]) with his wife and granddaughter. As a result, Petrozavodsk became the center of the TRIZ Association.

He died from complications of [[Parkinson's disease]] in 1998.

==Science Fiction==
Following his release from prison camp in the 1950s, he earned a living as a science fiction writer, under the pseudonym Genrikh Altov (Генрих Альтов), often in collaboration with his wife, [[Valentina Zhuravleva]].
