A '''United States Uniformed Services Privilege and Identification Card''' (also known as '''U.S. military ID''', '''Geneva Conventions Identification Card''', or less commonly abbreviated '''USPIC''') is an [[identity document]] issued by the [[United States Department of Defense]] to identify a person as a member of the Armed Forces or a member's dependent, such as a child or spouse.

The card is used to control access to military bases, exclusive stores (such as [[AAFES]] and [[Base exchange|NEX]] outlets and [[Defense Commissary Agency|commissaries]]), Morale Welfare and Recreation (MWR) facilities, and high-security areas. It also serves as proof of eligibilty for medical care delivered either directly within the [[Military_Health_System|military health system]] or outside via [[TRICARE]].  The modern identification card is called a [[Common Access Card]] (CAC) because it is also a [[smart card]] that is used with specialized card readers for automatic building access control systems, communications encryption, and computer access.

==Types==
The primary types of U.S. military ID cards being issued today are the CAC for active duty and Reserve members, the Department of Defense (DD) Form 2 for retirees, and DD Form 1173 for dependents. Until the CAC was phased in starting in late 2003, the DD Form 2 in branch-specific variants served as active duty members' ID.  Prior to the October 1993 revision, the DD Form 2 form number was appended with one of five variant codes denoting branch of service (A, AF, N, MC, or CG), and the typewriter-filled blank form variants were overprinted with branch names and logos.  Current DD Forms 2 and 1173 are identical for all branches; the [[Defense_Enrollment_and_Eligibility_Reporting_System|DEERS]] ID workstation prints branch-unique names and logos onto the blank form along with the holder's personal information at the time of issue.  Current DD Forms 2 and 1173 variants differ only in the color in which the blank form is printed, indicating the holder's status.  DD Forms 2 and 1173 are easily confused as they are similar in appearance and purpose, however they are two distinct forms.

=== Color Coding ===
The DD Form 2 and 1173 ID cards are color-coded to denote the status of the holder.  Possible colors are:

* '''Tan''' - Dependent of active duty member or retiree.
* '''Red''' - Retired Reservist not yet age 60 (Gray Area) and Dependent of Reserve Components.
* '''Blue''' - Retiree (or other honorably discharged Veteran with benefits).
