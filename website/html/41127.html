The '''Zope Object Database''' ('''ZODB''') is an object-oriented database for transparently and persistently storing [[Python (programming language)|Python]] objects. It is included as part of the [[Zope]] web [[application server]], but can also be used independently of Zope.

Features of the ZODB include: transactions, history/undo, transparently pluggable storage, built-in caching, multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), and scalability across a network (using ZEO).

The ZODB is a mature Python datastore that has hundreds of thousands of systems today running on top of it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

==History==

* Created by Jim Fulton of Zope Corporation in the late 90s.

* Started as simple Persistent Object System (POS) during Principia development (which later became Zope)

* The persistence from ZODB leverages ExtensionClass which was the precursor to current Python metaclass implementation

* ZODB 3 was renamed when a significant architecture change was landed.

* ZODB 4 was a short lived project to re-implement the entire ZODB 3 package using 100% Python.

==ZEO==

ZEO (Zope Enterprise Objects) is a ZODB storage implementation that allows multiple client processes to persist objects to a single ZEO server. This allows transparent scaling, but the ZEO server is still a single point of failure.

==Pluggable Storages==

* Network Storage (aka ZEO) - Enables multiple python processes load and store persistent instances concurrently.

* File Storage - Enables a single python process to talk to a file on disk.

* relstorage - Enables the persistence backing store to be a [[RDBMS]].

* Directory Storage - Each persistent data is stored as a separate file on the filesystem.  Similar to FSFS in [[Subversion (software)|Subversion]].

* Demo Storage - An in-memory back end for the persistent store.

* BDBStorage - Which uses [[Berkeley DB]] back end.  Now abandoned.

Failover Technologies

* Zope Replication Services (ZRS) - A commercial add-on that removes the single point of failure, providing hot backup for writes and load-balancing for reads.

* zeoraid - An open source solution that provides a proxy Network Server that distributes object stores and recovery across a series of Network Servers.

* relstorage - since RDBMS technologies are used this obviates need for ZEO server.

* NEO - Distributed (fault tolerance, load-balancing) storage implementation. Not ready for production use yet (as of 01/2011).
