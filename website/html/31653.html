'''Regina''' is a suite of mathematical software for [[3-manifold]] [[topology|topologists]]. It focuses upon the study of [[3-manifold]] [[Triangulation (topology)|triangulations]] and includes support for [[normal surface]]s and angle structures.

== Features ==

* Regina implements a variant of [[Hyam Rubinstein|Rubinstein's]] [[3-sphere]] recognition algorithm.  This is an algorithm that determines whether or not a [[Triangulation (topology)|triangulated]] [[3-manifold]] is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[3-sphere]]. 

* Regina further implements the [[connected sum|connect-sum]] decomposition.  This will decompose a [[triangulation_(topology)|triangulated]] 3-manifold into a [[connected sum|connect-sum]] of [[triangulation_(topology)|triangulated]] [[connected sum|prime]] 3-manifolds. 

* [[Simplicial_homology|Homology]] and [[Poincare duality]] for 3-manifolds, including the [[Poincare duality|torsion linking form]].

* Regina builds on [[SnapPea]], having both a [[GUI]] and [[Python_(programming language)|Python]] interface.
