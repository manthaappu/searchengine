'''''Modding''''' is a [[slang]] expression that is derived from the verb "[[wiktionary:modify|modify]]". Modding refers to the act of modifying a piece of hardware or software or anything else for that matter, to perform a function not originally conceived or intended by the [[designer]]. The term modding is often used within the computer game community, particularly in regard to creating new or altered content and sharing that via the web. It may also be applied to the [[overclocking]] of computers in order to increase the [[frequency]] at the which the [[CPU]] operates. [[Case modding]] is also a popular activity amongst many computer enthusiasts which involves the [[customization]] of a [[computer chassis]] or the installation of [[water cooling]] technology. In connection with [[automobiles]], modding often refers to [[engine tuning]], remapping of a vehicle's [[engine control unit]] or customization of the [[Coachwork|bodywork]].

=== Legal issues ===
Modding may sometimes infringe the legal rights of the copyright owner. Some nations have laws prohibiting modding and accuse modders of attempting to overcome [[copy protection]] schemes. In the United States, the [[DMCA]] has set up stiff penalties for mods that violate the rights of intellectual property owners. In the [[European Union]], member states have agreed the [[EU Copyright Directive]] and are transposing it into national law. A man was [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4650225.stm convicted] in the [[United Kingdom]] in July 2005 for selling a modded [[Xbox]] with built in software and games. However it is also worthy of note that some other European countries have not interpreted the legal issues in the same way. In Italy a judge threw out a [http://management.silicon.com/government/0,39024677,39117891,00.htm Sony case] saying it was up to owners of a console what they did with it. Similarly in [http://www.theregister.com/2004/04/27/spanish_xbox_modding_ruling/ Spain], mod chips are seen as legal despite the EU copyright legislation.
Modding may be an unauthorized changed made to a software or hardware to a platform in gaming.
Case mods are modifications to a device with the altering of certain styles. For example, people who mod a [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox 360]] can alter the [[led]] lights on the controller to glow different colors.

==== Multi-user licensing ====
Computer systems, hardware, and software are often sold or licensed to one home machine, to a business that has many computers, a government agency, or a non-profit organization.  When the software license says that it is for a specific person, then it is not legal{{dubious|date=November 2010}} for that software to be used by some other person on that same computer, even a member of the same family, or another employee of the same company. But this strict licensing is only one approach. In this form of licensing, for more than one person to be using that software or hardware, they need to have a multi-user license that usually dictates how many different people may use it.

==== Derivative software ====
Some [[software]] is [[licensed]] with a copy of the [[Computer program|program]] [[source code]] supplied along with the [[executable code]] in which the license specifically authorizes changes to the supplied software.  This is a common standard in business software packages.  Hundreds of thousands of computer programmers in some nations have jobs because businesses want the purchased software tailored to the specific needs of the individual businesses.  Most every major city has want ads in the newspaper where there are job openings for people to modify some company's computer systems, where the ad specifies what [[programming language]]s or [[operating system]]s the applicant needs to know.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

[[Derivative software]] is licensed copyrighted software used in whole or part in new programs written by programmers at businesses using the licensed software.  Programmers copy the copyright notices into the source code where the code was copied, and track all such places, because if the license is permitted to expire, then the business loses software use rights, including any place to which it was copied.  An annual fee is typically paid to keep the license in effect, and over time, the software supplier can increase the fees to the point that the business chooses to convert to some other commercial software that seems to be more cost effective.  It is not unusual in business software to find programs that have many different copyright notices, each referring to different sources of the derived source code.

=== Video game consoles ===
A common example of one kind of modding is [[video game console]] [[mod chip]]s, which can allow users to play [[Homebrew (video games)|homemade games]], games legitimately purchased in other [[Regional lockout|regions]], or legal backup copies, but can also allow [[copyright infringement of software|illegal unauthorized copies]] by allowing the player to play personally [[CD recorder|recorded]] [[compact disc|CD]] or [[digital video disc|DVD]] copies of [[video game]]s. [[Modchips]], in their current form, were first available for the Sony [[PlayStation]] (and later the [[PlayStation 2]]). Various other types of copyright circumvention systems also existed for the [[Nintendo 64]] and the older Game Boy consoles (though neither include actual modding, but instead backup devices).

==== Types of modding ====
There are two different ways of running unsigned code on a game console. One is through [[Softmod|soft modding]] (modifying software, normally using a [[softmod]]) to allow the user to change data contained on its [[hard drive]] in the case of the Xbox. Another type of modding, known as [[hard modding]], exploits the [[BIOS]] of the console to run unsigned code, or games. This form of 'modding' (more correctly termed as [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]]) is very popular as it is able to 'run' many different types of software. But soft modding is even more popular because of its ease of installation and its relatively low price (it can even be done for free with the right tools). Another type of console modding is about appearances, much like computer case modification, which includes adding lights, cutting the game system case, or adding devices such as whisper quiet fans.

On the other side, some companies actively encourage modding of their products. In cases such as [[TiVo]] and [[Google]], there has been an informal agreement between the modders and the company in which the modders agree not to do anything that destroys the company's business model and the company agrees to support the modding community by providing technical specifications and information. Some commercial [[video game]]s thrive through a [[mod (computer gaming)|modding]] community. In the case of ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', a mod called ''[[Counter-Strike]]'' drove sales of the original software for years.

Many games, such as ''[[The Elder Scrolls|The Elder Scrolls series]]'', come with a mod editing tool that allows users to create original content for themselves and others. Other games provide the [[source code]] for users to use in experimenting and creating. Still others, like ''[[18 Wheels of Steel]]'', will provide the non-programmed data (images, small codepieces and the like) in a simple archive, which can often be opened by renaming it to a .zip file. Often modders will take the game in directions that the developers never anticipated or didn't have time/funding to include. Generally, a small percent of game players will spend much time mod making, but those who do usually develop communities around modding a particular game. Communities are generally connected via a web forum where new modders can ask questions of more experienced ones, and everyone can find inspiration in the work of others. Some games, like ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'', could never have been as successful as they are without a thriving user community. And as more people have been more connected via the web, this has become a vital and dynamic creative phenomena where users become content creators not just content consumers.

Skilled computer users who are able to crack data formats and reverse engineer a game can modify them to their heart's content, because the creator of the [[software]] has [[copyright]]  authority over who may use it, or change it.  Software is sold with a license that spells out what guarantees, if any, come with the software, and what rights the purchaser has to change the software.  Many people do not read these contracts, or store them in such a way to be able to prove what contract came with what purchase, so some computer users are ignorant to what their rights are with respect to backing up software, modifying software, and sharing it with other potential users.

On August 5, 2009 Matthew Crippen, a student at California State University, was arrested for modifying game consoles such as Xbox, Playstation, and Nintendo Wii for profit.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=8244137 ]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref>  According to him it was so that the owners could play their backup discs of games they legally own.  However, according to the DMCA, it is illegal to circumvent copyright protection software, even for non-pirating uses such as backing up legally owned games.

=== Device drivers ===
Modded [[device driver|drivers]] are made for improved performance which official versions of drivers do not offer or in cases where there are no official versions of drivers for new [[hardware]] designed for older [[operating system]]s such as [[Windows 98]].

=== Computer hardware ===
{{See also|Case modding}}
Case modding is the first thing that comes in to mind when the term modding is applied to computer hardware. This may include from simple case painting to full blown case mod with cooling mods and fabricated pieces.

[[Overclocking]] may also be termed as 'modding', and the overclocking of a graphics card using driver software to gain the performance of a more expensive model is known as 'soft-modding'. Volt modding is a term in which jumpers and rheostats are used to mod a hardware's voltages to yield better overclocks.

== Cars and vehicles ==
{{Main|Car tuning}}

=== Orthopedic ===

Ortho-modding is the car adaptation (seats, [[pedal]]s, etc.) to help drivers to prevent, correct and diminish light [[orthopedic]] and [[backbone]]/[[vertebral column|spine]] problems.

=== Eco-modding ===

Eco-modding is the reduction of drag (see [[Low-energy vehicle]]), petroleum car adaptation to use renewable energy (generally, changing or adding a new [[Internal combustion engine|engine]] or [[electric motor|motor]]), generally [[hydrogen]] or [[electricity]]. See [[hybrid car]]. Occasionally, it has been known to run a [[Diesel engine]] on plant and animal oils. See [[Biodiesel]].

=== Performance tuning ===

[[Car tuning|Car]] and [[engine tuning]] are modification of a car for enhanced performance, in engine power output, handling, aerodynamics, or cosmetic purposes. See also [[:Category:Vehicle modification]].

== Industrial machines ==
Factories get rather expensive machines that are used to mass produce specialized parts.  These machines can be altered to make parts other than how the manufacturers of the machines designed or intended them.  The legality of doing this depends on who owns the machines, and whether the agreement, that supplied the machines to the factories, said anything about this, and what the laws are in the nation where this is being done.

For example, the machines might be leased from the manufacturer of the machines.  If they are ever to be returned, they need to go back in the same kind of condition and engineering shape as when they were first delivered.  There is an annual physical inventory to make sure the factory has everything that they are leasing.  This audit might be done by representatives of the leasing company, who are looking to see recognizable machines, that match their models and safety rules.

== Pens ==

Pen-modding is the act of combining many pen parts either to help with [[pen spinning]], in which a perfect balance is desired to create an ideal spinning pen, or simply for decoration. These pen mods can either be made by combining parts from different pens and/or mechanical pencils, or by buying modded pens online. In some cases, pen mods can exceed over $30–40 USD per pen<ref>[http://penwish.com Custom Pen Spinning Gear, Japanese Mechanical Pencils and Pens]. PenWish. Retrieved on 2010-11-26.</ref>. Recently, the practice of pen modding has grown dramatically in popularity, with several mod brands appearing, and multiple online communities dedicated to pen modding and spinning<ref>[http://www.upsb.info/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page Main Page - UPSB].
