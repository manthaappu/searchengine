<html> <head> <title>Magnetic Particle Imaging</title></head><body>'''Magnetic Particle Imaging''' ('''MPI''') is a [[Tomography|tomographic]] [[imaging technique]] that [[Measurement|measures]] the [[magnetic field]]s generated by magnetic particles in a [[tracer]]. Researchers at [[Philips Research]] have used the technique to achieve resolutions finer than one [[millimeter]]. Magnetic Particle Imaging has potential applications in [[medicine]] and [[material science]]. Recently, the first in-vivo results were published revealing structures of a beating mouse heart.

In comparison to the classic setup as a cave, the university of Lübeck in Germany is developing a single-sided MPI scanner. The single-sided MPI scanner could be used like a subsonic device.
