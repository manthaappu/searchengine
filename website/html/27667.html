'''Optical imaging''' is an [[:wikt:imaging|imaging]] technique.
 
[[Optics]] usually describes the behavior of visible, ultraviolet, and infrared light used in imaging.
 
Because light is an electromagnetic wave, similar phenomena occur in X-rays, microwaves, radio waves.

== Diffusive optical imaging in neuroscience==

''Diffusive optical imaging'' (also known as ''Near Infrared Optical Tomography'' or NIROT) is a technique that gives [[neuroscientist]]s the ability to simultaneously obtain information about the source of neural activity as well as its time course.  In other words, it allows them to "see" neural activity and study the functioning of the [[brain]].

In this method, a near-infrared laser is positioned on the [[scalp]].  Detectors composed of [[optical fiber]] bundles are located a few [[centimeter]]s away from the light source.  These detectors sense how the path of light is altered, either through [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] or [[scattering]], as it traverses brain tissue.  

This method can provide two types of information.  First, it can be used to measure the absorption of light, which is related to concentration of [[chemical]]s in the brain.  Second, it can measure the scattering of light, which is related to physiological characteristics such as the swelling of [[glia]] and [[neuron]]s that are associated with neuronal firing.

Typical applications include rapid 2D optical ''[[topographic]]'' imaging of the [[event-related optical signal]] (EROS) or [[Near infrared spectroscopy]] (NIRS) signal following [[human brain|brain]] activity and ''[[tomography|tomographic]]'' [[reconstruction algorithm|reconstruction]] of an entire 3D volume of tissue to diagnose [[breast cancer]] or [[neonate|neonatal]] [[human brain|brain]] [[haemorrhage]]. The spatial resolution of DOT techniques is several millimeters, comparable to the lower end of [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI).  The temporal resolution of EROS is very good, comparable to [[electroencephalography]], and [[magnetoencephalography]] (~milliseconds), while that of NIRS, which measures hemodynamic changes rather than neuronal activity, is comparable to fMRI (~seconds).  DOT instruments are relatively low cost ($150,000), portable and immune to electrical interference.  The signal-to-noise ratio of NIRS is quite good, enabling detection of responses to single events in many cases.  EROS signals are much weaker, typically requiring averaging of many responses.

Important chemicals that this method can detect include [[hemoglobin]] and [[cytochrome]]s.

== Ballistic optical imaging ==

''Ballistic optical imaging'' systems ignore the diffused photons and rely only on the [[ballistic photon]]s to create high-resolution (near [[diffraction limit]]ed) images through scattering media.
