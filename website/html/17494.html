'''IEEE 854-1987''' titled ''Standard for radix-independent floating-point arithmetic'', was the first [[IEEE]] [[standard]] for [[floating-point arithmetic]] with [[radix]] 2 or radix 10 (not more general than that, despite the title). 

It was superseded in 2008 by [[IEEE 754-2008]], which specifies floating-point arithmetic for both radix 2 and radix 10, including specifying two alternative formats for radix 10 floating-point values. IEEE 854 did not specify any formats. IEEE 754-2008 also has many other updates to the IEEE floating point standardisation.
