<html> <head> <title>Unconventional computing</title></head><body>'''Unconventional computing''' is [[computing]] by a wide range of new or unusual methods. It is also known as '''alternative computing'''. The different methods of unconventional computing include [[optical computing]], [[quantum computing]], [[chemical computer|chemical computing]], [[natural computation|natural computing]], [[biologically-inspired computing]], [[wetware computer|wetware computing]], [[DNA computer|DNA computing]], [[molecular computer|molecular computing]], [[amorphous computing]], [[nanocomputer|nanocomputing]], [[reversible computing]], [[ternary computer|ternary computing]], [[fluidics]], [[analogue computer|analogue computing]], and [[domino computer|Domino Computation]].

Historically, [[mechanical computers]] were used in industry before the advent of the [[transistor]]. Mechanical computers retain some interest today both in research and as analogue computers. Some mechanical computers have a theoretical or didactic relevance, such as [[billiard-ball computer]]s or hydraulic ones,<ref name=pen-empnew>[[Roger Penrose|Penrose, Roger]]: The Emperor's New Mind. Oxford University Press, 1990. See also corresponding [[The Emperor's New Mind|article on it]].</ref> and are actually simulated.  (No attempt is made to build a functioning computer through the mechanic collisions of billiard balls.) The [[Domino computer]] is another theoretically interesting mechanic computing scheme.

Unconventional computing is, according to a recent conference description,<ref>{{cite web | title = Unconventional computation Conference 2007 | url = http://cnls.lanl.gov/uc07/ }}</ref> "an interdisciplinary research area with the main goal to enrich or go beyond the standard models, such as the von-Neumann computer architecture and the Turing machine, which have dominated computer science for more than half a century". These methods model their computational operations based on non-standard paradigms, and are currently mostly in the research and development stage. This computing behavior can be "simulated" using the classical silicon-based micro-transistors or [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] computing technologies, but aim to achieve a new kind of computing engineering inspired in nature. 

== Mechanisms ==

* [[Billiards|Billiard]] balls ([[billiard ball computer]]); this is an unintuitive and pedagogical example that a computer can be made out of almost anything.
* [[Light]] ([[optical computing]])
: Computers can manipulate information as light (rather than electricity or billiard balls).
* [[Molecules]] ([[DNA computing]], [[chemical computing]])
* Gears, levels, dials, etc. ([[analog computer]]/[[mechanical computers]])
* [[Neurons]] ([[wetware computer]])
* [[Fluid]] ([[fluidics]])
* Agents acting under a special set of rules ([[cellular automata]])
: People acting under a set of rules can be ''part'' of a computer; [http://xkcd.com/505/ example]. If the "agent" were a human, it would not be major part of the computer, exactly like a single neuron is not an entire brain system.
