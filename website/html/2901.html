In [[multifunction printer|multifunction or all-in-one printers]], [[fax machine]]s, [[photocopier]]s and [[Image scanner|scanner]]s, an '''automatic document feeder''' or '''ADF''' is a feature which takes several pages and feeds the paper one page at a time into a scanner or copier<ref>[http://www.techterms.com/definition/adf Automatic Document Feeders]. Techterms.Com. Accessed 2010-May-10.</ref>, allowing the user to [[Image scanning|scan]], and thereby [[photocopying|copy]], [[printing|print]], or [[fax]], multiple-page documents without having to manually replace each page. On most copiers, you have a choice of scanning on the flatbed or platen (the "glass") or through a document feeder. The vast majority of fax machines have an ADF, allowing the unattended sending of multi-page faxes. Due to the ubiquity of ADF in fax machines, some fax machine owners use the fax machine as a scanner, faxing multi-page documents to themselves. Document feeders are described by speed, in pages per minute or ppm, and capacity, usually in a range from 10 sheets to 200. 

There are two kinds of document feeders capable of two-sided (duplex) scanning: a '''reversing automatic document feeder''' or '''RADF''' scans one side of a page, then flips it and scans the other side. A '''duplexing automatic document feeder''' or '''DADF''' scans both sides in one pass. The advantage of the DADF is faster speed for two-sided originals. RADFs and DADFs are rated in images per minute (IPM), the number of sides they can scan each minute.
