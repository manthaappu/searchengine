<html> <head> <title>European Conference on Computer Vision</title></head><body>'''ECCV''', the '''European Conference on Computer Vision''', is a bi-annual research conference organised by the [[IEEE]]. Similar to [[ICCV]] in scope and quality, it is held those years which ICCV is not. Like ICCV, it is considered an important conference in computer vision,<ref>[http://www.cs.ecnu.edu.cn/~mlan/SoC-Conference-Ranking.htm SoC Conference Ranking]</ref> with an 'A' rating from the Australian Ranking of ICT Conferences<ref>[http://www.arc.gov.au/era/era_journal_list.htm Australian Ranking of ICT Conferences]</ref>.

Like many IEEE conferences, ECCV has tutorial talks, technical sessions, and poster sessions. The conference is usually spread over four to five days. Leading experts in the focus areas would give tutorial talks on the first day. Then the technical sessions (and poster sessions in parallel) would follow.
