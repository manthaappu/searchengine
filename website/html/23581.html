'''Martin Kay''' is a [[computer scientist]] known especially for his work in [[computational linguistics]].

Born and raised in the [[United Kingdom]], he received his M.A. from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], in 1961. In 1958 he started to work at the [[Cambridge Language Research Unit]], one of the earliest centers for research in what is now known as Computational Linguistics. In 1961, he moved to the [[Rand Corporation]] in [[Santa Monica, California]], [[USA]], where he eventually became head of research in linguistics and machine translation. He left Rand in 1972 to become Chair of the Department of Computer Science at the [[University of California, Irvine]]. In 1974, he moved to the [[Xerox Palo Alto Research Center]] as a Research Fellow. In 1985, while retaining his position at Xerox PARC, he joined the faculty of [[Stanford University]] half-time. He is currently Professor of Linguistics at Stanford University and Honorary Professor of Computational Linguistics at [[Saarland University]].

==Life==

He was born in Great Britain and he studied linguistics and computational linguistics at Trinity College in Cambridge. 

In the autumn, he generally teaches 182/282 "Human and Machine Translation" described in the catalog as follows:
The process of translation by professional and amateur translators, and by existing and proposed machine-translation systems; what each might learn from the other.
Prerequisite: advanced knowledge of a foreign language.

Recently, he has been teaching a similar course in the first ten weeks of the summer quarter at the University of the Saarland.

In the winter, at Stanford, he teaches 183/283 "Programming and Algorithms for Natural Language Processing". It is describes as follows:
Construction of computer programs for linguistic processes such as string search, morphological, syntactic, and semantic analysis and generation, and simple machine translation. Emphasis is on the algorithms that have proved most useful for solving such problems.

His main interests are translation, both by people and machines, and computational linguistic algorithms, especially in the fields of morphology and syntax. 

==Work==

Kay worked at Rand Corporation, the University of California at Irvine and XEROX PARC. Kay is one of the pioneers of computational linguistics and machine translation. He was responsible for introducing the notion of chart parsing in computational
linguistics, and the notion of unification in linguistics generally. 

With [[Ronald Kaplan|Ron Kaplan]], he pioneered research and application development in finite-state morphology. He has been a longtime contributor to, and critic of, work on machine translation. In his seminal paper "The Proper Place of Men and Machines in Language Translation," Kay argued for MT systems that were tightly integrated in the human translation process. He was reviewer and critic of EUROTRA, Verbmobil, and many other MT projects. 

Kay is former Chair of the Association of Computational Linguistics and President of the [[International Committee on Computational Linguistics]]. He was a Research Fellow at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center until 2002. He holds an
honorary doctorate of [[Gothenburg University]]. This year, Kay received the lifetime Achievement Award of the Association for Computational Linguistics for his sustained role as an intellectual leader of NLP research.

==Achievements and honors==

* His achievements include the development of [[chart parsing]] and [[functional unification grammar]] and major contributions to the application of finite state automata in computational phonology and morphology. He is also regarded as a leading authority on [[machine translation]].

* His honors include an honorary Doctor of Philosophy from [[Gothenburg University]] and
the 2005 [[Association for Computational Linguistics]]' '''Lifetime Achievement Award'''. He is the permanent chairman of the [[International Committee on Computational Linguistics]].
