<html> <head> <title>Decision rules</title></head><body>A set of '''decision rules''' is the verbal equivalent of a graphical [[decision tree]], which specifies class membership based on a hierarchical sequence of (contingent) decisions.  Each rule in a set of decision rules therefore generally takes the form of a [[Horn clause]] wherein class membership is implied by a conjunction of contingent observations.  

:'''IF''' <math>condition_1</math> '''AND''' <math>condition_2</math> '''AND''' ... '''AND''' <math>condition_n</math> '''THEN''' CLASS = <math>class_i</math>

where <math>condition_j</math> is in general contingent on the choice of <math>condition_{j-1}</math>.  Decision rules can be transcribed from the corresponding decision tree, or can be induced directly from observations.

Decision rules are commonly used in the medical field.  For example, the Ottawa Ankle Rules guide obtaining radiographs for traumatic ankle pain.
