'''Human68k''' is an [[operating system]] for [[Sharp Corporation]]'s personal workstation [[X68000]]. It's developed by SHARP and [[Hudson Soft]].

== Appearance and usage ==
Generally, it looks like [[Microsoft]]'s [[MS-DOS]], but doesn't have [[IO.SYS]] and [[MSDOS.SYS]]. This is because Human68K doesn't care about porting to other hardware platform at all. Hardware-dependent things are done by [[X68000]]'s [[IOCS]].
 
The [[file extension]] of executable programs is ".X". The [[command line interface|command line]] [[shell (computing)|shell]] can be started by executing <code>COMMAND.X</code>.
Lately, <code>COMMAND.R</code> was developed as a [[free software]], and it was relocatable.
