A '''ternary plot''', '''ternary graph''', '''triangle plot''', '''simplex plot''', or '''de Finetti diagram''' is a [[barycentric coordinates (mathematics)|barycentric]] [[plot (graphics)|plot]] on three variables which sum to a constant. It graphically depicts the ratios of the three variables as positions in an [[equilateral]] [[triangle]]. It is used in [[petrology]], [[mineralogy]], [[metallurgy]], and other physical sciences to show the compositions of systems composed of three species. In [[population genetics]], it is often called a [[de Finetti diagram]].  In [[game theory]], it is often called a ''[[simplex]] plot''.

In a ternary plot, the proportions of the three variables ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' must sum to some constant, ''K''. Usually, this constant is represented as 1.0 or 100%. Because ''a'' + ''b'' + ''c'' = ''K'' for all substances being graphed, any one variable is not independent of the others, so only two variables must be known to find a sample's point on the graph: for instance, ''c'' must be equal to ''K'' &minus; ''a'' &minus; ''b''. Because the three proportions cannot vary independently, it is possible to graph the intersection of all three variables in only two dimensions.

==Reading values on the triangular plot==
A ternary plot is drawn as a triangle. Each base, or side, of the triangle represents a proportion of 0%, with the point of the triangle opposite that base representing a proportion of 100%. As a proportion increases in any one sample, the point representing that sample moves from the base to the opposite point of the triangle.

==Using Cartesian coordinates ==
[[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] are useful for plotting points in the triangle. Consider an equilateral ternary plot where <math>a=100%</math> is placed at <math>(x,y)=(0,0)</math> and <math>b=100%</math> at <math>(1,0)</math>.  Then <math>c=100%</math> is <math>(\frac{1}{2},\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})</math>, and the triple <math>(a,b,c)</math> is 
<math>(b+\frac{c}{2},\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}c)</math>

==Example==
This example shows how this works for a hypothetical set of three soil samples:

{| class="wikitable"
|width="10%"|Sample #||width="11%"|Organic matter||width="10%"|Clay||width="10%"|Sand||width="55%"|Notes
|-
|Sample 1||80%||10%||10%||Because organic matter and clay make up 90% of this sample, the proportion of sand must be 10%.
|-
|Sample 2||50%||40%||10%||The proportion of sand is 10% in this sample too, but the proportions of organic matter and clay are different.
|-
|Sample 3||10%||40%||50%||This sample has the same proportion of clay as in Sample 2 does, but because it has a smaller proportion of organic matter, the proportion of sand must be larger, because all samples' proportions must sum to 100%.
