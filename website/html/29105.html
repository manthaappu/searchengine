'''Phobot''' is a [[robot]] that exhibits [[behaviour]] that mimics [[fear]] and overcoming it by [[Systematic desensitization|graded exposure]]. The robot was voted the public's favourite at a conference on human-robot interaction in [[Amsterdam]]. It was designed by a team of students at the [[University of Amsterdam]], and constructed from [[Lego]].<ref name = AP>{{citeweb| url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,338172,00.html| title = Cowardly 'Phobot' Steals Show at Amsterdam Robot Conference| publisher = [[Fox news]]| date = 17| month=March| year = 2008| author = [[Associated Press]]}}</ref> It was designed to help children deal with [[phobia]]s and [[anxiety|anxieties]].

==Behaviour==
When Phobot sees a larger robot, it retreats, and spins around, making high pitched noises, seemingly in panic.<ref name = AP /> When it is gradually exposed to smaller robots, and is coached by holding its hands is talking to it in a soothing manner, it learns to overcome its fear.<ref name = volksvideo>{{cite video |date=March 2008 |title= gaan robots mensen vervangen |url= http://www.vk.tv/video/19705 |publisher= [[Volkskrant]]}} in Dutch</ref> This approach mimics the process of systematic desensitization, or graded exposure treatment, common in the treatment of phobias.

==Design==
Phobot was built for a competition at the international conference on human-robot interaction 2008 from a [[Lego Mindstorms]] robot kit, and its behaviour implemented in the Mindstorms software.<ref name = AP /> It uses [[RFID]], sound and touch sensors to interact with humans.<ref name = homepage>{{citeweb| url = http://staff.science.uva.nl/~hcramer/phobot/ |title = Meet Phobot! | publisher = [[University of Amsterdam]]}}</ref> It was designed as a low cost proof of concept for an affective robot, coaching children to deal with phobias and anxieties.<ref name = volksvideo />
