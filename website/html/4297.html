The '''Boot File System''' (Named '''BFS''' on Linux, but '''BFS''' also refers to the [[Be File System]]) was used on [[UnixWare]] to store files necessary to its boot process.

It does not support directories, and only allows contiguous allocation for files, to make it simpler to be used by the boot loader.

==Implementations==

Besides the UnixWare support, Martin Hinner wrote a '''bfs''' kernel module for [[Linux]] that supports it.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://martin.hinner.info/fs/bfs/ | title=UnixWare boot filesystem for Linux | author=Martin Hinner | date=1999 | publisher=Martin Hinner | accessdate=2008-12-21 }}</ref>

He documented the file system layout as part of the process.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://martin.hinner.info/fs/bfs/bfs-structure.html | title=The BFS filesystem structure | author=Martin Hinner | date=1999 | publisher=Martin Hinner | accessdate=2008-12-21 }}</ref>
