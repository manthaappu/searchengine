'''''Marvel Trading Card Game''''' is a [[video game]] for the [[Nintendo DS]], [[Personal computer|PC]], and [[PlayStation Portable]].  It was developed by [[Vicious Cycle Software]] and [[1st Playable Productions]] and published by [[Konami]].  The game is based on [[Upper Deck Entertainment|Upper Deck Entertainment's]] [[Marvel Comics|Marvel Comics-based]] [[collectible card game]], and was released across all three platforms in several regions in 2007.

''Marvel Trading Card Game'' is a virtual card game in which the player chooses to be either a [[superhero]] or [[supervillain]] in [[Single-player video game|single-player]] mode.  [[Multiplayer]] modes are also available.  The game follows the rules laid out in Upper Deck's [[VS System]], used in card games across several franchises including Marvel, [[DC Comics]], and [[Hellboy]].

The game received mixed reviews from critics.  It was considered faithful to the physical version, but reviewers commented that it was not accessible to players who weren't already fans of collectible card games.  The handheld versions were criticized for presenting a visual format inappropriate for small screens.

==Gameplay==
{{main|VS System}}
''Marvel Trading Card Game'' is a [[collectible card game]] with similarities to other card games, like ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]''.<ref name="ignpspreview" />  The game was designed to portray the [[VS System]] rules exactly the same as the physical version,<ref name="mcint">{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/vgstories.918|title=From the Tabletop to the Screen|last=Draudt|first=Greg|date=07-11-2007|publisher=Marvel Comics|accessdate=2009-03-24}}</ref> created by [[baseball card]] manufacturer [[Upper Deck Entertainment]].<ref name="gspotannouncee3">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/psp/strategy/marveltradingcardgame/news.html?sid=6149288&mode=news|title=E3 06: Marvel card game decks PCs, portables|last=Sinclair|first=Brendan|date=05-09-2006|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=2009-03-27}}</ref>  Players start each match with a premade deck of [[Playing cards|cards]],<ref name="ignpspreview">{{cite web|url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/769/769139p1.html|title=Marvel Trading Card Game Review (PSP)|last=Goldstein|first=Hilary|date=2007-02-28|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref> from which they draw a number of cards to form a hand.  Cards in the hand can be subsequently put into play, and each card represents a character or ability that is played against similar cards possessed by the opponent.<ref name="gspotpcreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/marveltradingcardgame/review.html|title=Marvel Trading Card Game Review (PC)|last=Davis|first=Ryan|date=2007-07-23|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref>

[[File:MTCGPSPScreen.jpg|left|thumb|A [[screenshot]] from the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] version of the game, displaying the playing field of a match.]]
Matches are formatted into segmented [[Game mechanic#Turns|turns]] during which players can act.<ref name="gspotpcreview" />  Each turn a player draws two cards to add to their hand,<ref name="pgamerpspreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/PSP/Marvel+Trading+Card+Game/review.asp?c=3306|title=PSP review, Marvel Trading Card Game|last=Parkin|first=Simon|date=06-12-2007|publisher=Pocket Gamer UK|accessdate=2009-03-27}}</ref> and cards in a hand can be put onto the playing field.  The playing field is made of up individual rows where cards can be placed; there are six rows for each player.<ref name="vcdiary" />  Cards are played by spending "resource points" which act as a form of [[Magic point#Synonyms|energy]].  The more powerful a card is, the more resource points are required to play it.<ref name="ignpspreview" />  Resource points are gained by specifically assigning any card in the hand to a resource row,<ref name="palgndsreview">{{cite web|url=http://palgn.com.au/article.php?id=8628&sid=7bc98aee1b422782a0db95fcbfff6fe8|title=Marvel Trading Card Game Review|last=Rositano|first=Joseph|date=2007-09-29|publisher=PALGN|accessdate=2009-03-27}}</ref> and only one card can be made into a resource each turn.<ref name="gspotpcreview" />  More powerful cards, such as [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], require a higher available pool of resources and so can only be played in later turns in a match.<ref name="ignpspreview" />
Once put into play from the player's hand, a card can be used to provide a benefit to the player or to attack the opponent.<ref name="gradarpspreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/psp/review/marvel-trading-card/a-2007032013565591063|title=Marvel Trading Card|work=PSP|last=Bratcher|first=Eric|publisher=GamesRadar|accessdate=2009-03-27}}</ref>  Types of cards include characters, such as [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] and [[Namor]];<ref name="ignpspreview" /> each character has an attack and defense rating that represents how much damage they can inflict and sustain.<ref name="gspotpcreview" />  Other cards include locations and equipment, which can be used to boost the statistics and abilities of characters,<ref name="gradarpspreview" /> and "plot twists" which encompass a wide range of effects, such as forcing an opponent to forfeit some of the cards in their hand.<ref name="gspotpcreview" />  Each player has a [[Health (gaming)|life bar]] that is depleted with each successful attack by an opponent, and a player [[Game over|loses the match]] when their life bar is empty.<ref name="gzpspreview" />

[[File:MTCGTeam.jpg|right|thumb|[[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] and [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] activating a "Team Attack".  Both characters are members of the [[supervillain]] team [[Sinister Six]].]]
Whenever a card in play is activated or otherwise used, such as resources, it is referred to as "[[List_of_Magic:_The_Gathering_keywords#Tap.2FUntap|tapped]]" and is generally unavailable for further use until the next turn.  Unlike ''Magic'', however, characters can attack and defend in the same turn, unless they are "stunned" in combat.  Damage is calculated by adding the difference between an attacking character's attack and the defending character's defense, plus the resource cost of the card.  Any damage not absorbed by a defending character is applied to the player's life total.<ref name="gzpspreview">{{cite web|url=http://psp.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r29714.htm|title=Marvel Trading Card Game Review (PSP)|last=Aceinet|date=2007-03-20|publisher=GameZone|accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref>  The location of a card on the playing field can affect its statistics; in order to attack, characters further away from the opponent must possess a projectile weapon or the ability to fly, for instance.<ref name="gspotpcreview" />  Adjacent characters with a matching team affiliation within the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] universe can also reinforce one another's attack and defense,<ref name="palgndsreview" /> such as the [[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends|Spider Friends]] and [[X-Men]].<ref name="gzpspreview" />  Cards activating an ability can be countered by the opponent,<ref name="gradarpspreview2">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/psp/review/marvel-trading-card/a-2007032013565591063/p-2|title=Marvel Trading Card (page 2)|last=Bratcher|first=Eric|publisher=GamesRadar|accessdate=2009-03-27}}</ref> and these abilities and counters combine to form a "chain" that dictates the order in which their effects are applied.<ref name="gzpspreview" />

===Single-player===
''Marvel Trading Card Game's'' [[Single-player video game|single-player]] mode allows the player to choose one of two different campaigns; one for [[Superhero|heroes]] and one for [[Supervillain|villains]].  Both campaigns are based around the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]].  Each campaign contains six chapters, with each chapter represented by a series of card matches.  The chapters are different for heroes and villains with the exception of the final chapter.<ref name="vcdiary2">{{cite web|url=http://www.viciouscycleinc.com/developer_diaries/diary.cfm?ID=12|title=Vicious Cycle Developer Diaries: Cross-Platform Compatibility and Story Mode|last=Ellis|first=Dave|date=2007-03-26|publisher=Vicious Cycle Software, Inc.|accessdate=2009-03-27}}</ref>  Some matches have additional requirements for victory beyond reducing an opponent's health to zero.<ref name="vcdiary2" />  Completing missions awards the player [[booster pack]]s and virtual money that can be used to purchase additional cards in the in-game card shop.<ref name="ignpspreview" />

==Development==
In August 2005, video game publisher [[Konami]] acquired an exclusive [[Brand licensing|license]] to make games based on Upper Deck's Marvel collectible card game.<ref name="gsutralicense">{{cite web|url=http://gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=6254|title=Round-Up: Marvel's Digital CCG, Penny Arcade's Non-Digital CCG, Romero's Non-CCG|last=Maragos|first=Nich|date=08-17-2005|publisher=Gamasutra|accessdate=2009-03-27}}</ref>  Konami had published previous titles based on card games, such as the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! media#Yu-Gi-Oh!-related video games|''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' series]].<ref name="ignannounce">{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/642/642919p1.html|title=Konami in on Marvel Card Game|last=Adams|first=David|date=08-17-2005|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref>  ''Marvel Trading Card Game'' was formally announced at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) video game [[Convention (meeting)|convention]] in May 2006.  Konami explained that the game would use Upper Deck's "VS System" rules and would be available for the DS, PSP, and PC consoles.  It was to have both single-player and multiplayer modes for all three systems, and the PC and PSP versions would be cross-compatible.<ref name="gspotannounce" />  Konami promised that it would host online tournaments, complete with prizes.<ref name="igne3">{{cite web|url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/706/706872p1.html|title=E3 2006: Konami Conference Preview Round-Up|last=Sony PlayStation Team|date=05-09-2006|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref>  The PSP and PC versions were developed by [[Vicious Cycle Software]], and the DS version was [[Outsourcing|outsourced]] to New York-based designer [[1st Playable Productions]].<ref name="vcdiary">{{cite web|url=http://www.viciouscycleinc.com/developer_diaries/diary.cfm?ID=8|title=Vicious Cycle Developer Diaries: MTCG - The Beginning|last=Ellis|first=Dave|date=03-04-2007|publisher=Vicious Cycle Software, Inc.|accessdate=2009-03-27}}</ref>

From the beginning of development, Vicious Cycle wanted players on all three consoles to be able to play against each other online.<ref name="vcdiary" />  This option was ultimately not implemented for the DS.  Lead designer [[Dave Ellis (game designer)|Dave Ellis]] said "...development time and platform limitations didn’t permit our DS developers to pursue that option, so the DS version was ultimately limited to Wi-Fi and online play with other DS players."  The PSP and PC versions allow players to use the same matchmaking system, and the game's code is linked so that if one platform is patched, the other must be as well.<ref name="vcdiary2" />  Players with a PC can download and use the online component of the game for free.<ref name="fpdownload">{{cite web|url=http://www.fileplanet.com/174419/170000/fileinfo/Marvel:-Trading-Card-Game-(Online-Client)|title=Marvel: Trading Card Game v1.1|publisher=FilePlanet|accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref>

The plot in the single-player mode of ''Marvel Trading Card Game'' was composed by Marvel writer [[John Layman]], and the [[Cut scene|cutscenes]] were drawn by comic artists like [[Keron Grant]] and [[Pat Olliffe]].<ref name="mcannounce">{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/vgstories.415.Marvel_TCG_for_PSP|title=Marvel Trading Card Game for PSP out now|date=2007-02-27|publisher=Marvel Comics|accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref>  Early in the development process, the design team had considered portraying the player's avatar as a character within the game's story, but this idea was eventually discarded, and the game does not explain the player's role.  The plot, which revolves around the group of robotic enemies of the X-Men known as Sentinels, was created because in real life, competitive play in the Marvel card game community was focused on Sentinel decks around the time of ''Marvel Trading Card Game's'' development.  Around 300 separate decks were created by the design team for the single-player mode, and AI opponents use a more challenging deck if they are played against more than once.<ref name="vcdiary2" />

The game contains over 1,100 cards,<ref name="vcdiary" /> and includes cards from select expansion sets in the physical version, like the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Fantastic Four]].  PC and PSP owners can download the X-Men expansion set online for free.  Over four hundred characters are represented, with over a hundred as specific entries in the story mode.<ref name="mcint" />  Artwork for cards was provided by artists such as [[Alex Garner]] and [[Adam Kubert]].<ref name="gspote3" />  Whenever a player completes a chapter in the story mode, they are awarded a five-card booster pack.<ref name="vcdiary2" />  The game includes a deck editor that allows players to create and modify decks as they see fit.<ref name="mcint" />

''Marvel Trading Card Game'' was released for the PSP on February 27, 2007 in [[North America]], June 8 in [[Europe]], and July 6 in [[Australia]].<ref name="gfaqspsp">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/psp/data/932927.html|title=Marvel Trading Card Game Release Information for PSP|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref>  The DS version was released on May 22 in North America, July 25 in Europe, and on August 3 in Australia.<ref name="gfaqsds">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/ds/data/932928.html|title=Marvel Trading Card Game Release Information for DS|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref>  The PC version was released on June 8 in Europe and July 3 in North America, and included a [[Special edition|limited edition]].<ref name="gfaqspc">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/data/932926.html|title=Marvel Trading Card Game Release Information for PC|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref>

The game's difficulty, especially the complexity of the VS System ruleset, was described as a potential barrier for gamers.<ref name="pgamerpspreview" /><ref name="gzdsreview" />  [[PALGN]] said "Even though there are a handful of in-game tutorials, they aren’t entirely utilised efficiently as they’re basically just a big slab of text making the game less friendly towards a wider audience."<ref name="palgndsreview" /> [[GamesRadar|GamesRadar's]] Eric Bratcher said "If you aren't familiar with the source, get ready for a very steep learning curve."<ref name="gradarpspreview" />  One [[X-Play]] reviewer commented that the game's tutorial "might go down in history as the worst in-game tutorial ever created,"<ref name="xplaydsreview" /> and another said that gamers who would be most interested in the video game would already be avid players of the physical version.<ref name="xplaypspreview" />
