A '''postscript''', abbreviated '''P.S.''', is writing added after the main body of a letter (or other body of writing). The term comes from the [[Latin]] ''post scriptum'', an expression meaning "written after"<ref Name="Sullivan">{{cite book

A postscript may be a sentence, a paragraph, or occasionally many paragraphs added, often hastily and incidentally, after the signature of a letter or (sometimes) the main body of an essay or book. In a book or essay, a more carefully-composed addition (e.g., for a second edition) is called an [[afterword]]. An afterword, not usually called a postscript, is written in response to critical remarks on the first edition. The word "postscript" has, poetically, been used to refer to any sort of addendum to some main work, even if not attached to a main work, as in [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s book titled ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]].''

Sometimes, when additional points are made after the first postscript, abbreviations such as PPS (post-post-scriptum, or postquam-post-scriptum) and PPPS (post-post-post-scriptum, and so on, ''[[ad infinitum]]'') are used, though only PPS has somewhat common usage.
A post script may be used to add additional information about the book.
