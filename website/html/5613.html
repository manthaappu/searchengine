'''Catalysis''' is a method for the specification and design of component-based computer systems originally developed by Desmond D’Souza and Alan Cameron Wills in their 1999 book<ref>''Objects, Components and Frameworks with UML: The Catalysis Approach'', D’Souza, D.F. and Wills, A.C., Reading MA: Addison-Wesley, 1999 ISBN 0-201-31012-0</ref>. It shows how to make precise abstractions, and emphasizes the formal specification of use cases using pre- and postconditions and ‘guarantees’ clauses. It also places stress on the specification of collaboration protocols so that kits of components can interact in a coherent ‘pluggable’ fashion. This removes much of the need to build translation or ‘mapping’ code. Catalysis therefore enhances the [[Unified Modelling Language]] (UML) with a definite method, showing how the various UML diagrams relate to each other and offering many design heuristics and process and [[design pattern]]s. Catalysis builds on the [[Syntropy]] method and key ideas from both influenced the development of [[UML 2.0]].

More recently, building on the work of D’Souza, Wills and that of John Cheesman and John Daniels<ref>''UML Components'', Cheesman, J. and Daniels, J., Harlow, England: Addison-Wesley, 2000 ISBN 0-201-70851-5</ref>, Derek Andrews of consultancy Trireme International has developed Catalysis II, which extends Catalysis to address the key issues of [[Service Oriented Architecture]] (SOA). Also building on the same foundation, Ian Graham developed Catalysis Conversation Analysis<ref>''Requirements Modelling and Specification for Service Oriented Architecture'', Graham, I., Chichester: Wiley, 2008, ISBN 978-0-470-77563-9</ref>, a method of business process modelling with its roots in [[Semiotics]] and the idea of a [[use case]] (''cf''. Graham, 2008).
