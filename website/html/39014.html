'''Uppaal''' is an integrated [[tool]] [[software platform|environment]] for [[model checking|modeling]], validation and verification of [[real-time computing|real-time]] systems modeled as networks of timed [[automaton|automata]], extended with [[data type]]s (bounded integers, arrays etc.).

The tool has been developed in collaboration between the Design and Analysis of Real-Time Systems group at [[Uppsala University]], [[Sweden]] and Basic Research in Computer Science at [[Aalborg University]], [[Denmark]].
