__NOTOC__
'''ThinkFree Office''' by Haansoft ThinkFree Co. Ltd., a subsidiary company of [[Haansoft Corporation]], is an [[office suite]] written in [[Java (Sun)|Java]] that runs on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] platforms. 

ThinkFree Office includes a [[word processor]] (Write), a [[spreadsheet]] (Calc), a presentation program (Show), and a [[WYSIWYG]] HTML and blog editor (Note). ThinkFree Office reads and writes to [[Microsoft Office]] file formats (.doc, .xls, and .ppt). ThinkFree Office has a [[look and feel]] similar to the prevalent Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint, providing a degree of familiarity to users of those applications. 

== ThinkFree Online ==
ThinkFree Online is a web-based edition that runs Write, Calc, Show and Note in a browser using a mix of [[Java applet]] and [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] technologies. It is free to use for a 30 day trial period, except for users in Australia and New Zealand<ref>*Comer, Stuart. [http://www.itwire.com/content/view/15189/127/ "ThinkFree? Think again: it's now a BigPond exclusive"], ''iT Wire'', November 5, 2007. <!--accessed August 28, 2008--></ref><ref>*Walsh, Des. [http://www.thinkinghomebusiness.com/2007/12/09/thinkfree-not-so-free-for-aussies-and-kiwis/ "ThinkFree Not So Free for Aussies and Kiwis"], ''Thinking Home Business'', December 9, 2007. <!--accessed August 28, 2008--></ref>, where only paid members of [[BigPond]] may use the service.  A way around this is to click on the already have account button at the start page and then click sign up.

Each user is allotted 1 GB of online storage space for saving documents. ThinkFree Online lets users collaborate on documents with others, publish to a blog or the web. ThinkFree Online also keeps a version history per document of the changes that are made. 

The Java applet version, or Power Edit mode, exists for all three applications, and appears to be an applet port of the original desktop versions written in Java. [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]]-based Quick Edit mode (offered for Write and Show only) can run without the need of starting up an applet. Also, ThinkFree Online supports a synchronization manager utility to keep documents on the desktop, online and mobile workspaces automatically updated.

==ThinkFree Docs==

ThinkFree Docs is an online community of publishers who share a variety of documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. It is intended to work in conjunction with ThinkFree.

==ThinkFree Mobile==

ThinkFree Mobile is a version of ThinkFree office available for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platform.
