<html> <head> <title>Primefree sequence</title></head><body>In [[mathematics]], a '''primefree sequence''' is a [[sequence]] of [[integer]]s that does not contain any [[prime number]]s. More specifically, it generally means a sequence defined by the same [[recurrence relation]] as the [[Fibonacci number]]s, but with different [[initial conditions]] causing all members of the sequence to be [[composite number]]s that do not all have a common [[divisor]]. To put it algebraically, a sequence of this type is defined by an appropriate choice of two composite numbers ''a''<sub>1</sub> and ''a''<sub>2</sub>, such that the [[greatest common divisor]] GCD(''a''<sub>1</sub>,''a''<sub>2</sub>) = 1, and such that for ''n'' > 2 there are no primes in the sequence of numbers calculated from the formula
:''a<sub>n</sub> = ''a''<sub>''n'' &minus; 1</sub> + ''a''<sub>''n'' &minus; 2</sub>.

==Wilf's sequence==
Perhaps the best known primefree sequence is the one found by [[Herbert Wilf]], with initial terms 

:''a''<sub>1</sub> = 20615674205555510, ''a''<sub>2</sub> = 3794765361567513 {{OEIS|id=A083216}}.

The proof that every term of this sequence is composite relies on the periodicity of Fibonacci-like number sequences modulo the members of a finite set of primes. For each prime ''p'', the positions in the sequence where the numbers are divisible by ''p'' repeat in a periodic pattern, and different primes in the set have overlapping patterns that result in a [[covering set]] for the whole sequence.

==Nontriviality==
The requirement that the initial terms of a primefree sequence be coprime is necessary for the question to be non-trivial. If we allow the initial terms to share a prime factor ''p'' (e.g., set ''a''<sub>1</sub> = ''xp'' and ''a''<sub>2</sub> = ''yp'' for some ''x'' and ''y'' both greater than 1), due to the [[distributivity|distributive property]] of [[multiplication]] it is obvious that ''a''<sub>3</sub> = (''x'' + ''y'')''p'' and more generally all subsequent value in the sequence will be multiples of ''p''. In this case, all the numbers in the sequence will be composite, but for a trivial reason.

The order of the initial terms is also important. In [[Paul Hoffman (science writer)|Paul Hoffman]]'s biography of [[Paul Erdős]], ''[[The man who loved only numbers]]'', the Wilf sequence is cited but with the initial terms switched. The resulting sequence appears primefree for the first hundred terms or so, but term 138 is the 45-digit prime 439351292910452432574786963588089477522344721. {{OEIS2C|id=A108156}} gives other positions of prime numbers in the Wilf-Hoffman sequence.

==Other sequences==
Several other primefree sequences are known:
:''a''<sub>1</sub> = 331635635998274737472200656430763, ''a''<sub>2</sub> = 1510028911088401971189590305498785 (sequence [[OEIS:A083104|A083104]] in [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|OEIS]]; Graham 1964),
:''a''<sub>1</sub> = 62638280004239857, ''a''<sub>2</sub> = 49463435743205655 (sequence [[OEIS:A083105|A083105]] in [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|OEIS]]; Knuth 1990), and
:''a''<sub>1</sub> = 407389224418, ''a''<sub>2</sub> = 76343678551 (sequence [[OEIS:A082411|A082411]] in [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|OEIS]]; Nicol 1999).
The sequence of this type with the smallest known initial terms has
:''a''<sub>1</sub> = 106276436867, ''a''<sub>2</sub> = 35256392432 (Vsemirnov 2004).
