<html> <head> <title>Octatron SkySeer</title></head><body>The '''Octatron SkySeer''' is an autonomous, computer controlled [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV) designed for easy transport and launch.  It is designed and manufactured by Octatron, Incorporated of [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], USA.

Intended for short-range operations, the electric-powered SkySeer resembles a normal [[radio controlled airplane]] or two-meter [[Glider (sailplane)|glider]].  Once unfolded from its storage tube and its electronics initialized, the SkySeer is then hand-launched by its operator.  All of the drone's basic flight functions are handled by [[GPS]] including landings.  Range is approximately two miles/3.2 km and is extendable via Octatron's NetWeaver  interface.

The basic platform is very low cost; a fully loaded SkySeer retails for approximately US$25,000 to $30,000 which includes all electronics, video surveillance equipment, ground station and computer interfaces.  Video interface is in real time and allows the operator to literally see what the drone sees and to record it as such.  The ground station's recorder can store up to twenty hours of high-quality [[MPEG-2]] format video which can then be transferred to [[DVD]] or [[Macromedia Flash]].

The [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] is currently experimenting with the SkySeer as a means of crime prevention.  At present, the experiment has been suspended by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] because of that agency's claim of a lack of the proper permits.  Although the FAA does not regulate model aircraft, it does have jurisdiction over unmanned aerial vehicles.<ref name="wsj1">{{cite web |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB115491642950528436.html?mod=hps_us_editors_picks |title=Drones in Domestic Skies?
