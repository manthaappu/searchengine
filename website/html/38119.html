<html> <head> <title>Transitive reduction</title></head><body>In [[mathematics]], a '''transitive reduction''' of a [[binary relation]] ''R'' on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' is a [[Maximal element|minimal]] [[Relation (mathematics)|relation]] <math>R'</math> on ''X'' such that the [[transitive closure]] of <math>R'</math> is the same as the transitive closure of ''R''.  If the transitive closure of ''R'' is [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]] and [[finite set|finite]], then <math>R'</math> is unique. However, neither existence nor uniqueness of transitive reductions is guaranteed in general.

==Example==

In [[graph theory]], any [[binary relation]] ''R'' on a set ''X'' may be thought of as a [[directed graph]] (''V'', ''A''), where ''V'' = ''X'' is the vertex set and ''A'' = ''R'' is the set of arcs of the graph.  The transitive reduction of a graph is sometimes referred to as its ''minimal representation''.  The following image displays drawings of graphs corresponding to a non-transitive binary relation (on the left) and its transitive reduction (on the right).

The transitive reduction of a finite [[acyclic graph]] is unique. For a graph with nontrivial [[strongly connected component]]s, each such component will become a cycle in any transitive reduction of that graph. More formally, suppose we have a graph G and we form an acyclic graph G' by [[edge contraction|contracting]] each strongly connected component to a vertex. If we take the unique transitive reduction of G', then expand each vertex back out to a cycle containing the vertices contracted to form it, attaching incident edges at any vertex in the cycle, the result will be a minimal transitive reduction regardless of how this expansion is performed.

==Graph algorithms for transitive reduction==

The transitive reduction <math>R^-</math> of an acyclic relation <math>R</math> can be computed using its transitive closure <math>R^+</math>:
:<math>R^- = R - (R \circ R^+)</math>
Here, <math>\circ</math> denotes [[relation composition]].

{{harv|Aho|Garey|Ullman|1972}}, which introduced the term in this meaning, also proves a connection between [[transitive closure]] and reduction:
* they extend the computation of transitive reduction from transitive closure to deal with cycles;
* they give a construction to compute a graph's transitive closure from its transitive reduction;
* thus, transitive closure and transitive reduction have the same [[time complexity]].

The ''tred'' tool in the [[Graphviz]]<ref>http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/</ref> toolset transitively reduces a graph, using a [[depth-first search]]-based implementation.

==Incremental data structures==

One of the most well-studied problems in computational graph theory is that of incrementally keeping track of the transitive closure of a graph while performing a sequence of insertions and deletions of vertices and edges. In 1987,  J.A. La Poutré and J. van Leeuwen described in their well-cited ''Maintenance Of Transitive Closures And Transitive Reductions Of Graphs'' an algorithm for simultaneously keeping track of both the transitive closure and transitive reduction of a graph in this incremental fashion.<ref>http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/poutre87maintenance.html</ref>

The algorithm uses 

:O(|E<sub>new</sub>||V|) 

time for a sequence of consecutive edge insertions and 

:O(|E<sub>old</sub>||V|+|E<sub>old</sub>|<sup>2</sup>) 

time for a sequence of consecutive edge deletions, where E<sub>old</sub> is the edge set prior to the insertions or deletions and E<sub>new</sub> is the edge set afterwards. For acyclic graphs, the deletion algorithm requires only 

:O(|E<sub>old</sub>||V|) 

time. These times are still best-known, as more recent research has preferred to focus on transitive closure.
