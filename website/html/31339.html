==Biography==
Dr. Ahuja holds a joint appointment of Professor in the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department at the [[University of Florida]], Gainesville, and President & CEO of Innovative Scheduling, Inc. He obtained his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, and his M.S. and Ph.D. in Industrial and Management Engineering from the [[Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur]]. He has served as a Professor at the [[Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur]], [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], and the [[Rutgers Business School]].

Dr. Ahuja founded [http://www.InnovativeScheduling.com Innovative Scheduling Inc.], in 2000 to bring cutting-edge [[Operations Research]] techniques to the field of transportation and scheduling. He has developed innovative models and algorithms for several airline scheduling, railroad scheduling, and logistics problems that were previously considered intractable. These models have now been packaged into interactive web-enabled decision support systems. Innovative Scheduling received seed grants from the NSF ([[National Science Foundation]]) [[SBIR]] Program (Small Business Innovations Research) to build two railroad decision support systems: Railroad Blocking and Train Scheduling. The company began commercializing the systems built through these NSF grants, and invested this revenue to fund the research and development of new decision support systems. The company now has eight decision support systems for various railroad planning and scheduling problems, several of these are in use by US railroads saving tens of millions of dollars annually. The company is now diversifying into other modes of transportation including trucking and package delivery. Innovative Scheduling licenses its current suite of decision support systems, builds custom software applications for clients, and provides consulting services through the use of its decision support systems.
