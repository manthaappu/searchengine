'''Hollywood''' is the name of the [[GPU|Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)]] used in [[Nintendo|Nintendo's]] [[Wii]] [[video game console]]. It was designed by [[AMD|AMD's]] [[ATI Technologies|graphics product]] division and is manufactured using the same [[90 nm]] CMOS process<ref name="hard_japan">{{ja icon}}{{cite web| url=http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n10/e3_2006/wii/index.html| title=Wiiの概要 (Wii本体)| publisher=Nintendo |accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref> as the [[Broadway (microprocessor)|"Broadway"]] processor. Very few official details have been released to the public by Nintendo, AMD, or [[IBM]]. The Hollywood GPU is reportedly based on the Nintendo GameCube's "Flipper" GPU and is clocked 50% higher at 243 MHz,<ref name="IGNTech">{{cite web|title=IGN: Revolution's Horsepower|date=2006-03-29|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2006-12-23|url= http://wii.ign.com/articles/699/699118p1.html}}</ref> though none of the [[clock rate]]s have been confirmed by Nintendo, IBM, or AMD.

The Hollywood is a [[multi-chip module]] (MCM) package containing two dies under the cover. One of the two chips, codenamed ''Napa'', controls the I/O functions, RAM access, and the actual GPU with its embedded DRAM, and measures 8 × 9 mm. The other, codenamed ''Vegas'', holds the Audio [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] and the 24 MB of "internal" [[1T-SRAM]] and measures 13.5 × 7 mm.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The Hollywood also contains an [[ARM architecture|ARM926]] core, which has been unofficially nicknamed the ''Starlet''.<ref name="Wiibrew">{{cite web|title=Starlet|url=http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Starlet|work=Wiibrew|accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref> This embedded microprocessor performs many of the I/O functions, including controlling the wireless functionality, USB, the disc drive, and other miscellaneous functions. It also acts as the security controller of the system, performing encryption and authentication functions. The Hollywood includes hardware implementations of [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] and [[SHA-1]], to speed up these functions. Communication with the main CPU is accomplished via an [[Inter-process communication|IPC]] mechanism. The Starlet performs the [[WiiConnect24]] functions while the Wii console is in standby mode.<ref name="Wiibrew"/>
