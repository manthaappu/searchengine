A '''popcorn ceiling''', also known as an '''acoustic ceiling''', is a term for a spray-on or paint-on [[ceiling]] treatment used from the late 1950s into the 1980s in [[United States|American]] residential construction. Cheaper than painting, it could be quickly and easily sprayed on in new construction and was also useful in masking ceiling defects in older homes, such as stains, uneven ceilings or poor workmanship. It was the standard for bedroom and residential hallways ceilings for its noise reduction qualities{{Citation needed|reason=I can't find any evidence that popcorn ceilings actually have noise reduction qualities. Cite or reword.|date=January 2011}}, while kitchen and living rooms ceilings would normally be textured in smoother skip-trowel or [[Orange peel (effect)|orange peel]] texture for their higher durability and ease of cleaning.  Unfortunately, its bright white "[[cottage cheese]]" texture often contained [[asbestos]]. 

Some popcorn ceiling textures were created using a paper based or [[Styrofoam]] product to create the texture, rather than asbestos. Nevertheless, when [[asbestos]] was banned in ceiling treatments in 1977,<ref>http://www.epa.gov/asbestos/pubs/ashome.html#example Asbestos in Your Home at EPA.com</ref> popcorn ceilings fell out of favor.  Fashions changed to more natural and handmade finishes. Popcorn ceilings become unattractive when they get dirty, are easily damaged, and are hard to clean, repaint, or repair. They can be easily, if messily, removed by spraying them with water to soften them up, and scraping the material off with a large scraping trowel or putty knife.<ref>http://www.ronhazelton.com/archives/howto/popcorn_ceiling_removal.shtm How to Remove a Popcorn Textured Ceiling</ref> If they may have been applied before the ban on asbestos, their removal should only be done by a licensed professional or after testing to rule out asbestos contamination.
