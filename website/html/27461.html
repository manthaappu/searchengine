<html> <head> <title>OpenWebNet</title></head><body>'''OpenWebNet''' is a [[Communications protocol|Communication Protocol]] developed by [[Bticino]] since [[2000]].

OpenWebNet Protocol allow a “high level” interaction between a remote unit and [[Bus SCS]] of MyHome [[domotic]] system.

Latest  protocol evolution has been improved to allow interaction with well known home automation systems like [[KNX (standard)|KNX]] and [[DMX512-A]] system, by using appropriate [[gateways]].

The ''OpenWebNet'' protocol is disclosed on MyOpen community.

==OpenWebNet Protocol==
The protocol is thought to being independent from the used technology.
For example it’s possible to use a supervisor software connected via [[Ethernet]], via serial [[RS-232]] or via [[USB]] to a gateway that is directly connected to a domotic system.

Everyone can require protocol message extension. It's enough to propose your own [[Request for Comments|RFC]]. It will be examined and disclosed if it respects  ''OpenWebNet'' syntax.

===Syntax===
An ''OpenWebNet'' message is structured with variable length fields separated by the special character '*' and closed by '##'.

The characters admitted in the fields are numbers and the character “#”.

The structure of a message is therefore:
*field1*field2*… *fieldN## 

The following fields are admitted:
WHO
WHERE
WHAT
DIMENSION
VALUE

'''WHO'''

It characterizes the domotic system function to which the OpenWebNet message is referred.

For example: WHO = 1, characterizes the messages for lighting system management.

'''WHERE'''

It characterizes the set of objects to which the OpenWebNet message is referred. It can be a single object, a group of objects, a specific environment, the entire system, etc.

For every WHO (and therefore for every function) there is a specified WHERE table.

The tag WHERE can also contain optional parameters: WHERE#PAR1#PAR2… #PARn.

Example of where: all the lights of group 1, sensor 2 of zone 1 of alarm system, etc.

'''WHAT'''

It characterizes an action to do or a status to read. For every WHO (and therefore for every function) there is a specific WHAT table.

The field WHAT can also contain optional parameters: WHAT#PAR1#PAR2… #PARn.

Example of actions: switch ON light, dimmer to 75%, switch DOWN shutter, radio ON, etc. 
Example of status: light ON, active alarm, battery unload, etc.

'''DIMENSION'''

Is a range of value that characterizes the dimension of the object to which the message is referred. For every WHO (and therefore for every function) there is a specific DIMENSION table.

It’s possible to require/to read/to write the value of one dimension.
Every dimension has a prefixed number of values, described in VALUE field.

Example of dimension: sensor temperature, loudspeaker volume, firmware version of a device, etc.

'''VALUE'''

It characterizes the read/written value of a written/required/read dimension.

===Message===
There are 4 types of OpenWebNet Message:

Command / Status Message

Status Request Message

Request/Read/Write Dimension Message

Acknowledge Message

''Command / Status Message''
 *WHO*WHAT*WHERE##

''Status Request Message''
 *#WHO*WHERE##

''Request/Read/Write Dimension Message''
Request:
 *#WHO*WHERE*DIMENSION##
Read:
 *#WHO*WHERE*DIMENSION*VALUE1*...*VALUEn##
Write:
 *#WHO*WHERE*#DIMENSION*VALUE1*...*VALUEn##

''Acknowledge Message''
ACK:
 *#*1##
NACK:
 *#*0##

==Gateway OpenWebNet==
It's possible to interact with the SCS [[home automation]] bus by using a specific [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]].

There are two typologies of [[gateways]] that allow a connection to the field [[bus]] by using different [[Technical standard|standard]] [[Communications protocol|protocol]]s:

* Gateway [[Ethernet]] ([[Linux]] based)
* Gateway [[USB]] / [[RS232]]

'''Gateway Ethernet'''

The current implementation by BTicino is also an [[embedded]] [[web server]]. It works as a translator between OpenWebNet messages via TCP/IP and the SCS messages transmitted on the SCS bus.

Actually it is possible to control three different kinds of buses:
* BUS SCS
* [[KNX (standard)|KNX]]
* [[Digital MultipleX|DMX]]

'''Gateway USB / RS232'''

The gateway is an interface that works as a translator between the OpenWebNet messages transmitted on USB or Serial and the SCS messages transmitted on the SCS bus.

==Example==
OpenWebNet message examples

'''Command Message'''

Switch Off of light 77
 *1*0*77##

WHO = 1
WHAT = 0
WHERE = 77

'''Status Message'''

Scenario 1 of scenario unit 23 activated.
 *0*1*23##

WHO = 0
WHAT = 1
WHERE = 23

'''Request status message'''

Status request of probe 1
 *#4*1##

WHO = 4
WHERE = 1

'''Request Dimension Message'''

Request of Temperature Measured, probe 44
 *#4*44*0##

WHO = 4
WHERE = 44
DIMENSION = 0

'''Read Dimension Message'''

Temperature Measured, probe 44
 *#4*44*0*0251*2##

WHO = 4
WHERE = 44
DIMENSION = 0
VALUE1 = 0251 (T=+25,1°C)
VALUE2 = 2 (System in "cooling mode")

'''Write Dimension Message'''

Volume set at 50%, environment 2
 *#16*#2*#1*16*##

WHO = 4
WHERE = #1
DIMENSION = 1
VALUE1 = 16
