{{Unreferenced|date=October 2007}} '''Mangler''' is a software [[design pattern (computer science)|design pattern]]. A Mangler is a pattern that performs multiple operations over a series of data, similar to the [[MapReduce]] function inside of [[BigTable]] and [[Amazon's Dynamo]].  Typically, a mangler is fed a series of Maps from which it performs its internal operations and passes its internal state/data to an external Filter.

A typical usage of the Mangler Pattern is during internal search operations.  When parsing a query from an end-user, the system will try and strip out a series of un-needed tokens, reassembling the original query into a more usable, functional query.

An important distinction between the Mangler and other patterns is the "Modify in place" optimization, pioneered by the pattern's creator.

This pattern was created by [[John Watson (Programmer)|Dr. John Watson]], during his tenure at TransUnion's Research and Development Lab.
