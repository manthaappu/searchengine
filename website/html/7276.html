In [[quantum chemistry]], a '''complete active space''' is a type of classification of [[molecular orbitals]]. [[Spatial orbitals]] are classified as belonging to three classes:

* ''core'', always hold two electrons
* ''active'', partially occupied orbitals
* ''virtual'', always hold zero electrons

This classification allows to develop a set of [[Slater determinant]]s for the description of the [[wavefunction]] as a linear combination of these determinants. Based on the freedom left for the occupation in the active orbitals, a certain number of [[electrons]] are allowed to populate all the active orbitals in appropriate combinations, developing a finite-size space of determinants. The resulting wavefunction is of [[Multireference configuration interaction|multireference]] nature, and is blessed by additional properties if compared to other selection schemes.

The active classification can theoretically be extended to all the molecular orbitals, to obtain a [[full CI]] treatment. In practice, this choice is limited, due to the high computational cost needed to optimize a large CAS wavefunction on medium and large molecular systems.

A Complete Active Space wavefunction is used to obtain a first approximation of the so-called [[static correlation]], which represents the contribution needed to describe bond dissociation processes correctly. This requires a wavefunction that includes a set of electronic configurations with high and very similar importance. [[Dynamic correlation]], representing the contribution to the energy brought by the instantaneous interaction between electrons, is normally small and can be recovered with good accuracy by means of perturbative evaluations, such as [[CASPT2]] and [[NEVPT]].
