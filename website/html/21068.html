'''Lagarith''' is an [[open source]] [[lossless]] [[video codec]] written by Ben Greenwood.<ref>{{cite book | last=Biebeler | first=R | title=Video-codecs | page=60 | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hJg4Cogc0O0C&pg=PT67&dq=lagarith&lr=#v=onepage&q=lagarith&f=false }}</ref> It was designed and written with a few aims in mind:
;Speed: while not as fast as [[Huffyuv]], it still outperforms most other lossless video codecs when it comes to encoding times<ref>{{cite web | title= Lossless Video Codecs Comparison 2007 | url=http://compression.ru/video/codec_comparison/lossless_codecs_2007_en.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title= Design and Performance Evaluation of some Conditional Replenishment Schemes for Video | url=http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/resolver/1840.16/1670}}</ref>, although decoding speed may be slower.  Recent versions also support parallelizing on multi-processor systems.
;[[Color-space]] support: color-space conversions can cause rounding errors, introducing data loss, contrary to the ideal of lossless video compression.  Lagarith attempts to avoid this problem by supporting [[YV12]], [[YUY2]], [[RGB]], and [[RGBA color space|RGBA]] colorspaces.
;[[Keyframes]]: disallowing inter-prediction means that each frame can be separately decoded. This makes cutting, joining and seeking much easier.
These three things, as well as being more efficient at compression than Huffyuv, make it a codec useful for the video editing stage.
