<html> <head> <title>Digital mammography</title></head><body>'''Digital mammography''' is a specialized form of [[mammography]] that uses digital receptors and computers instead of [[x-ray]] film to help examine [[breast]] tissue for [[breast cancer]].<ref name=i2>http://www.imaginis.com/breast-health/digital-mammography-2</ref> The electrical signals can be read on computer screens, permitting more manipulation of images to theoretically allow [[radiologist]]s to more clearly view the results.<ref>http://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info.cfm?pg=mammo</ref><ref name=i2/> Digital mammography may be "spot view", for breast [[biopsy]], or "full field" (FFDM) for [[Cancer screening|screening]].<ref name=i2/>

While radiologists had hoped for more marked improvement, the effectiveness of digital mammography was found comparable to traditional x-ray methods in 2004, though there may be reduced radiation with the technique and it may lead to fewer retests.<ref name=i2/>  Specifically, it performs no better than film for post-menopausal women, who represent more than three-quarters of women with breast cancer.<ref name=Sulik />

Digital mammography is a [[NASA spin-off]], utilizing technology developed for the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].<ref>http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/363454main_medical_flyer.pdf</ref> 

==Prevalence==
As of 2007, about 8% of American screening centers used digital mammography.  

Around the globe, Fuji's system s the most widely used.

== Costs ==
In the United States, GE's digital imaging units typically cost US$300,000 to $500,000, far more than film-based imaging systems.<ref name=Sulik>{{cite book
