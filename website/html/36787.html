In [[programming]], a '''tag''' is an [[parameter (computer science)|argument]] to a [[subroutine]] that determines other arguments passed to it, which is used as a way to pass indefinite number of tagged parameters to the subroutine; notably, tags are used for a number of system calls in [[AmigaOS]] v2.0 and onwards.

==In AmigaOS==
In earlier versions of [[AmigaOS]], if a system call required setting a large number of parameters, instead of passing them as function arguments, the function would require a pointer to a [[data structure|structure]] that holds the arguments (for example, [[intuition.library]]'s <code>OpenWindow()</code> required <code>struct NewWindow</code> with 17 different parameters). Tags were introduced in AmigaOS 2.0 because:

interfering with the original parameters.  They also make specifying
parameter lists much clearer and easier.|<nowiki/>|{{cite book|title=Amiga ROM Kernal Reference Manual: Libraries|edition=3rd edition|ISBN=0-201-56774-1|url=http://cataclysm.cx/random/amiga/reference/Libraries_Manual_guide/node0496.html|pages=867}} }}

A number of [[Third-party software component|third-party]] software libraries for AmigaOS also use tags extensively.

===Example===
{|
|- align=center
!AmigaOS 1.3
!AmigaOS 2.0+
|- valign=top
|<source lang="C">
struct Window *wnd;

struct NewWindow nw = {
        10, 10,
        100, 100,
        0, 1,
        IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW,
                WFLG_SIZEGADGET | 
                WFLG_DRAGBAR |
                WFLG_DEPTHGADGET |
                WFLG_CLOSEGADGET |
                WFLG_ACTIVATE,
        NULL, NULL,
        "WikiWindow",
        NULL, NULL,
        0, 0,
        640, 400,
        WBENCHSCREEN
};

wnd = OpenWindow(&nw);
</source>
|<source lang="C">
struct Window *wnd;

wnd = OpenWindowTags(NULL,
        WA_Left, 10, WA_Top, 10,
        WA_Width, 100, WA_Height, 100,
        WA_IDCMP, IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW,
        WA_Flags,
                WFLG_SIZEGADGET |
                WFLG_DRAGBAR |
                WFLG_DEPTHGADGET |
                WFLG_CLOSEGADGET |
                WFLG_ACTIVATE,
        WA_Title, "WikiWindow",
        WA_PubScreenName, "Workbench",
        TAG_DONE );
</source>
|}

Note how the code without tags is obscure (for example, <code>0, 1</code> define window colors) while the code with tags is self-documenting. Note also that fewer parameters have to be defined with tags than are in the structure, as OpenWindowTags will fall back to default parameters.

===Implementation===
{{Expand section|date=October 2008}}

AmigaOS provides functions for tag handling in its <code>utility.library</code>.

==In general==
An advantage of tags is that they ease the work with [[default (computer science)|default arguments]] since the programmer doesn't have to specify them or their substitutes. From this follows another advantage, ease of achieving of both [[forward compatibility|forward]] and [[backward compatibility]] with external [[library (computing)|libraries]]: a program written for an older version of the library will work with a newer one, since the newer library will simply set all the parameters not provided by the program to their default values; and a program written for a newer version of the library will still work with the older version, since the older library will simply pay no attention to the newly-introduced tags.

A disadvantage of tags is that their processing is slower than simply reading data from a [[data structure|structure]] or the [[stack (data structure)|stack]]. Additionally, [[compile time]] [[type checking]] is lost.
