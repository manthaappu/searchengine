'''GNAT Programming Studio''' ('''GPS''', formerly known as the '''GNAT Programming System''') is a [[free software|free]] multi-language [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) by [[AdaCore]]. GPS uses [[compiler]]s from the [[GNU Compiler Collection]], taking its name from [[GNAT]], the GNU compiler for the [[Ada programming language]].

GPS is [[cross-platform]], running on [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]]. GPS uses [[GTK+]] as the [[widget toolkit]] for its [[graphical user interface]]. Released under the [[GNAT Modified General Public License]], GPS is [[free software]].

== Features ==

GPS supports a variety of programming languages other than Ada, including [[C (programming language)|C]], [[JavaScript]], [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]]. In addition, it supports a number of other file types for [[build system]]s such as [[Autoconf]] and [[Make (software)|Make]], along with documentation formats like [[Changelog]] and [[Texinfo]].

The most interesting new development function of GPS from version 4.0 are remote edit, remote debug and [[cross-compilation]] capabilities for platforms for which GPS/GCC are not natively available.

The new version also includes new edit functions, among which is an intelligent [[autocomplete]] feature.

GPS supports the following [[Revision control|Version control systems]]: [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]], [[Rational ClearCase]], [[Subversion (software)|Subversion]], [[Git (software)|git]].
