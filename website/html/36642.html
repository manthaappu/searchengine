'''TERA''' is a shielded [[twisted pair]] connector for use with [[Category 7 cable|Category 7]] twisted-pair data cables, developed by [[The Siemon Company]] and standardized in 2003 by [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 61076-3-104. The latest revision of the standard (published in 2006) has extended the characterized performance up to 1000 MHz.[[Image:Tera steckverbinder.JPG|thumb|TERA-Connector]]  The connector has a different footprint from the more common [[8P8C]] connector style, often colloquially referred to as "[[RJ-45]]".

TERA is also the standard interface for broadcast communications technology (BCT) in SOHO (Small Office Home Office). This connector allows for cable sharing, permitting users to integrate video, voice and data services over a single cabling link.
