'''tcptrace''' is a tool written by [[Shawn Ostermann]] at [[Ohio University]], for analysis of [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] [[dump file]]s. It can take as input the files produced by several popular [[Packet sniffer|packet-capture program]]s, including [[tcpdump]]/[[WinDump]]/[[Wireshark]], [[snoop (software)|snoop]], [http://www.wildpackets.com/products/etherpeek/ EtherPeek], and [[Agilent NetMetrix]].

tcptrace can produce several different types of output containing information on each [[Telecommunication circuit|connection]] seen, such as elapsed time, [[byte]]s and segments sent and received, retransmissions, [[Round-trip delay time|round trip times]], [[window advertisement]]s, [[throughput]], and more. It can also produce a number of [[Computer graphics|graphs]] for further analysis.  As of version five, minimal [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] processing has been implemented in addition to the TCP capabilities.
