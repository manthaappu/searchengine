[[Image:GParted.png|thumb|300px|[[GParted]] is a popular utility used for disk partitioning]]

'''Disk partitioning''' is the act of dividing a [[hard disk drive]] into multiple logical storage units referred to as ''partitions'', to treat one physical disk drive as if it were multiple disks. Partitions are also termed "[[slice (disk)|slices]]" for operating systems based on [[BSD]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] or [[GNU Hurd]]. A [[partition editor]] software program can be used to create, resize, delete, and manipulate these partitions on the hard disk.

== Benefits of multiple partitions ==
Creating more than one partition has the following advantages:

* Separation of the [[operating system]] (OS) and program files from user files. This allows [[disk image|image]] [[backup]]s (or [[disk cloning|clones]]) to be made of only the operating system and installed software.
* Having an area for operating system [[virtual memory]] [[paging|swapping/paging]].
* Keeping frequently used programs and data near each other.
* Having cache and log files separate from other files. These can change size dynamically and rapidly, potentially making a file system full.
* Use of [[multi-boot]] setups, which allow users to have more than one operating system on a single computer. For example, one could install [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Microsoft Windows]] or others on different partitions of the same hard disk and have a choice of booting into any compatible operating system at power-up.
* Protecting or isolating files, to make it easier to recover a corrupted file system or operating system installation. If one partition is corrupted, none of the other file systems are affected, and the drive's data may still be salvageable. Having a separate partition for [[read-only]] data also reduces the chances of the file system on this partition becoming corrupted.
* Raising overall computer performance on systems where smaller file systems are more efficient. For instance, large hard drives with only one [[NTFS]] file system typically have a very large [[sequential access|sequentially accessed]] [[Master File Table]] (MFT) and it generally takes more time to read this MFT than the smaller MFTs of smaller partitions.
* "Short Stroking", which aims to minimize performance-eating head repositioning delays by reducing the number of tracks used per hard drive.<ref>[http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/short-stroking-hdd,2157.html Accelerate Your Hard Drive By Short Stroking]</ref> The basic idea is that you make one partition approx. 20-25% of the total size of the drive. This partition is expected to: occupy the outer tracks of the hard drive, and offer more than double the throughput — less than half the access time. If you limit capacity with short stroking, the minimum throughput stays much closer to the maximum.
:* For example a 1 TB disk might have an access time of 12 ms at 200 [[IOPS]] (at a limited queue depth) with an average throughput of 100 MB/s. When it is partitioned to 100 GB (and the rest left unallocated) you '''''might''''' end up with an access time of 6 ms at 300 IOPS (with a bigger queue depth) with an average throughput of 200 MB/s..

== PC partition types ==
This section describes the [[Partition table (master boot record)|master boot record (MBR) partitioning scheme]], as used in [[DOS]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Linux]] on [[PC compatible]] computer systems. For examples of partitioning schemes used in other operating systems, see the general article on [[partition table|partition tables]].

The total data storage space of a PC hard disk can be divided into at most four ''primary partitions'', or alternatively three primary partitions and an ''[[#Extended partition|extended partition]]''. These partitions are described by 16-byte entries that constitute the ''Partition Table'', located in the master boot record.

The ''partition type'' is identified by a 1-byte code found in its partition table entry. Some of these codes (such as <tt>0x05</tt> and <tt>0x0F</tt>) may be used to indicate the presence of an [[extended boot record|extended partition]]. Most are used by an operating system's bootloader (that examines partition tables) to decide if a partition contains a file system that can be used to ''mount / access'' for reading or writing data.

Once a specific partition's ''type'' has been identified, additional information about its purpose and probable contents may be found (see: [[partition type|list of partition types]]). For example, some partition type ''codes'' are used to ''hide'' a partition's contents from various operating systems. However, if an OS or some partitioning tool has been programmed to also examine the boot sectors of any partition, then its file system may no longer remain hidden. (Note: There are no ''officially assigned'' partition types; thus, more than one kind of file system may ''lay claim'' to the same code value.) Additionally, partition types and boot indicators can be easily modified using applications such as [[MBRWizard]] if required.

=== Primary partition ===
A primary  partition contains one file system. In [[DOS]] and earlier versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] systems, the system partition was required to be the first partition. Windows operating systems must be located in a primary partition. Other operating systems do not have this peculiar requirement. However, other factors, such as a PC's [[BIOS]] (see [[booting#Boot sequence on standard PC (IBM-PC compatible)|Boot sequence on standard PC]]) may also impart specific requirements as to which partition must contain the primary OS.

The partition type ''code'' for a primary partition can either correspond to a file system contained within (e.g. <tt>0x07</tt> means either an [[NTFS]] or an OS/2 [[HPFS]] file system) or indicate that the partition has a special use (e.g. code <tt>0x82</tt> usually indicates a Linux ''swap'' partition). The [[File Allocation Table|FAT16 and FAT32]] file systems have made use of a number of partition type codes due to the limits of various DOS and Windows OS versions. Though a Linux operating system may recognize a number of different file systems ([[ext4]], [[ext3]], [[ext2]], [[ReiserFS]], etc.), they have all consistently used the same partition type code: <tt>0x83</tt> ([[file system#File systems under Linux|Linux native file system]]).

=== Extended partition ===
A hard disk may contain only one extended partition; the extended partition can be subdivided into multiple ''logical partitions''. In DOS/Windows systems, each logical partition may then be assigned an additional drive letter. Linux operating systems can be installed into (and run from) logical partitions, whereas Windows operating systems are restricted to primary partitions.

See [[extended boot record]] for information on the structure of an extended partition.

== Partitioning schemes ==
=== DOS, Windows, and OS/2 ===
With [[DOS]], [[Microsoft Windows]], and [[OS/2]], a common practice is to use one primary partition for the active [[file system]] that will contain the operating system, the page/swap file, all utilities, applications, and user data. On most Windows consumer computers, the [[drive letter assignment|drive letter]] C: is routinely assigned to this primary partition. Other partitions may exist on the hard disk that may or may not be visible as drives, such as recovery partitions or partitions with diagnostic tools or data. (Microsoft drive letters do not correspond to partitions in a one-to-one fashion, so there may be more or less drive letters than partitions.)

Proponents of multiple partitions assert that a benefit of having multiple partitions is the ability to store data files on a partition separate from one containing the system files. If the system partition then becomes corrupted for any reason, irreplaceable user files stored on the independent partition would be able to be more easily retrieved (or [[file recovery|recovered]]), not having been corrupted along with the system files. Another operating system (loaded from a LiveCD or USB, for example) could access the files on the (presumably) uncorrupted independent data partition without having to worry about the corrupted system partition at all.

Further, when data files are kept in a separate partition, if an operating system needs to be re-installed / restored (due to malware infiltration, for example), this can be done without risking damage to the data files (that in a single-partition system are stored along with the operating system files). 

[[Windows 2000]], [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]], and [[Windows 7]] include an inbuilt '[[Logical Disk Manager|Disk Management]]' program which allows for the creation, deletion and movement of Windows (but not other types of) partitions. The Windows 7/Vista Disk Manager is [[Logical_Disk_Manager#Compatibility_problems|not compatible]] with Windows 2000 or XP, nor, for the most part, other operating systems.

Other examples of [[List of disk partitioning software|partition management programs]] for Windows are [[Acronis#Home_products_overview|Acronis Disk Director]], [http://www.partition-tool.com/ Easeus Partition Master], [[Norton Ghost]], and [http://perfectdisk.raxco.com/ Perfect Disk]. In some instances specialized recovery programs are supplied with retail consumer computers.

=== Unix, Linux and Mac OS X===

On [[Unix]]-based and [[Unix-like]] operating systems such as [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]], it is possible to use multiple partitions on a disk device. Each partition can be used for a [[file system]] or as a [[swap partition]].

Multiple partitions also allow directories such as [[/tmp]], [[/usr]], [[/var]], or [[home directory]] space to be allocated their own file system. Such a scheme has a number of potential advantages:
*If one file system gets corrupted, the data outside that filesystem/partition stay intact, minimizing data loss.
*Specific file systems can be mounted [[read-only]], or with the execution of [[setuid]] files disabled (thus enhancing security).
*Performance may be enhanced due to less disk head travel.
*A program which produces too much output (such as a system logging daemon) fills up only a single filesystem, therefore does not fill up more critical filesystems.  (Often systems will not function correctly if / or /tmp fills up.)
However, the disadvantage of subdividing the drive into fixed-size partitions is that a file system in one partition may become full, even though other file systems still have plenty of usable space.

A good partitioning scheme requires the user to predict how much space each partition will need, which may be a difficult task; especially for new users. [[Logical volume management]] (LVM), often used in servers, increases flexibility by allowing data in volumes to expand into separate physical disks (which can be added when needed).  Another option is to resize existing partitions when necessary.  LVM allows this easily by resizing (shrinking) a filesystem, reducing the size of the logical volume containing that filesystem, allocating that freed space to another logical volume, and expanding (resizing) this other filesystem.

Typical Linux desktop systems use two partitions: one holding a file system mounted on "/" (the [[root directory]]) and a [[swap partition]]. (However, an almost unlimited number of partitions can be accommodated by Linux operating systems.)

By default, Mac OS X systems also use a single partition for the entire filesystem, but use a [[swap file]] inside the file system (like Windows) rather than a swap partition.

=== Multi-boot and mixed-boot systems ===
{{Main|Multi-boot}}
[[File:GRUB with ubuntu and windows vista.png|thumb|400px|A [[GNU GRUB|GRUB]] startup menu showing [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] Linux (with three different boot modes) and [[Windows Vista]] options]]
Multi-boot systems are computers where the user can boot into one of two or more distinct operating systems (OS) stored in separate storage devices or in separate partitions of the same storage device. In such systems a menu at [[booting|startup]] gives a choice of which OS to boot/start (and only one OS at a time is loaded).

This is distinct from [[virtual machine|virtual operating systems]], in which one operating system is run as a self-contained virtual "program" within another already-running operating system. (An example is a Linux OS "virtual machine" running from within a Windows OS).
 
Multi-boot systems are typically mixed-boot systems, with ''different'' OSes installed, although multiple copies of the ''same'' OS can be installed for safety, testing, and redundancy. A mixture of Windows, [[Mac OSX]] (facilitated by the switch to the [[x86]] processor architecture), and [[Linux distribution|Linux OS]]s (such as Ubuntu) on the same computer can therefore be accommodated.

On computers with a single hard disk multi-boot systems require multiple partitions on that hard disk. Each OS requires one or more special types of partitions whose [[file system]] may or may not be compatible with the those of other OSs on the hard disk. Tools to manipulate different types of filesystems may be specific for that type of filesystem. In general, Windows-based filesystem and partition tools have historically been used to manipulate partitions with Windows filesystems but not Linux or Mac OS X partitions. Linux-based partition managers can often (but not always) manage both Linux/Mac OS X and Windows partitions. 

A particular problem of multi-boot systems is the mutual incompatibility between the [[boot manager|bootloaders]] of different operating systems, which may compete with each other and independently overwrite important settings. 

When most computers boot up, an [[Master boot record|MBR]] is referenced by the BIOS. This record indicates the partition in which the bootloader to be initially run is located. Each operating system usually attempts to change the MBR so that it points to the partition of the particular bootloader program installed by that OS. In other words, when Windows loads, it changes the MBR to point to the Windows partition in which the Windows bootloader is stored. When Mac OS X loads, it changes the MBR to point to the Mac OS X partition in which the Mac OS X bootloader is stored. When a Linux OS is loaded, it changes the MBR to point to the Linux partition in which the Linux OS bootloader (Grub) is stored.

Although all modern OSs include bootloaders that claim to be able to load other OSs as well as the primary OS, in practice this is not guaranteed. Subtle differences in file systems and ongoing changes to the various operating systems can eventually make the bootloaders of each OS unable to recognize the file systems of the competing OSs (and therefore prevent correct bootloading). One or more OSs may then appear to be "unbootable" on that computer. To rectify this, a new bootloader must be installed and configured and the MBR reset to point to the new bootloader.

A popular way to circumvent this problem is to install a small, independent "boot" partition (must be a primary partition) in which one specific bootloader is permanently stored. The MBR is then permanently set to always refer to the partition of this primary bootloader (and is never allowed to be changed or to refer to the partition of any other bootloader). This primary bootloader (in the boot partition) loads no OS directly. It merely presents a menu of operating system choices, and when one is chosen, its only function is to chainload the particular secondary bootloader of whichever OS is selected. Each secondary bootloader resides in the partition of the OS to which it belongs, and is ''only used to load its native OS'' (not any other OS). By utilizing this scheme, incompatibilities between different bootloaders, file systems and operating systems are avoided.<ref>[http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Multiple_OS_Installation Ubuntuguide -- Multiple OS installation]</ref>

== Partition recovery ==
When a partition is deleted, in general, only its partition table entry is removed from a table; and although the data is no longer accessible, some still remains on the disk until being overwritten. [[undeletion|Specialized recovery utilities]], (such as [[TestDisk]] and [[gpart]]), can locate ''lost'' file systems and recreate a partition table which includes entries for these recovered file systems. However, some disk utilities may also overwrite a number of beginning sectors of a partition they delete. For example, if Windows Disk Management (Windows 2000/XP, etc.) is used to delete a partition, it will overwrite the first sector (relative sector 0) of the partition before removing it. It may be possible to restore a [[File Allocation Table|FAT32]] or [[NTFS]] partition if a backup boot sector is available.

== Compressed disks ==
Hard disks can be compressed to create additional space.  In DOS and early Microsoft Windows, programs such as [[Stac Electronics|Stacker]] (DR-DOS except 6), SuperStor (DR-DOS 6), [[DoubleSpace]], or [[DriveSpace]] (Windows 95) were used. This compression was done by creating a very large file on the partition, then storing the disk's data in this file. At startup, device drivers opened this file and assigned it a separate letter. Frequently, to avoid confusion, the original partition and the compressed drive had their letters swapped, so that the compressed disk is C:, and the uncompressed area (often containing system files) is given a higher name. (SuperStor required a separate device driver to be loaded, DEVSWAP.COM).

Versions of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] using the NT kernel, including the most recent versions, XP and Vista, contain intrinsic disk compression capability. The use of separate disk compression utilities has declined sharply.
