"'''The Free Lunch Is Over'''" is an article<ref name=Sutter>Sutter, H. 2005. "The free lunch is over: A fundamental turn toward concurrency in software," Dr. Dobb's Journal, 30(3), http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm.</ref> from [[Herb Sutter]] published in 2005. It stated that [[microprocessor]] serial processing speed is reaching a physical limit, which leads to two main consequences:
* processor manufactures will focus on products that better support [[Thread (computer science)|multithreading]] (such as multi-core processors), and
* software developers will be forced to develop massively [[Thread (computer science)|multithreaded]] programs as a way to better use such processors. 

Despite these facts, information systems are still being developed in a more serial fashion.  {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
