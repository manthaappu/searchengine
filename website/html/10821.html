<html> <head> <title>Distributive homomorphism</title></head><body>A [[Congruence relation|congruence]] &theta; of a [[Semilattice|join-semilattice]] ''S'' is ''monomial'', if the &theta;-[[equivalence class]] of any element of ''S'' has a largest element. We say that &theta; is ''distributive'', if it is a [[Join (mathematics)|join]], in the [[Compact element|congruence lattice]] Con ''S'' of ''S'', of monomial join-congruences of ''S''.

The following definition originates in Schmidt's 1968 work and was subsequently adjusted by Wehrung.<br /><br />

'''Definition (weakly distributive homomorphisms).''' A homomorphism 
''&mu; : S â†’ T'' between join-semilattices ''S'' and ''T'' is ''weakly distributive'', if for all ''a, b'' in ''S'' and all ''c'' in ''T'' such that ''&mu;(c)&le; a &or; b'', there are elements ''x'' and ''y'' of ''S'' such that ''c&le; x &or; y'', ''&mu;(x)&le; a'', and ''&mu;(y)&le; b''.<br /><br />

'''Examples:'''<br />

(1) For an [[Universal algebra|algebra]] ''B'' and a ''reduct'' ''A'' of ''B'' (that is, an algebra with same underlying set as ''B'' but whose set of operations is a subset of the one of ''B''), the canonical (&or;, 0)-homomorphism from Con<sub>c</sub> A to Con<sub>c</sub> B is weakly distributive. Here, Con<sub>c</sub> A denotes the (&or;, 0)-semilattice of all [[Compact element|compact congruences]] of ''A''.

(2) For a [[Lattice (order)|convex sublattice]] ''K'' of a lattice ''L'', the canonical (&or;, 0)-homomorphism from Con<sub>c</sub> ''K'' to Con<sub>c</sub> ''L'' is weakly distributive.
