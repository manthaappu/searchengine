'''Fresh''', an internet community supported project started by John Found, is an [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) for flat [[assembly language|assembler]] languages.  The primary goal of Fresh is to make programming in assembly as fast and efficient as in other visual languages, without sacrificing the small application size and the raw power of assembly language.

Because Fresh is the logical continuation of the [[FASM]] project in the area of visual programming, it is perfectly compatible with FASM.  Fresh can be used for Windows programming, but also to create programs for any OS that FASM supports - [[DOS]], [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[BeOS]], [[MenuetOS]] - the same way as is done in FASM.

Sadly, this site has not been updated in quite some time & has been taken down (August, 2008).  It now redirects to FASM's main page for the time being.
