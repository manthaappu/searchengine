<html> <head> <title>Geometric analysis</title></head><body>'''Geometric analysis''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] discipline at the interface of [[differential geometry]] and [[differential equations]]. It includes both the use of geometrical methods in the study of [[partial differential equation]]s (when it is also known as "geometric PDE"), and the application of the theory of partial differential equations to geometry. It incorporates problems involving curves and surfaces, or domains with curved boundaries, but also the study of [[Riemannian manifold]]s in arbitrary dimension.  The [[calculus of variations]] is sometimes regarded as part of geometric analysis, because differential equations arising from [[variational principle]]s have a strong geometric content.  Geometric analysis also includes [[global analysis]], which concerns the study of differential equations on manifolds, and the relationship between differential equations and [[topology]].
