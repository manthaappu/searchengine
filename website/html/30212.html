'''PDM''' ('''Programming Development Manager''') is installed on all [[AS/400]] systems, and is a part of the [[Applications Development ToolSet]]. PDM is an environment that lets programmers and/or operators navigate three levels of the PDM: 1) the library level, 2) the object level, and 3) the member level. 

To start PDM, choose option 5 from the Main menu (Program menu). Next, choose option 2 to get to the PDM menu. 
To go directly to the PDM menu, you can also type in the following command into a command line: STRPDM (stands for Start PDM). 
Other "work with" commands for the designated levels of PDM are as follows: WRKOBJPDM (Object level).
