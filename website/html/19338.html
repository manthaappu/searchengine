The ultimate goal of the RoboCup project is by 2050, develop a team of fully autonomous [[humanoid]] [[robot]]s that can win against the human world champion team in soccer. In order for a robot team to actually perform a soccer game, various technologies must be incorporated including: design principles of autonomous agents, multi-agent collaboration, [[strategy acquisition]], [[real-time reasoning]], robotics, and [[sensor-fusion]]. RoboCup is a task for a team of multiple fast-moving robots under a dynamic environment. RoboCup also offers a [[software platform]] for research on the [[software]] aspects of RoboCup. One of the major applications of RoboCup technologies is a [[search and rescue]] in large scale disaster. RoboCup initiated RoboCupRescue project to specifically promote research in socially significant issues.
