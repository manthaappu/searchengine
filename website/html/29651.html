A '''portable computer''' is a [[computer]] that is designed to be moved from one place to another and includes a display and keyboard. Portable computers, by their nature, are [[microcomputer]]s. Portable computers, because of their size, are also commonly known as 'Lunchbox' or 'Luggable' computers. They can also be called a 'Portable Workstation' or 'Portable PC'.

The principal advantage of a portable computer versus a '''[[laptop]]''' or other '''[[mobile computing|mobile computer]]''' is the use of standard [[Motherboard|motherboards]] or [[backplane]]s providing plug-in slots for add-in cards. This allows mission specific cards such as test, A/D, or communication protocol (IEEE-488, 1553) to be installed. Portable computers also provide for more disk storage by using standard 3-1/2" drives and providing for multiple drives.

==History==

[[Xerox NoteTaker]], developed in 1976 at [[Xerox PARC]], was the precursor to portable computers, though it remained a prototype and did not enter production. 

The first portable computer was manufactured in 1979 by GM Research<ref>[http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/accession/X1243.96 Computer History Museum]</ref>, a small company in Santa Monica, California.  The machine which was designed and patented ([http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=4&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=%22portable+computer+enclosure%22.TI.&OS=TTL/%22portable+computer+enclosure%22&RS=TTL/%22portable+computer+enclosure%22 US Patent No. 4,294,496]) by James Murez.  It was called the Micro Star and later changed the name to The Small One.  Although Xerox claims to have designed the first such system, the machine by Murez predated anything on the market or that had been documented in any publication at the time - hence the patent was issued.  As early as 1979 the U.S. Government was contracting to purchase these machines.  Other major customers included Sandia Labs, General Dynamics, BBN (featured on the cover of their annual report in 1980 as the C.A.T. system) and several dozen private individuals and companies around the world. In 1979, Osborn viewed the machine along with several hundred other visitors at the first computer show that was sponsored by the IEEE Westec in Los Angeles.  Later that year the machine was also shown at the first Comdex show.

The first mass-produced portable computer was the [[Osborne 1]], developed by [[Adam Osborne]], which owed much to the NoteTaker's design. Another early portable computer released in 1982 was the [[Kaypro]]. In January 1983, the first [[IBM PC compatible]] portable computer (and indeed the first 100% IBM PC compatible, or "clone," of any kind) was the [[Compaq Portable]]. The first full-color portable computer was the [[Commodore SX-64]] in January 1984. [[Apple, Inc.]] introduced a portable [[Apple IIc]] in April 1984, but would not release a [[Macintosh Portable]] until 1989, though the [[Compact Macintosh|original Macintosh]] was by its compact design, technically a portable.

The term ''portable computer'' is now almost exclusively used to refer to portable computers that are larger than a [[laptop]], often use conventional parts such as an ATX motherboard and PS/2 style power supply and usually do not run on [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]]. Smaller portable computers are also known as '''[[mobile computing|mobile computers]]'''. They are referred to by their more specific terms:

* The [[laptop]] (or notebook) with a [[flat panel display]] and [[computer keyboard|keyboard]], requiring a seated position and both hands. A relatively recently introduced modification has been the [[Tablet PC]], which essentially is a laptop operated with a stylus on a touch-sensitive screen.  See also [[desktop replacement computer]], a large laptop designed to perform all of the functions of a [[desktop computer]].
* The [[sub-notebook]] which is something between a laptop and a [[personal digital assistant|PDA]]. They have a full keyboard (though often in reduced size), 11-13" screens and usually no internal optical drive. 
* The [[pocket computer]], which was mostly a phenomenon of the 1980s, and combined the features of an [[alphanumeric]] [[calculator]], a small [[home computer]] (usually programmable in [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]]), and a PDA. Manufacturers of these included [[RadioShack|Tandy/Radio Shack]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Casio]], and [[Sharp Corporation]].
* The [[personal digital assistant]] (PDA), usually held in one hand and operated with the other.
* The [[wearable computer]] with [[handsfree]] [[User interface|interface]], and usually some  voice capability ([[speech recognition]] and [[speech synthesis]]).

Portable computers have been increasing in popularity over the past decade, as they do not restrict the user in terms of mobility as a [[desktop computer]] would. Wireless [[Internet]], extended [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] life and more comfortable [[ergonomics]] have been factors driving this increase in popularity. [[All-in-One PC]]s such as the [[iMac]] can also be considered portable computers and often have handles built-in to the case.
