'''Critical Internet infrastructure''' is a collective term for all hardware and software systems that constitute essential components in the operation of the [[Internet]].

Physical transmission lines of all types, such as wired, [[Fiber Optics|fiber optic]] and [[Microwaves|microwave]] links, along with [[Router|routing equipment]], the accompanying critical software services like the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS), [[Email]], website hosting, authentication and authorization, storage systems, and [[database]] servers are considered critical Internet components<ref>[http://www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-06-672], GAO Report on DHS Internet Infrastructure Challenges</ref><ref>[http://tools.ietf.org/wg/dnsext/], IETF Working group calls DNS critical Internet infrastructure</ref>. If any of these systems and services were to be interrupted for a significant period of time "[t]he Internet...as we know it would collapse".<ref>[http://www.stevegibbard.com/], Steve Gibbard is an expert on critical Internet infrastructure</ref>
