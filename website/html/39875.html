'''Wayne P. Stevens''' (1944 - 1993) was an American [[software engineer]], consultant, author, pioneer, and advocate of the practical application of [[software development methodology|software methods]] and tools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reengineer.org/stevens/Stevens_2004_Bodart.htm#stevens|title=François Bodart to Receive the 2004 Stevens Award|accessdate=2010-09-29}}</ref>  

== Life & Work ==
Stevens grew up in [[Missouri]], spent two years in India, where he attended the [[Woodstock School]], and earned his [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in [[Electrical Engineering]] from [[MIT]] in 1967. He eventually became the chief architect of application development methodology for [[IBM]]'s consulting group. The annual [[Stevens Award]] Lecture on Software Development Methods is named after him.  

He belonged to the [[IEEE]] and the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] as well as the following honorary societies:  [[Tau Beta Pi]], [[Sigma Xi]], and [[Eta Kappa Nu]].

He wrote a seminal paper on [[Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method|Structured Design]], with [[Larry Constantine]] and Glenford Myers, and was the author of a number of books and articles on application design methodologies. He also worked with [[John Paul Morrison]] to refine and promote the concepts of what is now called [[Flow-based programming]], including descriptions of FBP in several of these references. 

== Publications ==
Stevens published several articles and books, including:
* 1982. ''How Data Flow can Improve Application Development Productivity,'' IBM System Journal, Vol. 21, No. 2.
* 1981. ''Using Structured Design: How to make Programs Simple, Changeable, Flexible and Reusable'', John Wiley and Sons.
