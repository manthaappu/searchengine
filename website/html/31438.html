<html> <head> <title>Real computation</title></head><body>In [[computability theory]], the theory of '''real computation''' deals with hypothetical computing machines using infinite-precision [[real number]]s. They are given this name because they operate on the set of [[real number]]s. Within this theory, it is possible to prove interesting statements such as "the complement of the [[Mandelbrot set]] is only partially decidable". 

These hypothetical computing machines can be viewed as idealised [[analog computer]]s which operate on real numbers and are [[differential (mathematics)|differential]], whereas [[digital computer]]s are limited to [[computable]] numbers and are [[algebraic]]. Depending on the model chosen, this may enable real computers to solve problems that are inextricable on digital computers (for example, [[Hava Siegelmann]]'s [[neural nets]] can have noncomputable real weights, making them able to compute nonrecursive languages), or vice versa ([[Claude Shannon]]'s idealized analog computer can only solve algebraic differential equations, while a digital computer can solve some transcendental equations as well. However this comparison is not entirely fair since in [[Claude Shannon]]'s idealized analog computer computations are immediately done, i.e. computation is done in real time. Shannon's model can be adapted to cope with this problem).<ref>{{cite journal |author=O. Bournez, M. L. Campagnolo, D. S. Graça, and E.

A canonical model of computation over the reals is [[Blum–Shub–Smale machine]] (BSS).

Using real computation one can solve [[NP-complete]] problems, and even [[Sharp P|#P]]-complete problems in [[polynomial time]], answering affirmatively the [[P = NP problem]]. Unlimited precision real numbers in the physical universe are prohibited by the [[holographic principle]] and the [[Bekenstein bound]].<ref>[[Scott Aaronson]], ''[http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502072 NP-complete Problems and Physical Reality]'', ACM [[SIGACT]] News, Vol. 36, No. 1.
