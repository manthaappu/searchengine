<html> <head> <title>Grotrian diagram</title></head><body>A '''Grotrian diagram''' or '''term diagram''' shows the allowed transitions between the energy levels of atoms.  They can be used for one electron and multi electron atoms.  They take into account the specific [[selection rules]] related to changes in angular momentum of the electron.

An example is given [http://spider.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/rosalie/H.jpg here] for the [[hydrogen atom]].

The diagrams are named after [[Walter Grotrian]].
