<html> <head> <title>Digital Signature Algorithm</title></head><body>The '''Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)'''  is a [[Federal government of the United States|United States Federal Government]] [[Federal Information Processing Standard|standard]] or [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS]] for [[digital signature]]s. It was proposed by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) in August 1991 for use in their '''Digital Signature Standard (DSS)''', specified in [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS]] 186,<ref>[http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip186.htm FIPS-186], the first version of the official DSA specification.</ref> adopted in 1993. A minor revision was issued in 1996 as FIPS 186-1.<ref>[http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/fips1861.pdf FIPS-186-1], the first revision to the official DSA specification.</ref> The standard was expanded further in 2000 as FIPS 186-2 and again in 2009 as FIPS 186-3.<ref name=FIPS186-3>[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips186-3/fips_186-3.pdf FIPS-186-3], the third and current revision to the official DSA specification.</ref>

==Key generation==
Key generation has two phases. The first phase is a choice of ''algorithm parameters'' which may be shared between different users of the system:
* Choose an approved [[cryptographic hash function]] ''H''. In the original DSS, ''H'' was always SHA-1, but the stronger SHA-2 hash functions are approved for use in the current DSS. The hash output may be truncated to the size of a key pair.
* Decide on a key length ''L'' and ''N''. This is the primary measure of the [[cryptographic strength]] of the key.  The original DSS constrained ''L'' to be a multiple of 64 between 512 and 1024 (inclusive). NIST 800-57<ref>[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-57/SP800-57-Part1.pdf NIST 800-57]</ref> recommends lengths of 2048 (or 3072) for keys with security lifetimes extending beyond 2010 (or 2030), using correspondingly longer ''N''.<ref name=FIPS186-3/> specifies ''L'' and ''N'' length pairs of (1024,160), (2048,224), (2048,256), and (3072,256).
* Choose an ''N''-bit prime ''q''. ''N'' must be less than or equal to the hash output length.
* Choose an ''L''-bit prime modulus ''p'' such that ''p''–1 is a multiple of ''q''.
* Choose ''g'', a number whose multiplicative order modulo ''p'' is ''q''. This may be done by setting ''g'' = ''h''<sup>(''p''–1)/''q''</sup> mod ''p'' for some arbitrary ''h'' (1 < h < p-1), and trying again with a different ''h'' if the result comes out as 1. Most choices of ''h'' will lead to a usable ''g''; commonly ''h''=2 is used.
The algorithm parameters (''p'', ''q'', ''g'') may be shared between different users of the system.
The second phase computes private and public keys for a single user:
* Choose ''x'' by some random method, where 0 < ''x'' < ''q''.
* Calculate ''y'' = ''g<sup>x</sup>'' mod ''p''.
* Public key is (''p'', ''q'', ''g'', ''y''). Private key is ''x''.

There exist efficient algorithms for computing the [[modular exponentiation]]s  ''h<sup>a</sup>'' mod ''p'' and ''g<sup>x</sup>'' mod ''p'', such as [[exponentiation by squaring]].

==Signing==

Let ''H'' be the hashing function and ''m'' the message:
* Generate a random per-message value ''k'' where 0 < ''k'' < ''q''
* Calculate ''r'' = (''g''<sup>''k''</sup> mod ''p'') mod ''q''
* Calculate ''s'' = (''k''<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''H''(''m'') + ''x''*''r'')) mod ''q''
* Recalculate the signature in the unlikely case that ''r'' = 0 or ''s'' = 0
* The signature is (''r'', ''s'')

The [[extended Euclidean algorithm]] can be used to compute the modular inverse ''k''<sup>&minus;1</sup> mod ''q''.

==Verifying==
* Reject the signature if either 0 < ''r'' <q or 0 < ''s'' < ''q'' is not satisfied.
* Calculate ''w'' = (''s'')<sup>&minus;1</sup> mod ''q''
* Calculate ''u''1 = (''H''(''m'')*''w'') mod ''q''
* Calculate ''u''2 = (''r''*''w'') mod ''q''
* Calculate ''v'' = ((''g''<sup>''u''1</sup>*''y''<sup>''u''2</sup>) mod ''p'') mod ''q''
* The signature is valid if ''v'' = ''r''

DSA is similar to the [[ElGamal signature scheme]].

==Correctness of the algorithm==
The signature scheme is correct in the sense that the verifier will always accept genuine signatures. This can be shown as follows:

First, if ''g'' = ''h<sup>(''p'' &minus; 1)/''q''</sup>'' mod ''p'' it follows that
''g<sup>q</sup>'' ≡ ''h''<sup>''p'' &minus; 1</sup> ≡ 1 (mod ''p'') by
[[Fermat's little theorem]]. Since ''g'' > 1 and ''q'' is prime, ''g'' must have order ''q''.

The signer computes

:<math>s=k^{-1}(H(m)+xr) \mod{q}. \, </math>

Thus 

:<math>
\begin{align}
k & \equiv H(m)s^{-1}+xrs^{-1}\\
  & \equiv H(m)w + xrw \pmod{q}.
\end{align}
</math>  

Since ''g'' has order ''q'' (mod p) we have

:<math>
\begin{align}
g^k & \equiv g^{H(m)w}g^{xrw}\\
    & \equiv g^{H(m)w}y^{rw}\\
    & \equiv g^{u1}y^{u2} \pmod{p}.
\end{align}
</math>

Finally, the correctness of DSA follows from

:<math>r=(g^k \mod p) \mod q = (g^{u1}y^{u2} \mod p) \mod q = v.\,</math>

==Sensitivity==
With DSA, the entropy, secrecy and uniqueness of the random signature value k is critical.  It is so critical that violating any one of those three requirements can reveal your entire private key to an attacker.<ref>[http://rdist.root.org/2009/05/17/the-debian-pgp-disaster-that-almost-was/ The Debian PGP disaster that almost was.]</ref>  Using the same value twice (even while keeping k secret), using a predictable value, or leaking even a few bits of k in each of several signatures, is enough to break DSA.<ref>[http://rdist.root.org/2010/11/19/dsa-requirements-for-random-k-value/ DSA k-value Requirements]</ref>
