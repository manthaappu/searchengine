'''Kurso de Esperanto''' is a free language course software with 12 units for the [[constructed language]] [[Esperanto]]. The course is especially dedicated to beginners who will know the basics of Esperanto within two weeks, due to optimized learning exercises.

The software uses listening tests of all used words to train pronunciation and listening comprehension.  The user can record their attempts at speaking [[Esperanto]] with a [[microphone]] and compare them with the examples.  Sound samples include songs available for singing along with, by the Brazilian pop music band Merlin among others.

At the end of each unit, and for certification of the whole Esperanto course the user can pass an examination and utilize a special feature of this course: the tests can be given to course leaders to be corrected free of charge.  This correction service is provided by volunteers of the [[Esperanto movement]] including the German Esperanto youth organization.
 
''Kurso de Esperanto'' is based on a 10 hour course developed by the Quebec Esperanto Society and some other courses.

The language course works with both [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] systems and the numerous [[Linux]] [[Linux distribution|distributions]]. At the moment <small>(February 2006)</small> there is version '''3.0''' for Linux and version '''3.2''' for Windows.

''Kurso de Esperanto'' is already in more than 23 languages. There are many volunteers working to increase this number. The translation process of the Esperanto course is simplified by a program called ''tradukilo'' that is also available for free download.
