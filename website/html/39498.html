'''Virtual USA''' (vUSA), is a joint [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] and [[U.S. state|state]] collaboration on a project that would allow state and local on-line tools and technologies, such as caches of [[geospatial]] data, to be interoperable and more useful with the goal of creating a "Virtual USA" for [[Emergency service|emergency response]] purposes<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fcw.com/Articles/2009/02/24/Virtual-USA.aspx|title=Officials eye a geospatial 'Virtual USA'|last=Bain|first=Ben|date=February 25, 2009|work=Federal Computer Week|accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref>. The initiative was developed by the [[DHS Directorate for Science and Technology]] (S&T), and  currently operates as a pilot in eight states — [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Florida]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Texas]], [[Virginia]] and [[Tennessee]] — with plans to incorporate additional states<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhs.gov/ynews/releases/pr_1260375414161.shtm|title=Homeland Security Information Network|work=Department of Homeland Security (official site)|accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref>.

Virtual USA is part of the DHS' Open Government plan, which is part of the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration's]] goal to promote a greater amount of [[Transparency (behavior)#Politics|transparency]] and openness between the government and citizens<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.securityinfowatch.com/dhs-announces-open-government-plan|title=DHS announces 'Open Government' plan|date=April 8, 2010|work=SecurityInfoWatch.com|accessdate=19 April 2010}}</ref>.

==Purpose and overview==
The stated goal of Virtual USA is to aggregate existing data, from federal, state, local, tribal, and other information into a common operating picture to assist first responders during emergencies.

Virtual USA:
*Virtual USA utilizes current [[Information sharing|information-sharing]] platforms to permit new and existing technologies to exchange information with one another.
*Virtual USA is based on the needs of local and state [[first responders]] to manage data access within their own jurisdictions and to share information with relevant jurisdictions across the United States.
*Virtual USA is not limited to information exchanges between two agencies; instead, the initiative fosters information sharing among all federal, state, [[Local government in the United States|local]] and [[Federally recognized tribes|tribal]] authorities.
*Virtual USA uses open data standards and [[open-source software]], more states and localities are able to join this information exchange project.
*Virtual USA allows Americans in their own communities to contribute information—in real-time to support the efforts of [[police]], [[Fire department|fire]] and [[emergency management]] officials during [[disaster]]s and recovery efforts<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhs.gov/ynews/releases/pr_1260375414161.shtm|title=Homeland Security Information Network|work=Department of Homeland Security (official site)|accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref>.

==Statistics==
*In the state of Virginia, Virtual USA has reduced response times to incidents involving [[Dangerous goods|hazardous materials]] by 70 percent.
