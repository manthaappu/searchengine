'''''OXO''''' was a  [[computer game]] written for the [[EDSAC]] computer in 1952, an implementation of the game known as '''''Noughts and Crosses''''' in the UK, or [[tic-tac-toe]] in the United States. It was written by [[A.S. Douglas|Alexander S. Douglas]] as an illustration for his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] thesis on human-computer interaction for the [[University of Cambridge]]. ''OXO'' was the first digital graphical game to run on a computer.<ref>http://www.pong-story.com/1952.htm</ref>

The simulation was played using a rotary telephone controller. OXO is often listed as the first computer game.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

In '''''OXO''''' the player played against the computer, and output was displayed on the computer's 35×16 [[pixel]] [[cathode ray tube]]. The [[source code]] was short, yet it played a perfect game of noughts and crosses. ''OXO'' did not have widespread popularity because the EDSAC was a computer unique to [[Cambridge]].
