A '''High Assurance Guard''' (HAG) is a [[Multilevel security]] computer device which is used to communicate between different [[Security Domains]], such as [[NIPRNet]] to [[SIPRNet]]. A HAG is one example of a [[Controlled Interface]] between security levels. HAGs are approved through the [[Common Criteria]] process. 

==Operation==
A HAG runs multiple [[virtual machines]] - one subsystem for the lower classification, one subsystem for the higher classification. The hardware runs a type of [[Knowledge Management]] software that examines data coming out of the higher classification subsystem and rejects any data that is classified higher than the lower classification. In general, a HAG allows lower classified data that resides on a higher classified system to be moved to another lower classified system. For example, in the US, it would allow unclassified information residing on a classified secret system to be moved to another unclassified system. Through various rules and filters, the HAG ensures that data is of the lower classification and then allows the transfer.

==Importance, risks==
The HAG is mostly used in email and [[Defense Message System|DMS]] environments as certain organizations may only have unclassified network access, and they need to send a message to an organization that has only secret network access. The HAG provides them this ability.
