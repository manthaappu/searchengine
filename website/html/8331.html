'''cpuinfo falsification''' is a [[Lowest common denominator (computers)|lowest common denominator]] technique that can be used on [[GNU]] operating systems to provide backwards compatible behaviour of the compiler and software tools. This technique is typically used on [[IBM compatible]] computers using [[80x86]] series processors, but can be used on other architectures, where applicable.

== Background ==

On [[GNU]] based [[operating system]]s, some software tools, such as the [[compiler]] and package building tools, detect [[CPU]] specific extensions that are incompatible with existing machines. This may cause incompatibility issues during compilation or operation of [[software]] on computers being utilized as [[backward compatible]] replacements.

=== The cpuinfo falsification project ===

The '''cpuinfo falsification project''' provides an assortment of patches to the [[GNU operating system]] to provide [[i386]] compatible behaviour of the compiler and software tools without the need for explicit [[cross compilation]].

==== setarch ====

The Unix [[setarch]] command provides the facility to generate falsified generic architecture information for system building. However, this does not currently work on [[GNU]] based [[operating system]]s:

 # The setarch utility does not work at this time
 setarch i386
 uname -m
 i686       <--- It's not working.

==== uname_hack ====

The '''uname_hack''' kernel module causes generic architecture information to be provided by the kernel.

==== uname ====

The [[uname]] utility is fixed by loading the [[uname hack]] module. This provides falsified processor information for "[[Lowest common denominator (computers)|lowest common denominator]]" compatibility. 

 uname -m
 i686     <--- This is no good
 insmod uname_hack.ko
 uname -m
 i386     <--- This will work just fine on a Pentium

=== /proc/cpuinfo ===

The /proc/cpuinfo file is patched by using a [[bindmount]] to overlay a file containing falsified [[CPU]] related information:

 if [ -e /etc/cpuinfo] ; then
   mountâ€”bind /etc/cpuinfo /proc/cpuinfo
 fi
