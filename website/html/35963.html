<html> <head> <title>Structure from motion</title></head><body>In [[computer vision]] and the study of [[visual perception]], '''structure from motion''' refers to the process of finding the three-dimensional structure of an object by analyzing local [[motion perception|motion signals]] over time.

==Obtaining 3D information from 2D images==
Humans perceive a lot of information about the three-dimensional structure in their environment by moving through it.  When the observer moves and the objects around him move, information is obtained from images sensed over time.<ref>{{cite book | title = Computer Vision | author = Linda G. Shapiro, George C.

Finding structure from motion presents a similar problem as finding structure from [[stereo vision]].  In both instances, the correspondence between images and the reconstruction of 3D object needs to be found.

To find correspondence between images, features such as corner points (edges with gradients in multiple directions) need to be tracked from one image to the next.  The feature trajectories over time are then used to reconstruct their 3D positions and the cameras motion.<ref>{{Cite journal | journal = IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition  | title = Structure from Motion without Correspondence | author = F. Dellaert, S. Seitz, C. Thorpe, and S. Thrun | year = 2000 | url = http://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/pub2/dellaert_frank_2000_1/dellaert_frank_2000_1.pdf }}</ref>

Structure from motion is related to the [[kinetic depth effect]] in perception whereby subjects viewing the shadow cast by a wire frame or other structure in rotation, perceive the full three-dimensional structure of the object, whereas when viewing the shadow of a static object they perceive only its two-dimensional projection.
