<html> <head> <title>PicoChip</title></head><body>'''Picochip''' is a venture-backed [[fabless semiconductor company]] based in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath, England]], founded in 2000.

The company is active in two areas, with two distinct product families.

==Multi-core DSP==

Picochip has developed a [[multi-core]] [[digital signal processor]], the picoArray. This integrates 250-300 individual DSP cores onto a single die (depending on the specific product). Each of these cores is a 16-bit processor with [[Harvard architecture]], local memory and 3-way [[Very long instruction word|VLIW]].

The company has four products currently available (PC102 and PC202 / 203 / 205) which deliver approximately 40 [[Multiply-accumulate|GMACS]] and 200 [[Instructions per second|GIPS]] of performance.

The programming model allows each processor to be coded independently (in [[ANSI C]] or [[Assembly language|assembler]]) and then to communicate over an any:any interconnect mesh. The communication flows are fixed at compile time, not dynamically at run time (analogous to [[Place and route|place & route]] of an [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] but at higher level of abstraction). This can be described as [[communicating sequential processes]]. Each process maps to a processor, which is fully independent from other processors with "encapsulation", with interaction only through defined [[message passing]] and data flows through the mesh. This architecture is also related to [[object-oriented programming]] concepts. Notably, the development environment is deterministic: simulation of code is cycle-accurate to hardware execution. Advantages claimed include ease of development, improved reliability of code and software-reuse.

Although the picoArray architecture is generic and could in principle be used for any DSP application, the company has stated its strategy is to focus on wireless infrastructure. In particular, the processor is widely used for baseband processing in [[WiMAX]] base stations and for [[femtocell]]s.

Independent benchmarks of representative communications systems by [http://www.bdti.com Berkeley Design (BDTI)] indicate that the picoArray delivers significantly better performance-per-dollar than traditional single-core DSP devices.

==Femtocells==

Picochip was one of the first companies to be active in [[femtocells]], and demonstrated a prototype at [[MWC]]2005. The company has since developed a range of system-on-chip (SoC) products named "picoXcell".

The company was a founder member of the [http://www.femtoforum.org Femto Forum], and is on the executive board of that organisation.

==Corporate==

Investors include [[Atlas Venture]], [[AT&T]], [[Highland Capital Partners]], [[Intel Capital]], [[Pond Venture Partners]], [[N M Rothschild & Sons|Rothschild]], [[Samsung]] and [[Scottish Equity Partners]]. There are also undisclosed strategic investors.

As of November 2009 the company had raised a total of $90M in venture funding.
