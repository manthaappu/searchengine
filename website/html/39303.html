==History==
The recording technology behind the Verba Recording System comes from the academic world.

The technology was first sold as a product in 2002 by TC&C Ltd under the brand name Carin IP Call Recording. In 2006 TC&C Ltd have opened offices in [[Stockholm]], Sweden and [[Hackensack, New Jersey]]. <ref>{{Citation |title=TC&C Opens Nordic Office|url=http://www.tcandc.com/press/TC%26C_Nordic_Opens_Press_Release.pdf}}</ref>

North American distribution was started by Interwork Technologies in June 2010. <ref>{{Citation |title=Interwork Technologies Signs Exclusive Agreement with Verba Technologies to Distribute State-of-the-art Call Recording Solution for UC Platforms|url=http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Interwork-Technologies-Signs-bw-526466712.html?x=0 |accessdate=2010-08-17}}</ref>
