<html> <head> <title>Fallacies of Distributed Computing</title></head><body>[[L._Peter_Deutsch|Peter Deutsch]] asserted that [[programmer]]s new to [[Distributed computing|distributed]] [[Application software|applications]] invariably make a set of assumptions known as the '''Fallacies of Distributed Computing''' and that all of these assumptions ultimately prove false, resulting either in the failure of the system, a substantial reduction in system scope, or in large unplanned expenses required to redesign the system to meet its original goals. 

==The fallacies==
The [[fallacies]] are summarized as follows:<ref name="Fallacies">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.sun.com/jag/resource/Fallacies.html |title=The Eight Fallacies of Distributed Computing}}</ref>

# The [[Computer network|network]] is reliable.
# [[Latency (engineering)|Latency]] is zero.
# [[Throughput|Bandwidth]] is infinite.
# The network is [[Computer security|secure]].
# [[Network topology|Topology]] doesn't change.
# There is one [[Network administrator|administrator]].
# Transport cost is zero.
# The network is homogeneous.


==History==
The list of fallacies generally came about at [[Sun Microsystems]]. [[L. Peter Deutsch|Peter Deutsch]], one of the original Sun "[[Fellow]]s," is credited with penning the first seven fallacies in 1994; however, [[Bill Joy]] and Tom Lyon had already identified the first four as "The Fallacies of Networked Computing"<ref name="NetworkFallacies">{{cite web |url=http://java.sys-con.com/read/38665.htm |title=Deutsch's Fallacies, 10 Years After}}</ref> (the article claims "Dave Lyon", but this is considered a mistake). Around 1997, [[James Gosling]], another Sun Fellow and the inventor of [[Java (programming language)|Java]], added the eighth fallacy.<ref name="NetworkFallacies"/>
