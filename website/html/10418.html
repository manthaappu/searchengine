<html> <head> <title>Digital delay line</title></head><body>A '''digital delay line''' is a discrete element in [[digital filter]] theory, which allows a signal to be delayed by a number of samples. If the delay is an integer multiple of samples digital delay lines are often implemented as [[circular buffer]]s. This means that integer delays can be computed very efficiently.

The delay by one sample is notated <math>\mathrm{z}^{-1}</math> and delays of <math>N</math> samples is notated as <math>\mathrm{z}^{-N}</math> motivated by the role the [[z-transform]] plays in describing [[digital filter]] structures.

If a delay is not an integer of a sample additional filters are applied to account for the fraction of delay different from an integer. Hence delay lines with non-integer delay are called ''fractional delay lines''.<ref>{{Citation
