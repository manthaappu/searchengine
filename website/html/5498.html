<html> <head> <title>Cardinality (data modeling)</title></head><body>In [[data modeling]], the '''cardinality''' of one data table with respect to another data table is a critical aspect of [[database]] design. Relationships between data tables define cardinality when explaining how each table links to another. 

In the relational model, tables can be related as any of: '''many-to-many''', '''many-to-one''' (rev. '''one-to-many'''), or '''one-to-one'''. This is said to be the '''cardinality''' of a given table in relation to another.

For example, considering a database designed to keep track of hospital records. Such a database could have many tables like:
* a ''Doctor'' table full of doctor information
* a ''Patient'' table with patient information
* and a ''Department'' table with an entry for each department of the hospital.

In that model:
* There is a '''many-to-many''' relationship between the records in the doctor table and records in the patient table (Doctors have many patients, and a patient could have several doctors);
* a '''one-to-many''' relation between the department table and the doctor table (each doctor works for one department, but one department could have many doctors).

'''one-to-one''' relationship is mostly used to split a table in two in order to optimize access or limit the visibility of some information. In the hospital example, such a relationship could be used to keep apart doctor's personal or administrative information.

A [[Entity-relationship_diagram#Crow.27s_Foot|crow's foot]] shows a '''one-to-many''' relationship, single line is a one-to-one relationship.

== UML Modeling ==
'''UML class diagram''' may be used for data modeling. In that case, relationship are modeled using UML associations, and multiplicity is used on those associations to denote '''cardinality'''. Here are some examples:
{|  class="wikitable"
|| left || right ||  || example
|-
|| '''1''' || '''1''' || one-to-one || person <-> weight 
|-
|| '''0..1''' || '''1''' || ''optional on one side'' one-to-one || date of death <-> person
|-
|| '''0..*''' or '''*''' || '''0..*''' or '''*''' || ''optional on both sides'' many-to-many || person <-> book
|-
|| '''1''' || '''1..*''' || one-to-many || person <-> language
|}
