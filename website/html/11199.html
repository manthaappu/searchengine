'''''Dust-Off''''' is a brand of [[gas duster|dust cleaner]] (refrigerant-based propellant cleaner, which is not [[compressed air]] and incorrectly called "canned air") containing [[1,1-Difluoroethane|difluoroethane]]; it is used to remove particulates and dust from computers and electronic equipment.  Dust-Off products are used to remove dust, debris, fingerprints, and smudges from hard to reach areas of keyboards, screens, and other components of electronic equipment. The Dust-Off brand also encompasses a line of electronics and home office cleaning supplies, including LCD/Plasma screen sprays, microfiber cleaning cloths, and the Dust-Off Screen Shammy. Dust-Off is manufactured by [[Falcon Safety Products]].
The compressed gas duster product has also gained attention as it has been abused as an [[inhalant]] by teenagers, as seen in the movie ''[[Thirteen (film)|Thirteen]]''. A warning email has been circulated by Jeff Williams, a police officer in [[Cleveland]], whose son, Kyle, died after inhaling Dust-Off in [[Painesville]] Township, [[Ohio]]. <ref>{{cite web

Falcon has now added a [[bitterant]] to the product to deter inhalation. Though a bitterant has been added, many people still inhale the product to get a quick high.
