<html> <head> <title>MacroML</title></head><body>'''MacroML''' is an experimental [[programming language]] based on the [[ML programming language|ML]] programming language family that seeks to reconcile ML's [[static typing]] systems, and the types of [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] systems more commonly found in [[dynamically typed]] languages like [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]; this reconciliation is difficult as macro transformations are typically [[Turing-complete]] and so can break the [[type safety]] guarantees static typing is supposed to provide.
