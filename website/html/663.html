'''Aaron Doral''' ('''Number Five''') is a [[fictional character]] from the reimagined ''[[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' series.

Doral is a humanoid [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylon]] (designated model Number Five)<ref>[[Downloaded (Battlestar Galactica)]]</ref> who first appeared as a civilian public relations specialist aboard ''Galactica'' just prior to the Cylon attack on the Colonies. Through conversation with the Cylon agent [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Six]], [[Gaius Baltar|Dr. Gaius Baltar]] claims Doral is a Cylon spy and has him thrown in the brig. Gaius does so to protect himself and justify the finding of a Cylon device he has noticed, Doral actually being a spy is mere coincidence. Doral emphatically denies being a Cylon. However, not willing to take a chance, Doral is abandoned by [[William Adama|Commander Adama]] on the Ragnar Anchorage weapons depot. At the time of abandonment, Doral exclaims his innocence, and claims to be from Oasis, outside Caprica City, and having been on Kobol College on Gemenon. The audience is shown that Baltar was correct in assuming Doral a Cylon, four copies of Doral, along with Number Six, [[Leoben Conoy]], and [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Sharon]] come to his rescue. (In the novelization, Doral is a [[sleeper agent]] - he does not know he is a Cylon until the others come for him at Ragnar Anchorage.)

Doral appears again on Cylon-occupied [[List of Battlestar Galactica (reimagining) locations#Caprica|Caprica]] curiously monitoring the situation developing between Sharon and [[Karl Agathon|Karl "Helo" Agathon]]. He initially decides that Sharon cannot be trusted, and orders Number Six to deal with her. Once Doral discovers that Sharon is pregnant, he states the child is a miracle, and must be protected at all costs. The discovery also leads to his suggesting a major tactical change, although the details of this new plan, as well as whatever changes were made from the original, have as yet to be clearly defined in the series.

The Doral Cylons seem to act more covertly, having an unassuming "average" appearance in order to better blend in with more trivial background matters instead of taking more noticeable positions of authority and purpose. He seems to have a position of authority among the Cylons, acting as overseer, and having a hand behind their decision making and tactical planning. This personalization is contradicted, however, in the special TV movie "[[Battlestar Galactica: The Plan|The Plan]]," in which a copy of Cavil berates a confused Doral copy (wearing clothing nearly identical to the first copy encountered by the Colonials) for his lack of disguise and caution while wandering the halls of Galactica. A later scene shows a small group of Doral copies assigned to menial labor on occupied Caprica, doing work they complain is below them and should be handled by centurions. Likewise, in the episode "[[Downloaded (Battlestar Galactica)|Downloaded]]," a copy of Doral can be seen serving drinks to other humanoid Cylons. These scenes seem to imply the Doral models are of lower intelligence than other Cylon models, and possess less authority.

The Doral Cylons appear to be more fanatical, militant and cold-hearted than the other humanoid Cylons encountered thus far, short of the often vile, overtly vicious [[Brother Cavil]]. They calmly discuss the genocide of mankind (stating on one occasion "They [humans] would have destroyed themselves anyway. They deserve what they got."), and unhesitatingly conducting (on at least one occasion) a suicide bombing aboard ''Galactica''<ref>[[Litmus (Battlestar Galactica)|Litmus]]</ref>. On the other hand, Doral was highly critical of the human suicide bombers in "[[Occupation (Battlestar Galactica)|Occupation]]" who inflicted Cylon casualties and fatalities, lambasting them for a 'lack of nobility'.

In "[[Torn(Battlestar Galactica)|Torn]]" a Number Eight accuses Doral of "barely even being able to say [God's] name."
