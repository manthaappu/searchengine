<html> <head> <title>Function approximation</title></head><body>The need for '''function approximations''' arises in many branches of [[applied mathematics]], and [[computer science]] in particular.  In general, a function approximation problem asks us to select a [[function (mathematics)|function]] among a well-defined class that closely matches ("approximates") a target function in a task-specific way.

One can distinguish two major classes of function approximation problems: First, for known target functions [[approximation theory]]  is the branch of [[numerical analysis]] that investigates how certain known functions (for example, [[special function]]s) can be approximated by a specific class of functions (for example, [[polynomial]]s or [[rational function]]s) that often have desirable properties (inexpensive computation, continuity, integral and limit values, etc.).

Second, the target function, call it ''g'', may be unknown; instead of an explicit formula, only a set of points of the form (''x'', ''g''(''x'')) is provided.  Depending on the structure of the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] and [[codomain]] of ''g'', several techniques for approximating ''g'' may be applicable.  For example, if ''g'' is an operation on the [[real number]]s, techniques of [[interpolation]], [[extrapolation]], [[regression analysis]], and [[curve fitting]] can be used.  If the codomain{{clarify|date=December 2010}} of ''g'' is a finite set, one is dealing with a [[statistical classification|classification]] problem instead.

To some extent the different problems (regression, classification, [[fitness approximation]]) have received a unified treatment in [[statistical learning theory]], where they are viewed as [[supervised learning]] problems.
