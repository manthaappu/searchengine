'''Conversational Programming System''' or '''CPS''' was an early [[Time-sharing]] system offered by [[IBM]] which ran on [[System/360]] [[mainframe computer|mainframes]] ''circa'' 1967 through 1972.  '''CPS''' was implemented as an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]], and users could select either a rudimentary form of [[BASIC]] or a reasonably complete version of [[PL/I]].  A third option provided [[Remote Job Entry|remote job entry]] (RJE) features allowing users to submit [[Job Control Language|JCL]] [[JOB Stream]]s for batch processing. A fourth option was called control mode. Normally, only the system operator would be permitted to use control mode.  The available features in control mode included:

*Send a message to an individual user or all users.
*Clobber (today it would be called re-boot) a specific user's virtual '''CPS''' machine.
*Monitor the activity of an individual user.
*Terminate the entire '''CPS''' system.

'''CPS''' provided a highly interactive user experience. It accomplished this by giving an immediate [[syntax error]] (when necessary) as soon as each line of a program was entered. 

Early versions of '''CPS''' were designed to run on the [[IBM 2741]] terminal. Later support was added for the [[IBM 2260]] terminal.

'''CPS''' was ultimately superseded by [[Time Sharing Option|TSO]].  Some installations ported '''CPS''' so that it could run as a command-invoked subsystem under TSO.
