'''Security Stores''' are usually housed on an [[Authentication server]].  The Security Store contains a combination of attributes about an entity including authentication [[credential]]s that can be used to validate the claim of an entity that it is the entity or not. The validation of that claim is commonly referred to as [[authentication]].

The term '''authentication store''' is synonymous with Security Store.
