'''Science journalism''' is a branch of [[journalism]] that uses the art of [[reporting]] to convey information about [[science]] topics to a public forum.  The communication of scientific knowledge through mass media requires a special relationship between the world of science and news media, which is still just beginning to form.

==Aim of science journalism==
The first task of a [[science journalist]] is to render the very detailed, specific, and often jargon-laden information produced by scientists into a form that the average media consumer can understand and appreciate, while still communicating the information accurately.

Science journalists often do not have training in the scientific disciplines that they cover. Some have earned a degree in a scientific field before becoming journalists, or exhibited talent in writing about science subjects. However, good preparation for interviews and even deceptively simple questions such as 'What does this mean to the people on the street' can often give material that is useful for publication for the intended audience.

==Quantity of science journalism==
In recent years, the amount of scientific news has grown rapidly with science playing an increasingly central role in society, and interaction between the scientific community and news media has increased.  The differences between the [[methodology|methodologies]] of these two "pillars" of modern society, particularly their distinct ways of developing their realities, have led to some difficulties.  Journalism tends to have a stronger bias towards sensationalism and speculative theories than science, whereas science focuses more on fact and empirical measurement.

==Criticism==
Science journalists regularly come under criticism for falsely reporting scientific stories.  Very often, such as with [[climate change]], this leaves the public with the impression that disagreement within the scientific community is much greater than it actually is.<ref>http://tigger.uic.edu/~pdoran/012009_Doran_final.pdf</ref>  Science is based on experimental [[evidence]], [[Test method|testing]] and not dogma, and disputation is a normal activity.<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/series/badscience</ref>
