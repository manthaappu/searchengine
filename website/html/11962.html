<html> <head> <title>Elias delta coding</title></head><body>'''Elias delta code''' is a [[Universal code (data compression)|universal code]] encoding the positive integers developed by [[Peter Elias]]. To code a number:
#Write it in binary.
#Count the bits and write down that number of bits in binary (X).
#Use the binary representation written in step 1 again, remove the leading bit and write down the remaining bits (Y).
#Append the second binary representation (Y) to the first binary representation (X).
#Count the bits written in step 2 (X), subtract 1 from that number and prepend that many zeros.

An equivalent way to express the same process:
#Separate the integer into the highest power of 2 it contains (2<sup>''N' ''</sup>) and the remaining ''N''' binary digits of the integer.
#Encode ''N = N' + 1'' with [[Elias gamma coding]].
#Append the remaining ''N''' binary digits to this representation of ''N''.

The code begins:

                                        Implied probability
  1 = 2<sup>0</sup> => N' = 0, N = 1 => 1             1/2
  2 = 2<sup>1</sup> + ''0'' => N' = 1, N = 2 => 010''0''      1/16
  3 = 2<sup>1</sup> + ''1'' => N' = 1, N = 2 => 010''1''       "
  4 = 2<sup>2</sup> + ''0'' => N' = 2, N = 3 => 011''00''     1/32
  5 = 2<sup>2</sup> + ''1'' => N' = 2, N = 3 => 011''01''      "
  6 = 2<sup>2</sup> + ''2'' => N' = 2, N = 3 => 011''10''      "
  7 = 2<sup>2</sup> + ''3'' => N' = 2, N = 3 => 011''11''      "
  8 = 2<sup>3</sup> + ''0'' => N' = 3, N = 4 => 00100''000''  1/256
  9 = 2<sup>3</sup> + ''1'' => N' = 3, N = 4 => 00100''001''   "
 10 = 2<sup>3</sup> + ''2'' => N' = 3, N = 4 => 00100''010''   "
 11 = 2<sup>3</sup> + ''3'' => N' = 3, N = 4 => 00100''011''   "
 12 = 2<sup>3</sup> + ''4'' => N' = 3, N = 4 => 00100''100''   "
 13 = 2<sup>3</sup> + ''5'' => N' = 3, N = 4 => 00100''101''   "
 14 = 2<sup>3</sup> + ''6'' => N' = 3, N = 4 => 00100''110''   "
 15 = 2<sup>3</sup> + ''7'' => N' = 3, N = 4 => 00100''111''   "
 16 = 2<sup>4</sup> + ''0'' => N' = 4, N = 5 => 00101''0000'' 1/512
 17 = 2<sup>4</sup> + ''1'' => N' = 4, N = 5 => 00101''0001''  "

To decode an Elias delta-coded integer:
#Read and count zeroes from the stream until you reach the first one.  Call this count of zeroes ''L''.
#Considering the one that was reached to be the first digit of an integer, with a value of 2<sup>''L''</sup>, read the remaining ''L'' digits of the integer.  Call this integer ''N''.
#Put a one in the first place of our final output, representing the value 2<sup>''N-1''</sup>.  Read and append the following ''N-1'' digits.

Example:
 001010001
 1. 2 leading zeros in 001
 2. read 2 more bits i.e. 00101
 3. decode N = 00101 = 5
 4. get N' = 5 - 1 = 4 remaining bits for the complete code i.e. '0001'
 5. encoded number = 2<sup>4</sup> + 1 = 17

This code can be generalized to zero or negative integers in the same ways described in [[Elias gamma coding#Generalizations|Elias gamma coding]].
