<html> <head> <title>Inverse semigroup</title></head><body>In mathematics, an '''inverse semigroup''' ''S'' is a [[semigroup]] in which every element ''x'' in ''S'' has a unique '''inverse''' 
''y'' in ''S'' in the sense that ''x = xyx'' and ''y = yxy''. Inverse semigroups appear in a range of contexts; for 
example, they can be employed in the study of [[partial symmetries]].<ref>Lawson 1998.</ref>

(The convention followed in this article will be that of writing a function on the right of its argument, and 
composing functions from left to right &mdash; a convention often observed in semigroup theory.)

== Origins ==
Inverse semigroups were introduced independently by [[Viktor Vladimirovich Wagner]]<ref>Since his father was German, Wagner preferred the German transliteration of his name (with a "W", rather than a "V") from Cyrillic - see Schein 1981.</ref> in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1952,<ref>First a short announcement in Wagner 1952, then a much more comprehensive exposition in Wagner 1953.</ref> and by [[Gordon Preston]] in [[Great Britain]] in 1954.<ref>Preston 1954a,b,c.</ref> Both authors arrived at inverse semigroups via the study of partial one-one transformations of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]]: a [[partial function|partial transformation]] α of a set ''X'' is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] from ''A'' to 
''B'', where ''A'' and ''B'' are subsets of ''X''. Let α and β be partial transformations of a set 
''X''; α and β can be composed (from left to right) on the largest [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]] upon 
which it "makes sense" to compose them:
:dom &alpha;&beta; = [im &alpha; <math>\cap</math> dom &beta;]&alpha;<sup>&minus;1</sup>
where α<sup>&minus;1</sup> denotes the [[preimage]] under α. Partial transformations had already been studied 
in the context of [[pseudogroup]]s.<ref>See, for example, Golab 1939.</ref>  It was Wagner, however, who 
was the first to observe that the composition of partial transformations is a special case of the multiplication of 
[[binary relations]].<ref>Schein 2002 : 152.</ref>  He recognised also that the domain of composition of two partial 
transformations may be the [[empty set]], so he introduced an ''empty transformation'' to take account of this.  
With the addition of this empty transformation, the composition of partial transformations of a set becomes an 
everywhere-defined [[associative]] [[binary operation]]. Under this composition, the collection 
<math>\mathcal{I}_X</math> of all partial one-one transformations of a set ''X'' forms an inverse semigroup, called 
the ''symmetric inverse semigroup'' (or monoid) on ''X''.<ref>Howie 1995 : 149.</ref>  This is the "archetypal" 
inverse semigroup, in the same way that a [[symmetric group]] is the archetypal [[group (mathematics)|group]]. For 
example, just as every [[group (mathematics)|group]] can be embedded in a [[symmetric group]], every inverse 
semigroup can be embedded in a symmetric inverse semigroup (see below).

== The basics ==
The inverse of an element ''x'' of an inverse semigroup ''S'' is usually written ''x''<sup>&minus;1</sup>. Inverses in an 
inverse semigroup have many of the same properties as inverses in a [[group (mathematics)|group]], for example, 
(''ab'')<sup>&minus;1</sup> = ''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>. In an inverse [[monoid]], ''xx''<sup>&minus;1</sup> and 
''x''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''x'' are not (necessarily) equal to the identity, but they are both [[idempotent]].<ref>Howie 
1995 : Proposition 5.1.2(1).</ref>  An inverse monoid ''S'' in which ''xx''<sup>&minus;1</sup> = 1 = 
''x''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''x'', for all ''x'' in ''S'' (a ''unipotent'' inverse monoid), is, of course, a [[group (mathematics)|group]].

There are a number of equivalent characterisations of an inverse semigroup ''S'':<ref>Howie 1995 : Theorem 
5.1.1.</ref>
* Every element of ''S'' has a unique inverse, in the above sense.
* Every element of ''S'' has at least one inverse (''S'' is a [[regular semigroup]]) and [[idempotent]]s commute (that is, the [[idempotent]]s of ''S'' form a [[semilattice]]).
* Every <math>\mathcal{L}</math>-class and every <math>\mathcal{R}</math>-class contains precisely one [[idempotent]], where <math>\mathcal{L}</math> and <math>\mathcal{R}</math> are two of [[Green's relations]].
The [[idempotent]] in the <math>\mathcal{L}</math>-class of ''s'' is ''s''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''s'', whilst the 
[[idempotent]] in the <math>\mathcal{R}</math>-class of ''s'' is ''ss''<sup>&minus;1</sup>. There is therefore a simple 
characterisation of [[Green's relations]] in an inverse semigroup:<ref>Howie 1995 : Proposition 5.1.2(1).</ref>
:<math>a\,\mathcal{L}\,b\Longleftrightarrow a^{-1}a=b^{-1}b,\quad a\,\mathcal{R}\,b\Longleftrightarrow 
aa^{-1}=bb^{-1}</math>

Examples of inverse semigroups:
*Every [[group (mathematics)|group]] is an inverse semigroup.
*The [[bicyclic semigroup]] is inverse, with (''a'',''b'')<sup>&minus;1</sup> = (''b'',''a'').
*Every [[semilattice]] is inverse.
*The [[Brandt semigroup]] is inverse.
*The [[Munn semigroup]] is inverse.

Unless stated otherwise, ''E(S)'' will denote the semilattice of idempotents of an inverse semigroup ''S''.

== The natural partial order ==
An inverse semigroup ''S'' possesses a ''natural [[partial order]]'' relation ≤ (sometimes denoted by ω) 
which is defined by the following:<ref>Wagner 1952.</ref>
:<math>a \leq b \Longleftrightarrow a=eb,</math>
for some [[idempotent]] ''e'' in ''S''. Equivalently,
:<math>a \leq b \Longleftrightarrow a=bf,</math>
for some (in general, different) [[idempotent]] ''f'' in ''S''. In fact, ''e'' can be taken to be 
''aa''<sup>&minus;1</sup> and ''f'' to be ''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''a''.<ref>Howie 1995 : Proposition 5.2.1.</ref>

The natural [[partial order]] is compatible with both multiplication and inversion, that is,<ref>Howie 1995 : 
152&ndash;3</ref>
:<math>a \leq b, c \leq d \Longrightarrow ac \leq bd</math>
and
:<math>a \leq b \Longrightarrow a^{-1} \leq b^{-1}.</math>

In a [[group (mathematics)|group]], this [[partial order]] simply reduces to equality, since the identity is the 
only [[idempotent]]. In a symmetric inverse semigroup, the [[partial order]] reduces to restriction of mappings, 
i.e., α ≤ β if, and only if, the domain of α is contained in the domain of β and 
''x''α = ''x''β, for all ''x'' in the domain of α.<ref>Howie 1995 : 153.</ref>

The natural partial order on an inverse semigroup interacts with [[Green's relations]] as follows: if ''s'' ≤ 
''t'' and ''s''<math>\,\mathcal{L}\,</math>''t'', then ''s'' = ''t''. Similarly, if 
''s''<math>\,\mathcal{R}\,</math>''t''.<ref>Lawson 1998 : Proposition 3.2.3.</ref>

On ''E(S)'', the natural [[partial order]] becomes:
:<math>e \leq f \Longleftrightarrow e = ef,</math>
so the product of any two [[idempotent]]s in ''S'' is equal to the lesser of the two, with respect to 
≤. If ''E(S)'' forms a [[chain (order theory)|chain]] (i.e., ''E(S)'' is [[totally ordered]] by ≤), then 
''S'' is a [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[group (mathematics)|groups]].<ref>Clifford & Preston 1967 : Theorem 
7.5</ref>

== Homomorphisms and representations of inverse semigroups ==
A [[homomorphism]] (or ''morphism'') of inverse semigroups is defined in exactly the same way as for any other 
semigroup: for inverse semigroups ''S'' and ''T'', a [[function (mathematics)|function]] θ from ''S'' to ''T'' 
is a morphism if (''s''θ)(''t''θ) = (''st'')θ, for all ''s'',''t'' in ''S''. The definition of a 
morphism of inverse semigroups could be augmented by including the condition (''s''θ)<sup>&minus;1</sup> = 
''s''<sup>&minus;1</sup>θ, however, there is no need to do so, since this property follows from the above 
definition, via the following theorem:

'''Theorem.'''  The homomorphic [[image (mathematics)|image]] of an inverse semigroup is an inverse semigroup; the 
inverse of an element is always mapped to the inverse of the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of that 
element.<ref>Clifford & Preston 1967 : Theorem 7.36.</ref>

One of the earliest results proved about inverse semigroups was the ''Wagner-Preston Theorem'', which is an analogue 
of [[Cayley's Theorem]] for [[group (mathematics)|groups]]:

'''Wagner-Preston Theorem.'''  If ''S'' is an inverse semigroup, then the [[function (mathematics)|function]] φ 
from ''S'' to <math>\mathcal{I}_S</math>, given by
:dom (''a''&phi;) = ''Sa''<sup>&minus;1</sup> and ''x''(''a''&phi;) = ''xa''
is a [[faithful representation]] of ''S''.<ref>Howie 1995 : Theorem 5.1.7. Originally, Wagner 1952 and, 
independently, Preston 1954c.</ref>

Thus, any inverse semigroup can be embedded in a symmetric inverse semigroup.

== Congruences on inverse semigroups ==
[[Congruences]] are defined on inverse semigroups in exactly the same way as for any other semigroup: a 
''congruence'' ρ is an [[equivalence relation]] which is compatible with semigroup multiplication, i.e.,
:<math>a\,\rho\,b,\quad c\,\rho\,d\Longrightarrow ac\,\rho\,bd.</math><ref>Howie 1995 : 22</ref>

Of particular interest is the relation <math>\sigma</math>, defined on an inverse semigroup ''S'' by
:<math>a\,\sigma\,b\Longleftrightarrow</math> there exists a <math>c\in S</math> with <math>c\leq 
a,b.</math><ref>Lawson 1998 : 62</ref>
It can be shown that σ is a congruence and that the factor semigroup ''S''/σ is, in fact, a group.  
Indeed, σ is the ''smallest'' congruence on ''S'' such that ''S''/σ is a group, that is, if τ is any 
other congruence on ''S'' with ''S''/τ a group, then σ is contained in τ. The congruence σ is 
called the ''minimum group congruence'' on ''S''.<ref>Lawson 1998 : Theorem 2.4.1.</ref>  The minimum group 
congruence can be used to give a characterisation of ''E''-unitary inverse semigroups (see below).

A congruence ρ on an inverse semigroup ''S'' is called ''idempotent pure'' if 
:<math>a\in S, e\in E(S), a\,\rho\,e\Longrightarrow a\in E(S).</math><ref>Lawson 1998 : 65</ref>

== ''E''-unitary inverse semigroups ==
One class of inverse semigroups which has been studied extensively over the years is the class of ''E-unitary 
inverse semigroups'': an inverse semigroup ''S'' (with [[semilattice]] ''E'' of [[idempotent]]s) is 
''E-unitary'' if, for all ''e'' in ''E'' and all ''s'' in ''S'',
:<math>es \in E \Longrightarrow s \in E.</math>
Equivalently,
:<math>se \in E \Rightarrow s \in E.</math><ref>Howie 1995 : 192.</ref>

One further characterisation of an ''E''-unitary inverse semigroup ''S'' is the following: if ''e'' is in ''E'' and 
''e'' ≤ ''s'', for some ''s'' in ''S'', then ''s'' is in ''E''.<ref>Lawson 1998 : Proposition 2.4.3.</ref>

'''Theorem.'''  Let ''S'' be an inverse semigroup with [[semilattice]] ''E'' of idempotents, and minimum group 
congruence σ. Then the following are equivalent:<ref>Lawson 1998 : Theorem 2.4.6.</ref>
*''S'' is ''E''-unitary;
*σ is idempotent pure;
*<math>\sim</math> = σ,
where <math>\sim</math> is the ''compatibility relation'' on ''S'', defined by
:<math>a\sim b\Longleftrightarrow ab^{-1},a^{-1}b</math> are idempotent.

'''McAlister's Covering Theorem.''' Every inverse semigroup S has a E-unitary cover; that is there exists an idempotent separating surjective homorphism from some E-unitary semigroup T onto S.<ref>Grillet p. 248</ref>

Central to the study of ''E''-unitary inverse semigroups is the following construction.<ref>Howie 1995 : 193&ndash;4</ref>  Let <math>\mathcal{X}</math> be a [[partially ordered set]], with ordering ≤, and let <math>\mathcal{Y}</math> be a [[subset]] of <math>\mathcal{X}</math> with the properties that
*<math>\mathcal{Y}</math> is a [[semilattice|lower semilattice]], that is, every pair of elements ''A'', ''B'' in <math>\mathcal{Y}</math> has a [[greatest lower bound]] ''A'' <math>\wedge</math> ''B'' in <math>\mathcal{Y}</math> (with respect to ≤);
*<math>\mathcal{Y}</math> is an [[order ideal]] of <math>\mathcal{X}</math>, that is, for ''A'', ''B'' in <math>\mathcal{X}</math>, if ''A'' is in <math>\mathcal{Y}</math> and ''B'' ≤ ''A'', then ''B'' is in <math>\mathcal{Y}</math>.

Now let ''G'' be a [[group (mathematics)|group]] which [[group action|acts]] on <math>\mathcal{X}</math> (on the left), such that
*for all ''g'' in ''G'' and all ''A'', ''B'' in <math>\mathcal{X}</math>, ''gA'' = ''gB'' if, and only if, ''A'' = ''B'';
*for each ''g'' in ''G'' and each ''B'' in <math>\mathcal{X}</math>, there exists an ''A'' in <math>\mathcal{X}</math> such that ''gA'' = ''B'';
*for all ''A'', ''B'' in <math>\mathcal{X}</math>, ''A'' ≤ ''B'' if, and only if, ''gA'' ≤ ''gB'';
*for all ''g'', ''h'' in ''G'' and all ''A'' in <math>\mathcal{X}</math>, ''g''(''hA'') = (''gh'')''A''.

The triple <math>(G, \mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y})</math> is also assumed to have the following properties:
*for every ''X'' in <math>\mathcal{X}</math>, there exists a ''g'' in ''G'' and an ''A'' in <math>\mathcal{Y}</math> such that ''gA'' = ''X'';
*for all ''g'' in ''G'', ''g''<math>\mathcal{Y}</math> and <math>\mathcal{Y}</math> have nonempty intersection.

Such a triple <math>(G, \mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y})</math> is called a ''McAlister triple''. A McAlister triple is 
used to define the following:
:<math>P(G, \mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y}) = \{ (A,g) \in \mathcal{Y}\times G: g^{-1}A \in \mathcal{Y} \}</math>
together with multiplication
:<math>(A,g)(B,h)=(A \wedge gB, gh)</math>.
Then <math>P(G, \mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y})</math> is an inverse semigroup under this multiplication, with 
(''A'',''g'')<sup>&minus;1</sup> = (''g''<sup>&minus;1</sup>''A'', ''g''<sup>&minus;1</sup>). One of the main results in the study of 
''E''-unitary inverse semigroups is ''McAlister's P-Theorem'':

'''McAlister's P-Theorem.'''  Let <math>(G, \mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y})</math> be a McAlister triple. Then <math>P(G, 
\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y})</math> is an ''E''-unitary inverse semigroup. Conversely, every ''E''-unitary inverse 
semigroup is [[isomorphic]] to one of this type.<ref>Howie 1995 : Theorem 5.9.2. Originally, McAlister 
1974a,b.</ref>

=== ''F''-inverse semigroups ===
An inverse semigroup is said to be ''F''-inverse if every element has a ''unique'' maximal element above it in the natural partial order, i.e. ever σ-class has a maximal element. Every ''F''-inverse semigroup is an ''E''-unitary monoid. McAlister's covering theorem has been refined by [[M.V. Lawson]] to:

'''Theorem.''' Every inverse semigroup has an ''F''-inverse cover.<ref>Lawson 1998 p. 230</ref>

McAlister's ''P''-theorem has been used to characterize ''F''-inverse semigroups as well. A McAlister triple <math>(G, \mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y})</math> is an ''F''-inverse semigroups if and only if <math>\mathcal{Y}</math> is a principal ideal of <math>\mathcal{X}</math> and  <math>\mathcal{X}</math> is a semilattice.

== Free inverse semigroups ==
A construction similar to a [[free group]] is possible for inverse semigroups. A [[presentation]] of the free inverse semigroup on a set ''X'' may be obtained by considering the [[free semigroup with involution]], where involution is the taking of the inverse, and then [[Semigroup#Homomorphisms and congruences|taking the quotient]] by the '''Vagner congruence'''

:<math>\{ (xx^{-1}x, x),\; (xx^{-1}yy^{-1}, yy^{-1}xx^{-1})\;|\;x,y \in (X\cup X^{-1})^+ \}. </math>

The [[word problem]] for free inverse semigroups is much more intricate than that of free groups. A celebrated result in this area due to [[W. D. Munn]] who showed that elements of the free inverse semigroup can be naturally regarded as trees, known as Munn trees. Multiplication in the free inverse semigroup has a correspondent on [[Munn tree]]s, which essentially consists of overlapping common portions of the trees. (see Lawson 1998 for further details) <!-- can't say much more without getting into way more details-->

Any free inverse semigroup is ''F''-inverse.<ref>Lawson 1998, p.230</ref>

== Connections with category theory ==
The above composition of partial transformations of a set gives rise to a symmetric inverse semigroup. There is 
another way of composing partial transformations, which is more restrictive than that used above: two partial 
transformations α and β are composed if, and only if, the image of α is equal to the domain of 
β; otherwise, the composition αβ is undefined. Under this alternative composition, the collection 
of all partial one-one transformations of a set forms not an inverse semigroup but an [[inductive groupoid]], in the 
sense of [[category theory]]. This close connection between inverse semigroups and inductive groupoids is 
embodied in the ''Ehresmann-Schein-Nambooripad Theorem'', which states that an inductive groupoid can always be 
constructed from an inverse semigroup, and conversely.<ref>Lawson 1998 : 4.1.8.</ref>

== Generalisations of inverse semigroups ==
As noted above, an inverse semigroup ''S'' can be defined by the conditions (1) ''S'' is a [[regular semigroup]], 
and (2) the [[idempotent]]s in ''S'' commute; this has led to two distinct classes of generalisations of 
an inverse semigroup: semigroups in which (1) holds, but (2) does not, and vice versa.

Examples of regular generalisations of an inverse semigroup are:<ref>Howie 1995 : Section 2.4 & Chapter 6.</ref>
*''[[Regular semigroup]]s'': a [[semigroup]] ''S'' is ''regular'' if every element has at least one inverse; equivalently, for each ''a'' in ''S'', there is an ''x'' in ''S'' such that ''axa'' = ''a''.
*''Locally inverse semigroups'': a [[regular semigroup]] ''S'' is ''locally inverse'' if ''eSe'' is an inverse semigroup, for each [[idempotent]] ''e''.
*''Orthodox semigroups'': a [[regular semigroup]] ''S'' is ''orthodox'' if its subset of [[idempotent]]s forms a subsemigroup.
*''Generalised inverse semigroups'': a [[regular semigroup]] ''S'' is called a ''generalised inverse semigroup'' if its [[idempotent]]s form a normal band, i.e., ''xyzx'' = ''xzyx'', for all [[idempotent]]s ''x'', ''y'', ''z''.

The [[class (set theory)|class]] of generalised inverse semigroups is the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the class of 
locally inverse semigroups and the class of orthodox semigroups.<ref>Howie 1995 : 222.</ref>

Amongst the non-regular generalisations of an inverse semigroup are:<ref>Fountain 
1979.</ref>[http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~varg1/finitela.ps]
*(Left, right, two-sided) adequate semigroups.
*(Left, right, two-sided) ample semigroups.
*(Left, right, two-sided) semiadequate semigroups.
*Weakly (left, right, two-sided) ample semigroups.
