<html> <head> <title>Beltrami identity</title></head><body>The '''Beltrami identity''' is an identity in the [[calculus of variations]]. It says that a function ''u'' which is an extremal of the integral

:<math>I(u)=\int_a^b L(x,u,u') \, dx</math>

satisfies the differential equation

:<math>
\frac{d}{dx}\left(L-u'\frac{\partial L}{\partial u'}\right)-\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}=0.
</math>

In the case that L is the Lagrangian of a Mechanical system, and if L does not depend on x explicitly, which corresponds to a Lagrangian which does not explicitly depend on time, the Beltrami identity states that the Hamiltonian associated to the Lagrangian is a conserved energy.
 
== Proof ==

Define the conjugate momentum p to be the partial derivative of the function L with respect to u'.

::<math> p = {\partial L \over \partial u'} </math>

The [[Euler-Lagrange equation]] says

::<math> {dp\over dx} - {\partial L \over \partial u} = 0 </math>

or

::<math> p' = {\partial L \over \partial u} </math>

define the Hamiltonian H to be the [[Legendre transformation|Legendre transform]] of L with respect to u:

::<math> H = p u' - L \,</math>

Then 

::<math> H' = {dH \over dx} = p' u' + p u'' - {\partial L \over \partial u'} u'' - {\partial L \over \partial u} u' - {\partial L \over \partial x}</math>

The second and third term cancel, by the definition of p, and the first and fourth terms cancel by the Euler Lagrange equation. This leaves  the Beltrami identity:

::<math> H' = - {\partial L \over \partial x} </math>

which is a special case of [[Noether's theorem]].

== Application ==

In case that ''L'' is independent of ''x'', then the Beltrami identity states that H is constant

::<math> - H' = \frac{d}{dx}\left(L-u'\frac{\partial L}{\partial u'}\right) = 0</math>

This can be used to solve the [[Euler-Lagrange equation]], in the same way that conservation of energy can be used to solve Newton's law of motion. The condition that H is constant is an equation for the first derivative of u, while the original Euler Lagrange equation is an equation for the second derivative of u.

For example, consider the [[Brachistochrone problem]]: find the curve minimizing the integral:

::<math> \int_0^1 {\sqrt{1+y'^2} \over \sqrt{y}} dx </math>

The quantity to minimize is the integral of an L which does not depend explicitly on time,

::<math> L(y,y') = {\sqrt{1+y'^2} \over \sqrt{y}} </math>

so the associated Hamiltonian is constant:

::<math> H = p y' - L = {y'^2 \over \sqrt{1+y'^2} \sqrt{y}} - {\sqrt{1+y'^2}\over \sqrt{y}} = {-1 \over \sqrt{1+y'^2}\sqrt{y}} </math>

::<math> \sqrt{1+y'^2}\sqrt{y} = \text{constant}</math>

which simplifies to the differential equation for the cycloid.
