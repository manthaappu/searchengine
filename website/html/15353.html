The '''Global Consciousness Project''' ('''GCP''', also called the '''EGG Project''') is a [[parapsychology]] experiment begun in 1998, described as an attempt to detect potential interactions of "global [[consciousness]]" with physical systems.  The project monitors a geographically distributed network of [[hardware random number generator]]s to uncover potential anomalies in their output which might correlate with world events that elicit widespread emotional response or focused attention by large numbers of people.<ref name="bancel">{{cite web|url=http://noosphere.princeton.edu/papers/pdf/GCP.Events.Mar08.prepress.pdf|title=The GCP Event Experiment: Design, Analytical Methods, Results |last=Bancel, P|first=& Nelson, R|work=Journal Scientific of Exploration (2008) Section 2 of this research article by GCP scientists provides a concise presentation of the GCP hypothesis and methodology }}</ref>  According to the GCP, the experiment aims to test a conjecture they feel would extend the range of anomalous phenomena currently encompassed by [[psi (parapsychology)|psi]] research. The GCP is privately funded through the [[Institute of Noetic Sciences]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noosphere.princeton.edu/contributions.html |title='&#39;Global Consciousness Project: Contributions'&#39; |publisher=Noosphere.princeton.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref> and describes itself as an international collaboration of about 100 research scientists and engineers.

[[Skepticism|Skeptics]] such as Robert T. Carroll, Claus Larsen, and others have questioned the methodology of the Global Consciousness Project, particularly how the data are selected and interpreted,<ref name=schiavo>{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticnews.com/2005/04/terry_schiavo_a.html|title="Terry Schiavo and the Global Consciousness Project" (Skeptic News, April 27, 2005)|accessdate=2008-05-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Larsen|first=Claus|date=1 January 2003|url=http://skepticreport.com/sr/?p=560|title="An Evening with Dean Radin"|work=Skeptic Report|accessdate=2008-05-05}}</ref> saying the data anomalies reported by the project are the result of "pattern matching" and [[selection bias]] which ultimately fail to support a belief in psi or global consciousness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/globalconsciousness.html |title=The Skeptic's Dictionary |publisher=Skepdic.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref>

==Background==
[[Roger D. Nelson]] developed the project as an extrapolation of two decades of experiments from the controversial [[Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab]] (PEAR),<ref name="NY Times 2007-02-06">{{cite news  | last = Carey  | first = Benedict  | title = A Princeton Lab on ESP Plans to Close Its Doors  | publisher = New York Times  | date = 2007-02-06  | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/10/science/10princeton.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5090&en=2f8f7bdba3ac59f1&ex=1328763600  | accessdate = 2007-08-03 }}</ref> which Nelson says appeared to show that electronic noise-based, random number generators ([[RNG]] or REG, random event generators) seem to be influenced by human consciousness to bring about a less-than-random sequence of data.

In an extension of the laboratory research called [[FieldREG]], investigators examined the outputs of REGs in the field, before, during and after highly focused or coherent group events. The group events studied included psychotherapy sessions, theater presentations, religious rituals, sports competitions such as the [[Football World Cup]], and television broadcasts like the [[Academy Awards]].<ref>Bierman, 1996; Blasband, 2000; Nelson, 1995, 1997; Nelson et al.,  1996, 1998a, 1998b; Radin, 1997; Radin et al., 1996.</ref>

FieldREG was extended to global dimensions in studies looking at data from 12 independent REGs in the US and Europe during a web-promoted "Gaiamind Meditation" in January 1997, and then again in September 1997 after the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]]. The results suggested it would be worthwhile to build a permanent network of continuously-running REGs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noosphere.princeton.edu/ejap/diana/abstract.html|title=ejap/diana/abstract|accessdate=2009-10-28}}</ref> This became the EGG project or Global Consciousness Project. 

Comparing the GCP to PEAR, Nelson,  referring to the "field" studies with REGs done by PEAR, said the GCP used "exactly the same procedure... applied on a broader scale."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noosphere.princeton.edu/story.html |title=The EGG Story |publisher=Noosphere.princeton.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref>

==Research==
The GCP's methodology is based on the hypothesis that events which elicit widespread emotion or draw the simultaneous attention of large numbers of people may affect the output of hardware random number generators in a statistically significant way.<ref name="bancel" /> The GCP maintains a network of hardware random number generators which are interfaced to computers at 65 locations around the world. Custom software reads the output of the random number generators and records a trial (sum of 200 bits) once every second. The data are sent to a server in Princeton, creating a database of synchronized parallel sequences of random numbers. The GCP is run as a replication experiment, essentially combining the results of many distinct tests of the hypothesis. The hypothesis is tested by calculating the extent of data fluctuations at the time of events. The procedure is specified by a three-step experimental protocol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noosphere.princeton.edu/papers/pdf/GCP.Events.Mar08.prepress.pdf|title=Ibid. p.6 }}</ref> In the first step, the event duration and the calculation algorithm are pre-specified and entered into a formal registry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noosphere.princeton.edu/pred_formal.html|title=GCP Event registry|accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref> In the second step, the event data are extracted from the database and a [[Z score]], which indicates the degree of deviation from the null hypothesis, is calculated from the pre-specified algorithm. In the third step, the event Z-score is combined with the Z-scores from previous events to yield an overall result for the experiment. The GCP claims that, as of late 2009, the cumulative result of more than 300 registered events significantly supports their hypothesis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noosphere.princeton.edu/results.html|title=GCP Event summaries|accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref>

The remote devices have been dubbed ''Princeton Eggs'', a reference to the coinage ''electrogaiagram'', a [[portmanteau]] of [[electroencephalogram]] and [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noosphere.princeton.edu/story.html|title=Gathering of a global mind|accessdate=2008-03-23}}</ref> Supporters and skeptics have referred to the aim of the GCP as being analogous to detecting "a great disturbance in [[Force (Star Wars)|The Force]]."<ref name=schiavo/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://noosphere.princeton.edu/williams/GCP911.html|title=Exploratory Block Analysis of Field Consciousness Effects on Global RNGs on September 11, 2001|last=Williams|first=Bryan J.|date=12 August 2002|work=Noosphere|accessdate=2009-10-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boundaryinstitute.org/bi/randomness.htm|title=A disturbance in the Force...?|first=December 2001|work=Boundary Institute|accessdate=2009-10-07}}</ref>

==Criticism==
Based on an exploratory analysis of 'highly statistically significant' experimental results, the GCP has suggested changes in the level of randomness may have occurred during the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] at the times of the plane impacts and the building collapses, and over the two days following the disaster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noosphere.princeton.edu/terror.html|title="September 11, 2001: Exploratory and Contextual Analyses"|accessdate=2008-07-12}}</ref>  Moreover, the GCP has identified similar 'anomalies' in the EGG data hours and even days before the attacks; while the GCP does not claim a causal relationship,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noosphere.princeton.edu/terror1.html|title="Extended Analysis: September 11, 2001 in Context"|accessdate=2008-07-12}}</ref> such changes&mdash;if genuine&mdash;would seem to imply either subconscious mass [[precognition]], or [[retrocausality|backwards causality]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noosphere.princeton.edu/papers/nelson-pp.pdf|title=Correlations of Continuous Random Data with Major World Events|last=Nelson et al. |work=Foundations of Physics Letters|date=2002| accessdate=2009-10-10}}</ref>

Independent scientists Edwin May and James Spottiswoode conducted an analysis of the data around the 11 September 2001 events and concluded there was no statistically significant change in the randomness of the GCP data during the attacks and the apparent significant deviation reported by Nelson and Radin existed only in their chosen time window.<ref name="MaySpottiswoode">May, E.C e.a.  [http://www.lfr.org/LFR/csl/library/Sep1101.pdf ''Global Consciousness Project: An Independent Analysis of The 11 September 2001 Events'']</ref> Spikes and fluctuations are to be expected in any random distribution of data, and there is no set time frame for how close a spike has to be to a given event for the GCP to say they have found a correlation.<ref name="MaySpottiswoode" />   
Wolcotte Smith said "A couple of additional statistical adjustments would have to be made to determine if there really was a spike in the numbers," referencing the data related to September 11, 2001.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/2001/12/06/net-interest.htm |title=USA Today |publisher=USA Today |date=2001-12-06 |accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref> Similarly, Jeffrey D. Scargle believes unless both [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] and classical [[p-value]] analysis agree and both show the same anomalous effects, the kind of result GCP proposes will not be generally accepted.<ref name="Scargle">Scargle, Jeffrey D. [http://noosphere.princeton.edu/papers/jseScargle.pdf ''Was There Evidence of Global Consciousness on September 11, 2001?'']</ref>

In  2003, a New York Times article concluded "All things considered at this point, the stock market seems a more reliable gauge of the national -- if not the global--emotional resonance."<ref>{{cite news|author=By J.D. Reed |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/09/nyregion/so-just-what-makes-the-earth-move.html |title=New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2003-03-09 |accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref>

According to ''[[The Age]]'', Nelson concedes "the data, so far, is not solid enough for global consciousness to be said to exist at all. It is not possible, for example, to look at the data and predict with any accuracy what (if anything) the eggs may be responding to."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/in-depth/mind-over-matter/2007/04/26/1177459869857.html |title=Theage.com.au |publisher=Theage.com.au |date= 2007-04-28|accessdate=2010-01-05 | location=Melbourne}}</ref>

[[Robert Matthews (scientist)|Robert Matthews]] called it "the most sophisticated attempt yet" to prove psychokinesis existed, but cited the unreliability of significant events to cause statistically significant spikes, concluding "the only conclusion to emerge from the Global Consciousness Project so far is that data without a theory is as meaningless as words without a narrative". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/article/20090209/FRONTIERS/272091981/1036/OPINION |title=The National (Abu Dhabi) |publisher=Thenational.ae |date=2009-02-09 |accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref>
