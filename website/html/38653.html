'''UTOPIA''' (User-friendly Tools for OPerating Informatics Applications) is a suite of free tools for visualising and analysing [[bioinformatics]] data. Based on an [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]]-driven data model, it contains applications for viewing and aligning protein sequences, rendering complex molecular structures in 3D, and for finding and using resources such as web services and data objects.

Between 2003 and 2005 work on UTOPIA was funded via [http://www.esnw.ac.uk/|The e-Science North West Centre] based at [[The University of Manchester]] by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, UK Department of Trade And Industry, and the European Molecular Biology Network. Since 2005 work continues under the [http://www.embracegrid.info EMBRACE European Network of Excellence].

== History ==
UTOPIA's CINEMA (Colour INteractive Editor for Multiple Alignments), a tool for [[Sequence alignment|Sequence Alignment]], is the latest incarnation of software originally developed at The [[University of Leeds]] to aid the analysis of [[GPCR]]s. SOMAP<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/7.2.233 |author=Parry-Smith DJ, Attwood TK |title=SOMAP: a novel interactive approach to multiple protein sequences alignment |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=233–5 |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/7/2/233 |year=1991}}</ref>, a Screen Orientated Multiple Alignment Procedure was developed in the late 1980s on the [[OpenVMS|VMS]] computer operating system, used a monochrome text-based [[VT100]] video terminal, and featured [[Context-Sensitive Help|context-sensitive help]] and [[Pull-down menu|pulldown menus]] some time before these were standard operating system features. 

SOMAP was followed by a [[Unix]] tool called VISTAS<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0263-7855(94)00013-I |author=Perkins DN, Attwood TK |title=VISTAS: a package for VIsualizing STructures and sequences of proteins |journal=J Mol Graph |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=73–5, 62 |year=1995 |month=February |pmid=7794837 }}</ref> (VIsualizing STructures And Sequences) which included the ability to render 3D molecular structure and generate plots and statistical representations of sequence properties.

The first tool under the CINEMA<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0378-1119(97)00650-1 |author=Parry-Smith DJ, Payne AW, Michie AD, Attwood TK |title=CINEMA--a novel colour INteractive editor for multiple alignments |journal=Gene |volume=221 |issue=1 |pages=GC57–63 |year=1998 |month=October |pmid=9852962 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378-1119(97)00650-1}}</ref> banner developed at [[The University of Manchester]] was a [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based applet launched via web pages, which is [http://www.bioinf.manchester.ac.uk/dbbrowser/CINEMA2.1/  still available] but is no longer maintained. A standalone Java version, called CINEMA-MX<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/18.10.1402 |author=Lord PW, Selley JN, Attwood TK |title=CINEMA-MX: a modular multiple alignment editor |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=18 |issue=10 |pages=1402–3 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12376388 |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12376388}}</ref>, was also released but is no longer readily available. 

A [[C++]] version of CINEMA, called CINEMA5 was developed early on as part of the UTOPIA project, and was released as a stand-alone sequence alignment application. It has now been replaced by a version of the tool integrated with UTOPIA's other visualisation applications, and its name has reverted simply to CINEMA.
