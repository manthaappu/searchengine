<html> <head> <title>Meta-emotion</title></head><body>'''Meta-emotion''' refers to the emotional reactions to one's own [[emotion]]s (second-order emotions about primary emotions).  An example would be being angry (the primary emotion) and being afraid of one's anger (the meta-emotion).

Meta-emotions can be short-term or long-term. The latter can be a source of discouragement or even [[psychological repression]], or encouragement of specific emotions, having implications for personality traits, [[psychodynamics]], family and [[group dynamics]], [[organizational climate]], emotional disorders, but also emotional [[awareness]], and [[emotional intelligence]].

Meta-emotion was first defined by Gottman et al. in 1996, encompasing both thoughts and feelings about emotions.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Gottman | first = JM | coauthors = Katz LF & Hooven C | year = 1996 | title = Parental meta-emotion philosophy and the emotional life of families: Theoretical models and preliminary data | journal = Journal of Family Psychology | volume = 10 | pages = 243–268 | doi = 10.1037/0893-3200.10.3.243}} [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=3230504 (abstract)]</ref>  Initial studies examined how parents discussed the emotions of their children and their attitudes towards these emotions.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hooven, Carole; Gottman, John Mordechai; Katz, Lynn Fainsilber |title=Meta-emotion: how families communicate emotionally |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location=Hillsdale, N.J |year=1997 |pages= [http://books.google.ca/books?id=sM8Wrpqk8X4C&pg=PA5 5]|isbn=0-8058-1996-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= }}</ref>  The theory of meta-emotions was an unexpected result of their initial work.
