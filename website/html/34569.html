The '''Sith engine''' is a [[game engine]] developed by [[LucasArts]].
The game ''[[Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II]]'' is based on this engine, and its expansion, ''[[Star Wars Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith]]'', is based on a slightly updated version.

The engine has also been used in ''[[Grim Fandango]]'' as a basis for the [[GrimE]] engine<ref>[http://www.grimfandango.net/?page=articles&pagenumber=2 Lua in Grim Fandango]</ref>, and used in ''[[Star Wars: Droid Works]]''<ref>[http://www.gamasutra.com/features/19990813/droidworks_01.htm Postmortem: LucasLearning's Star Wars DroidWorks]</ref>. A modified [[third-person view]] version of the code with drastically rewritten lighting, collision, rendering and tools was renamed to Jones engine and used in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.checkout.com/games/nn/article/0,6712,1746754,00.html  |title=Indiana Jones Interview |author=Chris Jensen |date=1999 |publisher=CheckOut Games (via [[Internet Archive]]) |accessdate=7 April 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20000127011936/http://www.checkout.com/games/nn/article/0,6712,1746754,00.html |archivedate = 27 January 2000}}</ref>

==Technical features==

The '''Sith engine''' is an early example of a scripted game engine.  Most object behaviors are implemented with the integrated COG [[scripting language]] or defined [[Parameter|parametrically]] using a template system which allows simple [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]].<ref>[http://www.gamasutra.com/features/19971003/huebner_01.htm Adding Languages to Game Engines]</ref>

The engine is also an example of a [[Portal rendering|portal engine]]. Level geometry is rendered as a series of negative-space [[Convex polytope|convex]] [[Polyhedron|polyhedrons]] connected by adjoining [[Polygon|polygons]]. Levels require no preprocessing and [[hidden surface determination]] is computed at run-time.
