<html> <head> <title>Washington State Digital Archives</title></head><body>The '''Washington State Digital Archives''' are an extensive [[digitized]] [[archive]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. The physical "hub" is on the campus of [[Eastern Washington University]] in [[Cheney, Washington|Cheney]], and the archive is available both over the [[internet]] and through computers in a local [[reading room]] there. It houses electronic [[Image scanner|scans]] of state, county, and local records that have permanent value, including records of censuses, immigration, prisoners, military service, and legislation dating back to the 19th century.

The digital archives opened in October 2004, managed by [[Adam Jansen]] until December 2007. They had been planned and built from 2000 through 2004, with a new building to house both the traditional paper archives and the new digital archives being completed in June 2004.

The Washington State Digital Archives is part of the Office of the Secretary of State and directed under the supervision of [[Sam Reed]].
