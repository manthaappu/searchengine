A '''barcode reader''' (or '''barcode scanner''') is an electronic device for reading printed [[barcode]]s. Like a [[flatbed scanner]], it consists of a light source, a lens and a light sensor translating optical impulses into electrical ones. Additionally, nearly all barcode readers contain ''decoder'' circuitry analyzing the barcode's image data provided by the sensor and sending the barcode's content to the scanner's output port.

== Types of barcode readers ==

=== Methods ===

Scanning methods are distinguished by the amount of operator manipulation required:
* Pen or wand-type readers: requires the operator to swipe the pen over the code.
* Semi-automatic handheld readers: The operator need not swipe, but must at least position the reader near the label
* Fix-mount readers for automatic reading: The reading is performed laterally passing the label over the reader. No operator is required, but the position of the code target must coincide with the imaging capability of the reader.
* Reader gates for automatic scanning: The position of the code must be just under the gate for short time, enabling the scanner sweep to capture the code target successfully.

=== Types of technology ===

The reader types can be distinguished as follows:

==== Pen-type readers ====
Pen-type readers consist of a light source and a [[photodiode]] that are placed next to each other in the tip of a pen or wand.<ref name="denso-wave, handheld illustrations" >{{cite web
  |title=Handheld barcode scanner technologies, illustrated
  |url=http://www.denso-wave.com/en/adcd/fundamental/barcode/scanner.html
}}</ref> To read a bar code, the tip of the pen moves across the bars in a steady motion. The photodiode measures the intensity of the light reflected back from the light source and generates a waveform that is used to measure the widths of the bars and spaces in the bar code. Dark bars in the bar code absorb light and white spaces reflect light so that the voltage waveform generated by the photo diode is a representation of the bar and space pattern in the bar code. This waveform is decoded by the scanner in a manner similar to the way [[Morse code]] dots and dashes are decoded.

==== Laser scanners====
Laser scanners work the same way as pen type readers except that they use a [[laser]] beam as the light source and typically employ either a reciprocating mirror or a rotating prism to scan the laser beam back and forth across the bar code.<ref name="denso-wave, handheld illustrations" /> As with the pen type reader, a photodiode is used to measure the intensity of the light reflected back from the bar code. In both pen readers and laser scanners, the light emitted by the reader is rapidly varied in brightness with a data pattern and the photodiode receive circuitry is designed to detect only signals with the same [[modulation|modulated]] pattern.

==== CCD readers ====
[[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] readers use an array of hundreds of tiny light sensors lined up in a row in the head of the reader. Each sensor measures the intensity of the light immediately in front of it. Each individual light sensor in the CCD reader is extremely small and because there are hundreds of sensors lined up in a row, a voltage pattern identical to the pattern in a bar code is generated in the reader by sequentially measuring the voltages across each sensor in the row. The important difference between a CCD reader and a pen or laser scanner is that the CCD reader is measuring emitted ambient light from the bar code whereas pen or laser scanners are measuring reflected light of a specific frequency originating from the scanner itself.

==== Camera-based readers ====
Two-dimensional [[machine vision|imaging scanners]] are the fourth and newest type of bar code reader. They use a camera and image processing techniques to decode the bar code. 

'''Video camera readers''' use small video cameras with the same CCD technology as in a CCD bar code reader except that instead of having a single row of sensors, a video camera has hundreds of rows of sensors arranged in a two dimensional array so that they can generate an image.<ref>[http://katanshi.com/Products.php Katanshi Barcode Reader] ''webcam based barcode reader''.</ref> 

'''Large field-of-view readers''' use high resolution industrial cameras to capture multiple bar codes simultaneously. All the bar codes appearing in the photo are decoded instantly (ImageID patents [http://www.wikipatents.com/US-Patent-6801245/method-for-automatic-identification-and-data-capture/Page-1 6801245] & [http://www.wikipatents.com/US-Patent-6922208/method-for-automatic-identification-and-data-capture/Page-1 6922208]). 

There are a number of open source libraries for barcode reading from images. These include the [http://code.google.com/p/zxing/ ZXing] project, which reads one- and two-dimensional barcodes using Android and JavaME, the [http://code.google.com/p/jjil/ JJIL] project, which includes code for reading [[European Article Number | EAN-13]] barcodes from cellphone cameras using [[Java ME]], and [http://sourceforge.net/projects/zbar ZBAR], which reads various one-dimensional barcodes in C. Even web site integration, either by image uploads (e.g. [http://www.ashberg.de/php-barcode/ Folke Ashberg: EAN-13 Image-Scanning] and code creation tools) or by use of plugins (e.g. the [http://barcodepedia.com/ Barcodepedia] uses a flash application and some web cam for querying a database), have been realized options for resolving the given tasks. Finally, there are free closed source libraries including [http://www.freebarcodescanner.com/ Barcode Scanner], which read one- and two-dimensional barcodes on iPhone, Windows Mobile, Android, BlackBerry and Symbian smartphones.

==== Omni-directional barcode scanners ====
Omni-directional scanning uses "series of straight or curved scanning lines of varying directions in the form of a starburst, a [[Lissajous curve|lissajous pattern]], or other multiangle arrangement are projected at the symbol and one or more of them will be able to cross all of the symbol's bars and spaces, no matter what the orientation."<ref name="Palmer, Bar Code Book" >{{cite book
  |author=Roger C. Palmer 
  |title=The Bar Code Book
  |ref=Palmer, Bar Code Book
}}</ref>

Omni-directional scanners almost all use a laser. Unlike the simpler single-line laser scanners, they produce a pattern of beams in varying orientations allowing them to read barcodes presented to it at different angles. Most of them use a single rotating polygonal mirror and an arrangement of several fixed mirrors to generate their complex scan patterns.

Omni-directional scanners are most familiar through the horizontal scanners in supermarkets, where packages are slid across a glass or sapphire window. There are a range of different omni-directional units available which can be used for differing scanning applications, ranging from retail type applications with the barcodes read only a few centimetres away from the scanner to industrial conveyor scanning where the unit can be a couple of metres away or more from the code. Omni-directional scanners are also better at reading poorly printed, wrinkled, or even torn barcodes.

====Cell phone cameras====
While cell phone cameras without auto-focus are not ideal for reading some common barcode formats, there are 2D barcodes (such as [[Semacode]]) which are optimized for cell phones, as well as QR Codes and Data Matrix codes which can be read quickly and accurately with or without auto-focus.
These open up a number of applications for consumers:
* Movies: DVD/VHS movie catalogs
* Music: CD catalogs, play MP3 when scanned
* Book catalogs
* Groceries, nutrition information, making shopping lists when the last of an item is used, etc.
* Personal Property inventory (for insurance and other purposes)
* Calling cards: 2D barcodes can store contact information for importing.
* Brick and mortar shopping: Portable scanners can be used to record items of interest for looking up online at home.
* Coupon management: weeding expired coupons.
* Personal finance.   Receipts can be tagged with a barcode label and the barcode scanned into personal finance software when entering.  Later, scanned receipt images can then be automatically associated with the appropriate entries.   Later, the bar codes can be used to rapidly weed out paper copies not required to be retained for tax or asset inventory purposes.
* If retailers put barcodes on receipts that allowed downloading an electronic copy or encoded the entire receipt in a 2D barcode, consumers could easily import data into personal finance, property inventory, and grocery management software.   Receipts scanned on a scanner could be automatically identified and associated with the appropriate entries in finance and property inventory software.

A number of enterprise applications using cell phones are appearing:
* Access control (ex. ticket validation at venues), inventory reporting (ex. tracking deliveries), asset tracking (ex. anti-counterfeiting).<ref name="Barcode reading apps for enterprise" >Barcode reading apps for enterprise, codeREADr.com, 2010.</ref>

ZXing Barcode Scanner, an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platform application, is one example of a barcode reader that has been optimized to work with a cellphone camera. Big in Japan's ShopSavvy and Occipital's RedLaser, among others, are examples of barcode reader apps for the [[iPhone]] optimized to work with a cellphone camera. There are also a few other [[iPhone]] apps, which integrates barcode scanner into Google shopping web site.

=== Housing types ===

The reader packaging can be distinguished as follows :
;Handheld scanner: with a handle and typically a trigger button for switching on the light source.
;Pen scanner (or wand scanner): a pen-shaped scanner that is swiped.
;Stationary scanner: wall- or table-mounted scanners that the barcode is passed under or beside.  These are commonly found at the checkout counters of [[supermarket]]s and other [[retailer]]s.
;Fixed-position scanner: an industrial barcode reader used to identify products during manufacture or logistics.  Often used on conveyor tracks to identify cartons or pallets which need to be routed to another process or shipping location.  Another application joins [[holographic]] scanners with a [[checkweigher]] to read bar codes of any orientation or placement, and weighs the package.  Systems like this are used in factory and farm automation for [[quality management]] and shipping.
;PDA scanner (or Auto-ID PDA): a [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] with a built-in barcode reader or attached barcode scanner.
;Automatic reader: a back office equipment to read barcoded documents at high speed (50,000/hour).
;Cordless scanner (or Wireless scanner): a cordless barcode scanner is operated by a battery fitted inside it and is not connected to the electricity mains

== Methods of connection ==
=== Early serial interfaces ===
Early barcode scanners, of all formats, almost universally used the then-common [[RS232]] serial interface. This was an electrically simple means of connection and the software to access it is also relatively simple, although needing to be written for specific computers and their serial ports.

=== Proprietary interfaces ===
There are a few other less common interfaces. These were used in large [[Point of sale|EPOS]] systems with dedicated hardware, rather than attaching to existing commodity computers. In some of these interfaces, the scanning device returned a "raw" signal proportional to the intensities seen while scanning the barcode. This was then decoded by the host device. In some cases the scanning device would convert the symbology of the barcode to one that could be recognized by the host device, such as [[Code 39]].

=== Keyboard wedges ===
[[Image:Ps-2-ports.jpg|thumb|right|[[PS/2 connector|PS/2]] keyboard and mouse ports]]
With the popularity of the [[Personal computer|PC]] and its standard keyboard interface, it became ever easier to connect physical hardware to a PC and so there was commercial demand similarly to reduce the complexity of the associated software. "Keyboard wedge" hardware plugged between the PC and its normal keyboard, with characters from the barcode scanner appearing exactly as if they had been typed at the keyboard. This made the addition of simple barcode reading abilities to existing programs very easy, without any need to change them, although it did require some care by the user and could be restrictive in the content of the barcodes that could be handled.

===USB===
Later barcode readers began to use [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] connectors rather than the keyboard port, as this became a more convenient hardware option. To retain the easy integration with existing programs, a device driver called a "software wedge" could be used, to emulate the keyboard-impersonating behaviour of the old "keyboard wedge" hardware.

In many cases a choice of USB interface types ([[USB HID|HID]], CDC) are provided. Some have [[Powered USB]].

=== Wireless networking ===
Modern handheld barcode readers are operated in [[wireless network]]s according to [[IEEE 802.11g]] (WLAN) or [[IEEE 802.15.3]] ([[Bluetooth]]). However, such configuration limits the time of operation from [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[rechargeable battery]] and required recharging at least after a shift of operation.

== Resolution ==

The scanner resolution is measured by the size of the dot of light emitted by the reader. If this dot of light is wider than any bar or space in the bar code, then it will overlap two elements (two spaces or two bars) and it may produce wrong output. On the other hand, if a too small dot of light is used, then it can misinterpret any spot on the bar code making the final output wrong.

The most commonly used dimension is 13 [[Thou (unit of length)|mils]] (0.33 [[millimetre|mm]]), although some scanners can read codes with dimensions as small as 3 mils. Smaller bar codes must be printed at high resolution to be read accurately.
