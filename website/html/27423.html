<html> <head> <title>OpenRT</title></head><body>The goal of the "'''OpenRT''' Real Time Ray Tracing Project" is to develop [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] to the point where it offers an alternative to the current rasterization based approach for interactive 3D graphics. Therefore the project consists of several parts: a highly optimized ray tracing core, the OpenRT-[[API]], which is similar to [[OpenGL]], and many applications ranging from dynamically animated massive models and global illumination, via high quality prototype visualization to computer games.

OpenRT is not [[Open Source]]; it is intended to be an open API similar to [[OpenGL]].  There is a GPL implementation under development (see links).
