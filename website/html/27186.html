'''OmniFocus''' is a personal task manager by [[The Omni Group]] for [[Mac OS X]] and [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]]. The declared goal<ref name="OmniFocus Overview">OmniFocus Overview, http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/</ref> of the program is to be able to capture thoughts and ideas into [[to do list]]s.

The program uses concepts and techniques described in the book [[Getting Things Done]] (commonly abbreviated as GTD) by [[David Allen (author)|David Allen]].

== History ==
OmniFocus has its roots in the Kinkless kGTD add/scripts for the Omnigroups OmniOutliner product.<ref name='Oreilly Radar 2006-10-21'> {{cite web|url=http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/10/the-story-of-kgtd-and-omnifocu.html |title=The Story of KGTD and OmniFocus |accessdate=2009-01-13 |last=Forrest |first=Brady |date=2006-10-21 |publisher=OReilly Publishing }}</ref>  Kinkless (kGTD) was developed by Ethan J. A. Schoonover to enable those following the GTD methodology.  The Omni group subsequently brought Ethan along with [[Merlin Mann]] to form a project team to create the OmniFocus application.<ref name='Omni Group interview: part 1'> {{cite web|url=http://en.onsoftware.com/omnigroup-interview-part-1/ |title=The Story of KGTD and OmniFocus |accessdate=2009-01-13 |last=Roger |first=Cyril |date=2007-05-08 |publisher=onsoftware }}</ref>

== iPod Touch/iPhone/iPad version ==
OmniFocus is available on several Apple products, including the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad. The iPod Touch/iPhone version is necessarily not as feature complete as the desktop version.  Synchronization between the two versions is reported to be both reliable and predictable.  It is possible to successfully use the iPod Touch/iPhone version as a standalone GTD tool, with no need to purchase the desktop version.  Ken Case, chairman and CEO of OmniGroup has been quoted as saying that the "iPhone version of OmniFocus was not to be merely a companion to the desktop version".<ref name='Ars Omnifocus preview'> {{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/06/15/ars-at-wwdc-preview-of-omnifocus-for-the-iphone |title=Ars at WWDC: Preview of OmniFocus for the iPhone |accessdate=2009-01-13 |last=Ecker |first=Clint |date=2008-06-15 |publisher=Ars Technica }}</ref>

The Omni Group released a new version of OmniFocus for the Apple [[iPad]] on July 30th, 2010.<ref name='OmniFocus announcement'> {{cite web|url=http://www.omnigroup.com/blog/entry/omnifocus_for_ipad_now_available_on_the_app_store_hallelujah/ |title=OmniFocus for iPad now available on the App Store (hallelujah!) |accessdate=2010-08-29 |last=Sharps |first=Linda |date=2010-07-30 |publisher=The Omni Group }}</ref>
