<html> <head> <title>Bit cell</title></head><body>A '''bit cell''' is the length of [[magnetic tape|tape]], the area of [[disk storage|disc]] surface, or the part of an [[integrated circuit]] in which a single [[bit]] is recorded. The smaller the bit cells are, the better the [[memory storage density|storage density]] of the medium is.

In [[magnetic storage]], the [[magnetic flux]] or [[magnetization]] doesn't necessarily change at the boundaries of bit cells to indicate bit states. For example, the presence of a magnetic transition within a bit cell might record state 1, and the lack of such a transition might record state 0. Other [[code|encoding]]s are also possible.
