'''DELOS''' was a medium sized European research project ([[Network of Excellence]]) concerned with [[Digital library|digital libraries]], partially funded by the [[Sixth Framework Programme|European Commission Sixth Framework Programme]] within the [[Information Society Technologies|Information Society Technologies Programme (IST)]]. The activities of DELOS project were initiated with the DELOS Working Group in late 1990s and the DELOS Thematic Network (2001â€“2003, under the [[Fifth Framework Programme]]). The project finished in the end of 2007.

==Project Objectives==

The main objective of DELOS was [[research]], results of which were supposed to be placed in the [[public domain]], but the project did not result in such scientific publications [http://www.delos.info/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=495&Itemid=263].

Another objective was [[technology transfer]], through cooperation with interested parties.

The objective was to develop dynamic ubiquitous knowledge environments, which will transform research and education at all levels by collecting, organizing and making publicly accessible on-line vast quantities of information.

All citizens, anywhere, anytime, should have access to [[Internet]]-connected devices to search all of human knowledge, regardless of barriers of time, place, culture or language. [[digital library|Digital libraries]] will enable anyone from their home, school or office to access the knowledge contained in the digital collections created by traditional libraries, museums, archives, universities, governmental agencies, specialised organizations, and individuals around the world. The digital libraries will not only will offer [[digital]] versions of traditional library, museum and archive holdings including text, documents, video, sound and images, but they will also provide technological capabilities that will enable users to work collaboratively through [[annotation]]s and [[shared resource|sharing of resources]], to refine their requests, analyse the results and access collections in various languages.

DELOS attempted to integrate the research of several European teams working in digital library related areas.

Its main objective and goal was to develop the next generation of digital library technologies by:
* defining unifying and comprehensive theories and frameworks over the life-cycle of digital library information;
* building interoperable [[multimodality|multimodal]] and multilingual [[web services]] and integrated [[content management]] ranging from the personal to the global for the specialist and the general population;
* developing generic digital library technology to be incorporated into industrial-strength [[Digital Library Management Systems]], offering advanced functionality through reliable and extensible [[web services]];
* networking and structuring European research on digital libraries to consolidate an emerging community;
* supporting an exchange program of researchers and providing a forum where researchers, practitioners, and representatives of the application communities can exchange ideas and experiences;
* promoting cooperation between European and national digital library initiatives and improving international cooperation in digital library research areas.

The ultimate goal was to provide access to human knowledge from anywhere and any time and in an efficient and [[user-friendly]] fashion. DELOS also attempted providing access to technological know-how, services, [[testbed]]s, and the necessary expertise to facilitate their take-up.

==Project activities==

The potential exists for [[digital libraries]] to become the universal knowledge repositories and communication conduits, through which information in all forms can be accessed, discussed, and enhanced.{{Dubious|date=July 2010}} In order to fulfil this role, the digital libraries require research{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} in several key areas pointing to the development of:
* user-centred system design methodology;
* pro-active systems with functionality that facilitates collaboration, communication, and information creation;
* generic digital library management systems that provide basic system infrastructures that can be used to implement application specific digital libraries incorporating context-specific [[web services]].

The project focused in the following research activities:
* digital library architecture: the conceptual and experimental evaluation of the impact of [[peer-to-peer]] [[data management]], [[grid computing]] [[middleware]] and [[service-oriented architecture]]s on a digital library architecture in order to reveal the advantages and disadvantages of either approach.
* information access and personalization, aiming at developing a uniform understanding among researchers concerning available practices in the fields of [[information access]] and [[personalization]] in [[digital libraries]], by building and promoting a common and comprehensive framework to serve as a reference point and to stimulate research.
* audio/visual and non-traditional objects: to establish a common ground of knowledge for European researchers about the state of the art, the research directions and important new applications for digital libraries with [[audio-visual]] and non-traditional objects, as well as to advance the state of the art in these areas.
* user interfaces and visualization, intended to developing methodologies, techniques and tools to enable future digital libraries designers and developers to meet not only the technological, but also the user-oriented requirements in a balanced way.
* knowledge extraction and semantic interoperability intended to explore the potential of new models, algorithms, methodologies and processes in a variety of technical applications, institutional frameworks and cross-sectoral environments, which will lead to the creation of guidelines and recommendations of best practice concerning knowledge extraction and [[semantic interoperability]].
* preservation: supposed to provide the methodological framework and theory for ensuring that digital libraries research addresses [[digital preservation|preservation]] issues and digital libraries incorporate preservation elements in their designs.
* evaluation - to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for digital libraries [[evaluation]], by researching new methodologies and corresponding toolkits and test-beds in order to enable new evaluations and to ease the application of standard evaluation methods.

Among its cross-cluster activities, DELOS attempted to develop a Digital Library Reference Model [http://www.delos.info/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=345] aiming at providing a conceptual framework for the new research field laying at the intersection of the many diverse disciplines involved in digital libraries ([[data management]], [[information retrieval]], [[document management system]], [[information systems]], the [[World Wide Web|web]], [[image processing]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[human-computer interaction]], mass-storage systems, etc.), and on a globally integrated prototype implementation of a digital library management system, DelosDLMS [http://www.delos.info/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=502], which would serve as a partial implementation of the reference model, encompassing several software components developed by the project partners.

In addition to workshops dedicated to specific research topics, DELOS sponsored an annual conference known as the [[European Conference on Digital Libraries]], a major European event focusing on digital libraries and associated technical, practical and social issues. As for [[education]] and [[technology transfer]], DELOS organized summer schools on key aspects of digital library maintenance (e.g. preservation, access to multimedia objects, library studies).
