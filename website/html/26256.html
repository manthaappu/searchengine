<html> <head> <title>Neurally controlled animat</title></head><body>A '''Neurally Controlled Animat''' is the conjunction of
#a [[cultured neuronal networks|cultured neuronal network]]
#a virtual body, the [[Animat]], "living" in a [[Virtual_reality|virtual computer generated environment]], connected to this array
Patterns of neural activity are used to control the virtual body, and the computer is used as a sensory device to provide electrical feedback to the neural network about the Animat's movement in the virtual environment.

The current aim of the Animat research is to study the [[neuron|neuronal]] activity and plasticity when learning and processing information in order to find a [[mathematical model]] for the neural network.

It leads towards interesting questions about [[consciousness]] theories as well.
