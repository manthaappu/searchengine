==The DMCA case==
{{main article|US v. ElcomSoft Sklyarov}}

On July 16, 2001, [[Dmitry Sklyarov]], a Russian citizen employed by ElcomSoft who was at the time visiting the United States for [[DEF CON (convention) | DEF CON]], was arrested and jailed for allegedly violating the [[United States]] [[DMCA]] law by writing ElcomSoft's Advanced eBook Processor software.  A landmark court case ensued, setting precedents and attracting much public attention and protest.  On December 17, 2002, ElcomSoft was found not guilty of all four charges under the DMCA. [[Bruce Chizen]], CEO of [[Adobe Systems]], had this to say to [[CNET]]:<ref>[http://www.elcomsoft.com/aebpr.html ELCOMSOFT: Advanced eBook Processing Software<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

<blockquote>''Looking back with 20/20, I wish that we could have had better communication with ElcomSoft, Dmitry Sklyarov and the EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) before the whole thing went public. I'm sorry that we weren't able to do that, because I think we could have resolved a lot of the issues.''</blockquote>
