The '''BMF file format''', is an [[image file format]] used to store [vector] [[digital image]]s, specifically clipart, by several [[Legacy system|legacy]] [[Corel]] applications; notably Corel's Windows 3.1-based Gallery Clipart applications.  The BMF file extension is also used by an architecture design program called '''FloorPlan 3D''' by [http://imsidesign.com/Default.aspx IMSI].  It was developed by CADSOFT Corporation, and the copyright in 1998 by IMSI shows '''FloorPlan 3D''' with a version of 4.10.

However, the Corel format was proprietary and, to our knowledge, has never been released publicly. Consequently, very little information exists about the BMF format. As of 2004, per a conversation with Corel's technical support group, Corel had discontinued support for the BMF format (ie, by dropping support for the Clipart Gallery applications which used that format) and had no further plans to support it any subsequent Corel applications.

Logipole's Konvertor at http://www.konvertor.net/indexe.html and Pierre Gougelet's XnView at http://pagesperso-orange.fr/pierre.g/xnview/enxnview.html are able only to convert the preview thumbnails and open them for viewing. The quality of the preview image, however, is very poor.

== BMF file header ==

This block of bytes is added and serves for identification. A typical application will read this block first to ensure that the file is actually a BMF file. [http://filext.com/ FILExt] reports that the file header is [http://filext.com/file-extension/BMF Hex: 81 8A].

== Color palette ==

The color palette of the BMF format is known. Likely it is 8-bit color based on the known clipart examples.

== Vector data ==

The BMF format is proprietary and has not been (to our knowledge) released publicly.

== Usage of BMF format ==

Usage of the BMF format was fairly limited. Only the Corel Clipart Gallery and Corel Flow products were known to have used this format. Neither product nor the format was supported after Windows 95 was released making the format an orphan.

== Related formats ==

None that we are aware of.
