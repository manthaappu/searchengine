[[Image:Image in Glossographia.png|thumb|right|Definition of ''image'' and ''imagery'', from [[Thomas Blount (lexicographer)|Thomas Blount's]] ''Glossographia Anglicana Nova'', 1707.]]

An '''image''' (from [[Latin]] ''imago'') is an artifact, for example a two-dimensional '''picture''', that has a similar appearance to some [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]&mdash;usually a physical object or a [[person]].  

==Characteristics==
Images may be two -[[dimension]]al, such as a [[photograph]], screen display, and as well as a three-dimensional, such as a [[statue]] or [[hologram]]. They may be ''captured'' by [[optics|optical]] devices&mdash;such as [[camera]]s, [[mirror]]s, [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], [[telescope]]s, [[microscope]]s, etc. and natural objects and phenomena, such as the human [[eye]] or water surfaces. 
                 
The word ''image'' is also used in the broader sense of any two-dimensional figure such as a [[map]], a [[Graph (data structure)|graph]], a [[pie chart]], or an [[abstract art|abstract painting]]. In this wider sense, images can also be ''rendered'' manually, such as by [[drawing]],  [[painting]], [[Wikt:carving|carving]], rendered automatically by [[printing]] or [[computer graphics]] technology, or [[Image development (visual arts)|developed]] by a combination of methods, especially in a [[pseudo-photograph]].

A volatile image is one that exists only for a short period of time. This may be a reflection of an object by a mirror, a projection of a [[camera obscura]], or a scene displayed on a [[cathode ray tube]].  A fixed image, also called a [[hard copy]],  is one that has been recorded on a material object, such as [[paper]] or [[textile]] by [[photography]] or digital processes.  

A [[mental image]] exists in an individual's mind: something one remembers or imagines.  The subject of an image need not be real; it may be an abstract concept, such as a [[graph theory|graph]], function, or  "imaginary" entity.
For example, [[Sigmund Freud]] claimed to have dreamed purely in aural-images of dialogs.  The development of synthetic acoustic technologies and the creation of [[sound art]] have led to a consideration of the possibilities of a sound-image made up of irreducible phonic substance beyond linguistic or musicological analysis.

A still image is a single [[wiktionary:static|static]] image, as distinguished from a moving image (see below).  This phrase is used in [[photography]], visual [[Electronic media|media]] and the [[computer industry]] to emphasize that one is not talking about movies, or in very precise or pedantic technical writing such as a [[Standardization|standard]].

A [[film still]] is a photograph taken on the set of a movie or television program during production, used for promotional purposes.

==Moving image==

A ''moving image'' is typically a movie ([[film]]), or [[video]], including [[digital video]].  It could also be an animated display such as a [[zoetrope]].
