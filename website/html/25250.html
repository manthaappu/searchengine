<html> <head> <title>Multi-entry key</title></head><body>In biology or medicine, a '''multi-entry key''' is an [[identification key]] that allows the free choice of characters only in the first step. Whereas in a typical [[multi-access key]] the choice of characters used for identification can be repeated multiple times (reducing the number of remaining taxa each time), in literally multi-''entry'' keys only the first step involves a free choice of characters. Examples for multi-entry keys are the keys created by the [[FRIDA]] software, where a single step of selecting one or multiple criteria is followed by a dichotomous key for the species remaining after this step. Several '''multi-entry keys''' are available in the pages of project ''Dryades'', section ''identification tools''.
