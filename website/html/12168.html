'''Engineering samples''' are the [[beta version]]s of [[CPU]]s that are meant to be used for compatibility qualification or as demonstrators<ref>[http://www.intel.com/support/processors/sb/CS-030747.htm Intel's Information about Intel Engineering / Qualification Sample Processors]</ref>. They are usually loaned to OEM manufacturers prior to the chips commercial release to allow product development/display. Usually, they are picked out of a very large bunch and perform well. However, rarely they may have flaws that were fixed in the production model. {{Fact|date=June 2010}}

Such samples are usually handed out under [[NDA|Non-disclosure]] or other confidential agreement.

Old engineering models, such as Pentium IV ES chips were rare and favoured for having unlocked multipliers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.techarp.com/showarticle.aspx?artno=407|title=Why You Should AVOID Intel Core 2 Engineering Samples}}</ref> More recently, Core 2 ES chips have become more common and popular. Sellers from Asia were selling volume purchased Core 2 ES chips at major profit. Some Engineering samples have been put through strenuous tests{{Fact|date=October 2009}}.
