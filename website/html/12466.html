'''Ervand George Kogbetliantz''' ({{lang-hy|Երվանդ Գէորգ Կոգբետլյանց}}; Born February 22, 1888 in Armenia &ndash; died of cancer in 1974 in Paris, France) 
Dr. Kogbetliantz was an Armenian/American mathematician and the first president of the [[Yerevan State University]]. He left Russia in 1918. He received a Doctorate in mathematics from the [[University of Paris]] in 1923. His mathematical work was mainly on [[infinite series]], on the theory of [[orthogonal polynomials]], on an algorithm for [[singular value decomposition]] which bears his name, on algorithms for the evaluation of elementary functions in computers, and on the enumeration of [[Prime_element#Divisibility.2C_prime_and_irreducible_elements|prime elements]] of the [[Gaussian integers]].  He also invented a [[Three-dimensional chess|three-dimensional version of chess]], and was working at his death with Bobby Fischer on a game of chess for three people. When he first came to America (1941) he taught Mathematics at [[Lehigh University]].  In the early 1950s he was a consultant for IBM in New York City and taught at Columbia University.  Prior to moving back to Paris and retiring he was a professor at [[Rockefeller University]].
