'''Windows Services for UNIX''' ('''SFU''') or '''Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications (SUA)''' is a software package produced by [[Microsoft]] which provides a [[Unix]] subsystem and other parts of a full Unix environment on [[Windows NT]] and some of its immediate successor operating-systems. The subsystem included, called [[Interix]], was acquired by Microsoft in 1999 from US-based Softway Systems as part of an asset acquisition.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1999/sept99/softwaypr.mspx  Microsoft Acquires Softway Systems to Strengthen Future Customer Interoperability Solutions, Sep 17, 1999, Press Release, Microsoft Corporation</ref>. These are available free from Microsoft as a download (in the case of SFU) or as part of the Windows OS distribution (in the case of SUA).

Like the [[Microsoft POSIX subsystem]] in Windows NT that it replaces, [[Interix]] is not an emulation of a Unix [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]], but rather an implementation of a [[user-mode]] subsystem running directly on top of the [[Architecture of Windows NT|Windows NT kernel]].

Windows Services for Unix and Subsystem for Unix-based Applications provide header files and libraries that make it easier to recompile or port Unix applications for use on Windows; they do not make Unix binaries compatible with Windows binaries. It is best thought of as a distinct [[Unix-like]] platform.

==Overview==
The current version of SFU contains:
* Over 350 [[Unix]] utilities such as [[vi]], [[Korn shell|ksh]], [[C shell|csh]], [[ls]], [[Cat (Unix)|cat]], [[awk]], [[grep]], [[Kill (Unix)|kill]], etc.
* [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] 3.3 compiler, includes and libraries (through an MS libc)
* A cc-like wrapper {{Clarify|cc?|date=September 2010}} for [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] command-line C/C++ compiler
* [[GNU Debugger|GDB]] debugger
* [[Perl]]
* [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] server and client
* A pcnfsd {{Clarify|date=September 2010}} daemon
* [[X Window system|X11]] tools and libraries
* Tools for making NFS mount-points appear as Windows shares, and vice-versa (''gateway'' services)
* An [[Network Information Service|NIS]] server capability linked with Active Directory (AD)
* Some Windows/Unix authentication information-synchronization tools

ABC

SFU does not contain the following (but binaries are available for separate installation<ref name = "Interop">[http://www.suacommunity.com/tool_warehouse.htm  Tool Warehouse for Interix, SFU & Subsystem for Unix-based Applications (SUA)], Interop Community</ref>):

* [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], [[OpenSSH]], [[sudo]], [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]], [[ClamAV]], [[bzip2]], [[gmake]], [[CURL|curl]], [[emacs]], [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]], [[XView]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Tcl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]]

Although SFU includes [[X Window System]] client libraries and applications, it does not contain a native X server. Any of the numerous third-party Windows X servers can be used. Fully-featured free alternatives include [[Cygwin/X]], [[Xming]], [http://www.tam.cornell.edu/Computer.old/remoteaccess/weirdmind/ WeirdMind] and [[WeirdX]].

==Releases==
=== SFU 1.0 ===
Microsoft produced at least one beta release of the initial version of SFU before its final release in February 1999. This release, in [[English language|English]] only, was supported on the [[Windows NT 4.0]] SP3+ for [[x86 architecture|x86]] and [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] platforms. This is the only known release to support Alpha. It included a demonstration version of the [[MKS Toolkit]] along with the following components:
* [[TELNET|Telnet]] server
* Telnet client
* UNIX Utilities (from [[MKS Inc.|MKS]])
* Client for [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]]
* Server for NFS
* Server for NFS Authentication
* Windows NT to UNIX password-synchronization
* Help files and documentation

===SFU 2.0===
This second installment of SFU was released April 2000 and was also for English; however, a [[Japanese-language]] release appeared just two months later in June 2000. Both ran on Windows NT 4.0 SP4+ and [[Windows 2000]] on x86 platforms with [[Internet Explorer]] 4.01+. SFU 2.0 supported the following UNIX versions: [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] 2.6+, [[HP-UX]] 10.2+, [[IBM AIX (operating system)|AIX]] 4.2+, [[Tru64 UNIX]] 5.0+, and [[Red Hat Linux]] 5.1+. It included the following components:
* Server for [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] (NFSServer)
* Client for NFS (NFSClient)
* Gateway for NFS (NFSGateway)
* Server for PCNFS (Pcnfsd)
* User Name Mapping (Mapsvc)
* Server for NFS Authentication (NFSServerAuth)
* Server for [[Network Information Service|NIS]] (NIS)
* [[TELNET|Telnet]] Client (TelnetClient)
* Telnet server (TelnetServer)
* Password synchronization (PasswdSync)
* [[ActiveState]] ActivePerl (Perl)
* UNIX utilities (UnixUtilities)
* [[Cron]] service (CronSvc)
* [[Remote Shell|Rsh]] service (RshSvc)

===SFU 3.0===
This version, released in May 2002, was the first release to include the [[Interix]] subsystem. Previously Microsoft had released Interix 2.2 (actually version 2.2.5) as a separate product around the same time frame as SFU 2.0. This SFU release included Interix release 3.0 (commonly called the "version" as reported by '''uname -r''') with an internal Microsoft version of 7.0 that relates to internal build sequences. This Interix release contained significant technical extensions from the Interix 2.2 release such as a rooted file system and setuid functionality that were entirely based on the Softway Systems' [[Interix]] development codenamed "Firebrand". This was also released in English and followed by a later release in Japanese in October 2002, adding [[Internationalization and localization|internationalization]] support. Both supported Windows NT 4.0 SP6a+, Windows 2000, and [[Windows XP]] Professional on x86 platforms with Internet Explorer 5.0+. The MKS Toolkit was no longer included. It included the following components:
* Base Utilities for Interix (BaseUtils; including [[X Window System|X11R5]] utilities)
* UNIX Perl for Interix (UNIXPerl)
* Interix SDK (InterixSDK; including headers and libraries for development and a wrapper for [[Microsoft Visual Studio|Visual Studio]] compiler)
* GNU Utilities for Interix (GNUUtils, about 9 utilities in total)
* GNU SDK for Interix (GNUSDK; including [[GNU Compiler Collection|gcc]] and g++)
* NFS Client for Windows (NFSClient)
* NFS Gateway for Windows (NFSGateway)
* NFS Server for Windows (NFSServer)
* NIS Server for Windows (NIS)
* Password Synchronization (PasswdSync)
* Windows Remote Shell Service (RshSvc)
* Telnet Server for Windows (TelnetServer)
* NFS User Name Mapping (Mapsvc)
* NFS Authentication Server (NFSServerAuth)
* PCNFS Server (Pcnfsd)
* ActiveState Perl (Perl)

===SFU 3.5===
This was the final release of SFU and the only release to be distributed free of charge. It was released January 2004 and included both English and Japanese versions for Windows 2000, Windows XP Professional, and [[Windows Server 2003]] on x86 platforms with Internet Explorer 5.0+. It included Interix subsystem release 3.5 (build version 8.0) adding internationalization support (at least for the English version which did not have such until now) and [[POSIX Threads|POSIX threading]]. This release could only be installed to an [[NTFS]] [[file system]] (earlier versions supported [[File Allocation Table|FAT]]; this was for improved file-security requirements in Interix 3.5). The following UNIX versions were supported for NFS components: Solaris 7 and 8, Red Hat Linux 8.0, AIX 5L 5.2, and HP-UX 11i. It included the following components:
* Base Utilities for Interix (BaseUtils; including X11R6 and X11R5 utilities)
* UNIX Perl for Interix (UNIXPerl)
* Interix SDK (InterixSDK; including headers and libraries for development and a wrapper for Visual Studio compiler)
* GNU Utilities for Interix (GNUUtils, again about 9 utilities)
* GNU SDK for Interix (GNUSDK; including gcc and g++)
* NFS Client for Windows (NFSClient)
* NFS Gateway for Windows (NFSGateway)
* NFS Server for Windows (NFSServer)
* NIS Server for Windows (NIS)
* Password synchronization (PasswdSync)
* Windows Remote Shell Service (RshSvc)
* Telnet Server for Windows (TelnetServer)
* NFS User Name Mapping (Mapsvc)
* NFS Authentication Server (NFSServerAuth)
* PCNFS server (Pcnfsd)
* ActiveState Perl (Perl)

===Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications (SUA)===
[[Windows Server 2003|Windows Server 2003 R2]] contains most SFU components, namely Microsoft Services for Network File System (NFS), Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications (SUA, aka [[Interix]]), and Identity Management for UNIX.<ref name = "MS">[http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/R2/unixcomponents/default.mspx Microsoft Windows Server 2003 R2 UNIX Interoperability Components], Microsoft</ref>

[[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]] Enterprise and Ultimate Editions also contain the Services for Unix components, now called the Subsystem for UNIX-based applications (SUA), and Client for NFS v3. Users must download the utilities and SDK separately. However, the server components from the SFU product line (namely Server for NFS, User Name Mapping, Server for NIS, Password Synchronization etc.) are not included<ref>[http://blogs.msdn.com/sfu/archive/2007/05/01/unix-interoperability-and-windows-vista.aspx UNIX Interoperability and Windows Vista], Published 01 May 2007, Ashish, Services for UNIX - Interoperability Blog, MSDN Blogs</ref>–these are included in Server editions of Windows (i.e. Windows Server 2008).

Microsoft does not intend to produce any further standalone versions of the product. As of September 22, 2010 v3.5 is still downloadable<ref name = "Download">[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=896c9688-601b-44f1-81a4-02878ff11778&DisplayLang=en  Download details: Windows Services for UNIX Version 3.5], Date Published: 9/21/2006, Microsoft
</ref>. General support will continue until 2011; extended support until 2014.<ref name = "Watch">[http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,2180,1855248,00.asp It's the End of the Line for Microsoft's Services for Unix Product], September 1, 2005, Microsoft Watch, eWeek</ref>

==Known problems==
Character translation must be used to accommodate filenames which include a colon (:) or other characters that do not comply with the naming conventions of Windows file-systems. Files with the same name but different cases are also not allowed by default, but can be enabled on installation with the side-effect of making the underlying partition's filesystem case-sensitive<ref>[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb463214.aspx  Windows Services for UNIX 3.5 White Paper], April 22, 2004, Charlie Russel, Microsoft Corporation</ref><ref>[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb496994.aspx Chapter 1: Introduction to Windows Services for UNIX 3.5], Published: May 31, 2006, Microsoft Corporation</ref>, even for the Win32 subsystem.  In addition, authentication for UNIX systems relies on the insecure NIS protocol (LDAP- and Kerberos-based authentication require a third-party solution).

Microsoft has released several [[hotfix]]es for Windows Services for UNIX, but no service packs. The GNU utilities are several versions older than the latest ones.
