* see abstract here http://locus.siam.org/SINUM/volume-25/art_0725014.html

It is built out of many [[elementary reflector]]s.

It is also referred to as a [[triangular factor]], and is a [[triangular matrix]] and they are used in the [[Householder transformation]].

A reflector <math> Q </math> belonging to <math>\mathcal M_n(\R) </math> can be written in the form :
<math> Q = I -auu^T  </math> where <math>I</math> is the [[identity matrix]] for <math>\mathcal M_n(\R) </math> , <math>a</math> is a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] and <math>u</math> belongs to <math>\mathcal \R^n </math> .

==LAPACK routines==
Here are some of the [[LAPACK]] routines that apply to block reflectors
* "*larft" forms the triangular vector T of a block reflector H=I-VTVH.
* "*larzb" applies a block reflector or its [[transpose]]/[[conjugate transpose]] as returned by "*tzrzf" to a general [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].
* "*larzt" forms the triangular vector T of a block reflector H=I-VTVH as returned by "*tzrzf".
* "*larfb" applies a block reflector or its [[transpose]]/[[conjugate transpose]] to a general rectangular matrix.
