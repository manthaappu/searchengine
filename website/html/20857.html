'''''Kryptos''''' is a [[sculpture]] by [[United States|American]] artist [[Jim Sanborn]] located on the grounds of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) in [[Langley, Virginia|Langley]], [[Virginia]]. Since its dedication on November 3, 1990, there has been much speculation about the meaning of the [[cryptography|encrypted]] messages it bears. Of the four sections, three have been solved, with the fourth remaining one of the most famous [[unsolved codes]] in the world.  The sculpture continues to provide a diversion for some employees of the CIA and other [[cryptanalyst]]s attempting to decrypt the messages.

== Description ==
The main sculpture is made of red and green [[slate]], white [[quartz]], [[petrified wood]], [[lodestone]], and [[copper]], and is located in the northwest corner of the New Headquarters Building courtyard, outside of the Agency cafeteria. 

The name ''Kryptos'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word for "hidden", and the theme of the sculpture is "intelligence gathering." The most prominent feature is a large vertical S-shaped copper screen resembling a scroll, or piece of paper emerging from a computer printer, covered with characters comprising encrypted text. The characters consist of the 26 letters of the standard Roman alphabet and question marks cut out of the copper. This "inscription" contains four separate enigmatic messages, three of which have been solved.<ref name=secrets/>

At the same time as the main sculpture was installed, sculptor [[Jim Sanborn|Sanborn]] also placed several other pieces around [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] grounds, such as several large granite slabs with sandwiched copper sheets outside the entrance to the New Headquarters Building. Several [[morse code]] messages are engraved in the copper, and one of the slabs has an engraved [[compass rose]]. Other elements of Sanborn's installation include a landscaped area, a duck pond, and several other seemingly unmarked slabs.

The cost of the sculpture was $250,000.<ref name="FAQ"/>

== Encrypted messages ==
The ciphertext on one half of the main sculpture contains 869 characters in total — in April 2006, however, Sanborn released information stating that an intended letter on the main half of ''Kryptos'' was missing. This would bring the total number of characters to 870 on the main portion. The other half of the sculpture comprises a [[Vigenère cipher|Vigenère]] encryption tableau, comprising 869 characters, if spaces are counted. 

Sanborn worked with a retiring CIA employee named [[Ed Scheidt]], Chairman of the CIA Cryptographic Center, to come up with the cryptographic systems used on the sculpture. Sanborn has revealed that the sculpture contains a riddle within a riddle, which will be solvable only after the four encrypted passages have been decrypted. He said that he gave the complete solution at the time of the sculpture's dedication to then-CIA director [[William Hedgcock Webster|William H. Webster]]. Sanborn said, however, that he had not given Webster the entire solution. He did, however, confirm that where in part 2 it says "Who knows the exact location? Only WW," that "WW" was intended to refer to William Webster. Sanborn also confirmed that should he die before the entire sculpture becomes deciphered that there will be someone able to confirm the solution.<ref>Zetter, Kim. [http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2005/01/66333 "Questions for Kryptos' Creator,"] ''Wired'' (January 20, 2005).</ref>

== Solvers ==
Over the years, only three individuals have uncovered parts of the solutions. The first person to publicly announce solving the first three sections, in 1999, was [[James Gillogly]], a [[computer scientist]] from southern [[California]]. He and others thought at the time that he had correctly deciphered the sections K1, K2 and K3. After Gillogly's announcement, the CIA revealed that their analyst David Stein had also thought he had solved the same sections in 1998, using pencil and paper techniques, though at the time of his solution the information was only disseminated within the intelligence community, and no public announcement was made. The [[National Security Agency|NSA]] also claimed at that time that they had solvers, but would not reveal names or dates until 2005, when it was learned that a [[National Security Agency|NSA]] team led by Ken Miller, along with Dennis McDaniels and two other unnamed individuals, had thought they had solved parts 1&ndash;3 using a computer in late 1992. All of these early attempts to solve Kryptos presumed that K2 ended with WESTIDBYROWS.  They were mistaken.

It wasn't until [[October 10]], [[2005]]<ref>[http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/Kryptos/message/3719?threaded=1&l=1 Message 3719, posted to the Yahoo Kryptos group]</ref>, that Ms. [[Monet Friedrich]], a computer engineer from [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] came across the character sequence LAYERTWO at the end of K2.<ref>[http://sites.google.com/site/sarenasix/home From a radio interview on BellCoreRadio, season 1, episode 32, Barcode Brothers]</ref>

To clarify..
Where all earlier attempts proposed that K2 ended with the plain text
:...FOUR SECONDS WEST IDBYROWS,
Monet discovered that K2 ended with the plain text
:...FOUR SECONDS WEST X LAYERTWO.

Monet's revelation came six months before [[Jim Sanborn]] announced an error.  This 'error' served to confirm Monet's find.

== Solutions ==
The following are the solutions of parts 1&ndash;3 of the sculpture.<ref>[http://www.elonka.com/kryptos/mirrors/cypherpunks/1999/0930.html Kryptos: The Sanborn Sculpture at CIA Headquarters]</ref> Misspellings present in the code are included as-is. Kryptos K1 and K2 ciphers are polyalphabetic substitution, using a [[Vigenère cipher|Vigenere Tableau]] similar to the tableau on the other half of the sculpture. K3 is a [[transposition cipher]], and K4 is still unsolved.

ONLY WW THIS WAS HIS LAST MESSAGE X THIRTY EIGHT DEGREES FIFTY SEVEN MINUTES SIX POINT FIVE SECONDS NORTH SEVENTY SEVEN DEGREES EIGHT MINUTES FORTY FOUR SECONDS WEST X LAYER TWO

On April 19, 2006, Sanborn contacted the [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Kryptos Kryptos Group] (an online community dedicated to the Kryptos puzzle) to inform them that the accepted solution to part 2 was wrong. He said that he made an error in the sculpture by omitting an "X" used to indicate a break for aesthetic reasons, and that the decrypted text which ended "...FOUR SECONDS WEST ID BY ROWS" should actually be "...FOUR SECONDS WEST X LAYER TWO".<ref>[http://www.elonka.com/kryptos/CorrectedK2Announcement.html The Kryptos Group announces a corrected answer to Kryptos Part 2]</ref>

The point is about 200 feet southwest of the sculpture itself.<ref name=secrets/>

This is a paraphrased and misspelled quotation from [[Howard Carter (archaeologist)|Howard Carter]]'s account of the opening of the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] on November 26, 1922, as described in his 1923 book ''The Tomb of Tutankhamun''. The question with which it ends is that posed by [[George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]], to which Carter (in the book) famously replied "wonderful things". In the actual November 26, 1922 field notes, his reply was, "Yes, it is wonderful."<ref>[http://www.ashmolean.org/gri/4tut.html Tutankhamun: Anatomy of an Excavation]</ref>

=== Solution 4 ===
Part 4 remains unsolved, though there is an active [[Yahoo! Groups|Yahoo! Group]]<ref>[http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/kryptos/ Kryptos Yahoo! Group]</ref> (formed in 2003) that coordinates the work of over 2000 members toward decryption of the code.

To solve it, it is crucial to have the first three sections correct, since when commenting on his error in section 2, Sanborn said they contain the clues to the last section.<ref>[http://www.wired.com/news/technology/1,70701-1.html Typo Confounds Kryptos Sleuths]</ref> In November 2010, Jim Sanborn released a clue that letters 64-69 NYPVTT equals the word BERLIN. He also mentioned the word "directions" in an NPR interview claiming he needs to "stop talking before he says too much."<ref> [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/us/21code.html?hp Artist releases clue to Kryptos]

== Related sculptures ==
''Kryptos'' is the first cryptographic sculpture made by Sanborn. After ''Kryptos'', however, he went on to make several other sculptures with codes and other types of writing, including one called ''[[Antipodes (sculpture)|Antipodes]]'' which is at the [[Hirshhorn Museum]] in Washington, D.C., an "Untitled Kryptos Piece" which was sold to a private collector, and a ''[[Cyrillic Projector]]'' with encrypted [[Cyrillic alphabet|Russian]] text, which included an extract from a classified [[KGB]] document. The cipher on one side of ''Antipodes'' repeats the text from CIA's ''Kryptos''. Much of the cipher on its Russian side is duplicated on the ''Cyrillic Projector''. The Russian portion of the cipher on the ''Cyrillic Projector'' and ''Antipodes'' was solved in 2003 after [[Elonka Dunin]] "led the charge",<ref>[http://www.elonka.com/mirrors/STL/sights.html Woman sets sights on code on CIA sculpture]</ref> with the [[ciphertext]] independently decrypted by Frank Corr and Mike Bales, and [[plaintext]] translation from Russian provided by Dunin.<ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol302/issue5643/r-samples.dtl Cyrillic Riddle Solved] [[Science (journal)|Science]], vol 302, 10 Oct. 2003, page 224</ref>

== Pop culture references ==
The dust jacket of the US version of [[Dan Brown]]'s novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' contains two references to ''Kryptos'': One on the back cover (coordinates printed light red on dark red, vertically next to the blurbs) is a reference to the coordinates mentioned in the plaintext of part 2 (see above), except the degrees digit is off by one. When Brown and his publisher were asked about this, they both gave the same reply: "The discrepancy is intentional." The other reference is hidden in the brown "tear" artwork&mdash;upside-down words which say "Only WW knows." These are another reference to Kryptos Part 2.<ref name="FAQ">[http://elonka.com/kryptos/faq.html FAQ About Kryptos]</ref> 

''Kryptos'' is one of the themes in Dan Brown's 2009 novel, ''[[The Lost Symbol]]''.<ref name=secrets>''Secrets of the Lost Symbol'', pp.319&ndash;326</ref>

A small version of ''Kryptos'' appears in the season 5 episode of ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', "[[Alias episodes (Season 5)#S.O.S.|S.O.S.]]". In it, [[Marshall Flinkman]], in a small moment of comic relief, says he has cracked the code just by looking at it during a tour visit to the CIA office. The solution he describes sounds like the solution to the first two parts.

The musical group [[Between the Buried and Me]] has a reference to ''Kryptos'' in their song "Obfuscation" from the 2009 album, ''[[The Great Misdirect]]''.

An image of ''Kryptos'' is hidden in the background artwork of the 2010 game ''[http://apps.facebook.com/fantasyuniversity Fantasy University]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elonka.com/kryptos|title=Elonka's Kryptos page|publisher=elonka.com|accessdate=December 7, 2010}}</ref>
