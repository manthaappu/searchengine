In [[computer science]], a '''container''' is a [[Class (computer science)|class]], a [[data structure]], or an [[abstract data type]] (ADT) whose instances are collections of other objects. In other words; They are used for storing objects in an organized way following specific access rules.

Generally, container classes are expected to implement methods to do the following:
* create a new empty container (constructor),
* report the number of objects it stores (size),
* delete all the objects in the container (clear),
* insert new objects into the container,
* remove objects from it,
* provide access to the stored objects.

There are two types of containers: value containers and reference containers.

''Value'' based containers store copies of the objects. Accessing an object also returns a copy of it. Modifying an external object after it has been inserted in the container will ''not'' affect the content of the container.

''Reference'' based containers only store pointers or references to the objects. Accessing an object returns a reference to it. Modifying an external object after it has been inserted in the container ''could'' result in modifying the content of the container (or more precisely, the object stored in the container).

Containers are sometimes implemented in conjunction with [[iterator]]s.

==Examples of containers==
Examples of containers include:
* [[array data structure|array]]
* [[List (computing)|list]]
* [[Associative array|map]]
* [[Queue (data structure)|queue]]
* [[Set (computer science)|set]]
* [[Stack (data structure)|stack]]
* [[table (information)|table]]
* [[tree (data structure)|tree]]
* [[Vector (C++)|vector]]

==Containers in object-oriented programming==
In [[object-oriented programming]], a '''container class''' is any [[class (computer science)|class]] that is capable of storing other [[object (computer science)|object]]s.  Container classes usually implement some kind of [[data structure]], such as a [[list (computing)|list]], [[associative array|map]], [[set (computer science)|set]], [[array data structure|array]], or [[tree (data structure)|tree]]. A container class is usually able to store an arbitrary number of data items, i.e. the size of the collection is adjusted automatically.

==Graphic containers==
[[Widget toolkit]]s use special [[Widget (computing)|widgets]] also called ''Containers'' to group the other widgets together ([[Window (computing)|windows]], [[Panel (computer software)|panels]], ...). Apart from their graphical properties, they have the same type of behavior as '''container classes''', as they keep a list of their child [[Widget (computing)|widgets]], and allow to add, remove, or retrieve [[Widget (computing)|widgets]] amongst their children.
