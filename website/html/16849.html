The '''Holdridge life zones system''' is a global bioclimatic scheme for the classification of land areas. It was first published by [[Leslie Holdridge]] in 1947, and updated in 1967. It is a relatively simple system based on few empirical data, giving objective mapping criteria.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/publications/abstracts/archived/lugo.htm Western Ecology Division | US EPA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A basic assumption of the system is that both [[soil type|soil]] and [[climax vegetation]] can be mapped once climate is known.<ref>http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0004-0851%28197322%295%3A3%3CA187%3ACOTAOT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-4&size=LARGE&origin=JSTOR-enlargePage</ref>

While it was first designed for tropical and subtropical area, the system applies globally. The system has been shown to fit [[tropical]] vegetation zones, [[Mediterranean]] zones, and [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]] zones, but is less applicable to cold oceanic or cold arid climates where moisture becomes the determining factor. The system has found a major use in assessing the possible changes in natural vegetation patterns due to [[global warming]].<ref>[http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/ecosys/cdroms/ged_iia/datasets/a06/reprints/lh1.htm]</ref>

The three axis of the [[Barycentric subdivision]]s are:
* [[precipitation]] (annual, logarithmic)
* [[humidity]] provinces
* [[potential evapotranspiration]] ratio  (PET) to mean total annual precipitation. 

Further indicators incorporated into the system are:
* [[biotemperature]] (mean annual, logarithmic)
* [[Latitudinal|latitudinal regions]]
* [[Altitudinal zonation|altitudinal belts]]

Biotemperature is based on the growing season length and temperature. It is measured as the mean of refers to all temperatures above freezing, with all temperatures below freezing adjusted to 0 °C, as plants are dormant at these temperatures. Holdridge's system uses biotemperature first, rather than the temperate latitude bias of [[Clinton Hart Merriam|Merriam]]'s life zones, and does not primarily consider elevation. The system is considered more appropriate to the complexities of tropical vegetation than Merriam's system.

# Boreal dry [[Scrubland|scrub]]
# Boreal moist [[forest]]
# Boreal wet forest
# Boreal rain forest
# [[Cool temperate]] desert
# Cool temperate [[desert scrub]]
# Cool temperate [[steppe]]
# Cool temperate moist forest
# Cool temperate wet forest
# Cool temperate rain forest
# [[Warm temperate]] desert
# Warm temperate desert scrub
# Warm temperate thorn scrub
# Warm temperate dry forest
