<html> <head> <title>Guard tour patrol system</title></head><body>A '''Guard tour patrol system''' is a system for logging the rounds of employees in a variety of situations such as [[Security guard]]s patrolling property, technicians monitoring climate-controlled environments, and [[corrections officer|correctional officers]]<ref>[http://www.metrokc.gov/budget/2006/cip/LSJ.pdf Paper on Law, Safety and Justice Capital Improvement Program, King County Washington, Page 6]</ref> checking prisoner living areas. It helps ensure that the employee makes his or her appointed rounds at the correct intervals and can offer a virtually indisputable record for legal or insurance reasons. Such systems have existed for many years using mechanical [[watchclock]]-based systems (watchman clocks/guard tour clocks/patrol clocks). Computerized systems were first introduced in Europe in the early 80s, and in North America in 1986.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=Bill |coauthors=Robert R. Macdonald |month=March |year=1991 |title= High-Tech Touring |journal=Security Management |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=25}}</ref> Modern systems are based on handheld [[data logger]]s and [[RFID]] sensors.

Essentially, the system provides a means to record the time when the employee reaches certain important points on their tour (and, of course, the fact that they reached these points at all). Checkpoints or Watchstations are commonly placed at the extreme ends of the tour route and at critical points such as [[bank vault|vaults]], [[specimen]] [[refrigerators]], vital equipment, access points, etc. Some systems are set so that the interval between stations is timed so if the employee fails to reach each point within a set time, other staff are dispatched to investigate and ensure the employee's well-being.

An example of a modern set-up might work as follows: The employee carries an portable electronic sensor (PES) or electronic data collector which is activated at each checkpoint. Checkpoints can consist of [[iButton]] semiconductors, magnetic strips, proximity microchips such as [[RFID]]s, or optical [[barcodes]]. The data collector stores the serial number of the checkpoint with the date and time. Later, the information is downloaded from the collector into a [[computer]] where the checkpoint's [[serial number]] will have an assigned location (i.e. North Perimeter Fence, Cell Number 1, etc.). Data collectors can also be programmed to ignore duplicate checkpoint activations that occur sequentially or within a certain time period. Computer [[software]] used to compile the data from the collector can print out summaries that pinpoint missed checkpoints or patrols without the operator having to review all the data collected. Devices can be subject to misuse or heavy wear and tear, to ensure that these devices protect themselves from the working environment the higher end devices have built in microwave, g-force and voltage detection.<ref>[http://www.tomst.com/WinKontrol/manual/en/anti-vandal.htm The PES 'AntiVandal system'], Tomas Haase.

In the analog age, the equivalent device used for the same purpose was the watchclock.<ref>[http://www.watchclocks.org/ The Detex Watchman's Clock Album], Philip Haselton. Accessed May 24, 2007.</ref> Watchclocks often had a paper or light cardboard disk placed inside for each 24-hour period. The user would carry the clock to each checkpoint where a numbered key could be found (typically chained in place to ensure that the user was physically visiting each point). That key would then be inserted into the clock where it would make an imprint in the disk. At the end of the shift or 24-hour period an authorized person (usually someone in a supervisory position above the patroller) would unlock the watchclock and retrieve the disk.

In [[Closed-circuit television|Closed Circuit Television Systems]], a tour is a feature allowing the user to monitor video from multiple locations on one screen sequentially on a continuous basis.

Though widely used throughout the security industry, these systems are best used in situations that require regular checks for fire, atmospheric conditions and/or malfunctions that could possibly endanger workers and/or assets. Regular patrols by security personnel offer predictability and therefore improve the criminal's chance of committing a crime. For routes which have significant outdoor exposure [[GPS]] units have proven to be a far more effective means of tracking security and law enforcement patrol behavior. Unfortunately GPS systems do not function in the most vulnerable areas such as indoors, underground or within floors of a building. So, systems using assisted GPS have been developed.
