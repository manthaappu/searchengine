The game's story starts with an explanation by Dr. Brain. He tells the player that plans for his latest project were stolen, and he charges the player to retrieve a battery from his island and bring it to him. The player must then traverse the security puzzles Dr. Brain has set up throughout his island.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/224/Island+of+Dr.+Brain,+The.html | title = Island of Dr. Brain, The | publisher = [[Abandonia]] | accessdate = 2008-08-10}}</ref>
