'''Kilocore''', from [[Rapport Inc.]] and [[IBM]], is a high-performance, low-power [[multi-core (computing)|multi-core]] [[microprocessor]] that has 1,025 cores. It contains a single [[PowerPC]] processing core, and 1,024 eight-bit Processing Elements running at 125 MHz each, which can be dynamically reconfigured, connected by a shared interconnect. It allows high performance [[parallel computing|parallel processing]].

Rapport's first product to market is the KC256, with 256 8-bit processing elements. The KC256 started shipping in 2006<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rapportincorporated.com/aboutus/background.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071220194359/http://www.rapportincorporated.com/aboutus/background.html|archivedate=20-Dec-2007|title=Rapport inc}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref>. The elements are grouped in 16 "stripes" of 16 processing elements each, with each stripe able to be dedicated to a particular task.

The "thousand core" products are the KC1024 and KC1025, due in 2008. Both have 1024 8-bit processing elements, in a 32 x 32-stripe configuration. The KC1025 has the PowerPC CPU, while the KC1024 has processing elements only.

IBM says that the Kilocore1025 will enable "streaming live- and high-definition video on a low-power, [[mobile device]] at five to 10 times the speed of existing processors."
