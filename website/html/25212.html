'''mt Xinu''' (from the letters in "[[Unix]](TM)", reversed) was a [[software]] company founded in 1983 that produced two [[operating system]]s.  Its slogan "We know Unix™ backwards and forwards" was an allusion<ref>{{harvnb|Salus|1994}}</ref> to the company's name and abilities.

''mt Xinu'' was a commercially licensed version of the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] [[Unix]] operating system for the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[VAX]]. The initial version was based on 4.1cBSD; later versions were based on 4.2 and 4.3BSD.

''more/BSD'' was mt Xinu's version of 4.3BSD-Tahoe for VAX and [[HP 9000]], incorporating code from the [[University of Utah]]'s [[HPBSD]]. It included [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]]. ''Mach386'' was a hybrid of [[Mach kernel|Mach 2.5/2.6]] and 4.3BSD-Tahoe/Reno for [[Intel 80386|386]] and 486 PCs.

The company's principals were [[University of California, Berkeley]] [[computer science]] students and graduates, notably Bob Kridle, Alan Tobey, Ed Gould, and Vance Vaughan. Debbie Scherrer was a later contributor.

mt Xinu is also famous for its light-hearted Unix-themed calendars, including:

* ''Command of the Month'' (1987–1988)
* ''Lessons in Art'' (1989)
* ''Platform of the Year'' (1990)

In 1991 a division of mt Xinu broke off to become [[Xinet]].
