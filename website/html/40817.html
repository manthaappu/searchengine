'''Xubuntu''' ({{pron-en|zuːˈbuːntuː}} "zoo-BOON-too") is a [[Canonical Ltd.]] recognized, community maintained derivative of the [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] [[operating system]], using the [[Xfce]] [[desktop environment]].<ref name="XubuntuAbout">{{cite web|url = http://www.xubuntu.org/about|title = What is Xubuntu?|accessdate = 2009-02-10|last = [[Canonical Ltd.]]|authorlink = |year = 2008}}</ref><ref name="XubuntuGlossary">{{cite web|url = http://www.xubuntu.org/glossary|title = Glossary|accessdate = 2009-02-10|last = [[Canonical Ltd.]]|authorlink = |year = 2008}}</ref><ref name="Derv">{{cite web|url = http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/derivatives|title = Products|accessdate = 2009-10-15|last = [[Canonical Ltd.]]|authorlink = |year = 2009}}</ref>

==Name==
The name ''Xubuntu'' is a [[portmanteau]] of ''Xfce'' and ''Ubuntu''. Xfce originally was an abbreviation for ''XForms Common Environment'', while Ubuntu means "humanity towards others" in the [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] languages. Combined as ''Xubuntu'' it does not have any specific new meaning.

==Goals==
Xubuntu's goals are to:

{{quote|provide an easy to use distribution, based on Ubuntu, using Xfce as the graphical desktop, with a focus on integration, usability and performance, with a particular focus on low memory footprint. The integration in Xubuntu is at a configuration level, a toolkit level, and matching the underlying technology beneath the desktop in Ubuntu. Xubuntu will be built and developed autonomously as part of the wider Ubuntu community, based around the ideals and values of Ubuntu.<ref name="Strategy" /> }}

The Xfce desktop environment is intended to use fewer system resources than the default Ubuntu [[GNOME]] desktop. The Xubuntu developers claim that the minimum RAM Xubuntu can be run on is 128 MB, with 256 MB of RAM strongly recommended.<ref name="XubuntuGet"> {{Cite web|url = http://www.xubuntu.org/get|title = Get Xubuntu|accessdate = 24 December 2010|last = Canonical Ltd|authorlink = |year = 2010}}</ref>

Testing conducted by Martyn Honeyford at [[IBM]] in January 2007 on Xubuntu 6.10 concluded that it "uses approximately 25MB less application memory, and also eats significantly less into buffers and cache (which may imply that there is less file activity) than Ubuntu."<ref name="Honeyford"> {{Cite web|url = http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-linux-memory.html|title = Reduce your Linux memory footprint|accessdate = 24 December 2010|last = Honeyford|first = Martyn|authorlink = |year = 2007|month = January}}</ref>

Later testing has showed that Xubuntu has not maintained its advantage over Ubuntu in successive releases. Tests were conducted by [[DistroWatch]] on a Dell Dimension 4500 desktop machine, with an Intel 2 GHz processor and 384 MB of memory in April 2009, that compared Xubuntu 9.04 against an Xfce desktop version of [[Debian]] 5.0.1 Xfce. These showed that Xubuntu used more than twice the RAM as Debian in simple tasks. Xubuntu also ran out of RAM doing everyday tasks, indicating that 384 MB of RAM was inadequate. The review concluded "It was obvious I had already run out of RAM and was starting to use swap space. Considering I wasn't doing very much, this was rather disappointing".<ref name="DW27Apr09"> {{Cite web|url = http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20090427#feature|title = Xubuntu 9.04 vs Debian 5.0.1 Xfce|accessdate = 24 December 2010|last = [[DistroWatch]]|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = April}}</ref>

Testing conducted on a later version, Xubuntu 9.10 beta, in September 2009 showed similar results. The tests, conducted by [[Linux Magazine (USA)|Linux Magazine]], concluded that Xubuntu 9.10 beta's RAM usage was actually greater than Ubuntu's 9.10 beta with GNOME.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.linux-mag.com/cache/7520/1.html|title = Lubuntu: Floats Like a Butterfly, Stings Like a Bee|accessdate = 2009-10-19|publisher = Linux Magazine|date = 9 September 2009}}</ref> 

Subsequent reviewers have noted the same issues. Doru Barbu writing on [[Softpedia]] in September 2009 said "while Xubuntu is often represented as a lightweight distro, it actually fails to run on older hardware"<ref name="Barbu01Sep09"> {{Cite news|url = http://news.softpedia.com/news/First-Lubuntu-Test-ISOs-Available-120608.shtml|title = First Lubuntu Test ISOs Available|accessdate = 14 November 2010|last = Barbu|first = Doru|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = September| work = Softpedia}}</ref>. In January 2010 OMG Ubuntu noted, "Xubuntu – the current “lightweight” choice – is not as slender a distribution as people tend to think. Recent benchmarks show it to be just as “demanding” as regular Ubuntu – sometimes even more so!"<ref name="OMG18Jan10"> {{Cite news|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/01/lubuntu-10-04-alpha-1-visual-overview/|title = Lubuntu 10.04 Alpha 1 – Visual Overview|accessdate = 14 November 2010|last = Sneddon|first = Joey|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = January| work = OMG Ubuntu}}</ref> Damien Oh of ''Make Tech Easier'' noted in May 2010, "So what about Xubuntu? isn’t it supposed to be the lightweight equivalent of Ubuntu? Sadly, that is a thing of the past. The truth is, the supposed lightweight equivalent is not lightweight at all. While Xubuntu is using the lightweight XFCE desktop environment, it had been bugged down by several heavyweight applications and also the integration with GNOME desktop also makes it lose its advantage."<ref name="Oh06May10"> {{Cite news|url = http://maketecheasier.com/lubuntu-review-a-lightweight-ubuntu-variant/2010/05/06|title = Lubuntu Review: A Lightweight Ubuntu Variant|accessdate = 14 November 2010|last = Oh|first = Damien|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = May| work = Make Tech Easier}}</ref>

==History==
Xubuntu was originally intended to be released at the same time as Ubuntu 5.10 ''Breezy Badger'', 13 October 2005, but the work was not complete by that date. Instead the Xubuntu name was used for the ''xubuntu-desktop'' metapackage available through the [[Synaptic Package Manager]] which installed the Xfce desktop.

The first official Xubuntu release, led by Jani Monoses, appeared on 1 June 2006, as part of the Ubuntu 6.06 ''Dapper Drake'' line, which also included [[Kubuntu]] and [[Edubuntu]].

Cody A.W. Somerville developed a comprehensive strategy for the Xubuntu project named the ''Xubuntu Strategy Document''. As of early 2009 the document is currently awaiting a second reading by the Ubuntu Community Council.<ref name="Strategy">{{cite web|url = https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Specifications/Intrepid/StrategyDocument#Mission%20Statement|title =Xubuntu/Specifications/Intrepid/StrategyDocument|accessdate = 2009-02-10|last = Somerville|first = Cody|authorlink = |year = 2008}}</ref>

In February 2009 [[Mark Shuttleworth]] agreed that an official [[LXDE]] version of Ubuntu, to be named [[Lubuntu]], will be developed. The LXDE desktop uses the [[Openbox]] window manager and, like Xubuntu, is intended to be a low-system-requirement, low-RAM environment for [[netbook]]s, mobile devices and older PCs and will compete with Xubuntu in that niche.<ref name="Distrowatch11May09">{{cite web|url = http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20090511#news|title = Another day, another Ubuntu derivative.|accessdate = 2009-05-21|last = Smart|first = Chris|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = May}}</ref><ref name="LXDEBlog">{{cite web|url = http://blog.lxde.org/?p=208|title =Lubuntu? LXDE Meet up with Mark Shuttleworth in Berlin|accessdate = 2009-05-21|last = [[LXDE]]|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = February}}</ref>

In November 2009, Cody A.W. Somerville stepped down as the project leader and made a call for nominations to help find a successor.<ref name="CallForNominations7Nov09">{{cite web|url = https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/xubuntu-devel/2009-November/007180.html|title =Xubuntu Project Lead: Call for Nominations}}</ref> Lionel Le Folgoc was confirmed by the Xubuntu community as the new project leader on 10 January 2010 and requested the formation of an official Xubuntu council.<ref name="XubuntuMeetingNotes10Jan10">{{cite web|url = https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Meetings/Archive/Minutes/2010-01-10|title =Xubuntu/Meetings/Archive/Minutes/2010-01-10|accessdate = 2010-03-29}}</ref> As of late March 2010, discussions regarding the future of Xubuntu's governance and the role a council might play in it are still ongoing.

==Releases==
Xubuntu versions are released twice a year, coinciding with Ubuntu releases. Xubuntu uses the same version numbers and code names as Ubuntu, using the year and month of the release as the [[Software versioning|version number]]. The first Xubuntu release, for example, was 6.06, indicating June 2006.<ref name="warty_release">{{cite mailing list |url=https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2004-October/000003.html |title=Ubuntu 4.10 announcement |date=2004-10-20 |accessdate=2008-08-19 |mailinglist=ubuntu-announce |last=Shuttleworth |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Shuttleworth }}</ref>

Xubuntu releases are also given [[code name]]s, using an adjective and an animal with the same first letter e.g.: "Dapper Drake" and "Intrepid [[Ibex]]". These are the same as the respective [[Ubuntu (operating system)#Releases|Ubuntu code names]]. Xubuntu code names are in alphabetical order, allowing a quick determination of which release is newer, although there were no releases with the letters "A" or "C". Commonly, Xubuntu releases are referred to by developers and users by only the adjective portion of the code name, for example ''Intrepid Ibex'' is often called just ''Intrepid''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames |title=DevelopmentCodeNames - Ubuntu Wiki |publisher=Wiki.ubuntu.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-19}}</ref>
