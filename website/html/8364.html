The '''Cray C90''' series (initially named the '''Y-MP C90''') was a [[vector processor]] [[supercomputer]] launched by [[Cray Research]] in 1991. The C90 was a development of the [[Cray Y-MP]] architecture. Compared to the Y-MP, the C90 processor had a dual vector pipeline and a faster 4.1 ns clock cycle (244 MHz), which together gave three times the performance of the Y-MP processor. The maximum number of processors in a system was also doubled from eight to 16. The C90 series used the same Model E IOS (Input/Output Subsystem) and [[UNICOS]] [[operating system]] as the earlier Y-MP Model E. 

The C90 series included the '''C94''', '''C98''' and '''C916''' models (configurations with a maximum of four, eight, and 16 processor respectively) and the '''C92A''' and '''C94A''' (air-cooled models). Maximum [[static RAM|SRAM]] memory was between 1 and 8 GB, depending on model.

The '''D92''', '''D92A''', '''D94''' and '''D98'''  (also known as the '''C92D''', '''C92AD''', '''C94D''' and '''C98D''' respectively) variants were equipped with slower, but higher-density [[DRAM]] memory, allowing increased maximum memory sizes of up to 16 GB, depending on the model.

The successor system was the [[Cray T90]].
