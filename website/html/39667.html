'''Voodoo3''' was a series of computer gaming video cards manufactured and designed by [[3dfx|3dfx Interactive]]. It was the successor to the company's high-end [[Voodoo 2]] line and was based heavily upon the older [[Voodoo Banshee]] product. Voodoo3 was announced at [[COMDEX]] '98 and arrived on store shelves in 1999.<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/11-16-1998/0000803667&EDATE= 3Dfx Interactive Blasts COMDEX with Voodoo3 Debut And Four Voodoo Banshee PC-OEM Announcements], 3dfx Press Release, November 16, 1998.</ref> The Voodoo3 line was the first product manufactured by the combined [[STB Technologies]] and 3dfx.<ref>Brown, Peter.

==History==
The 'Avenger' graphics core was originally conceived immediately after Banshee. Due to  mis-management by 3dfx, this caused the next-generation 'Rampage' project to suffer delays which would prove to be fatal to the entire company.

Avenger was pushed to the forefront as it offered a quicker time to market than the already delayed Rampage. Avenger was no more than the Banshee core with a second texture mapping unit (TMU) added - the same TMU which Banshee lost compared to Voodoo2. Avenger was thus merely a Voodoo2 with an integrated 128-bit 2D video accelerator and twice the clock speed.

==Architecture and performance==

Much was made of Voodoo3 (as Avenger was christened) and its [[Highcolour|16-bit color]] rendering limitation. This was in fact quite complex, as Voodoo3 operated to full [[truecolor|32-bit]] precision (8 bits per channel, 16.7M colours) in its texture mappers and pixel pipeline as opposed to previous products from 3dfx and other vendors, which had only worked in 16-bit precision.

To save framebuffer space, the Voodoo3's rendering output was dithered to 16 bit. This offered better quality than running in pure 16-bit mode.  However, a controversy arose over what happened next.

The Voodoo3's [[RAMDAC]], which took the rendered frame from the framebuffer and generated the display image, performed a 2x2 box or 4x1 line filter on the dithered image to almost reconstruct the original [[Truecolor|24-bit color]] render. 3dfx claimed this to be '22-bit' equivalent quality.<ref>Beets, Kristof. [http://www.beyond3d.com/content/articles/59/ 3dfx '22Bit Colour' Explored], Beyond3D, May 7, 1999.</ref>  As such, Voodoo3's [[framebuffer]] was not representative of the final output, and therefore, screenshots did not accurately portray Voodoo3's display quality which was actually much closer to the 24-bit outputs of NVIDIA's [[RIVA TNT2]] and ATI's [[ATI Rage|Rage 128]]. 

The internal organisation of Avenger was not complex. Pre-setup notably featured a guardband clipper (eventually part of hardware transformation and lighting) but the pixel pipeline was a conventional single-issue, dual-texture design almost identical to that featured on Voodoo2, but capable of working on 32-bit image data as opposed to Voodoo2's pure 16-bit output. Avenger's other remarkable features included the 128-bit [[Graphics Device Interface|GDI accelerator]] first debuted in Banshee. This 2D engine led the Voodoo3 to be considered one of the more high-performance video cards of its generation.<ref>Fastsite.

The Voodoo3 2000, 3000 and 3500 differed mainly in clock frequencies (memory and core were synchronous). The clock rates were 143 [[Hertz|MHz]], 166 MHz and 183 MHz respectively. While this gave the 3000 and 3500 a notable theoretical advantage in multi-textured fillrate over its main rival, the 125 MHz TNT2,the TNT2 had nearly twice the single-textured fillrate of the Voodoo3. In addition, the Voodoo3 consisted of one multi-texturing pipeline, the TNT series consisted of twin single texturing pipelines.<ref>[http://www.beyond3d.com/misc/chipcomp/ Beyond3D 3D Chip Tables], Beyond3D.Com, accessed August 30, 2006.</ref> As a result, Voodoo3 was disadvantaged in games not using multiple texturing. The 2000 and 3000 boards generally differed in their support for TV output; the 3500 boards also carried a TV tuner and provided a wide range of video inputs and outputs.

At the time modern multi-texturing games such as [[Quake3]] and [[Unreal Tournament]] were considered Voodoo3's performance territory, as Voodoo3's primary competition upon release was the dated RIVA TNT.<ref name=AnandVoodoo3 /> NVIDIA's RIVA TNT2 arrived shortly thereafter and the two traded places frequently in benchmark results.<ref>Lal Shimpi, Anand. [http://www.anandtech.com/showdoc.aspx?i=940 NVIDIA Riva TNT2], Anandtech, April 27, 1999.</ref> 

Voodoo3 remained performance competitive throughout its life, eventually being comprehensively outclassed by NVIDIA's [[GeForce 256]] and ATI's [[Radeon R100|Radeon]]. 3dfx created the ill-fated [[Voodoo 5]] to counter.

==3dfx Velocity==
3dfx released a line of business / value-oriented cards based on the Voodoo3 Avenger chipset. With the purchase of STB Technologies, 3dfx had acquired several popular brand names. The Velocity brand had appealed to OEM system builders for years, with boards such as the [[S3 Graphics]] [[S3 ViRGE|ViRGE VX]]-based ''STB Velocity 3D'' and [[NVIDIA]] [[RIVA 128]]-based ''Velocity 128'' being used in many OEM systems from companies such as [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]]. The 3dfx Velocity boards came with only 8 MiB of RAM, compared to 16 MiB on a regular Voodoo3. In addition, one of the texture management units came disabled as well, making the board more like a Banshee. Enthusiasts discovered that it was possible to enable the disabled TMU with a simple registry alteration. The board's clock speed was set at 143 MHz, exactly the same as a Voodoo3 2000.<ref>Andrawes, Mike.

==Drivers==

The last set of drivers officially released for the Voodoo 3 on Win9x was version 1.07.00. For Win2000 the latest version is 1.03.00.<ref>[http://www.falconfly.de/voodoo3.htm Voodoo3 Drivers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> After 3dfx shut its doors 3rd party drivers for Windows 98/98SE and XP were developed by loyal 3dfx customers.
