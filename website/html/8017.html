'''Contraposition''' is a logical relationship between two [[proposition]]s, or statements. For example, take the following (true) proposition: "''All birds are animals''." We can restate that as "''If something is a bird, then it is an animal''." The contrapositive is, "''If something is not an animal, then it is not a bird''." In [[mathematics]] and in [[logic]], the contrapositive is always guaranteed to be true, as long as the original proposition is true. If the original proposition is false, the contrapositive will always be false, as well.

Compare that to the other common relationships between propositions:

*'''[[Inverse (logic)|Inversion]]''': "''If something is not a bird, then it is not an animal''." Unlike the contrapositive, the inversion's [[truth value]] is not dependent upon whether the original proposition is true, as evidenced here. The inverse, here, is clearly not true.
*'''[[Conversion (logic)|Conversion]]''': "''If something is an animal, then it is a bird''." The conversion is actually the contrapositive of the inversion and always has the same truth value as the inversion, which is not necessarily the same as that of the original proposition. 
*'''[[Contradiction]]''': "''There exists a bird that is not an animal''. " If the contradiction is true, then the original proposition and, by extension, the contrapositive are untrue. Here, of course, the contradiction is untrue.

==Simple proof using Venn Diagrams==

[[File:Venn_A_subset_B.svg|thumb|right|]]

It appears clear that, if something is within A, then it must also be within B. We can rephrase that as

:<math>(A \to B)</math>

It is also clear that anything that is not within B '''cannot''' be within A, either. This statement,

:<math>(\neg B \to \neg A)</math>

is the contrapositive. Therefore we can say that

:<math>(A \to B)</math> ≡ <math>(\neg B \to \neg A)</math>

Practically speaking, this makes life much easier when trying to prove something. For example, if we want to prove that every girl in the United States is blonde, we can either try to prove <math>(A \to B)</math> by checking all girls in the United States to see if they are all blonde, or we can simply disprove the contrapositive by finding one nonblonde girl. Upon finding one, we have disproven <math>(\neg B \to \neg A)</math> and, by extension, <math>(A \to B)</math>.

To conclude, for any statement where A implies B, then ''not B'' always implies ''not A''. Proving or disproving either one of these statements automatically proves or disproves the other. They are logically equivalent.

==Formal definition==

A proposition ''Q'' is implicated by a proposition ''P'' when the following relationship holds:

:<math>(P \to Q)</math>

In [[vernacular]] terms, this states that,  "if ''P'', then ''Q''", or, "if ''Socrates is a man'', then ''Socrates is human''." In a conditional such as this, ''P'' is the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]], and ''Q'' is the [[consequent]]. One statement is the '''contrapositive''' of the other only when its antecedent is the [[Negation|negated]] consequent of the other, and vice versa. The contrapositive of the example is

:<math>(\neg Q \to \neg P)</math>.

That is, "If not-''Q'', then not-''P''", or, more clearly, "If ''Q'' is not the case, then ''P'' is not the case." Using our example, this is rendered "If ''Socrates is not human'', then ''Socrates is not a man''." This statement is said to be ''contraposed'' to the original and is logically equivalent to it. Due to their logical equivalence, stating one effectively states the other; when one is [[Truth value|true]], the other is also true. Likewise with falsity.

Strictly speaking, a contraposition can only exist in two simple conditionals. However, a contraposition may also exist in two complex conditionals, if they are similar. Thus, <math>\forall{x}(P{x} \to Q{x})</math>, or "All ''P''<nowiki></nowiki>s are ''Q''<nowiki></nowiki>s," is contraposed to <math>\forall{x}(\neg Q{x} \to \neg P{x})</math>, or "All non-''Q''<nowiki></nowiki>s are non-''P''<nowiki></nowiki>s."

==Simple proof by contradiction==

Suppose that it is given that

:<math>(A \to B)\and \neg B</math>

It is given that, if A is true, then B is true, and it is also given that B is not true. We can then show that A must not be true by contradiction. For, if A were true, then B would have to also be true (given). However,  it is given that B is not true, so we have a contradiction. Therefore, A is not true (assuming that we are dealing with concrete statements that are either true or not true):

:<math>(A \to B) \to (\neg B \to \neg A)</math>


We can apply the same process the other way round:

:<math>(\neg B \to \neg A)\and A</math>

We also know that B is either true or not true. If B is not true, then A is also not true. However, it is given that A is true; so, the assumption that B is not true leads to contradiction and must be false. Therefore, B must be true:

:<math>(\neg B \to \neg A) \to (A \to B)</math>


Combining the two proved statements makes them logically equivalent:

:<math>(A \to B) \iff (\neg B \to \neg A)</math>

==More rigorous proof of the equivalence of contrapositives==

Logical equivalence between two propositions means that they are true together or false together. To prove that contrapositives are [[logically equivalent]], we need to understand when material implication is true or false.

:<math>(P \to Q)</math>

This is only false when ''P'' is true and ''Q'' is false. Therefore, we can reduce this proposition to the statement "False when ''P'' and not-''Q''" (i.e. "True when it is not the case that ''P'' and not-''Q''"): 

:<math>\neg(P \and \neg Q)</math>

The elements of a [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] can be reversed with no effect:

:<math>\neg(\neg Q \and P)</math>

We define <math>R</math> as equal to "<math>\neg Q</math>", and <math>S</math> as equal to <math>\neg P</math> (from this, <math>\neg S</math> is equal to <math>\neg\neg P</math>, which is equal to just <math>P</math>):

:<math>\neg(R \and \neg S)</math>

This reads "It is not the case that (''R'' is true and ''S'' is false)", which is the definition of a material conditional. We can then make this substitution:

:<math>(R \to S)</math>

When we swap our definitions of ''R'' and ''S'', we arrive at the following:

:<math>(\neg Q \to \neg P)</math>

===Examples===
Take the statement "''All red objects have color.''" This can be equivalently expressed as "''If an object is red, then it has color.''"

* The '''[[contrapositive]]''' is "''If an object does not have color, then it is not red''". This follows logically from our initial statement and, like it, it is evidently true.
* The '''[[Inverse (logic)|inverse]]''' is "''If an object is not red, then it does not have color.''" Again, an object which is blue is not red, and still has color. Therefore in this case the inverse is false.
* The '''[[Conversion (logic)|converse]]''' is "''If an object has color, then it is red.''" Objects can have other colors, of course, so, the converse of our statement is false.
* The '''[[contradiction]]''' is "''There exists a red object that does not have the properties of color''". ''If'' the contradiction were true, then both the converse and the inverse would be correct in exactly that case where the shade of red is not a color. However, in our world this statement is entirely untrue (and therefore false).

In other words, the contrapositive is logically equivalent to a given [[conditional]] statement, though not sufficient for a [[biconditional]].

Similarly, take the statement "''All [[quadrilaterals]] have four sides,''" or equivalently expressed "''If a shape is a quadrilateral, then it has four sides.''"
* The '''[[contrapositive]]''' is "''If a shape does not have four sides, then it is not a quadrilateral.''"  This follows logically, and as a rule, contrapositives share the [[truth value]] of their conditional.
* The '''[[Inverse (logic)|inverse]]''' is "''If a shape is not a quadrilateral, then it does not have four sides.''"  In this case, unlike the last example, the inverse of the argument is true.
* The '''[[Conversion (logic)|converse]]''' is "''If a shape has four sides, then it is a quadrilateral.''"  Again, in this case, unlike the last example, the converse of the argument is true.
* The '''[[contradiction]]''' is "''There is at least one quadrilateral that does not have four sides.''"

Since the statement and the converse are both true, it is called a [[biconditional]], and can be expressed as "'''A shape is a quadrilateral ''if, and only if,'' it has four sides.'''"  That is, having four sides is both necessary to be a quadrilateral, and alone sufficient to deem it a quadrilateral.

===Truth===
* If a statement is true, then its contrapositive is always true (and vice versa).
* If a statement is false, its contrapositive is always false (and vice versa).
* If a statement's inverse is true, its converse is always true (and vice versa).
* If a statement's inverse is false, its converse is always false (and vice versa).
* If a statement's contradiction is false, then the statement is true (and vice versa).
* If a statement (or its contrapositive) and the inverse (or the converse) are both true or both false, it is known as a [[logical biconditional]].

==Application==
Because the '''contrapositive''' of a statement always has the same truth value (truth or falsity) as the statement itself, it can be a powerful tool for proving mathematical [[theorem]]s via [[Reductio ad absurdum|proof by contradiction]], as in the [[Irrational_number#The_square_root_of_2|proof of the irrationality of the square root of 2]]. By the definition of a [[rational number]], the statement can be made that "''If <math>\sqrt{2}</math> is rational, then it can be expressed as an [[irreducible fraction]]''".  This statement is '''true''' because it is a restatement of a true definition. The contrapositive of this statement is "''If <math>\sqrt{2}</math> cannot be expressed as an irreducible fraction, then it is not rational''".  This contrapositive, like the original statement, is also '''true'''.  Therefore, if it can be proven that <math>\sqrt{2}</math> cannot be expressed as an irreducible fraction, then it must be the case that <math>\sqrt{2}</math> is not a rational number.

A similar, but not identical tool for proving mathematical terms is the [[Proof by contrapositive|proof by contraposition]].
