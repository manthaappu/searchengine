'''Guy Lewis Steele Jr.''', <!-- Birth year unknown --> ({{pron-en|ˈstiːl}} as in ''steel''), also known as "The Great Quux"<ref name="quux">[http://www.seas.harvard.edu/news-events/publications/q-as/guy_steele  Q&A with Guy Steele '75], Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, publication date unknown, accessed 2009-11-12</ref> and GLS ({{IPA|/ˈɡlɪs/}}), is an American [[computer scientist]] who has played an important role in designing and documenting several computer [[programming language]]s.

==Biography==
Steele was born in [[Missouri]] and graduated from the [[Boston Latin School]] in 1972. He received a [[Bachelor's degree|BA]] from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] (1975) and an [[Master's degree|MS]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[MIT]] in [[Computer Science]] (1977, 1980). He then worked as an [[assistant professor]] of computer science at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and a compiler implementer at [[Tartan Laboratories]]. Next he joined the [[supercomputer]] company [[Thinking Machines]], where he helped to define and promote a parallel version of [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] called [[*Lisp]] (Star Lisp).

In 1994, Steele joined [[Sun Microsystems]] and was invited by [[Bill Joy]] to become a member of the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] team after the language had been designed, since he had a track record of writing good specifications for existing languages. He was named a Sun Fellow in 2003.

==Works==
While at MIT, Steele published more than two dozen papers with [[Gerald Jay Sussman]] on the subject of the Lisp language and its implementation (the [[Lambda Papers]]). One of their most notable contributions was the design of the programming language [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]].

Steele also designed the original command set of [[Emacs]] and was the first to port [[TeX]] (from [[WAITS]] to [[Incompatible Timesharing System|ITS]]). He has published papers on other subjects, including compilers, parallel processing, and constraint languages. One song he composed has been published in ''Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery'' ([[Communications of the ACM|CACM]]) ("The Telnet Song," April 1984, a parody of the behavior of a series of [[PDP-10]] [[TELNET]] implementations written by [[Mark Crispin]]).

Steele has served on accredited standards committees [[ECMA]] TC39 ([[ECMAScript]], for which he was editor of the first edition), [[X3J11]] (the [[C (programming language)|C]] language), and [[X3J3]] (Fortran) and is currently chairman of [[X3J13]] (Common Lisp).  He was also a member of the [[IEEE]] working group that produced the IEEE Standard for the Scheme Programming Language, IEEE Std 1178-1990. He represents Sun Microsystems in the High Performance Fortran Forum, which produced the [[High Performance Fortran]] specification in May, 1993.

In addition to specifications of the Java programming language, Steele's work at Sun Microsystems has included research in parallel algorithms, implementation strategies, and architectural and software support. In 2005, Steele began leading a team of researchers at Sun developing a new programming language named [[Fortress programming language|Fortress]], a high-performance language designed to obsolete [[Fortran]].

===Books===
In 1982, Steele edited ''The Hacker's Dictionary'' (Harper&Row, 1983; ISBN 0-06-091082-8), which was a print version of the [[Jargon File]].

Steele and [[Samuel P. Harbison]] wrote ''C: A Reference Manual'',  ([[Prentice-Hall]], 1984; ISBN 0-13-110016-5), to provide a precise description of the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], which Tartan Laboratories was trying to implement on a wide range of systems. Both authors participated in the ANSI C standardization process; several revisions of the book were issued to reflect the new standard.

In 1984, Steele published ''[[Common Lisp the Language]]'' (Digital Press; ISBN 0-932376-41-X; 465 pages). This first edition was the original specification of [[Common Lisp]] ("CLtL1") and served as the basis for the ANSI standard. Steele released a greatly expanded second edition in 1990, (Digital Press; ISBN 1-55558-041-6; 1029 pages) which documented a near-final version of the ANSI standard.<ref>[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html]</ref>

Steele, along with Charles H. Koelbel, David B. Loveman, Robert S. Schreiber, and Mary E. Zosel wrote ''The High Performance Fortran Handbook'' (MIT Press, 1994; ISBN 0-262-11185-3).

Steele also coauthored all three editions of ''The Java Language Specification'' (Addison-Wesley, third ed. 2005; ISBN 0-321-24678-0) with [[James Gosling]], [[Bill Joy]], and [[Gilad Bracha]].

==Awards==
Steele received the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[Grace Murray Hopper Award]] in 1988.  He was named an [[ACM Fellow]] in 1994, a member of the National Academy of Engineering of the United States of America in 2001 and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2002. He received the Dr. Dobb's Journal Excellence in Programming Award in 2005. [http://www.ddj.com/documents/s=9603/ddj0504a/0504a.html]
