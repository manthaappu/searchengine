'''Henry II''' (31 March 1519 &ndash; 10 July 1559) was [[King of France]] from 31 March 1547, until his death in 1559.<ref>Patrick, David, and Francis Hindes Groome, ''Chambers's biographical dictionary: the great of all times and nations'', (J.B. Lippincott Company, 1907), 482.</ref>

==Early years==
Henry was born in the royal [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], near Paris, the son of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] and [[Claude of France|Claude, Duchess of Brittany]] (daughter of [[Louis XII of France]] and [[Anne, Duchess of Brittany]]).

His father was captured at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525 by his sworn enemy, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], and held prisoner in Spain.<ref>Tazón, Juan E., ''The life and times of Thomas Stukeley (c.1525-78)'', (Ashgate Publishing Ltd, 2003), 16.</ref> To obtain his release it was eventually agreed that Henry and his older brother be sent to Spain in his place. They remained in captivity for three years.

Henry married [[Catherine de' Medici]] (13 April 1519 – 5 January 1589) on 28 October 1533, when they were both fourteen years old. The following year, he became romantically involved with a thirty-five-year-old widow, [[Diane de Poitiers]]. They had always been very close: she had publicly embraced him on the day he set off to Spain, and during a [[jousting]] tournament, he insisted his lance carry her ribbon instead of his wife's. Diane became Henry's most trusted confidante and, for the next twenty-five years, wielded considerable influence behind the scenes, even signing royal documents. Extremely confident, mature and intelligent, she left Catherine powerless to intervene.<ref>Arnold-Baker, Charles, ''The companion to British history'', (Routledge, 1996), 254.</ref> She did, however, insist that Henry sleep with Catherine in order to produce heirs to the throne.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Serpent and The Moon:  two rivals for the love of a Renaissance king | year=2004 | isbn=0-743-25104-0 | last=Princess Michael of Kent | first= | publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]] | coauthor= | authorlink=Princess Michael of Kent}}</ref>

When his elder brother, [[Francis III, Duke of Brittany|Francis]], died in 1536 after a game of tennis, Henry became heir to the throne. He succeeded his father on his 28th birthday and was crowned King of France on 25 July 1547 at [[Cathedral of Notre-Dame, Reims|Cathedral of Notre-Dame]] in [[Reims]].

Henry's reign was marked by wars with [[Austria]], and the persecution of the [[Protestant]] [[Huguenot]]s. Henry II severely punished them, particularly the ministers: burning them at the stake or cutting off their tongues for uttering heresies. Even those only suspected of being Huguenots could be imprisoned. The [[Edict of Châteaubriant]] (27 June 1551) called upon the civil and ecclesiastical courts to detect and punish all heretics and placed severe restrictions on Huguenots, including the loss of one-third of their property to informers, and confiscations. It also strictly [[Freedom of the press|regulated publications]] by prohibiting the sale, importation or printing of any unapproved book. It was during the reign of Henry II, [[Huguenot]] attempts at establishing a colony in [[Brazil]] were made, with the short-lived formation of ''[[France Antarctique]]''.<ref name="Marshall 185">[http://books.google.com/books?id=jfq5Tp0nq98C&pg=PA185 ''France and the Americas: culture, politics, and history'' Volume 3, By Bill Marshall, Cristina Johnston p.185''ff'']</ref>

===Italian War of 1551–1559===
The [[Italian War of 1551|Italian War of 1551–1559]], sometimes known as the Hapsburg–Valois War, began when Henry declared war against [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] with the intent of recapturing Italy and ensuring French, rather than Hapsburg, domination of European affairs. Henry II allied with German Protestant princes at the [[Treaty of Chambord]] in 1552. Simultaneously, the continuation of his father's [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]] allowed Henry II to push for French conquests towards the [[Rhine]] while a Franco-Ottoman fleet defended southern France.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=4AuJvd2Tyt8C&pg=PA328&dq=Ottoman+Hungary+French+artillery&as_brr=3&ei=QwzXSbOsB5HGzATilfm6DQ&hl=en#PPA328,M1 ''The Cambridge History of Islam'', p.328]</ref> An early offensive into [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] was successful, with Henry capturing the three episcopal cities of [[Metz]], [[Toul]], and [[Verdun]], and securing them by defeating the Hapsburg army at the [[Battle of Renty]] in 1554. However the attempted French invasion of [[Tuscany]] in 1553 was defeated at the [[Battle of Marciano]].

After Charles's abdication in 1556 split the Hapsburg empire between [[Philip II of Spain]] and [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]], the focus of the war shifted to [[Flanders]], where Phillip, in conjunction with [[Emmanuel Philibert]] of [[Savoy]], defeated the French at [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)|St. Quentin]].  England's entry into the war later that year led to the French capture of [[Calais]], and French armies plundered Spanish possessions in the [[Low Countries]]. Henry was nonetheless forced to accept the [[Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis]], in which he renounced any further claims to Italy.

[[File:Cateau-Cambresis.jpg|thumb|The [[Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis]] (1559). Henry II and [[Philip II of Spain]] were in reality absent, and the peace was signed by their ambassadors.]]
The [[Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis]] was signed between [[Elizabeth I of England]] and Henry on 2 April and between Henry and [[Philip II of Spain]] on 3 April 1559 at [[Le Cateau-Cambrésis]], around twenty kilometers southeast of [[Cambrai]].  Under its terms,  France restored [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]] and [[Savoy]] to the Duke of Savoy, but retained  [[Saluzzo]], [[Calais]] and the bishoprics of [[Diocese of Metz|Metz]], [[Diocese of Toul|Toul]], and [[Diocese of Verdun|Verdun]].  Spain retained [[Franche-Comté]].  [[Emmanuel Philibert]], Duke of [[Savoy]], married [[Margaret of France, Duchess of Berry]], the sister of Henry II, and [[Philip II of Spain]] married Henry's daughter [[Elizabeth of Valois|Élisabeth]].

Henry raised the young [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], at his court, hoping to use her to ultimately establish a dynastic claim to Scotland. On 24 April 1558, Henry's fourteen-year-old son Francis was married to Mary in a union intended to give the future king of France not only the throne of Scotland but a claim to the throne of England. Henry had Mary sign secret documents, illegal in Scottish law, that would ensure Valois rule in Scotland even if she died without an heir (Guy 2004:91). Mary's claim to the English throne quickly became an issue when [[Mary I of England]] died later in 1558, Henry and his Catholic advisers regarding [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] unfit to reign because of her illegitimacy.

==Patent innovation==
[[File:16th century French cypher machine in the shape of a book with arms of Henri II.jpg|thumb|left|A [[cryptography|cypher machine]] in the shape of a book, with arms of Henri II.]]
Henry II introduced the concept of publishing the description of an invention in the form of a [[patent]].  The idea was to require an inventor to disclose his invention in exchange for monopoly rights to the patent.  The description is called a patent “specification”.  The first patent specification was submitted by the inventor [[Abel Foullon]] for "Usaige & Description de l'holmetre", (a type of [[rangefinder]].)  Publication was delayed until after the patent expired in 1561.<ref>M. Frumkin, "The Origin of Patents", Journal of the Patent Office Society, March 1945, Vol. XXVII, No. 3, pp 143 et Seq.</ref>

==Death==

Caliber: 85mm, length: 300cm, weight: 1076kg.]]
Henry II was an avid hunter and a participant in jousts and tournaments. On 30 June 1559, at the Place Royale, during a match to celebrate the [[Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis]] with his longtime enemies, the [[Habsburg]]s of [[Austria]], and to celebrate the marriage of his daughter [[Elisabeth of Valois]] to King [[Philip II of Spain]], King Henry was mortally wounded by the lance of [[Gabriel Montgomery]], captain of the King's [[Scottish Guard]]. The lance pierced his eye and, despite the efforts of royal surgeon [[Ambroise Paré]], he died on 10 July 1559 from [[Sepsis|septicemia]].<ref>[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Henry_II_Of_France Classic Encyclopedia Web, Based on 1911 Edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica]</ref> He was buried in a [[cadaver tomb]] in [[Saint Denis Basilica]]. 

[[File:Tournament between Henry II and Lorges.jpg|thumb|left|The fatal tournament between Henry II and [[Gabriel, comte de Montgomery|Montgomery]] (Lord of "Lorges").]]
As Henry lay dying, [[Catherine de' Medici|Queen Catherine]] limited access to his bedside and denied his mistress [[Diane de Poitiers]] access to him, even though he repeatedly asked for her. Following his death, Catherine sent Diane into exile, where she lived in comfort on her own properties until her death.

Henry was succeeded by his son, [[Francis II of France|Francis II]], who died the following year and was succeeded by his two brothers. Their mother acted as [[Regent]]. For the forty years following Henry II's death, France was filled with turbulence as Protestants and Catholics fought the bitter [[French Wars of Religion]].

Henry II also had four illegitimate children:
*By Catherine Michelle: [[Elaine de Francias]] (1557–1635).  Henry supposedly debated whether or not to give her a title and only on his deathbed did he admit to being her father. He gave her the title Comtesse de Montmorency. It is not known why he was so secretive about this one daughter.
*By Filippa Duci: [[Diane de France|Diane, duchesse d'Angoulême]] (1538–1619). Some sources have stated that the child was the natural daughter of Henry's long-time mistress, [[Diane de Poitiers]].{{Whom?|date=April 2010}}  This is probably not the case since it is on record that Henry had Filippa Duci watched closely throughout her pregnancy.  She gave birth in a convent and it appears that she remained there for the rest of her life. At the age of fourteen, the younger Diane married Orazio Farnese, Duke of Castro, who died young in battle.  Her second marriage was to François, duc de Montmorency.
*By [[Lady Janet Stewart]] (1508–1563), herself an illegitimate daughter of [[James IV of Scotland]]: Henri de Valois (1551 – June 1586). He was legitimized and became governor of [[Provence]].
*By Nicole de Savigny: a son, Henri (1557–1621). He was given the title of comte de Saint-Rémy. One of his last descendants was Jeanne de Valois-Saint-Rémy, [[Comtesse de la Motte]], famous for her role in the [[Affair of the Diamond Necklace]].

==Prophecy==

[[Nostradamus]], a French astrological writer known for his prophecies, is often said to have become famous when one of his [[quatrain]]s was construed as a prediction of the death of King Henry II:

CI, Q 35
''The young lion shall overcome the older one,''<br/>
''on the field of combat in single battle,''<br/>
''He shall pierce his eyes in a golden cage,''<br/>
''Two forces one, then he shall die a cruel death.''

But, in fact, the link was first proposed in print only in 1614,<ref>César Nostradamus, ''Histoire et Chronique de Provence'', Lyon, Simon Rigaud, 1614</ref> fifty-five years after the event and forty-eight after Nostradamus' death; thus it qualifies as a [[postdiction]], or ''vaticinium ex eventu''. The Italian astrologer [[Luca Gaurico]], a contemporary of Nostradamus, is also said to have predicted the king's death.
