'''Molecular breast imaging''' (MBI) is a new screening methodology for [[breast cancer]]. It helps identify tumors in dense tissue that often aren't visible with mammography. MBI overcomes a shortcoming of X-ray-based [[mammography]]. On a mammogram, X-ray imageries of tumors and dense breast tissue both appear white, which makes difficult to distinct. Therefore, MBI is currently considered as an adjunct to today's mammography. With MBI, a tumor is easy to see, even if it's in dense breast tissue.
