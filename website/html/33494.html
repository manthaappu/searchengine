The '''seal of the [[New York City|city of New York]]''', adopted in an earlier form in 1686, bears the legend <small>SIGILLUM CIVITATIS NOVI EBORACI</small> which means simply "The Seal of the City of New York": ''[[Eboracum]]'' was the Roman name for York, the [[Titular ruler|titular]] [[Seat (legal entity)|seat]] of [[James II of England|James II as Duke of York]].

The two [[supporters]] represent the unity between [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and [[European colonization of the Americas|colonists]].  Dexter,<ref>Note that "Dexter" is [[Latin]] for "right" and is a term used in heraldry to denote the rightmost character.  It is not intended to represent the name of the character.</ref> a [[sailor]] colonist holds a [[plummet]] in his right hand; over his right shoulder is a [[Jacob's staff|cross-staff]].  Sinister,<ref>Note that "Sinister" is [[Latin]] for "left" and is a term used in heraldry to denote the leftmost character.  It is not intended to represent the name of the character.</ref> a [[Lenape]] native to [[Manhattan]] rests his left hand upon a [[Bow (weapon)|bow]].

Upon the [[Coat of arms|arms]] / [[shield]], the four [[windmill]] sails recall the city's [[Netherlands|Dutch]] history as [[New Amsterdam]] and the [[beaver]]s and [[flour]] [[barrel]]s signify the city's earliest trade goods (see ''[[History of New York City]]''). The flour barrels and windmills represent the tremendous wealth generated by New York City from the [[Bolting Act of 1674]].<ref>{{cite news |title=New York's 250th Anniversary |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9501E6D7123FE233A25753C2A9609C946496D6CF |magazine=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=June 20, 1915 |page=SM12 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> The Act gave the city an exclusive monopoly to mill and export flour. The shield and supporters rest upon a horizontal [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] branch.

The [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] over the seal is the [[Bald Eagle]], added in 1784, after the [[American Revolution]]. Prior to this change, a crown had been located in this space, representing the authority of the monarchy during the British colonial period. The eagle rests upon a hemisphere. At the bottom is the date, 1625, ostensibly as the founding of [[New Amsterdam]], the colonial Dutch settlement which would later become the City of New York. This date, however, was chosen for somewhat unknown reasons and most historians believe no significant event actually occurred that year. The first Dutch settlers actually arrived in the region in 1624, and the town of New Amsterdam was incorporated in 1653.<ref>{{cite news |title=New York's Birth Date: Don't Go by City's Seal |first=Sam |last=Roberts |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/14/nyregion/14seal.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 14, 2008 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>
