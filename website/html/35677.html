'''Steam''' is a [[digital distribution]], [[digital rights management]], [[multiplayer]] and communications platform developed by [[Valve Corporation]]. It is used to distribute games and related media online, from small [[independent video game development|independent]] developers to larger software houses. Steam also has [[#Steam Community|community features]], automated game updates, and in-game voice and chat functionality.

As of 2010, there are over 1,400 games available through Steam<ref>{{cite web|title=Steam Holiday Sale On Now|url=http://store.steampowered.com/news/4816/|publisher=[[Valve Corporation]]|accessdate=21 December 2010}}</ref> and over 30 million "active" (logged into in last 30 days) user accounts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Steam Surpasses 30 Million Account Mark|url=http://store.steampowered.com/news/4502/|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=18 October 2010|date=18 October 2010}}</ref> Although Valve never releases sales figures, Steam is estimated to have a 70% share of the digital distribution market for video games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=26158 |title=Stardock Reveals Impulse, Steam Market Share Estimates |last=Graft|first=Kris|publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=November 21, 2009|date=November 19, 2009}}</ref>

Many major [[video game publisher|publishers]] have catalogues on Steam, including [[id Software]], [[Bethesda Softworks]], [[Electronic Arts]], [[Activision]], [[2K Games]], [[Ubisoft]], [[THQ]], [[Sega]], [[Codemasters]], [[LucasArts]], [[Capcom]], [[Rockstar Games]], [[Firaxis]] and [[Square Enix]].

==Client functionality==
Steam includes a digital storefront called the Steam Store, through which users can purchase [[computer games]] [[digital distribution|digitally]]. Once purchased, software is permanently attached to the user's Steam account. Content is delivered using a proprietary file transfer [[protocol (computing)|protocol]] from an international network of servers.<ref name="contentserver-stats">{{Cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/stats/content|title=Content Server Stats|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=November 15, 2008}} (click "View individual server statistics")</ref> While logged in, games can be downloaded to any computer that has the Steam client installed. Steam includes a [[Game server browser|server browser]] for users to search, filter, bookmark, and join [[Internet]] and [[Local Area Network|LAN]] [[server (computing)|servers]] for games that integrate with it. It can be accessed from the desktop or from a games menu system, and queries [[#Steam Community|friends]] to show a list of servers to which a user's contacts are connected. Currently accounts cannot be merged or deleted by their creators.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1558-QYAX-1965|title=SteamID, Steam Account Names, Merging Accounts and Deleting Accounts|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=June 16, 2010}}</ref>

Once [[Patch (computing)|patches]] for a user's installed software have been uploaded to Steam, they are applied the next time the user logs in or launches a game. Once a patch has been applied, it cannot be removed unless a patch is released which reverses the previous one. Individual games can be set to only update when requested by the user. Steam requires games to be fully patched before they can be played online, however.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

[[Valve Anti-Cheat]] (VAC), Valve's proprietary [[anti-cheat]] system, is available for online game servers to use. VAC-secured servers automatically detect users who are using [[Cheating in online games|cheats]].<ref>{{Cite web

===Localization===
Steam is currently available in the following languages: [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[English language|English]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Simplified Chinese]], [[Traditional Chinese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Thai language|Thai]].

Steam games are typically purchased through the integrated Steam Store via a web-based [[Online shopping#Logistics|basket/checkout]] system. Steam sells its products in [[United States dollar|US dollars]], [[Euro]]s and [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]], based on the user's location.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/news/2110/|title=Steam News – European Local Currency Available|date=2008-12-17|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=2008-12-18}}</ref>

===Mods===
{{See also|List of Steam titles#Modifications|l1=Steam Modifications}}
The Steam interface allows for user-defined shortcuts to be added. In this way [[mod (computer gaming)|third-party mods]], and games not purchased through the Steam Store, can use Steam features. Valve sponsors and distributes some mods for free,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://storefront.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/message/1843/|title=Steam mod hosting announcement|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=2008-10-01}}</ref> and mods that use [[#Steamworks|Steamworks]] can also use VAC, Friends, the server browser, and any Steam features supported by their parent game.

===Multiplayer lobbies and matchmaking===
Introduced in ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'' and made available through [[#Steamworks|Steamworks]], a lobby system allows for players to organize and agree on game settings before joining a server and a matchmaking system can automatically group players together based on a certain criteria.

===Steam Community===
[[File:Steam community.PNG|thumb|The Steam Community's homepage]]
On September 12, 2007, Valve released the Steam Community, a [[social network service]] that allows Steam users to communicate with each other on a [[many-to-many]] scale.<ref>{{Cite web
| url         = http://www.joystiq.com/2007/09/13/steam-community-officially-launched/

}}</ref> It is accessible from both the desktop (in a [[web browser]] or the Steam client) and through an "overlay" program that can be viewed on top of 3D-accelerated games. In January 2010, Valve reported that 10 million of the 25 million active Steam accounts had signed up to Steam Community.<ref name="steamgrowth_2009">{{Cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/news/3390/|title=Steam Realizes Extraordinary Growth in 2009|date=2010-01-29|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=29 January 2010}}</ref>

Notwithstanding privacy settings, a user's page includes some brief personal information, links to any friends' user pages, details of any games owned, the number of hours of playtime during the past two weeks, a 0–10 "Steam Rating" of activity,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_rating|title=Steam rating|work=Valve Developer Community|accessdate=November 3, 2007}}</ref> and links to any groups of which the user is a member. Users can also receive a feed of their friends' actions, including groups joined, games purchased, and Steam Achievements earned.
[[File:New steam ui chat.png|thumb|An [[instant messaging|IM]] conversation in Steam]]

Friends, Steam's [[instant messaging]] tool, supports both one-to-one and group conversations, held publicly or privately, and [[Peer-to-Peer]] [[Voice over IP|VoIP]]. It provides extended information about what games each user is playing, allowing others to join their contacts in Steam-integrated multiplayer games.

On July 1, 2010,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Steam Web APIs|url=http://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=4014|work=''[[Team Fortress 2]]'' blog|accessdate=2 July 2010|author=TF2 Team|date=1 July 2010}}</ref> Valve made an announcement about Steam Community being able to act as an [[OpenID]] provider, thus enabling authentication of user's SteamID without requiring them to enter their Steam username or password on any third-party site.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Steam Web API Documentation|url=http://steamcommunity.com/dev|work=Steam Community|publisher=[[Valve Corporation]]|accessdate=2 July 2010}}</ref>

===Steam Cloud===
Valve provides a service called Steam Cloud. For supported games, Steam Cloud stores various amounts of game data, such as keyboard shortcut settings and single-player game saves, on a central server. Any changes to relevant game files are uploaded to the main server, and newer files are automatically downloaded and used when a game is started.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/52906|title=Valve Announces Steam Cloud; Online Network to Store Saved Games Indefinitely|last=Breckon|first=Nick|date=May 29, 2008|accessdate=September 3, 2008|publisher=[[Shacknews]]}}</ref> Valve launched the service simultaneously with the release of ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'', and the service now supports most newer Valve games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/55705|title=Steam Cloud Launching With Left 4 Dead; Custom Settings To Be Automatically Backed Up, Applied|last=Faylor|first=Chris|date=September 3, 2008|accessdate=September 3, 2008|publisher=[[Shacknews]]}}</ref> It is one of the services offered to game developers through [[#Steamworks|Steamworks]]. Users can individually disable Steam Cloud on a per-game and per-account basis.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://store.steampowered.com/news/4012/ | title = Steam client update released | date = 2010-07-01 | publisher = [[Valve Corporation]] | accessdate = 2010-07-05 }}</ref>

===Downloadable content===
Steam offers a framework for selling and distributing [[downloadable content]] (DLC) for games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/news/2355/|title=Steam offers gamers in-game downloadable content|date=2009-03-16|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=2009-03-20}}</ref> DLC, if available, is listed on the game's Store page. New DLC releases are listed alongside full games in the "New Releases" section on the storefront.

===File system===
Steam-integrated games are stored as single non-compressed archive files with the extension <code>.gcf</code> (an acronym for '''G'''ame '''C'''ache '''F'''ile<ref>{{Cite web
| url         = http://supportwiki.steampowered.com/wiki/Game_cache_file_(GCF)
| title       = Game cache file (GCF)
| accessdate  = 20 January 2010
}}</ref>). Steam allocates space on the user's hard disk for <code>.gcf</code> files before downloading in order to reduce fragmentation which may occur when downloading large files and performing disk access. Game Cache Files help to make games more portable, stop users from accidentally overwriting important files, allow for easy modification of resources, and allows for validation of content for errors.<ref>{{Cite web
| url         = http://www.wunderboy.org/docs/gcfformat.php

| publisher   = [http://www.wunderboy.org/index.php Wunderboy.org]
| accessdate  = 20 January 2010

===Retail boxed games===
Users who buy selected boxed games sold at retail stores are required to register the game on Steam with the included CD key, which will then be attached to the user's Steam account in the same way as a digital purchase. The game will then act in every way like a digital copy. All of Valve's post-Steam games are sold in this fashion, as are around 20 third party titles (most notably the ''Call of Duty'' series, from ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2|Modern Warfare 2]]'' onward).<ref name="steamworks-home">{{cite web|title=Steamworks homepage|url=http://www.steampowered.com/steamworks/|publisher=Valve|accessdate=November 30th 2010}}</ref>

===Statistics collection===
Steam collects and reports anonymous metrics of its usage, stability, and performance.<ref name="valveprivacypolicy">{{Cite web|url=http://www.valvesoftware.com/privacy.htm|title=Valve Privacy Policy|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=2007-10-25}}</ref> With the exception of Valve's hardware survey,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/ hardware survey|title=Valve Hardware Survey |publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=2010-07-10}}</ref> most collection occurs without notifying the user or offering an opt-out. Some of these metrics are available publicly, such as what games are being played or statistics on player progress in certain games.<ref name="ep1stats">{{Cite web|url=http://steamgames.com/status/ep1/|title=Half-Life 2: Episode One Stats|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=2007-10-25}}</ref> Valve has also used information from these statistics to justify implementing new features in Steam, such as the addition of a [[defragmentation]] option for game caches.<ref name="defrag-news">{{Cite web|url=http://www.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/message/639/|title=Wednesday May 31, 2006 - Steam client update released|publisher=Valve Corporation|date=31 May 2006|accessdate=2006-10-26}}</ref> Announced on July 15, Steam will soon start offering users to allow Steam to collect the details of what programs are installed on their system which are listed within the [[List of Control Panel applets (Windows)|Windows' Programs and Features control panel]].<ref>http://store.steampowered.com/news/4073/</ref>

===Browser===
Steam includes a tabbed [[Webkit]] based browser which can be accessed in-game.

==Steamworks==<!--This section is linked from [[Steamworks]]-->
On January 28, 2008, Valve released Steamworks, a free development and publishing suite (granted at Valve's discretion or with an [[Unreal Engine 3]] license)<ref name="steamworks_demo">{{Cite web|url=http://www.steampowered.com/steamworks/FAQ.php|title=Steamworks FAQ|publisher=[[Valve Corporation]]|accessdate=March 14, 2020}}</ref><ref name="ue3_steamworks"/><ref name="ue3_steamworks">{{Cite web|url=http://epicgames.com/press_releases/steamworks.html|title=Steamworks  Integration Now Available to Unreal Engine 3 Licensees|publisher=[[Epic Games]]|date=March 11, 2010}}</ref> that gives developers access to every component of Steam.<ref name="api overview">{{Cite web|url=https://partner.steamgames.com/documentation/api|title=Steamworks API Overview|work=Steamworks partner site|publisher=Valve Corporation|date=May 1, 2008|accessdate=August 1, 2008}}</ref> Specifically, Steamworks provides means of games to integrate with the Steam client, including networking and player authentication tools for both server and peer-to-peer multiplayer games, matchmaking services, support for Steam community friends and groups, Steam statistics and achievements, integrated voice communications, and Steam Cloud support; the API also provides for anti-cheating devices and digital copy management.<ref name="api overview"/>  Steamworks can be combined with a standard Steam distribution agreement, the latter of which gives it advertising space in the Steam store but also provides Valve with a share of revenue; ''[[Audiosurf]]'' became the first game to be released in this way in February 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/12900/|title=Audiosurf purchase page|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=February 26, 2008}}</ref> Several major games have since implemented Steamworks, including ''[[Aliens vs. Predator (video game)|Aliens vs. Predator]]'', ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]'', ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'', ''[[Unreal Tournament 3]]'', and ''[[Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II]]''. Most games using the Steamworks [[Application Programming Interface|API]] also opt for a presence in the Steam store. The only known exceptions (since Valve does not make announcements about such games) are ''[[NBA 2K9]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/55472|title=NBA 2K9 PC Ships to Stores Without CD Keys; Update: Fix Through Steam|publisher=[[Shacknews]]|date=October 21, 2008|accessdate=October 28, 2008}}</ref>, and ''[[Supreme Commander 2]]'' for Mac OS X.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.igameradio.com/2010/08/11/vp-releases-supreme-commander-2-sys-reqs-will-launch-on-steam/|title=VP releases Supreme Commander 2 sys reqs, will launch on Steam|publisher=iGame Radio|date=11 August 2019|accessdate=9 October 2010}}</ref>

=== PlayStation 3 ===

[[Portal 2]]'s [[PlayStation 3]] release will include several Steamworks features, including cross-platform [[instant messaging]], [[#Steam Cloud|Steam Cloud]] for saved games, and the ability for PS3 owners to download Portal 2 from Steam (Windows or Mac) at no extra cost. Cross-platform play is also supported.<ref name="eurogamer11-ps3">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-01-18-portal-2-ps3-steam-cross-platform-play|title=Portal 2 PS3, Steam cross-platform play|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|date=January 18, 2011}}</ref> Valve said they "hope to expand upon this foundation with more Steam features and functionality in DLC and future content releases".

==Promotions==
Steam regularly offers a variety of promotions, which include Guest Passes, Free Weekends, and weekend-long sales.

"Guest Passes" are allocated to a user when he or she purchases an applicable game. The user can then share the passes with others who have not purchased the game, allowing the new user to play the game for a limited time (which varies depending on the game). Once an activated guest pass expires, the recipient will be prompted to purchase the game in order to continue playing. The number of guest passes available to a game purchaser is determined on a game-by-game basis, and they expire one month after being granted if not used.<ref name="guestpasssupport">{{Cite web|url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?p_faqid=549|title=Gifts and Guest Passes|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref>

"Free Weekends" are multi-player promotions in which a game becomes free to play on Steam for a weekend. When the promotion ends, the game files remain on the participating users' computers, but they are barred from playing further until they purchase the game.

Valve runs the subscription-based Valve Cyber Café Program,<ref name="cybercafehome">{{Cite web|url=https://cafe.steampowered.com/|title=Valve Cyber Café Program|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=November 7, 2007}}</ref> which is the only legal way for a cyber café to offer Steam-based games.

From December 6 to December 20, 2010, Steam had an ongoing "multi-game game" called "The Great Steam Treasure Hunt", where various objectives, both in Steam itself and in numerous games, where presented for a day, and the completion of ten or more gave the user a chance to win 100 free games at the end of it, as well as ongoing chances for users to win the top five games in their wish lists.

===Hardware promotions===
Steam keeps a record of the hardware in the computer it is running on for various purposes, one of which is enabling hardware manufacturers to run after-sale promotions directly to their customers. Both [[AMD]]'s ATi and [[nVidia]] use this feature: owners of ATi's [[Radeon]] video cards receive ''[[Half-Life 2: Lost Coast]]'' and ''[[Half-Life 2: Deathmatch]]'', as well as a discount on ''[[Half-Life 2]]'',<ref name="ati_offer1a">{{Cite web|url=http://steamgames.com/ati_offer1a/|title=ATi Steam Offer|publisher=Valve Corporation|date=May 30, 2007|accessdate=June 4, 2007}}</ref> while owners of nVidia's [[GeForce]] video cards receive ''Half-Life 2: Deathmatch'', ''Half-Life 2: Lost Coast'', ''Portal: First Slice'' and ''[[Peggle Extreme]]''.<ref name="nvidia_offer1a">{{Cite web|url=http://www.valvesoftware.com/news.php?id=1398|title=Portal: The First Slice for NVIDIA owners|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=2008-01-11}}</ref>

Prior to Steam, Valve had problems releasing updates for their online games, such as ''[[Counter-Strike]]'', wherein a patch would result in the disconnection of the larger part of the online user base for several days. They decided to make a platform which would update games automatically, and implement better [[anti-piracy]] and [[Cheating in online games#Anti-cheating methods and limitations|anti-cheat]] measures. Valve originally approached several companies—including [[Microsoft]], [[Yahoo!]], and [[RealNetworks]]—to build a client with these features, but all turned them down.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lee|first=James|title=The Last of the Independents?|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/the-last-of-the-independents-|publisher=GamesIndustry.biz|accessdate=2010-07-09}}</ref>

Steam's development began at an uncertain date prior to 2002. Working titles included "Grid" and "Gazelle".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gameguru.in/pc/2007/24/steam-registers-13-million-active-accounts/|title=Steam Registers 13 million Active Accounts|accessdate=2007-12-08}}</ref> It was revealed to the public on 22 March 2002 at the [[Game Developers Conference]], and was presented purely as a distribution network.<ref name="steam-announced">{{Cite web|url=http://gamespot.com/news/2857298.html|title=GDC 2002: Valve unveils Steam|publisher=[[GameSpot|GameSpot.com]]|date=22 March 2002|accessdate=7 September 2006}}</ref> To demonstrate the ease of integrating Steam to a game, [[Relic Entertainment]] had created a special version of ''[[Impossible Creatures]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Walker|first=Trey|title=GDC: Steam pushes software over Net|url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/gdc-steam-pushes-software-over-net/121632|publisher=ZDNet|accessdate=2010-07-09}}</ref> The game was ultimately not released on Steam, however.

Valve partnered with a number of companies including [[AT&T]], [[Acer Inc.|Acer]] and [[GameSpy]] Industries. The first [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]] on the system was ''[[Day of Defeat]]''.<ref name="salon2002">{{Cite web|last=James |first=Wagner |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/tech/feature/2002/04/16/modding/index.html |title=Triumph of the mod – Salon.com |publisher=Dir.salon.com |date=2002-04-16 |accessdate=2009-11-16}}</ref><ref name="herring1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.redherring.com/Home/6517 |title=A small games startup is gunning for big publishers |publisher=Redherring.com |date=2002-05-05 |accessdate=2009-11-16}}</ref> (See [[#Mods|Mods]].)

The Steam client was first made available for download in 2002 during the beta period for ''[[Counter-Strike]]'' 1.6. At that time, its primary function was streamlining the patch process common in online [[computer game]]s.

Around this time, Valve began negotiating contracts with several publishers and independent developers to release their products on Steam. ''[[Rag Doll Kung Fu]]'' and ''[[Darwinia (computer game)|Darwinia]]'' are two examples, and Canadian publisher [[Strategy First]] announced in December 2005 that it would be partnering with Valve for digital distribution of current and future titles.<ref>{{cite press release | publisher = [[Strategy First]] | date = 2005-12-08 | title = Strategy First to Deliver Multiple Titles On-Line via Steam | url = http://www.strategyfirst.com/press/DisplayArticle.asp?sLanguageCode=EN&iArticleID=3250 | accessdate = 2010-07-09 }}</ref> In 2002, [[Gabe Newell]] the head of Valve said he was offering mod teams a game engine license and distribution over Steam for $995.<ref name="salon2002" />

===''Half-Life 2'' release===
{{Main|Half-Life 2#Distribution|l1=Half-Life 2 Distribution}}
On November 16, 2004, ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' was officially released. The title required activation via Steam in order to play the game. Later in the day of the launch, a significant number of buyers (both through Steam and retail) found themselves unable to play the game, due in part to a bottleneck of Valve's Steam system. The European authentication servers went down for a reported 5 hours before being fixed, preventing those with accounts stored on them from unlocking or playing the game.<ref name="hl2down">{{Cite web|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/en/inquirer/news/2004/11/16/half-life-authentication-servers-steam-up|title=Half Life authentication servers steam up|accessdate=2007-12-09}}</ref> Other problems included long download times, glitches, and seemingly unnecessary updates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.netjak.com/review.php/780 Netjak review|title=Half Life 2 Review|accessdate=2007-12-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sharkyextreme.com/features/games/article.php/3449611|title=Half Life 2 Review|accessdate=2007-12-09}}</ref><ref name="hl2fire">{{Cite web|url=http://www.contractoruk.com/news/001819.html|title=Half Life 2 fires up web users|publisher=Contractor UK Limited|accessdate=2008-02-19}}</ref> Some customers buying the in-store game had found that the CD keys with the game had already been hacked, users contacting support were told to wait for at least two weeks for a solution.<ref name="inq1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1017268/steam-comes-out-of-half-life-2-players-ears|title=Steam comes out of Half Life 2 players' ears|last=Harris|first=Wil|date=2005-01-31|accessdate=2010-03-11}}</ref> It came second in [[1UP.com]]'s Top 5 Botched PC Gaming Launches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3166996|title=Top 5 Botched PC Game Launches|publisher=1UP.com|accessdate=2008-04-07}}</ref>

Many hacks sprang up following ''Half-Life 2's'' launch, each claiming to be able to circumvent Steam and enable the user to get the games for free.<ref name="hl2fire" /> Valve responded to these hacks by patching the servers and disabling accounts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4041289.stm|title=Ban hits Half-Life 2 pirates hard|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=November 25, 2004|accessdate=February 2, 2008}}</ref>

===Profitability===

In 2005, the first third-party games began to appear on Steam. Valve also announced that Steam was starting to be profitable, if only due to some highly successful Valve games. Although digital distribution was still no match to retail in terms of sales volume, profit margins for Valve and developers were far bigger on Steam than at retail.<ref name="hr-2005">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000955338|title=Digital distribution: Keep the money and run?|publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=2005-06-13|accessdate=2010-01-31|quote=Valve won't talk about how many units it's sold through Steam, but Lombardi describes the venture as being "extremely successful.

In 2007, big developer-publishers such as [[id Software]], [[Eidos Interactive]] and [[Capcom]] started to distribute their games on Steam. In May 2007, 13 million accounts had been created on Steam, and 150 games were for sale on the platform.<ref>{{Cite web

===Interface update and Mac OS X release===
On 23 February 2010, Valve released a public beta for a major update to the Steam client.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/uiupdate/|title=A Brand New Steam|date=February 23, 2010|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=February 24, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/62488|title=Valve Launches Public Beta For New Steam UI|last=Leahy|first=Brian|date=February 23, 2010|publisher=Shacknews|accessdate=February 24, 2010}}</ref> The update added a new "Library" panel and the [[Layout engine|rendering engine]] for the Store and Community pages—including the in-game overlay engine—was changed from [[Internet Explorer]]'s [[Trident (layout engine)|Trident engine]] to a [[WebKit]] implementation.

Upon launch, over 50 games, most supporting the ''SteamPlay'' feature, were available for the client.

===Linux===
Based on Valve's website "There are no plans to create a native [[Linux]] Steam Client at this time."<ref>https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1313-QIPD-5381</ref> Following the announcement of Steam for [[Mac OS X]], Linux benchmark and news website ''[[Phoronix]]'' found Linux-related references in a beta release of the Mac Steam client.

===PlayStation 3===
At [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010|E3 2010]] Valve announced that Steamworks would arrive on the [[PlayStation 3]] with ''[[Portal 2]]''. It will provide automatic updates, community support, downloadable content and other unannounced features.<ref name="Gamespot E3 Portal 2">[http://e3.gamespot.com/story/6265808/portal-2-steamworks-ps3-bound-in-2011]</ref>

===Steam Translation Server===

In March 2010 Valve launched the [https://translation.steampowered.com/ Steam Translation Server], which is a service that allows Steam users to help in the translation of Steam and a selected library of Steam games.  The service was undergoing a closed beta until October 2010. Since then, every Steam user has the ability to apply as a translator.

===Webmoney support===
On 18 December 2010, Valve officially launched support for [[Webmoney]] payment system. It can be used from the following countries: Azerbaijan, Belarus, Czech Republic,  Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russian Federation, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United Arab Emirates.<ref name='News - WebMoney Now Available on Steam'>http://store.steampowered.com/news/4806/</ref>

==Criticism==
===Regional restrictions and pricing===
[[File:Steam_regional_limitation.PNG|thumb|Some games purchased in one region become unplayable if user moves to another.]]
Steam allows developers and publishers to change prices and restrict game availability depending on the user's location. This can cause some games to cost more than retail prices, despite digital distribution removing the costs of manufacturing, packaging, design, and logistics.<ref name="cnetsteamed">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com.au/broadband/0,239036008,339288255,00.htm|title=Getting Steamed: digital distribution for games isn't there yet|last=Craig|first=Simms|date=April 18, 2008|accessdate=April 25, 2008|publisher=[[CNET]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lovemoney.com/news/ways-to-save/how-your-pc-can-entertain-you-for-less-4028.aspx |title=How your PC can entertain you for less |publisher=Lovemoney.com |date=2009-10-14 |accessdate=2009-11-16}}</ref><ref name="steamworks_pubservs">{{Cite web|url=http://steamgames.com/steamworks/publishingservices.php|title=Steamworks publishing services|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=November 22, 2008}}</ref>

Valve also restricts game registration and playability to the buyer's country of residence. One example of this regional restriction can be seen where Valve uses Steam's authentication to prevent boxed versions of their games sold in Russia and Thailand, which are priced significantly lower than elsewhere, from being used outside those territories.<ref name="thai_restrictions_07">{{Cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/49656|title=Valve Responds to Steam Territory Deactivations (Updated)|last=Breckon|first=Nick|date=October 29, 2007|accessdate=November 26, 2007|publisher=ShackNews}}</ref>

Steam offers products in three [[currencies]]; [[US Dollar]], [[Euro]] and [[Pound Sterling]]. The currency is selected automatically based on the user's location, and cannot be changed. Due to how Steam handles the [[US Dollar]] to [[Euro]]/[[Pound Sterling]] conversion,  prices in [[Eurozone]] countries are often much higher than in the United States, which has led to much criticism from European Steam users since the Euro support was introduced on December 12, 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.techpowerup.com/79349/Valve_Inflicts_European_Gamers_with_$1_=_%E2%82%AC1_Equation.html|title=Valve Inflicts European Gamers with $1 = €1 Equation|date=December 19, 2008|accessdate=December 20, 2008}}</ref>

===Authentication===
It is necessary to authenticate every Steam game online, whether purchased via Steam itself or installed via a retail disc, the first time it is played.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Reimer |first=Jeremy |url=http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2005/09/5351.ars |title=Microsoft previews online software purchasing with the Digital Locker |publisher=Ars Technica |date=2005-09-26 |accessdate=2009-11-16}}</ref> After the initial authentication, an offline mode allows games to be run without being connected to your Steam account.

According to the Steam Subscriber Agreement, Steam's availability is not guaranteed and Valve is under no legal obligation to release an update disabling the authentication system in the event that Steam becomes permanently unavailable.<ref name="ssa">{{Cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/|title=Steam Subscriber Agreement|publisher=Valve Corporation|accessdate=January 31, 2009}}</ref>

Despite this, [[Gabe Newell]], CEO of Valve, said in a post on the Steam User Forums that "Unless there was some situation I don't understand, we would presumably disable authentication before any event that would preclude the authentication servers from being available." He added, "We've tested disabling authentication, and it works."{{Fact|date=December 2010}}
