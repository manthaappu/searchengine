<html> <head> <title>Range tree</title></head><body>In [[computer science]], a '''range tree''' is an [[ordered tree data structure|ordered tree]] [[data structure]] to hold a list of points. It allows all points within a given range to be efficiently retrieved, and is typically used in two or higher dimensions. 

It is similar to a [[kd-tree]] except with faster query times of [[Big O notation|O]](log<sub>''d''</sub> ''n'' + ''k'') but worse storage of O(''n'' log<sub>(''d''-1)</sub> ''n''), with ''d'' being the dimension of the space, ''n'' being the number of points in the tree, and ''k'' being the number of points retrieved for a given query.

Range trees may be contrasted with [[interval tree]]s: instead of storing points and allowing points in a given range to be retrieved efficiently, an interval tree stores intervals and allows the intervals containing a given point to be retrieved efficiently.
