<blockquote>
Mantras, the Sanskrit syllables inscribed on yantras, are essentially "thought forms" representing divinities or cosmic powers, which exert their influence by means of sound-vibrations.<ref name=Khanna1979 >{{citation | last=Khanna | first=Madhu | year=1979 | title=Yantra : the tantric symbol of cosmic unity | publisher=Thames and Hudson | isbn=9780500272343 | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/247371657|page=21}}</ref>

==Working definitions==
A number of ''prima facie'' unrelated definitions have been suggested:
*An image or images held in the mind of a practitioner which aids in the [[manifestation]] of intent. An agency of psychic effect which exists and takes form on the pre-physical realms of existence, which acts in accord with the Intent of its creator(s).<ref>

*A living spiritual being created by humans. It could be a magical person's helper, or a being created by the belief in it from masses of people.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | title = The Mystic Cauldron | url=http://mysticcauldron.com/dictionary2.html | accessdate = 2007-02-26}}</ref>
*A [[homunculus]] of awareness:  an instantaneous observer / observed duality. They are created by everyone every moment (in some formulations they are everyone every moment); and they possess wills of their own.

==Thoughtforms and Annie Besant==
[[Thought Forms]] is a book by [[Annie Besant]] and [[C.W. Leadbeater]] that studies the nature and power of [[thought]]s (ISBN 0-8356-0008-4). It states that thoughts have two effects: "a radiating [[oscillation|vibration]] and a floating form". 

Thought forms are divided into three classes:
*That which takes the image of the thinker.
*That which takes the image of some [[material]] [[Object (philosophy)|object]].
*That which takes a form entirely its own, expressing its inherent qualities in the [[matter]] which it draws round it.

The effect of [[music]], [[emotions]], and [[colors]] on thought forms is also studied in the book.

The effect of the music of [[Mendelssohn]] (No. 9 of his "Songs without words"), [[Gounod]] (Soldiers Chorus from "Faust") and [[Richard Wagner]] (Overture to "The Meistersingers") is studied. The music of Wagner produced a "marvellous mountain-range" on the thought forms.

==Thoughtform in popular culture==
{{Trivia|date=February 2008}}
Many authors and artists have since used tulpas in their works, both in the context of fiction and in writing about mysticism. Horror author [[Clive Barker]], for example, envisioned his famous "[[Candyman (slasher)|Candy Man]]" killer to be nothing more than a myth gone terribly awry in his original story.

===Television===
* In the ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' episode ''[[The X-Files (season 6)#Arcadia|Arcadia]]'' (6X13), the president of the homeowners' association for an exclusive gated community uses a tulpa to enforce the neighborhood rules; those who repeatedly violate the guidelines meet a grisly fate at its hands. 

* The ''[[Supernatural (TV series)|Supernatural]]'' episode ''Hell House'' (1.17) features a haunted house in which the resident malevolent spirit turns out to be a tulpa, created when the beliefs of thousands of website visitors are focused through a Tibetan [[Sigil (magic)|sigil]] painted on one wall of the house.

* In the ''[[So Weird]]'' episode ''PK (or Tulpa)''. Fi meets a little boy who is troublesome and it is caused because of a Tulpa he creates. He thinks it is an [[imaginary friend]] but Fi tells him it's some type of energy he created and helps him solve it.

* In ''Tears of Kali'' by [[Andreas Marschall]], an entity becomes an evil murderer that can't be controlled.

*In ''[[Paranoia Agent]]'', the character [[Characters from Paranoia Agent#Li.27l Slugger|Lil' Slugger]] (Shonen Bat) is revealed to have materialized thanks to the growing hysteria caused when [[Tsukiko Sagi]] claimed he attacked her.

*''The Tulpa'' is a [[Canadian]] [[short film]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0466498/ The Tulpa (2005)]</ref>

===Literature===

* In ''Every Which Way But Dead'' by [[Kim Harrison]], 'Tulpa' is the focus word used to create a three-dimensional circle in the main character, Rachel Morgan's imagination, and is used to hold an overflow of power.

* In ''[[American Gods]]'' by [[Neil Gaiman]], various deity-like beings are created through cultural belief, a certain society's perception of, say, Odin, creating a form of that god particular to that society.

* In ''[[It (novel)|It]]'' by [[Stephen King]], the eponymous entity's various manifestations are given form and power by the belief of the townspeople.

*In ''Outcast'' by [[Lynne Ewing]], the main character, Kyle, is confronted and pestered by a tulpa of his own creation, that convinces him that he is his lost twin brother.

*In [[Grant Morrison]]’s [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[limited series]] ''[[Fantastic Four: 1234]]'' (2002) [[Reed Richards]] muses on a fictitious journey to [[Tibet]] where, with the help of [[Bön]] priest, he creates a Tulpa, a “thoughtform”.  After Richards names it ‘Victor’ the Tulpa takes on a life of its own, becoming Richards’ opposite number.  This was an alternative, fantastical, origin for Richards’ arch enemy [[Dr Doom]] (aka Victor Von Doom). 

*According to the book ''The Teachings of Don Juan Matus'', a Mexican shaman by the name of [[Don Juan Matus]], who had taught his student [[Carlos Castaneda]], the books author, about the true nature of the physical universe and how intense concentration can summon, [[apport]], and even materialize objects out of thin air. It was said that [[Carlos Castaneda]] was able to materialize a living squirrel on the palm of Don Juan's hand based on the latter's instruction.<ref>The Teachings
of Don Juan Matus</ref> Many of his claims have been disputed by members of the [[Anthropology|anthropological]] profession.<ref>[http://peyote.com/carlos-castaneda/academia.html PEYOTE'S HALLUCINATIONS SPAWN REAL-LIFE ACADEMIC FEUD]</ref>

* In ''Secrets & Mysteries of the World'' by [[Sylvia Browne]], chapter 7: Tulpas, explains brief story of old Tulpas and new Tulpas from England.

* In ''The Mothman Prophecies'' by John A. Keel, the author alludes to several ghost and UFO sightings as likely being tulpas.

* In ''Las Ruinas Circulares'' by [[Jorge Luis Borges]], a man is created from dream and given substance.

* In ''[[The Wheel of Darkness]]'' by [[Douglas Preston]] and [[Lincoln Child]], a tulpa is created.

* In [[Warren Ellis]]'s ''[[Doktor Sleepless]]'' the title character creates a Tulpa of himself allowing for one to be imprisoned while the other goes free.

*Alvin Schwartz, writer of Superman comics during the '40s and '50s, writes in his book, ''An Unlikely Prophet'' about a tulpa he meets, named Thongden. The tulpa educates Schwartz about his own tulpa, Superman. ISBN 0965952126 and ISBN 978-0965952125

*Starting in July 1989, [[Alan Grant (writer)]] wrote a story arc for [[Batman]] entitled "Tulpa", in which a Tibetan man creates entities to steal for him in order to repay a mob boss.

* In the ''[[Fables (Vertigo)|Fables]]'' series of graphic novels by [[Bill Willingham]], the lifespan/health/vitality of each of the "Fable" characters (i.e., Snow White, Goldilocks, etc...) is directly tied into the degree of popularity or belief that real "mundy" (mundane) humans have in them, implying that they are willed into existence by the thoughts of humans.

===Games===
*In the [[role-playing game]] ''Over the Edge'', tulpas are used as background characters (NPC's). They also have natural enemies, sociopathic individuals called "Sandmen", who prey on them to create either "Nightmare" (a drug) or "Dreamweb" (gossamer webs that can capture dreams from people). Dreamweb are typically used to capture the nightmares of neurotic individuals, which are also sold as something like a drug.
*Although the word "Tulpa" is never used in the ''Changeling: the Dreaming'' RPG, creatures known as "Chimera" fulfill a role very similar to Tulpa.  Chimera may be sentient or non-sentient entities made manifest in the mental alternate reality of "The Dreaming".  They typically arise spontaneously due to the force of human thought and emotion, sometimes from the dreams of individuals but potentially as amalgams of all human thought.  These beings are typically weakened by exposure to human doubt, but nevertheless some have the necessary strength and abilities to manifest as tangible entities in the mundane world of humans, at least for a time.
*In the [[alternate reality game]] ''The Hunt for Sammex83'', it is said that the Sammex83 is a tulpa that lives in both the Internet and the real world.
