<html> <head> <title>Irregular matrix</title></head><body>An '''irregular matrix''', or '''ragged matrix''', can be described as a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] that has a different number of elements in each row. Ragged matrices are not used in [[linear algebra]], since standard matrix transformations cannot be performed on them, but they are useful as [[array data structure|array]]s in [[computing]]. Irregular matrices are typically stored using [[Iliffe vector]]s.

For example, the following is an irregular matrix:

:<math>
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 31 & 12& -3 \\
    7 & 2 \\
    1 & 2 & 2
  \end{bmatrix}
</math>
