<html> <head> <title>Structured program theorem</title></head><body>The '''structured program theorem''' is a result in [[programming language]] theory. It states that every [[computable function]] can be implemented in a programming language that combines subprograms in only three specific ways. These three [[control structure]]s are
#Executing one subprogram, and then another subprogram (sequence)
#Executing one of two subprograms according to the value of a [[Boolean data type|boolean]] variable (selection)
#Executing a subprogram until a boolean variable is true (repetition)
Computer scientists usually credit the theorem to a 1966 paper by [[Corrado Böhm]] and [[Giuseppe Jacopini]]. However, [[David Harel]] traced its origins to the 1946 description of the [[von Neumann architecture]] and [[Stephen Kleene]]'s [[Kleene normal form|normal form theorem]].

The Böhm-Jacopini proof describes how to construct a structured flow chart from an arbitrary chart, using the [[bit]]s in an extra integer variable to keep track of information that the original program represents by the program location. This construction was based on Böhm's programming language [[P′′]]. The Böhm-Jacopini proof did not settle the question of whether to adopt [[structured programming]] for software development, partly because the construction was more likely to obscure a program than to improve it. On the contrary, it signalled the beginning of the debate. [[Edsger Dijkstra]]'s famous letter, "[[Go To Statement Considered Harmful]]," followed in 1968. Subsequent proofs of the theorem addressed practical shortcomings of the Böhm-Jacopini proof with constructions that maintained or improved the clarity of the original program.[http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/111F04/greatidea3.html]

In the 1980s [[IBM]] researcher [[Harlan Mills]] oversaw the development of the [[COBOL Structuring Facility]], which applied a structuring algorithm to [[COBOL]] code. Mills's transformation involved the following steps for each procedure.

#Identify the [[basic block]]s in the procedure.
#Assign a unique [[Label (programming language)|label]] to each block's entry path, and label each block's exit paths with the labels of the entry paths they connect to. Use 0 for return from the procedure and 1 for the procedure's entry path.
#Break the procedure into its basic blocks.
#For each block that is the destination of only one exit path, reconnect that block to that exit path.
#Declare a new variable in the procedure (called L for reference).
#On each remaining unconnected exit path, add a statement that sets L to the label value on that path.
#Combine the resulting programs into a selection statement that executes the program with the entry path label indicated by L
#Construct a loop that executes this selection statement as long as L is not 0.
#Construct a sequence that initializes L to 1 and executes the loop.

Note that this construction can be improved by converting some cases of the selection statement into subprocedures.
