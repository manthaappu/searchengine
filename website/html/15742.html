A '''graphics library''' is a [[Computer program|program]] [[Library (computing)|library]] designed to aid in rendering [[computer graphics]] to a monitor. This typically involves providing optimized versions of functions that handle common [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] tasks. This can be done purely in [[Computer software|software]] and running on the [[Central processing unit|CPU]], common in [[embedded system]]s, or being [[Computer hardware|hardware]] accelerated by a [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]], more common in [[Personal computer|PCs]]. By employing these functions, a program can assemble an image to be output to a monitor. This relieves the programmer of the task of creating and optimizing these functions, and allows them to focus on building the graphics program.
