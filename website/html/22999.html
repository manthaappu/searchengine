The '''MODAF Meta-Model''' (or M3, for short) is the underlying model for the [[UK Ministry of Defence|UK MoD]] Architecture Framework ([[MODAF]]). It defines a [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] profile (abstract syntax only) by extending the UML 2.1 Meta-Model. The M3 was one of the key inputs to the [[Object Management Group|OMG]] [[UPDM]] specification.

Version 1.1 of the M3 was released on 18 May 2007. The current version 1.2.004, was released in May 2010.
