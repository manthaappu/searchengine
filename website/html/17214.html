The Parallel '''High Performance Preconditioners''' ('''hypre''') is a library of [[computer code|routines]] for [[scalability|scalable]] ([[parallel computing|parallel]]) solution of linear systems. The built-in [[BLOPEX]] package in addition allows solving [[eigenvalue]] problems. The main strength of '''Hypre''' is availability of high performance parallel [[multigrid]] [[preconditioning|preconditioners]] for both structured and unstructured grid problems, see (Falgout et. al., 2005, 2006). 

Currently, '''Hypre''' supports only [[real number|real]] [[double-precision]] arithmetic. '''Hypre''' uses the [[Message Passing Interface]]  (MPI) standard for all message-passing communication.  The current beta version of '''Hypre''' is 2.6.0b; released 2010/02/04. [[PETSc]] has an interface to call '''Hypre''' [[preconditioning|preconditioners]]. 

'''Hypre''' is being developed and is supported by members of the Scalable Linear Solvers project within the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]].

== Features ==

'''hypre''' provides the following features:

* Parallel vectors and  matrices, using several different interfaces
* Scalable parallel [[preconditioning|preconditioners]]
* Built-in [[BLOPEX]]
