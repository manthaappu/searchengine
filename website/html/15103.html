'''Geoff Peterson''' is the robot skeleton sidekick for ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' on [[CBS]]. His debut appearance was on Monday, April 5, 2010. Geoff Peterson was designed and built by [[Grant Imahara]] of the [[Discovery Channel]] show ''[[Mythbusters]]''.<ref name="Myth Busters">{{cite web| url= http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/mythbusters/projects/4350887| title=Craig Ferguson's New Mythbuster Robot Sidekick: Exclusive Pics| date=2010-04-02| publisher= [[Popular Mechanics]]| accessdate=2010-07-29}}</ref> He has blue eyes, a metal [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] and wears an over-sized brown suit. He also wears a [[Price is Right]] name tag that reads "Geoff", and a [[Comicon]] 2010 button on a lanyard.

==History==
The idea of Geoff Peterson came from [[Craig Ferguson]]'s comedic complaining that his show suffered due to its lack of a band or sidekick. (He even used to talk to his "non-existent-sidekick" and then reply to himself, i.e. "Isn't that right non-existent-sidekick? That's right Craig".) This coupled with an expressed desire to have his own "[[Robot Skeleton Army]]", a reference to the cybernetic creatures from the ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]'' series of movies and the name of his legion of [[Twitter]] followers, led to the creation of a robot sidekick named Geoff, designed by Imahara.

Actress and frequent Late Late Show guest [[Kristin Bell]] consistently expresses hostility towards Geoff, claiming that she had always wanted to be Ferguson's Late Late Show sidekick.  This has since become a comical rivalry between the two both on and off the show; e.g. when Geoff was speaking to and interviewing the various stars of the film [[You Again]] at its red carpet premiere, Bell began chiding Peterson, one of the few moments off the Late Late Show where she expresses her disdain towards him.

On December 8, 2010 [[Russell Brand]] was a guest on the show, where he jokingly poured water on Geoff and knocked the top of his head off. This made Craig noticeably frustrated but the show continued on anyway. Later on in the show Craig commented to Geoff "You shouldn't have pissed him off!" The episode finished with Craig cradling the top of Geoff's skull in his arms.

==Idea behind Peterson==
Peterson is meant to parody the traditional "[[sidekick]]" role such as those played by [[Ed McMahon]], [[Paul Shaffer]], and [[Andy Richter]]. The idea of the "Robot Sidekick" evolved from the fact that [[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show]] has a minuscule budget, but also stems from Ferguson's oft-stated aim of deconstructing the conventions of the contemporary late-night chat shows in a surreal and satirical way.

==General Persona==
Geoff's collection of pre-recorded comments are voiced noticeably sarcastically. The idea behind the comments is to add to [[Craig Ferguson]]'s comedic style of [[self-deprecation]].

==Features==
Peterson's mouth moves when he talks. His head turns side to side and his right arm can move up and down. Originally, his voice was a loud, obnoxious monotone with an English accent, voiced by Craig Ferguson, but this was changed after the first week. Now his voice sounds similar to that of [[George Takei]], but is performed by voice actor [[Josh Robert Thompson]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2590280 imdb.com]</ref> According to Craig Ferguson, Geoff Peterson might be a gay robot. Craig has also said that it really doesn't matter what Geoff's personal sexual preference is, as Geoff's genitals have been held up in customs. Craig explains the missing genitals as the reason Geoff stands behind a podium as well.

Because of his most recent upgrade, Geoff can now shake his head, keep his mouth open, and use his right hand to perform what seems to suggest a [[Human sexual activity|sexual act]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Craig noted that this is because his "wise ass" chip was activated.

==Duties==
Peterson makes comments occasionally throughout the show and helps introduce the [[e-mail]]/[[Twitter]] portion of the show.

* His comments are broad and often said as a segue to another joke or to make fun of something else, including Peterson himself, or as humorous [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]]s.
* He is featured in one of the "Tweets and E-mails" jingles, in a parody of a [[Bollywood]] [[Filmi]] musical performance. [[Terminator (character)|Terminator]]-esque robot skeletons, which pre-date Peterson, appear in jingles that parody the musical performances of artists such as [[Kraftwerk]], [[David Bowie]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Johnny Cash]].
* His best-known expression is "in your pants," often triggered to add sexual [[innuendo]] to statements by Ferguson during the show's [[cold open]], the monologue, or a guest interview.
* Peterson has also been sent "on assignment" to interview celebrities at film openings, in the style of red-carpet entertainment reporters. In those instances, where the segment is pre-recorded, his vocabulary is considerably larger and he interacts more directly with his interviewees.
