<html> <head> <title>Novelty detection</title></head><body>'''Novelty detection''' is the identification of new or unknown [[data]] or signals that a [[machine learning]] system is not aware of during training<ref name="markou">M. Markou, S. Singh, Novelty detection: A review, part 1: Statistical approaches, Signal Processing 83, 2481â€“2497, 2003</ref>. Novelty detection is one-class classification. The known data form one class, and a novelty-detection method tries to identify [[outlier]]s that differ from the distribution of ordinary data, which formed the single data class<ref name="markou"/>. Compared to [[multi-class classification]], [[one-class classification]] is useful if [[outliers]] are sparse compared to ordinary data.
