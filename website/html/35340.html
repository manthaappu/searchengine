{{Wiktionary|disc|disk}}

'''Disc''' and '''disk''' are the two alternative spellings of the descriptive word for things of a generally thin and circular geometry. These variations are due to the way in which the words originated. The discussion here somewhat focuses on how the word applies to data-storage [[Media (communication)|media]]. See [[Disc (disambiguation)]] for other meanings.

The earlier word is ''disk'', which came into the [[English language]] in the middle of the 17th century, and (probably following pre-existing words such as ''risk'') it was spelled with a ''k''. The spelling ''disc'' was introduced in the 18th century, following an increasing tendency to base the spelling of words on their roots: in this case the [[Latin]] word ''discus'' and the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word ''δισκος'' (note that ''[[kappa]]'' in Greek is usually [[transliterate]]d by ''c'' rather than ''k''). In the 19th century, ''disc'' became the conventional spelling for [[audio recording]]s made on a flat plate, such as the [[gramophone record]]; this usage gave rise to the modern term ''[[disc jockey]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bartleby.com/61/16/C0521600.html |title= Compact disk |year= 2000 |work= [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]] |publisher= Bartleby.com}}</ref>{{Dead link|date=December 2010}} Early [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] technicians differentiated between ''disks'' (in-house transcription records) and ''discs'' (the colloquial term for commercial gramophone records, or what the BBC dubbed CGRs).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.btinternet.com/~roger.beckwith/bh/grams/grams_4.htm |title= Test Records |date= 2008-03-12 |accessdate= 2008-06-11 |author=Barry Taylor |publisher= [[BT Group|BTInternet]]}}</ref>

By the 20th century, the ''c''-spelling was more popular in [[British English]], while the ''k''-spelling was preferred in [[American English]]. In the 1950s, when the American company [[IBM]] pioneered the first [[hard disk drive]] storage devices, the ''k''-spelling was used. Consequently, in [[computer jargon]] today it is common for the ''k''-spelling to refer mainly to magnetic storage devices (particularly in British English, where the term ''disk'' is sometimes regarded as a contraction of ''[[diskette]]'', a much later word and actually a diminutive of ''disk'').

Some latter-day storage device manufacturers prefer the ''c''-spelling. In 1979 the Dutch company [[Philips]], along with [[Sony]], developed the [[compact disc]] medium; here, the ''c''-spelling was chosen. The ''c''-spelling is now used consistently for optical media such as the compact disc and similar technologies.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/disc.html |title=Common Errors in English |author=Paul Brians |publisher=[[Washington State University]] |accessdate= 2008-06-11}}</ref>
