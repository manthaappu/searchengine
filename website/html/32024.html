<html> <head> <title>Rhyme</title></head><body>A '''rhyme''' is a repetition of similar sounds in two or more words and is most often used in [[poetry]] and [[song]]s. The word "rhyme" may also refer to a short poem, such as a rhyming [[couplet]] or other brief rhyming poem such as [[nursery rhyme]]s.

==Etymology==
The word ''rime'', derived from [[Old Frankish language]] ''*rīm'', a Germanic term meaning "series, sequence" attested in Old English (Old English ''rīm'' - "enumeration, series, numeral") and Old High German ''rīm'', ultimately cognate to Old Irish ''rím'', [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{polytonic|ἀριθμός}}'' ''arithmos'' "number".

The spelling ''rhyme'' (from original ''rime'') was introduced at the beginning of the Modern English period, due to a learned (but etymologically incorrect) association with  [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{polytonic|ῥυθμός}}'' (''rhythmos'', [[rhythm]]).

The older spelling ''rime'' survives in Modern English as a rare alternative spelling.  A distinction between the spellings is also sometimes made in the study of [[linguistics]] and [[phonology]], where ''rime/rhyme'' is used to refer to the [[Syllable nucleus|nucleus]] and [[Syllable coda|coda]] of a [[syllable]].  In this context, some prefer to spell this ''rime'' to separate it from the poetic rhyme covered by this article (see [[syllable rime]]).

==Types of rhyme==

The word ''rhyme'' can be used in a specific and a general sense. In the specific sense, two words rhyme if their final stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical; two lines of poetry rhyme if their final strong positions are filled with rhyming words. A rhyme in the strict sense is also called a [[perfect rhyme]]. Examples are ''sight'' and ''flight'', ''deign'' and ''gain'', ''madness'' and ''sadness''. 

===Perfect rhymes===

Perfect rhymes can be classified according to the number of syllables included in the rhyme , which is dictated by the location of the final stressed syllable. 

* '''[[Masculine rhyme|masculine]]:''' a rhyme in which the stress is on the final syllable of the words.  (''rhyme'', ''sublime'')
* '''[[Feminine rhyme|feminine]]:''' a rhyme in which the stress is on the penultimate (second from last) syllable of the words.  (''picky'', ''tricky'')
* '''dactylic:''' a rhyme in which the stress is on the antepenultimate (third from last) syllable (''cacophonies'', ''Aristophanes'')

===General rhymes===

In the general sense, ''general rhyme'' can refer to various kinds of phonetic similarity between words, and to the use of such similar-sounding words in organizing verse.  Rhymes in this general sense are classified according to the degree and manner of the phonetic similarity:

* '''[[syllable rhyme|syllabic]]:''' a rhyme in which the last syllable of each word sounds the same but does not necessarily contain vowels.  (''cleaver'', ''silver'', or ''pitter'', ''patter'')
* '''imperfect:''' a rhyme between a stressed and an unstressed syllable. (''wing'', ''caring'')
* '''semirhyme:''' a rhyme with an extra syllable on one word.  (''bend'', ''ending'')
* '''oblique (or slant/forced):''' a rhyme with an imperfect match in sound. (''green'', ''fiend''; ''one'', ''thumb'')
* '''[[assonance]]:''' matching vowels. (''sh'''a'''ke'', ''h'''a'''te'') Assonance is sometimes used to refer to slant rhymes.
* '''[[literary consonance|consonance]]:''' matching consonants. ('''''r'''a'''b'''ie'''s''', '''r'''o'''bb'''er'''s''''')
*'''[[half rhyme]]''' (or '''sprung rhyme'''): matching final consonants.  (''be'''nt''''', ''a'''nt''''')
* '''[[alliteration]]''' (or '''head rhyme'''): matching initial consonants. ('''''sh'''ort'','''''sh'''ip'')

A rhyme is not classified as a rhyme if one of the words being rhymed is the entirety of the other word. For example Ball and all.

As stated above, in a perfect rhyme the last stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical in both words.  If the sound preceding the stressed vowel is also identical, the rhyme is sometimes considered to be inferior and not a perfect rhyme after all.<ref>[http://myclasses.net/smiser/cwp/rhyme.html], which cites ''Whitfield's University Rhyming Dictionary'', 1951</ref><ref>[http://www.michael-thomas.com/music/songwriting/rhyming.htm]</ref> An example of such a "super-rhyme" or "more than perfect rhyme" is the "identical rhyme", in which not only the vowels but also the onsets of the rhyming syllables are identical, as in ''gun'' and ''begun''. Punning rhymes such are "bare" and "bear" are also identical rhymes. The rhyme may of course extend even farther back than the last stressed vowel. If it extends all the way to the beginning of the line, so that there are two lines that sound identical, then it is called a "holorhyme" ("For I scream/For ice cream").

====Eye rhyme====
{{main|Eye rhyme}}
Though not strictly rhymes, eye rhymes or sight rhymes refer to similarity in spelling but not in sound, as with ''cough'', ''bough'', or ''love'', ''move''. These are not rhymes in the strict sense, but often were in earlier language periods.

====Mind rhyme====
{{main|Mind Rhyme}}
'Mind Rhyme is a kind of substitution rhyme similar to [[rhyming slang]], but it is less generally codified and is “heard” only when generated by a specific verse context. For instance, “this sugar is neat / and tastes so sour.” If a reader or listener thinks of the word “sweet” instead of “sour”, then a mind rhyme has occurred.

===Classification by position===
The preceding classification has been based on the nature of the rhyme; but we may also classify rhymes according to their position in the verse:
* '''tail rhyme''' (also called '''end rhyme''' or '''rime couée'''): a rhyme in the final syllable(s) of a verse (the most common kind)
* When a word at the end of the line rhymes with a word in the interior of the line, it is called an [[internal rhyme]].
* Holorhyme has already been mentioned, by which not just two individual words, but two entire lines rhyme.

A [[rhyme scheme]] is the pattern of rhyming lines in a poem. [[Internal rhyme]] is rhyme which occurs within a single [[Line (poetry)|line of verse]].

==History==
The earliest surviving evidence of rhyming is the Chinese [[Shi Jing]] (ca. 10th century BC). Rhyme is not used either in the poems of classical antiquity or in the [[Bible]], but is prominent in the [[Qur'an]] and other Arabic works.

In Europe, the practice arose only with [[Late Antiquity]], continuing the [[homoioteleuton]] of rhetorics. According to some archaic sources, [[Early Irish literature|Irish literature]] introduced the rhyme to Early Medieval Europe, though this is a disputed claim;<ref>"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08116a.htm Article about early Irish literature by prof. Douglas Hyde in The Catholic Encyclopedia]"</ref> in the 7th century we find the Irish had brought the art of rhyming verses to a high pitch of perfection. The [[leonine verse]] is notable for introducing rhyme into High Medieval literature in the 12th century. From the 12th to the 20th centuries, European poetry is dominated through rhyme

==Rhyme in various languages==
===English===
:''See [[English poetry]]''

[[Old English poetry]] is mostly [[alliterative verse]]. One of the earliest rhyming poems in English is [[The Rhyming Poem]].

Some words in English, such as "[[Orange (word)|orange]]", are commonly regarded as having no rhyme. Although a clever poet can get around this (for example, by obliquely rhyming "orange" with combinations of words like "door hinge" or with <!--POV: far-fetched--> lesser-known words like "[[Blorenge]]", a hill in Wales), it is generally easier to move the word out of rhyming position or replace it with a [[synonym]] ("orange" could become "amber").

One view of rhyme in English is from [[John Milton]]'s preface to ''[[Paradise Lost]]'':
:The Measure is ''English'' Heroic  Verse without Rime, as that of ''Homer'' in ''Greek'', and of ''Virgil'' in ''Latin''; Rime being no necessary Adjunct or true Ornament of Poem or good Verse, in longer Works especially, but the Invention of a barbarous Age, to set off wretched matter and lame Meeter; grac't indeed since by the use of some famous modern Poets, carried away by Custom...<!--carefully proofread -->

A more tempered view is taken by [[W. H. Auden]] in [[The Dyer's Hand]]:
:Rhymes, meters, stanza forms, etc., are like servants. If the master is fair enough to win their affection and firm enough to command their respect, the result is an orderly happy household. If he is too tyrannical, they give notice; if he lacks authority, they become slovenly, impertinent, drunk and dishonest.

Forced or clumsy rhyme is often a key ingredient of [[doggerel]].

===French===<!-- This section is linked from [[Meter (poetry)]] -->

In [[French poetry]], unlike in English, it is common to have "identical rhymes", in which not only the vowels of the final syllables of the lines rhyme, but their onset consonants ("consonnes d'appui") as well. To the ear of someone accustomed to English verse, this often sounds like a very weak rhyme. For example, an English perfect rhyme of homophones, ''flour'' and ''flower'', would seem weak, whereas a French rhyme of homophones ''doigt'' and ''doit'' is not only acceptable but quite common.

Rhymes are sometimes classified into the categories "rime pauvre" ("poor rhyme"), "rime suffisante" ("sufficient rhyme"), "rime riche" ("rich rhyme") and "rime richissime" ("very rich rhyme"), according to the number of rhyming sounds in the two words or in the parts of the two verses. For example to rhyme "parla" with "sauta" would be a poor rhyme (the words have only the vowel in common), to rhyme "pas" with "bras" a sufficient rhyme (with the vowel and the silent consonant in common), and "tante" with "attente" a rich rhyme (with the vowel, the onset consonant, and the coda consonant with its mute "e" in common).  Authorities disagree, however, on exactly where to place the boundaries between the categories.

''[[Holorime]]''  is an extreme example of ''rime richissime'' spanning an entire verse. [[Alphonse Allais]] was a notable exponent of holorime. Here is an example of a holorime couplet from Victor Hugo:

:''Gall, amant de la Reine, alla (tour magnanime)''
:''Gallamment de l'Arène à la Tour Magne, à Nîmes.''

:Gallus, the Queen's lover, went (a magnanimous gesture)
:Gallantly from the Arena to the Great Tower, at Nîmes.

Classical French rhyme only differs from English rhyme in its different treatment of onset consonants. It also treats coda consonants in a peculiarly French way.

French spelling includes several final letters that are no longer pronounced, and that in many cases have never been pronounced. Such final sounds, which were sometimes once pronounced, continue to live a shadowy existence in Classical French versification. They are in almost all of the pre-20th-century French verse texts, but these rhyming rules are almost never taken into account from the 20th century it.
The most important "silent" letter is the "[[Silent_letter#Vowels|mute e]]". In spoken French today, final "e" is, in some regional accents (in Paris for example), omitted<!--leads a kind of half-life: this is an abuse of the term "half-life"--> after consonants; but in Classical French prosody, it was considered an integral part of the rhyme even when following the vowel. "Joue" could rhyme with "boue", but not with "trou". Rhyming words ending with this silent "e" were said to make up a "feminine rhyme", while words not ending with this silent "e" made up a "masculine rhyme". It was a principle of stanza-formation that masculine and feminine rhymes had to alternate in the stanza. All 17th-century French plays in verse alternate masculine and feminine [[alexandrine]] couplets.

The "silent" final consonants present a more complex case. They, too, were considered an integral part of the rhyme, so that "pont" could rhyme only with "vont" and not with "long"; but this cannot be reduced to a simple rule about the spelling, since "pont" would also rhyme with "rond" even though one word ends in "t" and the other in "d".  This is because the correctness of the rhyme depends not on the spelling on the final consonant, but on how it would have been pronounced. There are a few simple rules that govern word-final consonants in French prosody:
* The consonants must "rhyme" ''give or take their voicing''. So "d" and "t" rhyme because they differ only in voicing. So too with "g" and "c", and "p" and "b", and also "s" and "z" (and "x"). (Rhyming words ending with a silent "s" "x" or "z" are called "plural rhymes".)
* Nasal vowels rhyme no matter what their spelling. ("Essaim" can rhyme with "sain", but not with "saint" because the final "t" counts in "saint".)
* If the word ends in a consonant cluster, only the final consonant counts. ("Temps" rhymes with "lents" because both end in "s".)
In fact, only the "silent" final consonants which would be able to be pronounced the same way, if they were followed by a vowel, are able to rhyme together.

===Hebrew===
Ancient [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] verse generally did not employ rhyme. However, many [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[liturgy|liturgical]] poems rhyme today, because they were written in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Europe]], where rhymes were in vogue.

===Portuguese===
[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] classifies rhymes in the following manner:

*'''rima pobre''' (poor rhyme): rhyme between words of the same [[grammatical category]] (e.g. noun with noun) or between very common endings (''-ão'', ''-ar'');
*'''rima rica''' (rich rhyme): rhyme between words of different grammatical classes or with uncommon endings;
*'''rima preciosa''' (precious rhyme): rhyme between words with a different [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], for example ''estrela'' (star) with ''vê-la'' (to see her);
*'''rima esdrúxula''' (odd rhyme): rhyme between [[Proparoxytone|proparoxitonic]] words (example: ''última'', "last", and ''vítima'', "victim").

===Greek===
:''See [[Homoioteleuton]]'' rhyme

===Latin===
In [[Latin]] rhetoric and poetry [[homeoteleuton]] and [[alliteration]] were frequently used devices. 

Tail rhyme was occasionally used, as in this piece of poetry by [[Cicero]]:

:''O Fortu'''natam''' '''natam''' me consule '''Romam'''''.

:''(O fortunate Rome, to be born with me consul)''

But tail rhyme was not used as a prominent structural feature of [[Latin poetry]] until it was introduced under the influence of local vernacular traditions in the early [[Middle Ages]]. This is the [[Latin]] [[hymn]] ''[[Dies Irae]]'':

:''Dies irae, dies illa''
:''Solvet saeclum in favilla''
:''Teste David cum Sybilla''

:''(The day of wrath, that day''
:''which will reduce the world to ashes,''
:''as foretold by David and the Sybil.)''

[[Medieval poetry]] may mix Latin and [[vernacular]] languages. Mixing languages in verse or rhyming words in different languages is termed [[macaronic]].

===Sanskrit===

Patterns of rich rhyme (''[[prāsa]]'') play a role in modern Sanskrit poetry, but only to a minor extent in historical Sanskrit texts. They are classified according to their position within the ''pada'' (metrical foot): ''ādiprāsa'' (first syllable), ''dvitīyākṣara prāsa'' (second syllable), ''antyaprāsa'' (final syllable) etc.

===Arabic===

The [[Qur’an]] is written in ''[[Saj (literature)|saj‘]]'', a prosaic genre that uses end rhymes. This particular style was widespread in the Arabic peninsula during the time of the Qur’an's appearance.

===Celtic languages===

:''For Welsh, see [[cynghanedd]]''

Rhyming in the [[Celtic Languages]] takes a drastically different course from most other Western rhyming schemes despite strong contact with the Romance patterns.  Even today, despite extensive interaction with English and French culture, Celtic rhyme continues to demonstrate native characteristics.  Gaelic languages use little true rhyming and prefer [[assonance]] or the rhyming of vowel sounds within non-rhyming words.  Often, pieces with true rhyming are considered awkward to Gaelic speakers, much in the same way many English speakers find the Irish rhyming pattern.
Here is an example of Irish Gaelic rhyme from ''Bríd Óg Ní Mháille'' by [[The Corrs]]: 

:''Is a Bhríd Óg Ní Mháille / 'S tú d'fhág mo chroí cráite''
:{{IPA-ga|is ə vrʲiːdʲ oːɡ nʲiː wɒːlʲə / stuː dɒːɡ mə xriː krɒːtʲə|}}

Translation: ''Oh Brid Og O'Malley / You have left my heart breaking''

===Tamil===

There are some unique rhyming schemes in Dravidian languages like Tamil. Specifically, the rhyme called ''etukai'' (anaphora) occurs on the second consonant of each line. The effect of ''etukai'', though a little strange at first, rapidly becomes pleasant to the reader, and to the Tamil it is as enjoyable as the end rhyme. 

The other rhyme and related patterns are called ''mō<u>n</u>ai'' ([[alliteration]]), ''toṭai'' ([[epistrophe|epiphora]]) and ''iraṭṭai kiḷavi'' ([[Parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]). 

Some classical Tamil poetry forms, such as ''veṇpā'', have rigid grammars for rhyme to the point that they could be expressed as a context-free grammar.

==Function of rhyme==

Partly it seems to be enjoyed simply as a repeating pattern that is pleasant to hear.  It also serves as a powerful [[mnemonic]] device, facilitating memorization.  The regular use of tail rhyme helps to mark off the ends of lines, thus clarifying the metrical structure for the listener.  As with other poetic techniques, poets use it to suit their own purposes; for example [[William Shakespeare]] often used a rhyming [[couplet]] to mark off the end of a scene in a [[Play (theatre)|play]].

Evolutionary psychologist [[Geoffrey Miller (evolutionary psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]] hypothesizes that rhyme is a form of [[sexual selection|sexually selected]] [[handicap principle|handicap]] imposed on communication making poetry harder and more reliable as a signal of verbal intelligence and overall [[fitness (biology)|fitness]].<ref>Miller G (2000) ''The mating mind: how sexual choice shaped the evolution of human nature'', London, Heineman, ISBN 0-434-00741-2 (also Doubleday.
