{{History of IBM mainframe operating systems}}
'''BOS/360''' (Basic Operating System/360) was an early [[IBM]] [[operating system]].

It came in 2 versions, 4K BOS and 8K BOS.  The latter evolved into [[DOS/360]], which some{{Who|date=October 2009}} suggest was really version 6 of BOS.  BOS in turn was preceded by BPS, Basic Programming Support. The first 360s to be shipped were the models 30 and 40.  BOS was the first disk based operating system{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} and was released in early 1965.  4K BOS was for machines with 8 or 16K of core storage and as its name implies, assembled a Supervisor of about 4K.  With very few exceptions, all of the early 360s (but not the model 20) shipped with 2, 3 or more [[IBM 2311|2311]] disk drives.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Thus BOS was the only disk based operating system available at launch for a machine that was marketed as disk based. The Supervisor was [[Initial Program Load|IPL]]'d and the date and time were entered by the operator on the console typewriter.  

The operating system disk contained a source language library, a macro library and a core image library.  The macro library included all the options for the supervisor, which was assembled by the 360 assembly language compiler, the only language available at the time, although [[RPG programming language|RPG]] came a little later.  The other crucial component was the Job Controller,  which was fed by punched cards using [[Job Control Language|JCL]] (Job Control Language).  Most BOS users upgraded to DOS and added more core, typically to 32K or even a gargantuan (for the time) 64K.  DOS was the first System/360 operating system to introduce multi-programming.  It could be configured with 2 foreground partitions, typically used for spooling while the main [[JOB Stream]] ran in the background.
