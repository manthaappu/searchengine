<html> <head> <title>Mutation (genetic algorithm)</title></head><body>In [[genetic algorithm]]s of [[computing]], '''mutation''' is a [[genetic operator]] used to maintain [[genetic diversity]] from one generation of a population of algorithm [[chromosome (genetic algorithm)|chromosomes]] to the next.  It is analogous to biological [[mutation]].

The classic example of a mutation operator involves a probability that an arbitrary [[bit]] in a [[genome (genetic algorithm)|genetic sequence]] will be changed from its original state.  A common method of implementing the mutation operator involves generating a [[random variable]] for each bit in a sequence. This random variable tells whether or not a particular bit will be modified. This mutation procedure, based on the biological [[point mutation]], is called single point mutation. Other types are inversion and floating point mutation. When the gene encoding is restrictive as in permutation problems, mutations are swaps, inversions and scrambles.

The purpose of mutation in GAs is preserving and introducing diversity. Mutation should allow the algorithm to avoid [[local minimum|local minima]] by preventing the population of chromosomes from becoming too similar to each other, thus slowing or even stopping evolution.  This reasoning also explains the fact that most GA systems avoid only taking the [[Fitness function|fittest]] of the population in generating the next but rather a random (or semi-random) selection with a weighting toward those that are fitter.

For more details how mutation is used in a genetic algorithm, see the main article on [[genetic algorithm]]s.
