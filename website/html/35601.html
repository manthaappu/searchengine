'''State-dependent learning''' (state-dependent memory) is an idea of learning and recalling that is based upon the physiological and mental state of the organism. An example of this effect is [[transfer-appropriate processing]] which is a strong positive effect on memory when the type of memorization and the type of recall are similar. An example would be rhyming words out loud and recalling the rhyme out loud. 

Factors affecting state-dependent learning may include: [[natural environment|environment]], [[substance intoxication|intoxication]], [[emotional state]], and [[sensory modality]].

In [[neuropsychopharmacology]], state-dependent learning denotes the fact that information that has been learned while the animal is under the influence of a certain drug ("state") can only be recalled and used to solve a task when the animal is in the same state in which the information was learned, but not in a different, i.e., undrugged state (Colpaert, 1990 [http://www.springerlink.com/content/p117614312310g03/] and Carlezone et al., 1995). (definition quoted from [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2004.06.041])

A recently identified type of [[context-dependent memory|context-dependent learning]] is the effect of language. Research by Marian et al. (2007)<ref>Marian, V. & Kaushanskaya, M. (2007). Language context guides memory content. Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, 14(5), 925â€“933.</ref> demonstrated that participants were more likely to identify an English answer to a question when asked in English and a Mandarin answer to a question when asked in Mandarin. This illustrates that the linguistic context of a memory may be encoded during learning.
