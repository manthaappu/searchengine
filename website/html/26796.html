In basic mathematics, a '''number line''' is a picture of a straight line on which every point is assumed to correspond to a [[real number]] and every real number to a point.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Stewart | first1=James B. | last2 = Redlin | first2 = Lothar | last3=Watson | first3=Saleem | authorlink=James Stewart (mathematician) | title=College Algebra | publisher=[[Brooks Cole]]  | year=2008 | edition = 5th | pages=13&ndash;19 | isbn=0-495-56521-0}}</ref>  Often the [[integer]]s are shown as specially-marked points evenly spaced on the line.  Although this image only shows the integers from &minus;9 to 9, the line includes all [[real number]]s, continuing "forever" in each direction, and also numbers not marked that are between the integers. It is often used as an aid in teaching simple [[addition]] and [[subtraction]], especially involving [[negative number]]s.

It is divided into two symmetric halves by the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]], i.e. the number [[0 (number)|zero]].

In advanced mathematics, the expressions '''real number line''', or '''[[real line]]''' are typically used to indicate the above-mentioned concept that every point on a straight line corresponds to a single real number, and [[List of Latin phrases: V#vice versa|vice versa]].

==Drawing the number line==
The number line is usually represented as being [[horizontal plane|horizontal]]. Customarily, [[positive number]]s lie on the right side of zero, and [[negative number]]s lie on the left side of zero. An arrowhead on either end of the drawing is meant to suggest that the line continues indefinitely in the positive and negative [[real number]]s, denoted by <math>\mathbb{R}</math>. The real numbers consist of [[irrational number]]s and [[rational numbers]], as well as the [[integer]]s, [[whole number]]s, and the [[natural number]]s (the counting numbers).

A line drawn through the origin at right angles to the real number line can be used to represent the [[imaginary number]]s. This line, called [[imaginary line (mathematics)|imaginary line]], extends the number line to a [[complex plane|complex number plane]], with points representing [[complex number]]s.
