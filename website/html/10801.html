A '''Distributed Network Block Device (DNBD)''' is a read-only and caching [[network block device]] and supports following main features:

* replication of [[server (computing)|server]]s for robustness
* multicast communication and [[caching]] of network traffic for [[scalability]]

These characteristics make it suitable especially for use in [[wireless networks]],
e.g. for [[diskless client]]s or to share multimedia files in such an environment.
The servers can export a file or block device equipped with an operating system,
movies, music, etc. Several clients can import the block device and access it
like a local [[hard disk]]. However, each block transfer over the network can be
cached by all clients: If several users on each client start to watch a movie
within a certain time interval, the movie data has to be transmitted only once
(depending on the [[cache]] size). The network is not burdened with unnecessary
traffic.

DNBD can be used together with [[cowloop]] [1] or [[unionfs]] [2] in order to get local
write [[semantics]], e.g. for diskless clients. Especially in wireless environments
with limited [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], caching can increase [[boot-up]] time enormously.
