Privacy advocates have objected to the [[Google Street View]] feature, pointing to views found to show men leaving strip clubs, protesters at an abortion clinic, sunbathers in bikinis, [[Cottaging|cottagers]] at public parks, people picking up prostitutes and people engaging in activities visible from public property in which they do not wish to be photographed and published online.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/other/display.var.1444323.0.0.php |title=Google’s Street View site raises alarm over privacy |author=MacDonald, Calum |publisher=The Herald |date=June 4, 2007 |accessdate=April 1, 2009}}</ref> Google maintains that the photos were taken from public property.

[[File:Google Street View Car in Hunters Point, Queens.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Google Car in [[Hunters Point, Queens]] on June 4, 2009]]

In the [[law of the United States]], the general rule (with some exceptions) is that there is no reasonable [[expectation of privacy]] in a public place, thus implying that Google (and anyone else) is usually free to take photographs in public places.

However, one of Google's responses to concerns about privacy laws outside the United States has been a pledge to blur the faces of people who are filmed on Street View photos taken both inside and outside the U.S. Google began blurring faces on May 13, 2008<ref>{{cite web|last=Shankland |first=Stephen |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9943140-7.html |title=Google begins blurring faces in Street View |publisher=News.cnet.com |date= |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref> and the images published since then, including the first launch of images in Europe on July 2, 2008, have all used face blurring (this process is automated; as a result even facial images on posters and billboards are often blurred).

Google delayed the release of its street views of the [[Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area]] following concern expressed by the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] that some of the images taken might be of security-sensitive areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/technology/content/CA-GOOGLE27_03-01-08_LH93PVQ_v27.244d0a8.html |title=Pull up a chair for a walking tour &#124; The Providence Journal |publisher=Projo.com |date=March 1, 2008 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref>

The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] has banned Google from publishing Street View content of [[United States armed forces|U.S. Military]] bases and asked Google to remove existing content of bases. Google has complied with this order.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D8V84RL00&show_article=1|title= Pentagon bans Google teams from bases|accessdate=March 7, 2008 |publisher=Reuters|work=|date= March 6, 2008}}</ref>

Some parents have expressed concern over Street View compromising the security of their children.<ref>{{cite web|author=February 29, 2008 |url=http://www.fox6now.com/witi-googlestreetviewupsetssome-5909178,0,7515019.story |title=Google Street View Upsets Some Parents |publisher=Fox 6 Now |date=February 29, 2008 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref>

Aaron and Christine Boring, a Pittsburgh couple, sued Google for invasion of privacy. Street View made a photo of their home available online, and they claimed that this diminished the value of their house, which they had chosen for its privacy.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Couple Sues Google Over "Street View". |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/0404081google1.html |quote= |publisher=[[The Smoking Gun]] |date= |accessdate=April 4, 2008 }}</ref> They lost their case in a Pennsylvania court. "While it is easy to imagine that many whose property appears on Google's virtual maps resent the privacy implications, it is hard to believe that any – other than the most exquisitely sensitive – would suffer shame or humiliation," Judge Hay ruled.<ref>{{cite news |first= Jemima|last= Kiss|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Google wins Street View privacy case |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/feb/19/google-wins-street-view-privacy-case |quote=An American couple who attempted to sue Google over what they claimed was its "privacy invading" Street View technology have lost their case in a Pennsylvania court. |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=February 19, 2009 |accessdate=February 19, 2009 | location=London}}</ref>

In August 2008, a Street View vehicle took a picture of a house on fire in [[Sherwood, Arkansas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2008/08/10/google-street-view-catches-house-on-fire/ |title=Google Street View Catches House on Fire |publisher=Neatorama.com |date=August 10, 2008 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref> The people who lived in the house asked Google to remove this picture.

Some cities in the United States where all streets are privately owned have asked Google to remove Street View images because their consent was not given. [[North Oaks, Minnesota]] may have been the first. In that case, Google complied.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/19416279.html |title=North Oaks tells Google Maps: Keep out - we mean it |author=Pabst, Lora |publisher=Minneapolis Star-Tribune |date=May 31, 2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2009}}</ref>

==Canada==

While Canada, like other jurisdictions, has raised the issue of privacy concerns regarding Google Street View, the presence of Google cameras in one Canadian city in March 2009 gave rise to a different complaint. Les MacPherson, a columnist with the [[Saskatoon]] [[The StarPhoenix|Star-Phoenix]], complained in a March 28, 2009, [[column]] that the timing of the imaging, at the end of a protracted winter season and before the true onset of spring would cast an unfavourable image of Saskatoon and other cities. "What worries me more than any loss of privacy is the prospect of presenting to the world a highly unflattering impression of Canadian cities. With the possible exception of [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], they do not show off well in the spring. Google could not have picked a more inauspicious time to do its scanning. Saskatoon is unfortunately typical. For Google to record its images of the city at this most visually unappealing time of year is like photographing a beautiful woman who has just awakened from a six-month coma," he wrote.<ref>{{Citation | last = MacPherson | first = Les | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = City not at its best in Google's new photos | newspaper=[[The StarPhoenix|Saskatoon Star-Phoenix]] | pages = | year = | date = March 28, 2009 | url = http://www.thestarphoenix.com/Business/COLUMN+City+best+Google+photos/1438536/story.html | accessdate = April 19, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In early October 2009, the first Canadian cities began to appear on Street View; several, including Saskatoon, were not included in the initial roll-out. One city that was included, Calgary, included images taken in both summer and winter. Images of Saskatoon were rolled out on December 2, 2009.

More recently{{When|date=July 2010}}, several areas have had their pictures re-taken, for example, [[Toronto]]. Toronto's old images appeared to have been taken in late October, but these new images appear to have been taken in late March, April and May, as evidenced by images where school [[bulletin boards]] indicate the month is as such.

==Czech Republic==

In the [[Czech Republic]] Street View has been banned since September 2010 by the Czech Office for Personal Data Protection after more than half a year of unsuccessful negotiation between the Czech Republic and Google. The Office described Google’s programme as taking pictures “beyond the extent of the ordinary sight from a street”, and that it “disproportionately invade citizens’ privacy.” However pictures taken before this decision (mostly in 2009) may remain available online but Google is obliged to erase every picture from that period shall it be disputed.”<ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,6006085,00.html]</ref><ref>[http://seerpress.com/czech-republic-blocks-googles-data-mapping-feature/7691/]</ref>

==European Union==
A recent demand from the European Union would require Google to warn local residents before sending out the cameras.  It also requires Google to keep the unblurred versions of the photos no longer than 6 months, instead of no longer than a year.  Google was instructed to give advance notice online and in the local press before photographing.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/25/AR2010022504840.html | work=The Washington Post}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>

In 2010, Google announced that it might cancel Google Street View service in the European Union due to unmanageable requests of the European Commission.<ref>{{cite web|author=Post a Job |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-03/google-may-drop-street-view-in-eu-if-photo-storage-time-is-cut.html |title=Google May Drop Street View in EU if Photo Storage Time Is Cut |work=BusinessWeek  |date=March 3, 2010 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref>

==United Kingdom==

[[File:Google Street View Car in Southampton.jpg|250px|right|thumbnail|[[Opel Astra]] Street View Car in [[Southampton]], [[Hampshire]]]]

In the first days of launch the UK service drew criticism due to privacy.<ref>{{cite web|author=by dave |url=http://news.idealo.co.uk/news/5344/images-get-pulled-from-google-street-view-in-first-week-of-service.html |title=Images Get Pulled From Google Street View In First Week Of Service |publisher=News.idealo.co.uk |date=March 20, 2009 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref> Images were found of a man leaving a [[sex shop]], a man vomiting and another man being arrested. Some images were removed including those surrounding [[Downing Street]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7952317.stm |title=Google's pictures of UK go live |publisher=BBC News |date=March 19, 2009 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7954596.stm |title=Google pulls some street images |publisher=BBC News |date=March 20, 2009 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref>

The service drew criticism in [[Belfast]] that it represented a "reckless" security risk, particularly for showing the exteriors of army bases and police stations so soon after the killing of two soldiers in the [[2009 Massereene Barracks shooting]], and a police officer.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7955062.stm | work=BBC News | title=Google 'reckless' on NI security | date=March 20, 2009 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}</ref>

Soon after the launch human rights watchdog [[Privacy International]] sent a formal complaint about the service to the UK [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO), which cited more than 200 reports from members of the public who were identifiable on Street View images. Privacy International director Simon Davies said that the organization had filed the complaint due to the "clear embarrassment and damage" Street View had caused to many [[British people|Briton]]s. He said that Street View fell short of the assurances given by Google to the ICO in July 2008 that had enabled its launch, namely that privacy would be protected by blurring faces and vehicle licence plates, and asked for the system to be "switched off" while an investigation was completed. He said the few cases where Google's face blurring system had failed meant the data used by Street View would fall under UK [[Privacy|Data Protection]] legislation, which requires that subjects give permission for the use of information concerning them.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Call to 'shut down' Street View | work=| publisher=BBC News | date = March 24, 2009 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7959362.stm | doi = | accessdate = }}</ref>

Davies subsequently sent an open letter to Google chief executive [[Eric Schmidt]], accusing the company of briefing journalists against him, claiming Davies was biased in favour of [[Microsoft]]. Google has pointed to connections between Microsoft and data protection consultancy ''[[80/20 Thinking]]'', run by Davies, and has said that Davies' connections to Microsoft should be made clear in public, as the credibility of his criticisms is undermined by the fact that he acts as a consultant to companies who are direct rivals and critics of Google, a fact Davies rarely discloses in press releases or comments.<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Google 'trying to smear Street View critic' | newspaper=[[Belfast Telegraph]] | pages = | year = | date = March 28, 2009 | url = http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/technology-gadgets/google-trying-to-smear-street-view-critic-14247255.html | accessdate = April 1, 2009}}</ref>

However, on April 23, 2009, the Information Commissioner ruled that although Google Street View carries a small risk of privacy invasion it should not be stopped. They ruled that "There is no law against anyone taking pictures of people in the street as long as the person using the camera is not harassing people". They also ruled that Google Street View does not contravene the Data Protection Act, as an image of a house held on Street View is not a data protection matter, as data protection is about people's personal information.<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Common sense on Street View must prevail, says the ICO | newspaper=[[Information Commissioner]] | pages = | year = | date = April 23, 2009 | url = http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/pressreleases/2009/google_streetview_220409_v2.pdf | accessdate = April 1, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = All clear for Google Street View | work=| publisher=BBC News | date = April 23, 2009 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8014178.stm | doi = | accessdate = }}</ref>

On April 3, 2009, it was reported in the press that residents of the village of [[Broughton, Milton Keynes|Broughton]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] formed a human barrier to stop a Google car from photographing the village,<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1167211/A-English-revolt-sees-Googles-spies.html A very English revolt sees off Google's spies] Mail Online</ref> expressing fears that it was "invading the villagers' privacy" and "facilitating crime".<ref>[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article2357834.ece Raid-fear villagers halt Google Street View Car], ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]] Online'', 03/04/2009</ref> As also reported in the press, contrary reactions have come from some Internet users, who have called on people to "descend on the village to snap their own perfectly legal photographs".<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1166722/Watch-Broughton-Street-View-fans-plan-descend-privacy-village-photo-fest.html Watch out Broughton!

On May 21, 2009, Google Street's privacy issues got some attention in the [[tabloid]] press, after it was revealed that Google's [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition technology]] automatically blurred out the face of "''The Colonel''" on the shop signage of ''[[KFC|Kentucky Fried Chicken]]'' stores "to protect his privacy", despite the fact that [[Harland Sanders|Harland David "Colonel" Sanders]], upon whose image "''The Colonel''" is based, died in 1980. A spokesperson for Google defended the decision as "it shows how good our facial recognition technology is".<ref>[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article2439826.ece "Google blur out KFC founder"], ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]] online'', May 21 '2009</ref>

In October 2010, Google admitted to accidentally downloading passwords and e-mails from unprotected wireless networks across the United kingdom

==Denmark==
According to a Danish media lawyer, Oluf Jørgensen, Google's practice of photographing people on private property is illegal. The Danish data authorities advices people, who are photographed by Google, to turn Google into the police.<ref>{{cite web|author=af trfi for TV 2 Nyhederne |url=http://nyhederne-dyn.tv2.dk/article/28089720/?rss |title="Google Street View is a systematic violation of law" |publisher=Nyhederne-dyn.tv2.dk |date= |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref>

==Germany==

In an April 2009 interview for the magazine [[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]] Google's Global Privacy Counsel [[Peter Fleischer]] remarked that "public opposition to Google Street View in Germany, though not hysterical, had been tougher than in any other country."<ref>Focus No. 18/2009, p. 20 (April 28, 2009)</ref> On the same occasion he stated that the project has now been "essentially aligned with the concerns of data privacy advocates," and that "specific privacy tools would be developed for the German launch while imaging continues at the fastest possible pace." The option to have specific images removed would also apply for locations in Germany.

German Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor [[Guido Westerwelle]] said "I will do all I can to prevent it.".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5910738,00.html |title=German Foreign Minister joins criticism of Google's mapping program |publisher=Dw-world.de |date= |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref> However, Interior Minister [[Thomas de Maizière]] said that people should not get "hysterical" about the issue and called for "caution in introducing blanket rules allowing objections."<ref>{{cite web|author=(AP) &ndash; Aug 18, 2010 |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jEzBqjxVsTYM7m6Q2LXRSWN9_YDQD9HLTKP80 |title=German gov't considers 'Street View' concerns |publisher=Google.com |date=August 18, 2010 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref>

As of 2010, 244,000 German households have opted out of Streetview<ref>{{cite web|author=Stan Schroeder |url=http://mashable.com/2010/10/21/240000-german-households-street-view/ |title=240,000 German Households Opted Out of Google Street View |publisher=Mashable/Tech |date= |accessdate= }}</ref>.

==Greece==

Google had been stopped from gathering images in Greek cities for its Street View service until it provides further guarantees about privacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/05/13/greece.google.street.view.blocked/index.html?iref=newssearch |title=Google Street View blacked out in Greece |publisher=CNN  |date=May 13, 2009 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref>

However, on January 18, 2010, the government legalized the service under the condition that the faces and other privacy details will be blurred.<ref>{{cite web|author=12:00 |url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.ellada&id=122458 |title=Πράσινο φως στο Google Street View |publisher=Enet.gr |date= |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref>

==Australia==

Australia has no laws prohibiting Google Street View.

== Japan ==

In Japan, Google Street View started in August 2008 and was made available for ten [[prefectures of Japan|Japanese Prefectures]] in February 2009. The available Street View areas depicted residential and business areas, and showed the faces of pedestrians, displayed [[vehicle registration plates of Japan|vehicle registration plate]]s, and the {{Nihongo|''name plate of a family residence''|[[:ja:表札|表札]]|Hyōsatsu}} - Google's decision to show these has led to disputes. [[Local government]]s, lawyers and individuals claimed Google was violating privacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/08/14/japan-debate-over-google-street-view-continues/|title=Japan: Debate over Google Street View continues|publisher=Global Voices|accessdate=February 8, 2009}}</ref> On February 3, 2009, Google Japan representatives attended a meeting about privacy concerns held at a [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government]] facility, and agreed that privacy issues had not been adequately considered. Google pledged that, before taking photographs for Street View, they would in future notify the provinces' local government. Google Japan admitted that notifications and explanations of this kind had already been taking place in countries other than Japan, but had not done so in Japan as they were not aware of the potential privacy concerns.<ref>[[Yomiuri Shimbun]] (Japanese edition), February 4, 2009 Ver.13S page 28</ref>

On May 13, 2009, Google Japan announced that it would modify their cameras to scan from a lower height of 2.05 meters above ground level, 95 centimeters lower than the original height of the camera head. The new height is intended to avoid having cameras view over fences in front of homes and into homes. This reduced height is to apply immediately, and all areas previously visited will be rescanned from the reduced height. Scans taken at the original height will remain available until they are replaced with the new images. <!-- Tried to edit this paragraph into coherent language yet I appreciate that it is not in the right place and perhaps should be (re)moved - I tried my best to make it fit. -->

== Hong Kong ==



Before the launch of Google Street View in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data has taken the initiative to inquire into the Google Street View Project, to ensure that it complies with the provisions of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance in Hong Kong and to consider privacy issues that may arise.

Google declares that the Project does not intend to compile information about specific individuals whose identities can be ascertained. Faces of passers-by and [[car licence plate]]s in the photographs will be unidentifiable because [[blurring technology]] is to be used. Also, there will be at least a three month gap between image gathering and publication, to prevent the images being used to identify an individual's current whereabouts.

Google also assures the Commissioner that if anyone objects to any image of themselves, their cars, houses or children captured by the cameras, the related image will be removed.

The commissioner concluded that Google Street View does not breach Hong Kong privacy laws. But he will look seriously into any complaint made by an affected individual in accordance with the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcpd.org.hk/english/infocentre/press_20090205.html|title=Privacy Commissioner inquired into Google Street View Project|publisher=HKPCPD|accessdate=August 19, 2009}}</ref>

==Switzerland==

In November 2009, Switzerland's Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner Hanspeter Thür announced that his agency would be suing Google because in Street View "numerous faces and vehicle number plates are not made sufficiently unrecognizable from the point of view of data protection".<ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/article/182150/swiss_contend_google_doesnt_blur_street_view_enough.html Swiss Contend Google Doesn't Blur Street View Enough] [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] by Jeremy Kirk</ref>

==Middle East==

In December 2010, Google revealed plans to introduce its Street View feature in the [[Middle East]], but stated there would be additional forms of censorship not previously seen in other parts of the world out of concern for the religious and cultural beliefs of those residing in these countries, the laws of these countries, and security concerns. This would include, but not be limited to, the blacking out of all human bodies, license plates, and windows of all automobiles and structures, and the total omission of some security-sensitive sites, such as government buildings.<ref name=Mideast>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11979397 |title=Google explores Middle East Street View launch |publisher=BBC News |date=December 10, 2010 | accessdate= December 10, 2010}}</ref>

Google would start to film the Middle East some time in 2011 if all goes as planned. Only countries with which the United States has a peaceful relationship would be included. Some countries mentioned are [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Morocco]], and [[Turkey]]. In Israel, disputed territories and locations under rule of the [[Palestinian Authority]] would be excluded until further progress.<ref name=Mideast/>
