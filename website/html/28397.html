<html> <head> <title>Parallax barrier</title></head><body>A '''parallax barrier''' is a device placed in front of an image source, such as a [[liquid crystal display]], to allow it to show a [[3D display|stereoscopic image]] without the need for the viewer to wear [[Stereoscopy#3D_glasses|3D glasses]]. Placed in front of the normal LCD, it consists of a layer of material with a series of precision slits, allowing each eye to see a different set of [[pixel]]s, so creating a sense of depth through [[parallax]] in an effect similar to what [[lenticular printing]] produces for printed products.<ref>{{cite web

==Applications==
In addition to films and computer games, the technique has found uses in areas such as [[molecular modelling]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} and [[airport security]].<ref>{{cite news
