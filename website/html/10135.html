The Device Management Forum differs from other industry groups such as the [http://www.openmobilealliance.org '''Open Mobile Alliance'''] and the [http://tmforum.org '''Telemanagement Forum'''] in that it does not have standards making within its mandate. Instead, it collaborates with organisations such as the latter in order to achieve its objectives. Also, the Device Management Forum [http://www.devicemanagement.org/content/view/66/122/ '''defines device management'''] as a process rather than as a standard, technology or collection of technologies.
