<html> <head> <title>Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD)</title></head><body>'''ICSD''' is a database of [[inorganic]] [[crystal]] structure data. It was founded in 1978 by [[GÃ¼nter Bergerhoff]] (University of Bonn) and [[I.D.Brown]] (University of McMaster, Canada). It is now produced by the [[Fachinformationszentrum Karlsruhe]] in Europe and the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]. It seeks to contain information on all inorganic [[crystal structures]] published since 1913, including pure [[chemical element|element]]s, [[mineral]]s, [[metal]]s, and [[intermetallic compounds]] (with atomic coordinates). ICSD contains 103,679 entries {{As of|2008|alt=as of mid-2008}} and is updated twice a year.

A [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based [[Personal Computer|PC]] version has been developed in co-operation with the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology ]] (NIST), and a PHP-MySQL web based version in co-operation with the [[Institut Laue-Langevin]] (ILL) Grenoble.
