'''Electroadhesion''' is the term given to the [[electrostatic]] effect of astriction between two surfaces subjected to an [[electrical field]]. Applications include the retention of paper on [[plotter]] surfaces, astrictive robotic prehension (electrostatic grippers) etc. Clamping pressures in the range of 0.5 to 1.5 [[Newton (unit)|N]]/cm<sup>2</sup> (0.8 to 2.3 [[Pounds per square inch|psi]]) have been claimed.<ref>[http://www.sri.com/rd/electroadhesion.html SRI International's Electroadhesive Robots<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Electroadhesion can be loosely divided into two basic forms: that which concerns the prehension of electrically conducting materials where the general laws of [[capacitance]] hold ('''D''' = '''E''' ε) and that used with [[Insulator (electrical)|electrically insulating]] subjects where the more advanced theory of electrostatics ('''D''' = '''E''' ε + '''P''') applies.
