A '''[[wikt:schedule#English|schedule]]''', often called a '''rota''', is a list of [[employment|employees]] who are working on any given day, week, or month in a [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]]. A schedule is necessary for the day-to-day operation of any [[retailing|retail store]] or [[manufacturing]] facility. The process of creating a schedule is called '''scheduling'''. An effective workplace schedule balances the needs of employees, tasks, and in some cases, [[customer]]s.

A ''daily'' schedule is usually ordered [[chronology|chronologically]], which means the first employees working that day are listed at the top, followed by the employee who comes in next, ''et cetera''.

A ''weekly'' or ''monthly'' schedule is usually ordered [[collation|alphabetically]], employees being listed on the left hand side of a grid, with the days of the week on the top of the grid. 

A schedule is most often created by a [[Management|manager]]. In larger operations, a [[Human resources|Human Resources]] manager or scheduling [[specialist (disambiguation)|specialist]] may be solely dedicated to writing the schedule.

A schedule by this definition is sometimes referred to as [[workflow]].

In some cases [[employee scheduling software|scheduling software]] is used to allow organizations to better manage staff scheduling.
