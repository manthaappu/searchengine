<html> <head> <title>Spry framework</title></head><body>The '''Spry Framework''' is an [[open source]] [[Ajax framework]] developed by [[Adobe Systems]] which is used in the construction of  [[Rich Internet Applications]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Adobe Adds Spry Framework for AJAX |author=Darryl K. Taft |publisher=''[[eWeek]]'' |date=2006-05-11 |url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development/Adobe-Adds-Spry-Framework-for-AJAX/ |accessdate=2008-04-05}}</ref> Unlike other pure [[JavaScript]] frameworks such as the [[Dojo Toolkit]] and [[Prototype Javascript Framework| Prototype]], Spry is geared towards [[web designers]], not [[web developer]]s.

==Components==

The Spry framework broadly consists of
* Spry Effects - animation effects like blind, fade, grow, highlight, shake, slide and squish.
* Spry Data - data binding to HTML markup using minimal code or proprietary markup. Spry uses [[Google|Google's]] [[Xpath]] JavaScript library to convert [[XML]] into JavaScript objects. It can handle [[XML]], [[HTML]] and [[JSON]] data.
* Spry [[Widget (computing)|Widgets]] - framework for development of widgets, and included widgets such as the [[Accordion (GUI)|accordion]]. CRC

== Versions ==
Spry is currently in beta. The current version is 1.6.1. Adobe has not specified a target release date for the Spry framework, nor has it posted any sort of roadmap. Spry prerelease 1.5 was released on May 17, 2007

== Usage ==
The Spry framework is directly integrated into [[Adobe Systems]]'s Dreamweaver CS3.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dreamweaver CS3 integrates Spry framework for Ajax |author=Jim Dalrymple |publisher=''[[Macworld]]'' |date=2007-03-27 |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/56994/2007/03/cs3dweaver.html |accessdate=2008-04-05}}</ref><ref>[http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver/?xNav=MCDW Dreamweaver product page - reasons to upgrade]</ref>
There is further speculation as to how Adobe will utilize the Spry codebase. Possible uses are:
* Ajax development within an [[Integrated Development Environment|IDE]] such as [[Eclipse (software)]]. 
* Ajax generation from server code using [[ColdFusion]]. [[Ruby on Rails]] offers similar functionality.
* Ajax application generation from [[Adobe Flex]] code. [[OpenLaszlo]] will offer similar functionality with their "Legals" release (version 4).

== Competitors ==
Spry competes with a number of other Ajax frameworks and toolkits:
* [[Atlas Framework]] from [[Microsoft]]
* [[Ext (javascript library)|Ext]]
* [[Dojo Toolkit]]
* [[Echo (framework)|Echo]]
* [[Google Web Toolkit]]
* [[jQuery]]
* [[Mootools]]
* [[Prototype Javascript Framework|Prototype]] and [[Script.aculo.us]]
* [[Yahoo! UI Library]]
