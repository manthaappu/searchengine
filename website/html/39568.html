{{Lead rewrite|date=October 2010}}
'''Visual FoxPro''' is a [[Database-centric architecture|data-centric]] [[object-oriented]] and [[Procedural programming|procedural]] [[programming language]] produced by [[Microsoft]]. It is derived from [[FoxPro 2|FoxPro]] (originally known as '''FoxBASE''') which was developed by Fox Software beginning in 1984.  Fox Technologies merged with Microsoft in 1992, after which the software acquired further features and the prefix "Visual". The last version of [[FoxPro 2|FoxPro (2.6)]] worked under [[Mac OS]], [[DOS]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], and [[Unix]]: Visual FoxPro 3.0, the first "Visual" version, reduced platform support to only Mac and Windows, and later versions were Windows-only. The current version of Visual FoxPro is [[Component Object Model|COM]]-based and Microsoft has stated that they do not intend to create a [[Microsoft .NET]] version.

FoxPro originated as a member of the class of languages commonly referred to as [[XBase|"xBase"]] languages, which have syntax based on the [[DBASE|dBase]] programming language. Other members of the xBase language family include [[Clipper programming language|Clipper]] and [[Recital (database)|Recital]]. (A history of the early years of xBase can be found in the [[dBase#Origins|dBase]] article.)

Visual FoxPro, commonly abbreviated as VFP, is tightly integrated with its own relational database engine, which extends FoxPro's xBase capabilities to support [[SQL]] query and data manipulation. Unlike most [[database management systems]], Visual FoxPro is a full-featured, [[dynamic programming language]] that does not require the use of an additional general-purpose programming environment. It can be used to write not just traditional "[[fat client]]" applications, but also [[middleware]] and [[web application]]s.

== Recent history ==

In late 2002, it was demonstrated that Visual FoxPro can run on [[Linux]] under the [[Wine (software)|Wine]] Windows compatibility suite. In 2003, this led to complaints by Microsoft: it was claimed that the deployment of runtime FoxPro code on non-Windows machines violates the [[End User License Agreement]].<ref>[http://fox.wikis.com/wc.dll?Wiki~VFPandLinux VFP and Linux - Visual FoxPro Wiki<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In December 2005, VFP broke into the top 20 on [[Tiobe index]]<ref>[http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/paperinfo/tpci/FoxPro_xBase.html Tiobe Index History for FoxPro]</ref> for the first time. In March 2007 it was at position 19, making it a "B" language. As of August, 2010, VFP (combined with xBase) is at position 25.

In March 2007, Microsoft announced that there will be no VFP 10<ref name="eolannouncement">[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vfoxpro/bb308952.aspx A Message to the Community]</ref>, thus making VFP9 (released to manufacturing on December 17, 2004) the last commercial VFP release from Microsoft. The support of Version 9 is ongoing with service packs that were released December 8, 2005 and October 11, 2007.

At the time of the end of life announcement, work on the next release codenamed Sedna (named after a [[90377 Sedna|recently discovered dwarf planet]]) which was built on top of the VFP9 codebase had already begun. "Sedna" is a set of add-ons to VFP 9.0 of xBase components to support a number of interoperability scenarios with various Microsoft technologies including [[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server]] 2005, [[.NET Framework]], Windows Vista, Office 2007, Windows Search and [[Team Foundation Server]] (TFS). Microsoft released Sedna under the [[Shared source]] license on the [[CodePlex]] site. Microsoft has clarified that the VFP core will still remain closed source. Sedna was released on January 25, 2008<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=C04BCF8C-0944-49F0-AC2B-563518CE1D70&displaylang=en Microsoft SEDNA download]</ref>. As of March 2008, all xBase components of the VFP 9 SP2 (including Sedna) were available for community-development on CodePlex.

In late March 2007 a [[grassroots]] campaign was started by the Spanish-speaking FoxPro community at MasFoxPro<ref>[http://www.masfoxpro.com MasFoxPro]</ref> (MoreFoxPro in [[English language|English]]) to sign a petition to Microsoft to continue updating Visual FoxPro or release it to the community as [[Open Source]]. On April 3, 2007 the movement was noted by the technical press<ref>[http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=361 Developers petition Microsoft to reconsider FoxPro phase out] Posted by Mary Jo Foley (April 3rd, 2007) - All about Microsoft - ZDNet.com</ref>

Also on April 3, 2007 Microsoft responded to the petitioner's requests with this statement from  [[Alan Griver]]:

<blockquote>
    "We're very aware of the FoxPro community and that played a large part in what we announced on March 13th. It's never an easy decision to announce that we're not going to release another version of a product and it's one that we consider very carefully.
<p>
    "We're not announcing the end of FoxPro: Obviously, FoxPro applications will continue to work.  By some of our internal estimates, there are more applications running in FoxPro 2.6 than there are in VFP and FoxPro 2.6 hasn't been supported in many years.  Visual FoxPro 9 will be supported by Microsoft through 2015.
<p>
    "For Microsoft to continue to evolve the FoxPro base, we would need to look at creating a 64-bit development environment and that would involve an almost complete rewrite of the core product.  We've also invested in creating a scalable database with SQL Server, including the freely available SQL Server Express Edition. As far as forming a partnership with a third-party is concerned, we've heard from a number of large FoxPro customers that this would make it impossible for them to continue to use FoxPro since it would no longer be from an approved vendor. We felt that putting the environment into open source on CodePlex, which balances the needs of both the community and the large customers, was the best path forward."
