In [[computer science]], '''multiple granularity locking''' (MGL), sometimes called the '''John Rayner locking method''', is a locking method used in [[database management system]]s (DBMS) and [[relational database]]s. 

In MGL, locks are set on objects that contain other objects.  MGL exploits the hierarchical nature of the ''contains'' relationship.  For example, a database may have files, which contain pages, which further contain records.  This can be thought of as a [[tree (data structure)|tree]] of objects, where each node contains its children.  A [[lock (computer science)|lock]] locks a [[node (computer science)|node]] and its descendants.

Multiple granularity locking is usually used with non-strict [[two-phase locking]] to guarantee [[serializability]].  MGL uses [[lock escalation]] to determine granularity lock on a node and its ancestors.

==Lock Modes==
In addition to shared (S) locks and exclusive (X) locks from other locking schemes, like strict two-phase locking, MGL also uses ''intention shared'' and ''intention exclusive'' locks.  IS locks conflict with X locks, while IX locks conflict with S and X locks.  The null lock (NL) is compatible with everything.

To lock a node in S (or X), MGL has the transaction locks all of its ancestors with IS (or IX), so if a transaction locks a node in S (or X), no other transaction can access its ancestors in X (or S and X).

MGL locking modes are compatible with each other as defined in the following matrix.
