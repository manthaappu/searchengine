'''Moldex3D''' is an engineering simulation software. It is designed for plastic injection modeling simulation based on [[finite volume method|finite volume analysis]] and [[computational fluid dynamics]].

===Company history===
CoreTech System Co., Ltd. (Moldex3D) was founded in 1995, it has provided the professional CAE analysis solution "Moldex" series for the plastic injection molding industry, and the current product "Moldex3D" is marketed worldwide.

The developer company oriented itself as the pioneer for plastic injection molding simulation in 3D field and published a series of 3D featured capabilities product.  Sooner or later Lego in Denmark and Unilever in UK adopted this unique technology as it has never been seen in the market.  The announcement of 3D technology then bacame the mainstream in simulation applications

==Interactions with other softwares==
Moldex3D communicates with popular software as its preprocess, post-analysis and reports.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===Preprocess===
Moldex3D recognizes [[STL (file format)|STL files]] which can be generated by many . The [[Rhinoceros 3D|Rhino]] comes with Moldex3d has many [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] suitable for work with Moldex3d. Many [[List of CAx companies|CAD software]], such as [[Pro/ENGINEER|ProE]], can be the preprocessor or [Moldex3D].

===Post analysis===
The output of Moldex3D can be further analyzed by [[ANSYS]].

===Reports===
It generates reports in either [[Microsoft powerpoint|PowerPoint]] or [[HTML]] format.
