A '''drive bay''' is a standard-sized area for adding [[Computer hardware|hardware]] to a computer. Most drive bays are fixed to the inside of a case, but some can be removed. 

Over the years since the introduction of the [[IBM PC]], it and [[IBM PC compatible|its compatibles]] have had three types of drive bay, of which two are in common use today. The original PC came equipped with 2 full height bays in which 5.25" floppy or hard disk drives could be mounted. Later, miniaturization of components brought about the half-height drive, which became the standard in the late 1980s. The 3.5" bay was introduced to mount the new 3.5" [[microfloppy]] drives, but later came to be used for 3.5" hard drives as well. A 3.5" bay is the same height as a half-height 5.25" bay. There is no "full height" 3.5" bay. Due to the [[Wintel]] platform's hegemony during the 1990s, its disk drive mounting configuration became standard across a wide variety of computer hardware. Mounting brackets exist to mount 3.5" drives in 5.25" bays.

== Usage ==
Drive bays are most commonly used to store [[disk drives]], although they can also be used for front-end [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] ports, I/O bays, [[card reader]]s, [[Computer fan|fans]], tool storage, and other uses. Some computers have a small [[system monitor]] LCD display mounted in a drive bay.

When installing a drive in a bay, it is usually secured with 4 screws that hold the drive in the bay, although toolless fasteners are becoming more common. Then, any necessary power, data transfer, and other cables are routed into and connected to the rear of the drive. The drive bay is usually just big enough for the drive to fit inside. 3.5" bays are most often used today for mounting hard drives, and 5.25" bays remain standard equipment for mounting [[CD]] and [[DVD]] drives.
