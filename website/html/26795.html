'''D'Anna Biers''' ('''Number Three''') is a fictional [[Character (arts)|character]] from the re-imagined ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' television series, played by [[Lucy Lawless]].

== Character biography ==
===Introduction===
Three first appeared in the episode "[[Final Cut (Battlestar Galactica)|Final Cut]]" as '''D'Anna Biers''', a reporter for the Fleet News Service. In this episode, she is given full access to ''[[Battlestar Galactica (ship)|Galactica]]'' by [[William Adama|Commander Adama]] to film a documentary about the military. During filming, D'Anna comes across the Cylon prisoner [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)#Sharon_.22Athena.22_Agathon|Sharon "Athena" Agathon]] and discovers she is pregnant when [[Dr. Cottle]] rushes to save her baby from miscarriage. D'Anna is ordered to remove the evidence by Adama on the grounds it could jeopardize fleet security. The episode concludes with a group of Cylons watching the documentary as well as the removed footage—it is in this scene that D'Anna's identity as a Cylon is first revealed.<ref name="Final Cut">{{cite episode| episodelink=Final Cut (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Final Cut| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]}}</ref>

=== On Caprica ===

I’ve been reading a book called ''The Fantastic Bond'' and it talks about cold mothers who may have physical proximity but no warmth towards their child. There is something about that which is one of the most malignant types of mother love there is. I kind of wanted an element of that in this woman, which is why on some level she is really creepy."

In the episode "[[Downloaded (Battlestar Galactica)|Downloaded]]", D'Anna debriefs newly resurrected [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)#Caprica Six|Caprica Six]] and [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)#Sharon_.22Boomer.22_Valerii|Sharon "Boomer" Valerii]] and helps them to integrate back into Cylon society. When the two begin to show sympathy towards the humans, D'Anna reacts with disgust. Ultimately she is killed by Caprica Six to protect [[Samuel Anders|Anders]], a resistance fighter. After D'Anna has resurrected (offscreen), she claims this to be the first act of Cylon-on-Cylon violence in their history. Ironically, Caprica actually averted Three's own unwitting act of Cylon-on-Cylon violence, [[patricide]] in fact, as Anders is later revealed to be one of the Final Five, the creators of D'Anna and all other Humanoid Cylons.<ref name="Downloaded">{{cite episode| episodelink=Downloaded (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Downloaded| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]}}</ref> Three is also unaware of Boomer destroying a Basestar filled with copies of herself, as well as [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)#Sharon_.22Athena.22_Agathon|Athena]] gunning down on two separate occasions a Number Six who threatened [[Karl Agathon|Karl "Helo" Agathon]] on Caprica. 

=== Search for the truth ===
In the third season episode "[[Exodus (Battlestar Galactica)|Exodus]]", D'Anna is plagued by disturbing dreams. She visits a human oracle who tells her [[Hera Agathon|Hera]], the hybrid child of Helo and Athena, still lives and Number Three will play a vital role in the child's destiny. Athena, now a commissioned officer of the Colonial Fleet, later infiltrates the Cylons' New Caprica headquarters. D'Anna tells her her child is alive, but a distrustful Athena [[kneecapping|kneecaps]] her. After almost all humans have escaped the planet, D'Anna finds Hera accidentally left behind due to the deaths of her adoptive mother and bodyguards, and takes her into the care of the Cylons.

In response to dreams which she believes are messages from God, D'Anna begins a series of [[suicide]]s in an apparent attempt at enlightenment. She is determined to learn the truth despite suicide being a major taboo in Cylon society. In the space of time before she awakens in a new body, she experiences a vision of five figures bathed in light, whom she believes are the five unknown humanoid Cylon models, the "Final Five".

D'Anna engages in a sexual affair with both [[Gaius Baltar]] and [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)#Caprica Six|Caprica Six]], and claims to love both. However, in the episode "[[The Eye of Jupiter (Battlestar Galactica)|The Eye of Jupiter]]", she ends the relationship with Caprica Six, claiming they have different destinies. Ignoring the consensus decision of the other humanoid Cylons, D'Anna proceeds with Baltar to the temple on the algae planet. [[John Cavil|Cavil]] finds her in the temple and orders her at gunpoint not to proceed any further, realizing she has come to find out the identities of the Final Five. However, Baltar shoots him from behind. D'Anna continues and finds herself in a glowing room surrounded by five hooded beings in gleaming white robes. She moves closer and finally sees their faces, realizing who they are. She asks one of them for forgiveness, saying she never knew. She then slumps to the floor and dies, with Baltar pleading for her to tell him if he's one of them ("[[Rapture (Battlestar Galactica)|Rapture]]").

=== Boxing and unboxing ===

As D'Anna resurrects, Cavil is present, displeased with her for disregarding the Cylon taboo against seeking out the Final Five, which he himself programmed to cover up his tracks. He claims the Cylons have reached a consensus all members of the Number Three model are inherently flawed and suffer from messianic delusions. All copies would therefore be "boxed" — deactivated with their memories placed into cold storage. The boxing is carried out by Cavil. 

Later, when the Cylons split over whether or not to seek out the Final Five Cylon models, which they learn are in the Colonial fleet, the [[Number Two (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Twos]], Sixes and [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Eights]] (except Boomer) call for the Threes to be unboxed to end the deadlock.

In the episode "[[Faith (Battlestar Galactica)|Faith]]," the hybrid says "The missing three will give you the five who have come from the home of the thirteenth". Six and Starbuck realize Three, having previously seen the final five, will be able to recognize the final five from among the presumed humans in the fleet, and as the five are "from the home of the thirteenth" they are from Earth, the home of the thirteenth tribe of humans. Thus they believe resurrecting Three will enable the finding of the five and give the fleet a way home to Earth. It turns out much later, in the episode "[[Sometimes a Great Notion (Battlestar Galactica)|Sometimes a Great Notion]]," that "who have come from the home of the thirteenth" is to be taken literally on a different level.

The copy known as D'Anna is revived by Cavil in "[[The Hub (Battlestar Galactica)|The Hub]]." Cavil hopes she will be able to mediate peace between the warring Cylon factions, but she kills him and is taken away by Helo and a Number Eight. All other copies of Number Three are destroyed during the attack on the Resurrection Hub. Helo takes D'Anna to Roslin, where D'Anna tells the President she will only reveal the identities of the Final Five once she is assured of her own safety.

=== Standoff and alliance ===

In "[[Revelations (Battlestar Galactica)|Revelations]]", D'Anna becomes the de facto leader of the rebel Cylons, and informs Adama and Roslin she will hold members of the Galactica crew hostage until the Cylons in the Colonial fleet — she notes there are only four, not five — rejoin their brethren. D'Anna then accompanies Adama to the Galactica, declaring to the assembled crew (and the Final Four, all of whom are present); [[Lee Adama]], acting as president, assures her he will make no effort to stop the Four from leaving if they so choose; [[Tory Foster]] acts immediately, leaving with D'Anna under the excuse of delivering Roslin's medication to her. The others hesitate, and D'Anna soon begins executing hostages.  After [[Saul Tigh|Col. Tigh]] reveals himself, as well as [[Galen Tyrol|Tyrol]] and [[Samuel Anders|Anders]], D'Anna responds to Lee's threat to execute them by targeting the Colonial Fleet with the basestar's nuclear weapons.  Baltar successfully persuades her to stand down, and Lee shortly thereafter reveals to her Starbuck's discovery of a Colonial signal apparently coming from Earth. Though at first hesitant, convinced the humans would never forgive the Cylons and their conflict would never end, she agrees to Lee's proposal they go to Earth together.  She is a member of the landing party that discovers the planet to be an irradiated, post-apocalyptic wasteland.

At the conclusion of "[[Sometimes a Great Notion (Battlestar Galactica)|Sometimes a Great Notion]]", [[Saul Tigh]] approaches D'Anna to tell her the fleet is about to leave. D'Anna chooses to stay behind on Earth. She tells him: "You know all this is just going to happen again and again... and again. So I'm getting off this merry-go-round." She adds she would rather die on Earth with her ancestors than at [[John Cavil|Cavil]]'s hands in the cold and dark of space.

D'Anna, the final number three copy, remains behind on the wasteland of the original Earth.
