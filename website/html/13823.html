<html> <head> <title>Floquet theory</title></head><body>'''Floquet theory''' is a branch of the theory of [[ordinary differential equations]] relating to the class of solutions to [[linear differential equation]]s of the form

:<math>\dot{x} = A(t) x,\,</math>

with <math>\displaystyle A(t)</math> a [[Piecewise#Continuity|piecewise continuous]] periodic function with period <math>T</math>. 

The main theorem of Floquet theory, '''Floquet's theorem''', due to {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Gaston Floquet|first=Gaston |last=Floquet|year=1883}}, gives a [[canonical form]] for each [[Fundamental solution|fundamental matrix solution]] of this common [[linear system]]. It gives a [[Change of coordinates|coordinate change]] <math>\displaystyle y=Q^{-1}(t)x</math> with <math>\displaystyle Q(t+2T)=Q(t)</math> that transforms the periodic system to a traditional linear system with constant, real [[coefficients]]. 

In [[solid-state physics]], the analogous result (generalized to three dimensions) is known as [[Bloch wave|Bloch's theorem]].

Note that the solutions of the linear differential equation form a vector space. A matrix <math>\phi(t)</math> is called a fundamental matrix solution if all columns are linearly independent solutions. A matrix <math>\Phi(t)</math> is called a principal fundamental matrix solution if all columns are linearly independent solutions and there exists <math>t_0</math> such that <math>\Phi(t_0)</math> is the identity. A principal fundamental matrix can be constructed from a fundamental matrix using <math>\Phi(t)=\phi(t)\phi^{-1}(t_0)</math>. The solution of the linear differential equation with the initial condition <math>x(0)=x_0</math> is <math>x(t)=\phi(t)\phi^{-1}(0)x_0</math> where <math>\phi(t)</math> is any fundamental matrix solution.

== Floquet's theorem == <!-- [[Floquet theorem]] redirects to this section -->
Let <math>\dot{x}= A(t) x</math> be a linear first order differential equation,
where <math>x(t)</math> is a column vector of length <math>n</math> and <math>A(t)</math> an <math>n \times n</math> periodic matrix with period <math>T</math> (that is <math>A(t + T) = A(t)</math> for all real values of <math>t</math>). Let <math>\phi (t) </math> be a fundamental matrix solution of this differential equation. Then, for all <math>t \in \mathbb{R}</math>,

:<math> \phi(t+T)=\phi(t) \phi^{-1}(0) \phi (T).\ </math>

In addition, for each matrix <math>B</math> (possibly complex) such that

:<math>e^{TB}=\phi^{-1}(0) \phi (T),\ </math>

there is a  periodic (period <math>T</math>) matrix function <math>t \mapsto P(t)</math> such that 

:<math>\phi (t) = P(t)e^{tB}\text{ for all }t \in \mathbb{R}.\ </math>

Also, there is a ''real'' matrix <math>R</math> and a ''real'' periodic (period-<math>2T</math>) matrix function <math>t \mapsto Q(t)</math> such that 

:<math>\phi (t) = Q(t)e^{tR}\text{ for all }t \in \mathbb{R}.\ </math>

In the above <math>B</math>, <math>P</math>, <math>Q</math> and <math>R</math> are <math>n \times n</math> matrices.

== Consequences and applications ==
This mapping <math>\phi (t) = Q(t)e^{tR}</math> gives rise to a time-dependent change of coordinates (<math> y = Q^{-1}(t) x</math>), under which our original system becomes a linear system with real constant coefficients <math>\dot{y} = R y</math>.  Since <math>Q(t)</math> is continuous and periodic it must be bounded. Thus the stability of the zero solution for <math>y(t)</math> and <math>x(t)</math> is determined by the eigenvalues of <math>R</math>.

The representation <math>\phi (t) = P(t)e^{tB}</math> is called a ''Floquet normal form'' for the fundamental matrix <math>\phi (t)</math>.

The [[eigenvalue]]s of <math>e^{TB}</math> are called the [[characteristic multiplier]]s of the system. They are also the eigenvalues of the (linear) Poincaré maps <math>x(t) \to x(t+T)</math>. A '''Floquet exponent''' (sometimes called a characteristic exponent), is a complex <math>\mu</math> such that <math>e^{\mu T}</math> is a characteristic multiplier of the system.  Notice that Floquet exponents are not unique, since <math>e^{(\mu + \frac{2 \pi i k}{T})T}=e^{\mu T}</math>, where <math>k</math> is an integer.  The real parts of the Floquet exponents are called Lyapunov exponents. The zero solution is asymptotically stable if all Lyapunov exponents are negative, [[Lyapunov stability|Lyapunov stable]] if the Lyapunov exponents are nonpositive and unstable otherwise.

* Floquet theory is very important for the study of [[dynamical systems]].
* Floquet theory shows stability in [[Hill's equation]] (introduced by [[George William Hill]]) approximating the motion of the [[moon]] as a [[harmonic oscillator]] in a periodic [[gravitational field]].

== Floquet's theorem applied to Mathieu equation==

Mathieu's equation is related to the wave equation for the elliptic cylinder. 

Given <math>a \in \mathbb{R}, q \in \mathbb{C}</math>, the [[Mathieu equation]] is given by

: <math>\frac {d^2 y} {dw^2} +(a-2q \cos 2w )y=0.</math>

The Mathieu equation is a linear second-order differential equation with periodic coefficients. 

One of the most powerful results of Mathieu's functions is the Floquet's Theorem [1, 2]. 
It states that periodic solutions of  Mathieu equation for any pair (''a'', ''q'') can be expressed in the form

: <math>y(w)=F_{\nu}(w)=e^{iw \nu} P(w) \,</math>

or

: <math>y(w)=F_{\nu}(-w)=e^{-iw \nu} P(-w) \,</math>

where <math> \nu</math> is a constant depending on ''a'' and ''q''  and ''P''(.) is <math> \pi </math>-periodic in ''w''. 

The constant <math> \nu</math> is called the ''characteristic exponent''. 

If <math> \nu</math> is an integer, then <math>F_{\nu}(w)</math> and <math>F_{\nu}(-w)</math> are linear dependent solutions. Furthermore, 

: <math>y(w+k \pi) =e^{i \nu k \pi}y(w)\text{ or }y(w+k \pi) =e^{-i \nu k \pi}y(w), \,</math>

for the solution <math>F_{\nu}(w)</math> or <math>F_{\nu}(-w)</math>, respectively. 

We assume that the pair (''a'', ''q'') is such that <math>| \cosh (i \nu \pi) | <1</math> so that the solution <math> y(w)</math> is bounded on the real axis. General solution of Mathieu's equation (<math>q \in \mathbb{R}</math>, <math> \nu</math> non-integer) is the form 

: <math>y(w) =c_1 e^{i w \nu}P(w)+ c_2e^{-i w \nu}P(-w), \,</math>

where <math>c_1</math> and <math>c_2</math> are arbitrary constants.

All bounded solutions --those of fractional as well as integral order-- are described by an infinite series of [[harmonic oscillation]]s whose amplitudes decrease with increasing frequency. 

Another very important property of Mathieu's functions is the orthogonality [3]: 

If <math>a( \nu +2p,q)</math> and <math>a( \nu +2s,q)</math> are simple roots of 

: <math> \cos(\pi\nu) - y(\pi = 0) = 0, \, </math>

then:

: <math>\int_0^\pi F_{\nu+2p} (w) F_{\nu+2s}(-w) \, dw = 0,\qquad p \ne s,</math>

i.e.,

: <math>\langle F_{\nu +2p} (w),F_{\nu +2s} (w)\rangle = 0, \qquad p \ne s,</math>

where <.,.> denotes an [[inner product]] defined from 0 to ''&pi;''.
