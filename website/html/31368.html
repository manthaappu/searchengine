==Confiscation by the police==
On 21 February 2006, the servers located in a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[datacenter]] were confiscated by the Belgian police, and their operator, who lives in [[Switzerland]], was arrested. This was done after a local judge authorized the confiscation at the datacenter in [[Zaventem]] near [[Brussels]], after a denouncement of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), in collaboration with the [[IFPI|International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]. After the police shut down the site and confiscated the servers however, [http://torrentfreak.com/p2p-is-unstoppable/ P2P traffic stayed much the same], it has even grown 20% since then. {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

The [[MPAA]] Chairman and CEO [[Dan Glickman]], presented this raid as a "major victory":
{{cquote|This is a major victory in our fight to cut off the supply of illegal materials being circulated on the Internet via peer-to-peer networks. By shaving the illegal traffic of copyrighted works facilitated by Razorback2, we are depleting other illegal networks of their ability to supply Internet pirates with copyrighted works which is a positive step in our international effort to fight piracy.<ref>http://www.mpaa.org/press_releases/2006_02_21_razer.pdf</ref>}}

Since the confiscation, the owner was released, and the trial has not started yet. {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Besides having Razorback's equipment confiscated and their site shut down,  copyright enforcement entities such as MPAA and [[IFPI]] have set up several "Razorback2" fake servers online, with the purpose of mimicking the original servers but which yield no useful results, hampering file-sharing traffic. Afterwards, the Swiss anti-piracy tech firm Logistep SA was hired to help further intimidate and prosecute filesharing users.<ref>[http://www.razorback2.com/ Resurrected Razorback2 website (in French)]</ref> 

The raid on Razorback2 was part of a series of raids on [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]] websites or [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] trackers initiated by the [[MPAA]]. Another well publicized example is [[The Pirate Bay raid|the raid on The Pirate Bay]] in [[Sweden]] that took place on May 31, 2006.<ref>http://www.mpaa.org/press_releases/2006_02_23.pdf</ref>
