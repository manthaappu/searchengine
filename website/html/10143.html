A [[computer program|program]] or [[computer file|file]] is '''device independent''' when its function is universal on different types of device.

For the '''[[World Wide Web]]''', this means writing simple common denominator [[Hypertext Markup Language]] (HTML) and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) so that ''most'' Web [[user agent]]s on ''most'' devices can render it acceptably.

For '''[[computer program]]s''', this generally means that it is written in a [[metalanguage]] that can be read by any [[system platform|platform]]. A program that was not originally written for a certain environment can be [[porting|ported]], i.e. the code can be adapted for a certain platform and [[compiler|compiled]] for the platform it will be functioning in. Unfortunately, this can lead to confusion if the [[user interface]] still resembles the one for the platform it was initially designed for.

For '''[[computer file]]s''', device independence means that [[software]] (or, theoretically, [[computer hardware|hardware]]) is in place that can interpret the file and allow the user to view or manipulate it. Good examples of [[cross-platform]] or '''device independent''' [[file format]]s are [[HTML]] and [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[GIF]] and [[JPEG]].
