<html> <head> <title>Back to My Mac</title></head><body>'''Back to My Mac''' is a feature of [[Mac OS X 10.5]] Leopard that uses Wide-Area [[Bonjour (software)|Bonjour]] to securely discover services across the Internet and automatically configure ad hoc, on-demand, point-to-point encrypted connections between computers using [[IPSec]]. It requires users to have a [[MobileMe]] subscription, as it uses MobileMe for the [[Dynamic DNS]] service portion of Wide-Area Bonjour.

Due to its generality, Back to My Mac can work for many [[Bonjour (software)|Bonjour]]-enabled services, not just [[Screen Sharing]] (similar to [[Apple Remote Desktop]]) and File Sharing. In addition to requiring a MobileMe subscription, users must have a router that supports either [[Universal Plug and Play|UPNP]] (Universal Plug & Play) or [[NAT-PMP]]  (NAT Port Mapping Protocol) with either of those features enabled in their connected router. It uses UDP port 4500 for point-to-point IPSec connections (which may be mapped to different UDP ports on the public side of a NAT router).<ref>Glenn Fleishman, [http://www.macworld.com/2007/11/features/backtomymac_side/index.php Back to My Mac: Apple's Internet mashup], ''MacWorld.com'', 7 November 2007</ref>

==Uses==
Back to My Mac can be used to edit and transfer files from one Mac to another. In one instance an [[Apple Store]] employee used this technology to capture the image of a person who stole her [[MacBook]] using the built in [[iSight]] webcam.<ref>[http://www.roughlydrafted.com/2008/04/15/using-back-to-my-mac-to-catch-a-thief/ Using Back to My Macâ€¦ to Catch a Thief!], ''RoughlyDrafted'', 15 April 2008</ref>
