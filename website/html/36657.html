'''TICOM (Target Intelligence Committee)''' was a project formed in [[World War II]] by the United States to find and seize German [[Military espionage|intelligence]] assets, particularly [[cryptographic]] ones. The project was stimulated chiefly by the US military cryptography organizations, and had support from the highest levels. 

Several teams were sent into the field immediately behind the fighting front. In April 1945 a TICOM team found Russian code and  cipher material in a German cryptanalytic center.
 
Captured German cryptographic personnel revealed that, at least amongst the cryptographers, the [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] was clearly recognized as breakable. They had simply believed, it seems, that no one would go to the immense trouble required for the only attacks they could see. 

TICOM was one of several efforts made by the Western Allies to extract German scientific and technological information and personnel during and after the war. Others included [[Operation Paperclip]] (for rocketry), [[Operation Alsos]] (for nuclear information) and [[Operation Surgeon]] (for avionics). 

In [[Operation Stella Polaris]] the [[Finland|Finnish]] [[signals intelligence]] unit was evacuated to [[Sweden]] after the end of the [[Continuation War]]. The records, including cryptographic material ended up in the hands of Americans.
