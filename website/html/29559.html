A '''Polygonizer''' is a tool, used in [[user interface]]s, for creating or editing [[polygon]]s by selecting or manipulating other polygons. For example, by selecting two polygons that touch (topologically) the polygonizer can create a new polygon that is the [[union (set theory)|union]] of the two input polygons.

"Polygonizer" may also refer to the [[Namco System 21]] arcade board.
