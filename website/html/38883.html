<html> <head> <title>Units (software)</title></head><body>'''Units''' is a [[cross-platform]] [[computer program]] for [[conversion of units]] of quantities. It has a database of [[Units of measurement|measurement]]s, including [[List of strange units of measurement|esoteric]] and historical measurements. This for instance allows conversion of velocities specified in [[furlong]]s per [[fortnight]], and pressures specified in [[ton]]s per [[acre]]. The [[plain text]] database ''units.dat'' is a good reference in itself, as it is extensively commented and cites numerous sources.

The original ''units'' program has been a standard part of Unix since the early [[Bell Laboratories]] versions.{{fact|date=April 2007}}

''[http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/udunits/index.jsp UDUNITS]'' is a similar utility program, except that it has an additional programming [[Library (computing)|library]] interface and date conversion abilities. UDUNITS is considered the ''de facto'' program and library for variable unit conversion for [[netCDF]] files.<ref>As specified from several [[NetCDF]] conventions, e.g.:
*'''COARDS''' - {{cite web |title=Conventions for the standardization of NetCDF files |date=1995-02-10 |url=http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/noaa_coop/coop_cdf_profile.html }}
*'''CF''' - {{cite web |title=NetCDF Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions |url=http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/eaton/cf-metadata/CF-1.0.html |date=2003-10-28 }}</ref>

The relatively newer [[GNU]] [[free software]] version of ''units'' (or '''GNU Units''') is written by [[Adrian Mariano]].

==Usage==

''Units'' will output the result of the conversion in two lines.  Usually the first line (multiplication) is the desired result.  The second line is the same conversion expressed as a division.

''Units'' can also do math while converting, including several built in mathematical functions such as [[sine|sin]], [[cosine|cos]], [[arctangent|atan]], [[natural logarithm|log]], [[exponential function|exp]], etc.

If you attempt to convert types of measurements that are incompatible ''units'' will print a conformability error message and display a reduced form of each measurement.

===Examples===

====Interactive mode====

 2083 units, 71 prefixes, 32 nonlinear units
                                                                                                                             
 You have: 10 furlongs
 You want: miles
         * 1.2500025
         / 0.7999984
 You have: 1 gallon + 3 pints
 You want: quarts
         * 5.5
         / 0.18181818
 You have: sqrt(miles^2)
 You want:
         Definition: 1609.344 m
 You have:

====On the [[command line]] (non-interactive)====

 % units 'ten furlongs per fortnight' 'kilometers per hour'
         * 0.0059871548
         / 167.02424

 % units cup ounces
