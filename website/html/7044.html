<html> <head> <title>Common reference string model</title></head><body>In cryptography, the ''common reference string'' (CRS) model captures the assumption that a trusted setup in which all involved parties get access to the same string ''crs'' taken from some distribution ''D'' exists. Schemes [[Provable security|proven secure]] in the CRS model are secure given that the setup was performed correctly. The common reference string model is a generalization of the common random string model, in which ''D'' is the uniform distribution of bit strings. As stated in <ref>Ran Canetti and Marc Fischlin; Universally Composable Commitments; Cryptology ePrint Archive: Report 2001/055 [http://eprint.iacr.org/2001/055 (link)]</ref>, the CRS model is equivalent to the ''reference string model'' <ref>Marc Fischlin, Roger Fischlin: Efficient Non-malleable Commitment Schemes. CRYPTO 2000: 413-431</ref> and the ''public parameters model'' <ref>Ivan Damg√•rd: Efficient Concurrent Zero-Knowledge in the Auxiliary String Model. EUROCRYPT 2000: 418-430</ref>. 

The CRS model has applications in the study of [[non-interactive zero-knowledge proof]]s and [[universal composability]].
