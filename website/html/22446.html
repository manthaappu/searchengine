'''Local Management Interface (LMI)''' is a signaling standard used between [[router]]s and [[frame relay]] switches. Communication takes place between a router and the first frame relay switch it's connected to. Information about [[keepalive]]s, global addressing, [[IP Multicast]] and the status of [[virtual circuits]] is commonly exchanged using LMI.

There are three standards for LMI: ANSI's T1.617 Annex D standard; ITU-T's Q.933 Annex A standard; and the "Gang of Four" standard, named for the four companies that developed it: Cisco, DEC, StrataCom and NorTel (Northern Telecom).

The "Gang of Four" LMI standard uses DLCI 1023<ref name="Odom">{{cite book |title=CCNA ICND2 |last=Odom |first=Wendell |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Cisco Press |location=[[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]] |isbn=1-58720-181-X |url= |page=467 }}</ref>.
