==Overview==

Arnetminer is designed to search and perform [[data mining]] operations against academic publications on the Internet, using social network analysis to identify connections between researchers, conferences, and publications<ref>{{cite journal|coauthors=Jie Tang , Jing Zhang , Limin Yao , Juanzi Li , Li Zhang , Zhong Su|year=2008|title=ArnetMiner: extraction and mining of academic social networks|journal=Proceeding of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining|publisher=ACM|location=New York|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1401890.1402008}}</ref>. This allows it to provide services such as expert finding, association search, course search, academic evaluation, and topic modeling.

Arnetminer was created as a research project in social influence analysis, social network ranking, and social network extraction. A number of peer-reviewed papers have been published arising from the development of the system. It has been in operation for more than three years, and has indexed 700,000 researchers and more than three million publications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arnetminer.org/introduction|title=Arnetminer: introduction|accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref> The research was funded by the Chinese National High-tech R&D Program, the [[National Science Foundation of China]], and [[IBM|IBM China Research Lab]] among other sponsors.

Arnetminer is commonly used in academia to identify relationships between and draw statistical correlations about research and researchers. The product was used in a study aimed at verifying the popular notion that no more than [[six degrees of separation]] connect any two people on Earth.<ref>{{cite journal|coauthors=Lei Zhang, Wanging Tu|title=Six Degrees of Separation in Online Society|publisher=Web Science 2009|url=http://en.scientificcommons.org/43869050}}</ref>

==Operation==

Arnetminer automatically extracts the researcher profile from the web. It collects and identifies the relevant pages, then uses a unified approach to extract data from the identified documents. It also extracts publications from online digital libraries using heuristic rules.

It integrates the extracted researchersâ€™ profiles and the extracted publications. It employs the researcher name as the identifier. A probabilistic framework has been proposed to deal with the name ambiguity problem in the integration. The integrated data is stored into a researcher network knowledge base (RNKB).

The principal other product in the area are Google Scholar, Elsevier's Scirus, and the open source project CiteSeer.
