'''Nanosyntax''' is an approach to [[syntax]] in which [[Concrete syntax tree|syntactic parse trees]] are built up out of a large number of syntactic constituents. Each [[morpheme]] may correspond to several such elements, which do not have to form a "subtree".

Some recent work in [[theoretical linguistics]] suggests that the "atoms" of syntax are much smaller than [[word]]s or [[morpheme]]s. From that it immediately follows that the responsibility of syntax is not limited to ordering "preconstructed" words. Instead, within the framework of nanosyntax, the words are derived entities built in syntax, rather than primitive elements supplied by a lexicon.

The beginnings of nanosyntax can be traced to a 1993 article by [[Kenneth Hale]] and [[Samuel Jay Keyser|S. Jay Keyser]] titled 'On Argument Structure and the Lexical Representation of Syntactic Relations'<ref>Hale, Kenneth and S. Jay Keyser. 1993. On Argument Structure and the Lexical Representation of Syntactic Relations.  In ''The View from Building 20'', edited by Kenneth Hale and S. Jay Keyser, pp. 53-109. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press. ISBN 978-0262581240</ref>, which first introduced the concept of l-syntax.
