of applications for [[Facebook]], [[Meebo]], [[OpenSocial]], iPhone web applications, and other social platforms, as well as [[web widgets]]. Users of zembly interacted with one another via zembly's social networking features to engage in co-development of applications for these platforms. 

In addition to the development environment, the zembly platform, provided the ability to consume Web APIs ([[RESTful|RESTful web services]]) in zembly applications as well as externally using the open source zembly client library (with language bindings for [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[JavaFx]]). This functionality provided a consistent programming model across various API providers. 

Zembly combined features from traditional [[Integrated Development Environment|IDE]]s (such as a rich scripting editor) with wiki- and social-networking-based technologies to attempt to innovate on the application development paradigm for smaller-sized applications. Applications created at zembly were automatically and transparently deployed, hosted, and scaled on its underlying [[cloud computing]] infrastructure.

== Architecture ==

Zembly was run as a product within [[Sun Microsystems]]'s cloud computing organization, with the hosting of the website and developer applications provided by [[Network.com]]'s compute cloud. It was built on a stack consisting largely of Sun technologies, including [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] 10, [[Java (programming language)|Java]], the [[GlassFish]] application server, and [[MySQL]]. The software stack ran on a horizontally scaled cluster of [[Sun Fire]] T2000 ("Niagara") and [[X4500]] ("Thumper") servers. In addition, zembly used [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] and [[memcached]]. Zembly had also incorporated (and contributed to) [[Mozilla Bespin]].

== Closure ==

In November 2009 zembly announced that the site would be closed on 2009-11-30 and that "once the site is shutdown, all your applications and services on zembly will be unavailable".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zembly.com/static/suspend/index.html|title=Zembly Shutdown Notice|accessdate=2009-11-10}}</ref>
Some Zembly developers have expressed frustration about Zembly abandoning them without even open-sourcing their code.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hasin.wordpress.com/2009/11/10/zembly-is-deadpooled-2-5-yrs-of-effort-went-in-vain/|title=zembly is deadpooled â€“ 2.5 yrs of effort went in vain :(|accessdate=2010-03-18}}</ref>
