The '''CMU Pronouncing Dictionary''' (also known as ''cmudict'') is a [[public domain]] pronouncing [[dictionary]] created by [[Carnegie Mellon University]] (CMU). It is used as the American lexicon for the [[Festival Speech Synthesis System]] and also for the [[CMU Sphinx]] speech recognition system. The latest release is 0.7a, which contains 133,746 entries (from 123,442 baseforms).

==Database Format==
The database is distributed as a text file of the format ''word <two spaces> pronunciation''. If there are multiple pronunciations available for a word, all subsequent entries are followed by an index in [[Bracket#Parentheses .28 .29|parentheses]]. The pronunciation is encoded using a modified form of the [[Arpabet]] system. The difference is stress marks on vowels with levels 0, 1, 2; not all entries have stress however.
