'''Transaction authentication''' generally refers to the Internet-based security method of securely identifying a user through two or three factor authentication ([[Two-factor authentication]]: something you know plus something you have and/or something you are) at a transaction level, rather than at the traditional Session or Logon level.

An internet banking application may allow a customer to perform numerous transactions within the single session and hence each, or selected transactions, will require the user to re-authenticate themselves using the appropriate two or three factor authentication method (see [[Two-factor authentication]]). Authentication, no matter how strong the method(s) used cannot protect against so called [[Man-in-the-Middle]] (MitM) or [[Man in the Browser|Man-in-the-Browser]] (MitB) attacks. This differs from [[Transaction verification]], also an Internet based security method, which is specifically designed to combat so called [[Man-in-the-Middle]] (MitM) and [[Man in the Browser|Man-in-the-Browser]] (MitB) attacks through not only authenticating the identity of the user, but also verifying the integrity of the actual content of the transaction, i.e. ensuring it has not been altered by one of these fraudulent techniques.
