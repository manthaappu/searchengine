The '''Clean Slate Program''' is an interdisciplinary research program at [[Stanford University]] which aims to consider how the internet would be redesigned with a "Clean Slate".  Its Program Director is [[Nick McKeown]].

==Outline==
It is based on the belief that the current Internet has significant deficiencies that need to be solved before it can become a unified global communication infrastructure, and that the Internet's shortcomings will not be resolved by the conventional incremental and backward-compatible style of academic and industrial networking research. The program aims to focus on unconventional, bold, and long-term research that tries to break the network's ossification. To this end, the research program is characterized by two research questions:
* "With what we know today, if we were to start again with a clean slate, how would we design a global communications infrastructure", and
* "How should the Internet look in 15 years."

They aim to measure success in the long-term: looking back in 15 years time to see significant impact.

They identify five key areas for research:
# Network architecture
# Heterogeneous applications
# Heterogeneous physical layer technologies
# Security
# Economics & policy

and expect these areas will evolve and perhaps change completely as the program progresses.<ref>[http://cleanslate.stanford.edu/ Clean Slate website at Stanford]</ref>
