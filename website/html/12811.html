<html> <head> <title>Expectation propagation</title></head><body>'''Expectation propagation (EP)''' is a technique in Bayesian [[machine learning]], developed by [[Thomas Minka]].

EP finds approximations to a [[probability distribution]]. It uses an iterative approach that leverages the factorization structure of the target distribution.  It differs from other Bayesian approximation approaches such as [[Variational Bayesian methods]].
