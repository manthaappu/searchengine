In [[genetic programming]] (GP) a '''linear tree''' is a program composed of a variable number of unary functions and a single [[leaf node|terminal]]. Note linear tree GP differs from bit string [[genetic algorithms]] since a population may contain programs of different lengths and there may be more than two types of functions or more than two types of terminals.
