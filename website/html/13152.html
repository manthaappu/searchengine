<html> <head> <title>FTP bounce attack</title></head><body>'''FTP bounce attack''' is an [[exploit (computer science)|exploit]] of the [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] protocol whereby an attacker is able to use the <tt>PORT</tt> command to request access to [[Transmission Control Protocol|ports]] indirectly through the use of the victim machine as a middle man for the request.

This technique can be used to [[port scan]] hosts discreetly, and to access specific ports that the attacker cannot access through a direct connection.

[[nmap]] is a port scanner that can utilize an FTP bounce attack to scan other servers.  

Nearly all modern FTP server programs are configured by default to refuse <tt>PORT</tt> commands that would connect to any host but the originating host, thwarting FTP bounce attacks.
