<html> <head> <title>Deluxe Music Construction Set</title></head><body>'''''Deluxe Music Construction Set''''' is a 1986 [[music]] composition, [[musical notation|notation]] and playback [[software|program]] for the [[Amiga]] and [[Apple Macintosh]] [[home computer]]s.  It was the first music program for the Amiga system and was created by Geoff Brown and published by [[Electronic Arts]] (EA). [[Ariolasoft]] published the program in Europe under license from EA.

''Deluxe Music Construction Set'' was the first of a line of music programs for the Amiga to make use of its 4 voice 8-bit sample playback and [[MIDI]] synthesis.  Some compared the Amiga's sample playback, at the time, to the first [[Ensoniq Mirage]] Sampler which was selling for over [[United States dollar|USD]]$1000 in the mid-1980s. This program required 256 [[kilobyte|KB]] of [[RAM]], but with 512KB, it could be used for sample playback and complex music composition.

''Deluxe Music Construction Set'' included Bach's [[Little Fugue in G minor, BWV 578|Fugue in G minor "Little"]]. 

''Deluxe Music Construction Set'' was more complex and capable than the first music application that EA made for the [[Commodore 64]], [[Apple II family|Apple II]], [[Atari 800|Atari]] and [[Atari ST]] computers, ''[[Music Construction Set]]''.  For example, it allowed users to enter [[lyrics]] in with the musical score, though the lyrics were strictly for the user's benefit, as the program did not attempt to "sing" the words.

''Deluxe Music Construction Set'' was also released for the Macintosh, though it was hampered by its copy protection, which used a low-level code encryption that skirted the Macintosh toolbox, resulting in it becoming incompatible with Macintosh System software when upgraded to System 6.
