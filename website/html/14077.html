<html> <head> <title>Fractional calculus</title></head><body>'''Fractional calculus''' is a branch of [[mathematical analysis]] that studies the possibility of taking [[real number]] powers or [[complex number]] powers of the [[differential operator]] 

::<math>D = \dfrac{d}{dx},</math>

and the integration operator ''J''. (Usually ''J'' is used instead of ''I'' to avoid confusion with other ''I''-like glyphs and [[identity (mathematics)|identities]].)

In this context the term ''powers'' refers to iterative application or composition, in the same sense that ''f ''<sup>2</sup>(x) = f(f(x)).<br>
For example, one may ask the question of meaningfully interpreting

::<math>\sqrt{D} = D^{1/2} \,</math>

as a [[square root]] of the differentiation [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] (an operator [[half iterate]]), i.e., an expression for some operator that when applied ''twice'' to a function will have the same effect as [[derivative|differentiation]]. More generally, one can look at the question of defining

::<math>D^a \,</math>

for real-number values of ''a'' in such a way that when ''a'' takes an [[integer]] value ''n'', the usual power of ''n''-fold differentiation is recovered for ''n'' > 0, and the &minus;''n''th power of ''J'' when ''n'' < 0.

There are various reasons for looking at this question.  One is that, in this way, the [[semigroup]] of powers ''D''<sup>''n''</sup> in the ''discrete'' variable ''n'' is seen inside a ''continuous'' semigroup (one hopes) {{clarify|date=January 2011}} with parameter ''a'' which is a real number. Continuous semigroups are prevalent in mathematics, and have an interesting theory. Notice here that ''fraction'' is then a misnomer for the exponent, since it need not be [[rational number|rational]], but the term ''fractional calculus'' has become traditional.

'''Fractional differential equations''' are a generalization of [[differential equation]]s through the application of fractional calculus.

==Nature of the fractional derivative==

An important point is that the fractional derivative at a point ''x'' is a ''local property'' only when ''a'' is an integer; in non-integer cases we cannot say that the fractional derivative at ''x'' of a function ''f'' depends only on the graph of ''f'' very near ''x'', in the way that integer-power derivatives certainly do. Therefore it is expected that the theory involves some sort of [[boundary condition]]s, involving information on the function further out. To use a metaphor, the fractional derivative requires some [[peripheral vision]].

As far as the existence of such a theory is concerned, the foundations of the subject were laid by [[Liouville]] in a paper from 1832. The fractional derivative of a function to order ''a'' is often now defined by means of  the [[Fourier transform|Fourier]] or [[Mellin transform|Mellin]] integral transforms. <ref>For the history of the subject, see the thesis (in French): Stéphane Dugowson, [http://s.dugowson.free.fr/recherche/dones/index.html ''Les différentielles métaphysiques''] (''histoire et philosophie de la généralisation de l'ordre de dérivation''), Thèse, Université Paris Nord (1994)</ref>


==Heuristics==

A fairly natural question to ask is whether there exists an operator <math>H</math>, or '''half-derivative''', such that

::<math>H^2 f(x) = D f(x) = \dfrac{d}{dx} f(x) = f'(x) </math>.

It turns out that there is such an operator, and indeed for any <math>a > 0</math>, there exists an operator <math>P</math> such that 

::<math>(P ^ a f)(x) = f'(x) \,</math>, 

or to put it another way, the definition of <math>\dfrac{d^ny}{dx^n}</math> can be extended to all real values of ''n''.

To delve into a little detail, start with the [[Gamma function]] <math>\Gamma \,</math>, which extends [[factorial]]s to non-integer values.
This is defined such that 
::<math>n! = \Gamma(n+1) \,</math>.

Assuming a function <math>f(x)</math> that is defined where <math> x > 0 </math>, form the definite integral from 0 to ''x''. Call this 

::<math> ( J f ) ( x ) = \int_0^x f(t) \; dt </math>.

Repeating this process gives

::<math> ( J^2 f ) ( x ) = \int_0^x ( J f ) ( t ) dt = \int_0^x \left( \int_0^t f(s) \; ds \right) \; dt</math>,
and this can be extended arbitrarily.

The [[Cauchy formula for repeated integration]], namely

::<math> (J^n f) ( x ) = { 1 \over (n-1) ! } \int_0^x (x-t)^{n-1} f(t) \; dt,</math>

leads to a straightforward way to a generalization for real ''n''.

Simply using the Gamma function to remove the discrete nature of the factorial function (recalling that <math>\Gamma\left(n+1\right)\,=\,n!</math>, or equivalently <math>\Gamma\left(n\right)\,=\,(n-1)!</math>) gives us a natural candidate for fractional applications of the integral operator.

::<math> (J^\alpha f) ( x ) = { 1 \over \Gamma ( \alpha ) } \int_0^x (x-t)^{\alpha-1} f(t) \; dt</math>

This is in fact a well-defined operator.

It can be shown that the ''J'' operator satisfies

::<math> (J^\alpha) (J^\beta) f = (J^\beta) (J^\alpha) f = (J^{\alpha+\beta} ) f = { 1 \over \Gamma ( \alpha + \beta) } \int_0^x (x-t)^{\alpha+\beta-1} f(t) \; dt</math>

this relationship is called the semigroup property of fractional [[differintegral]] operators. Unfortunately the comparable process for the derivative operator ''D'' is significantly more complex, but it can be shown that ''D'' is neither [[commutative]] nor [[additive]] in general.{{fact|date=April 2010}}

==Fractional derivative of a simple function==
[[Image:Half-derivative.svg|right|thumb|320px|The half derivative (purple curve) of the function <math>f(x)=x</math> (blue curve) together with the first derivative (red curve).]]
Let us assume that <math>f(x)</math> is a monomial of the form 

::<math> f(x)=x^k\;.</math>

The first derivative is as usual 

::<math> f'(x)=\dfrac{d}{dx}f(x)=k x^{k-1}\;.</math> 

Repeating this gives the more general result that

::<math> \dfrac{d^a}{dx^a}x^k=\dfrac{k!}{(k-a)!}x^{k-a}\;,</math>

Which, after replacing the [[factorial]]s with the [[Gamma function]], leads us to 

::<math> \dfrac{d^a}{dx^a}x^k=\dfrac{\Gamma(k+1)}{\Gamma(k-a+1)}x^{k-a}\;.</math>

For k = 1 and a = 1/2 we obtain the half-derivative of the function <math>x</math> as

::<math> \dfrac{d^{1/2}}{dx^{1/2}}x=\dfrac{\Gamma(1+1)}{\Gamma(1-1/2+1)}x^{1-1/2}=\dfrac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}x^{1/2}.</math>

Repeating this process yields

::<math>\dfrac{d^{1/2}}{dx^{1/2}}2\pi^{-1/2}x^{1/2}=2\pi^{-1/2}\dfrac{\Gamma(1+1/2)}{\Gamma(1/2-1/2+1)}x^{1/2-1/2}=2\pi^{-1/2}\dfrac{\Gamma(3/2)}{\Gamma(1)}x^{0}=1,</math>

which is indeed the expected result of

::<math> \left(\dfrac{d^{1/2}}{dx^{1/2}}\dfrac{d^{1/2}}{dx^{1/2}}\right)x=\dfrac{d}{dx}x=1.</math>

This extension of the above differential operator need not be constrained only to real powers.  For example, the <math>(1+i)</math>th derivative of the <math>(1-i)</math>th derivative yields the 2nd derivative. Also notice that setting negative values for ''a'' yields integrals.

The complete fractional derivative which will yield the same result as above is (for <math>0<\alpha<1</math>)
::<math>D^{\alpha}f(x)=\frac{1}{\Gamma(1-\alpha)}\frac{d}{dx}\int_{0}^{x}\frac{f(t)}{(x-t)^{\alpha}}dt</math>

For arbitrary <math>\alpha</math>, since the gamma function is undefined for arguments whose real part is a negative integer, it is necessary to apply the fractional derivative after the integer derivative has been performed.  For example,
::<math>D^{3/2}f(x)=D^{1/2}D^{1}f(x)=D^{1/2}\frac{d}{dx}f(x)</math>

==Laplace transform==
We can also come at the question via the [[Laplace transform]]. Noting that
:<math>\mathcal L \left\{Jf\right\}(s) = \mathcal L \left\{\int_0^t f(\tau)\,d\tau\right\}(s)=\frac1s(\mathcal L\left\{f\right\})(s)</math>
and
:<math>\mathcal L \left\{J^2f\right\}=\frac1s(\mathcal L \left\{Jf\right\} )(s)=\frac1{s^2}(\mathcal L\left\{f\right\})(s)</math>
etc., we assert
:<math>J^\alpha f=\mathcal L^{-1}\left\{s^{-\alpha}(\mathcal L\{f\})(s)\right\}</math>.
For example
:<math>
\begin{array}{lcr}
J^\alpha\left(t^k\right) &= &\mathcal L^{-1}\left\{\dfrac{\Gamma(k+1)}{s^{\alpha+k+1}}\right\}\\
&= &\dfrac{\Gamma(k+1)}{\Gamma(\alpha+k+1)}t^{\alpha+k}
\end{array}
</math>
as expected. Indeed, given the [[convolution]] rule <math>\mathcal L\{f*g\}=(\mathcal L\{f\})(\mathcal L\{g\})</math> (and shorthanding <math>p(x)=x^{\alpha-1}</math> for clarity) we find that
:<math>
\begin{array}{rcl}
(J^\alpha f)(t) &= &\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\mathcal L^{-1}\left\{\left(\mathcal L\{p\}\right)(\mathcal L\{f\})\right\}\\
&=&\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)}(p*f)\\
&=&\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\int_0^t p(t-\tau)f(\tau)\,d\tau\\
&=&\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\int_0^t(t-\tau)^{\alpha-1}f(\tau)\,d\tau\\
\end{array}
</math>
which is what Cauchy gave us above.

Laplace transforms "work" on relatively few functions, but they ''are'' often useful for solving fractional differential equations.

==Riemann–Liouville integral==

The classical form of fractional calculus is given by the [[Riemann–Liouville integral]], essentially what has been described above. The theory for [[periodic function]]s, therefore including the 'boundary condition' of repeating after a period, is the [[Weyl differintegral]]. It is defined on [[Fourier series]], and requires the constant Fourier coefficient to vanish (so, applies to functions on the [[unit circle]] integrating to 0).

By contrast the [[Grünwald–Letnikov derivative]] starts with the derivative instead of the integral.

== Functional calculus ==

In the context of [[functional analysis]], functions ''f(D)'' more general than powers are studied in the [[functional calculus]] of [[Spectral theorem|spectral theory]].  The theory of [[pseudo-differential operator]]s also allows one to consider powers of ''D''.  The operators arising are examples of [[singular integral operator]]s; and the generalisation of the classical theory to higher dimensions is called the theory of [[Riesz potential]]s.  So there are a number of contemporary theories available, within which ''fractional calculus'' can be discussed.  See also [[Erdélyi–Kober operator]], important in [[special function]] theory {{harv|Kober|1940}}, {{harv|Erdélyi|1950–51}}.

== Applications ==

==== Fractional Conservation of Mass ====

As described by Wheatcraft and Meerschaert (2008)<ref> Wheatcraft, S., Meerschaert, M., (2008).  "Fractional Conservation of Mass."  Advances in Water Resources 31, 1377-1381.</ref>, a fractional conservation of mass equation is needed when the control volume is not large enough compared to the scale of heterogeneity and when the flux within the control volume is non-linear.  In the referenced paper, the fractional conservation of mass equation for fluid flow is:

<math> -\rho (\nabla^{\alpha} \cdot \vec{u}) = \Gamma(\alpha +1)\Delta x^{1-\alpha}\rho(\beta_s+\phi \beta_w) \frac{\part p}{\part t} </math>

==== Fractional Advection Dispersion Equation ====

This equation has been shown useful for modeling contaminant flow in heterogenous porous media <ref> Benson, D., Wheatcraft, S., Meerschaert, M., (2000).  "Application of a fractional advection-dispersion equation."  Water Resources Res 36, 1403-1412.</ref><ref> Benson, D., Wheatcraft, S., Meerschaert, M., (2000).  "The fractional-order governing equation of L\acute{e}vy motion."  Water Resources Res 36, 1413-1423.</ref><ref> Benson, D., Schumer, R., Wheatcraft, S., Meerschaert, M., (2001).  "Fractional dispersion, L\acute{e}vy motion, and the MADE tracer tests."  Transport Porous Media 42, 211-240.</ref>

==== WKB approximation ====

for the semiclassical approximation in one dimensional spatial system (x,t) the inverse of the potential <math> V^{-1} (x) </math> inside the Hamiltonian <math> H= p^2 + V(x) </math> is given by the half-integral of the density of states <math> V^{-1} (x) = 2 \sqrt \pi \frac{d^{1/2}n(x)}{dx^{1/2}} </math> taken in units where <math> \hbar = 2m = 1 </math> (ref: 6)
