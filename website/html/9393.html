A '''data mining agent''' is a software program built for the primary purpose of finding information efficiently. It is a type of [[intelligent agent]] that operates in a [[data warehouse]] and does the actual dirty work involved in finding sometimes less than obvious relationships between different pieces of data.  This type of agent is able to detect major trend changes, as well as detect new pertinent information. If a new piece of information is found, the agent will generally attempt to alert the end-user of the new information. 

For example, a corporation may develop an agent to analyze economic trends.  If the agent detects that consumers are becoming more conservative, it will alert management of the change. With this information in hand, management can better plan on how to produce, market, and sell its product. It will make all the process efficiently.
