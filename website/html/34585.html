'''<code>size_t</code>''' is an unsigned data type defined by several C/C++ standards (e.g., the [[C99]] ISO/IEC 9899 standard) that is defined in <code>[[stddef.h]]</code>.<ref>http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf chapter 7.17</ref> It can be further imported by inclusion of <code>[[stdlib.h]]</code> as this file internally sub includes <code>stddef.h</code>.<ref>http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf chapter 7.20</ref>

This type is used to represent the size of an object. Library functions that take or return sizes expect them to be of type  or have the return type of <code>size_t</code>. Further, the most frequently used compiler-based operator <code>[[sizeof]]</code> should evaluate to a value that is compatible with <code>size_t</code>.

==Range and storage size of size_t==
The actual type of <code>size_t</code> is platform-dependent; a common mistake is to assume <code>size_t</code> is the same as <code>unsigned int</code>, which can lead to programming errors,<ref>[http://www.gamedev.net/reference/programming/features/20issues64bit/ gamedev.net - 20 issues of porting C++ code on the 64-bit platform]</ref><ref>[http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/lessons-on-development-of-64-bit-cc-applications/ software.intel.com - Lessons on development of 64-bit C/C++ applications]</ref> when moving from 32 to 64-bit architecture, for example.

According to the 1999 ISO C standard (C99), <code>size_t</code> is an unsigned integer type of at least 16 bits.

==Signed variant ssize_t==
In some implementations there is further a non-standard signed variant of this type with name <code>ssize_t</code>. The type definition for <code>ssize_t</code> is available in most Unix compatible systems.  It was probably introduced by the second edition of the POSIX 1003.1 standard (1003.1-1996).<ref>http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-help/2006-06/msg00188.html</ref>

The <code>ssize_t</code> type follows the same rules as <code>size_t</code> for its storage size, location and inclusion, and uses the implementation's usual representation of signed values&mdash;2's complement in most, if not all, cases.
