'''Chemistry''' (the etymology of the word has been much disputed<ref>'''See:''' [[Chemistry (etymology)]] for possible origins of this word.</ref>) is the [[science]] of [[matter]] and the changes it undergoes. The science of matter is also addressed by [[physics]], but while physics takes a more general and fundamental approach, chemistry is more specialized, being concerned with the composition, behavior (or reaction), structure, and properties of [[matter]], as well as the changes it undergoes during [[chemical reaction]]s.<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Chemistry Chemistry]. (n.d.). Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary. Retrieved August 19, 2007.</ref> It is a [[physical science]] which studies various [[chemical substance|substance]]s, [[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, [[crystal]]s and other aggregates of matter whether in isolation or combination, and which incorporates the concepts of [[energy]] and [[entropy]] in relation to the [[spontaneous reaction|spontaneity]] of [[chemical process]]es.

Disciplines within chemistry are traditionally grouped by the type of matter being studied or the kind of study. These include [[inorganic chemistry]], the study of [[inorganic]] matter; [[organic chemistry]], the study of [[organic compound|organic]] (carbon based) matter; [[biochemistry]], the study of [[chemical substance|substances]] found in [[organisms|biological organisms]]; [[physical chemistry]], the study of chemical processes using physical concepts such as [[thermodynamics]] and [[quantum mechanics]]; and [[analytical chemistry]], the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their [[chemical composition]] and [[Chemical structure|structure]]. Many more specialized disciplines have emerged in recent years, e.g. [[neurochemistry]] the chemical study of the [[nervous system]] (see [[#Subdisciplines|subdisciplines]]).

==Summary==
Chemistry is the scientific study of interaction of [[chemical substance]]s<ref>[http://chemweb.ucc.ie/what_is_chemistry.htm What is Chemistry?]</ref> that are constituted of [[atom]]s or the subatomic particles: [[proton]]s, [[electron]]s and [[neutron]]s.<ref>[http://www.visionlearning.com/library/module_viewer.php?mid=49 Matter: Atoms from Democritus to Dalton] by Anthony Carpi, Ph.D.</ref> Atoms combine to produce [[molecule]]s or [[crystal]]s. Chemistry is often called "[[the central science]]" because it connects the other [[natural science]]s such as [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[material science]], [[biology]] and [[geology]].<ref>Theodore L. Brown, H. Eugene Lemay, Bruce Edward Bursten, H. Lemay. ''Chemistry: The Central Science''. Prentice Hall; 8 edition (1999). ISBN 0-13-010310-1. Pages 3-4.</ref><ref>It is sometimes called the central science because it is seen as occupying an intermediate position in a hierarchy of the sciences by "reductive level", between physics and biology. See Carsten Reinhardt. ''Chemical Sciences in the 20th Century: Bridging Boundaries''. Wiley-VCH, 2001. ISBN 3-527-30271-9. Pages 1-2.</ref>

The genesis of chemistry can be traced to certain practices, known as [[alchemy]], which had been practiced for several [[millennia]] in various parts of the world, particularly the Middle East.<ref>[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-04 Dictionary of the History of Ideas: Alchemy]</ref>

The structure of objects we commonly use and the properties of the matter we commonly interact with are a consequence of the properties of chemical substances and their interactions. For example, [[steel]] is [[Hardness (materials science)|harder]] than iron because its atoms are bound together in a more rigid [[crystalline lattice]]; wood burns or undergoes rapid [[oxidation]] because it can react spontaneously with [[oxygen]] in a [[chemical reaction]] above a certain [[temperature]]; sugar and salt dissolve in water because their molecular/ionic properties are such that dissolution is preferred under the ambient conditions.

The transformations that are studied in chemistry are a result of interaction either between different chemical substances or between [[matter]] and [[energy]]. Traditional chemistry involves study of [[chemical interaction|interactions]] between [[chemical substance|substances]] in a chemistry [[laboratory]] using various forms of [[laboratory glassware]].
[[Image:Lab bench.jpg|thumb|left|[[Laboratory]], Institute of Biochemistry, [[University of Cologne]]]]
A [[chemical reaction]] is a transformation of some substances into one or more other substances.<ref>IUPAC [[Gold Book]] [http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/C01033.pdf Definition]</ref> It can be symbolically depicted through a [[chemical equation]]. The number of atoms on the left and the right in the equation for a chemical transformation is most often equal. The nature of chemical reactions a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules, known as chemical laws.

[[Energy]] and [[entropy]] considerations are invariably important in almost all chemical studies. Chemical substances are classified in terms of their [[structure]], phase as well as their [[chemical composition]]s. They can be analyzed using the tools of [[chemical analysis]], e.g. [[spectroscopy]] and [[chromatography]]. [[Scientists]] engaged in chemical [[research]] are known as [[chemists]].<ref>[http://www.calmis.ca.gov/file/occguide/CHEMIST.HTM California Occupational Guide Number 22: Chemists]</ref> Most chemists specialize in one or more sub-disciplines.

==History==
{{Main|History of chemistry}}
{{See also|Alchemy|Timeline of chemistry|Nobel Prize in Chemistry}}

[[Ancient Egypt]]ians pioneered the art of synthetic "wet" chemistry up to 4,000 years ago.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg16121734.300-first-chemists.html First chemists], February 13, 1999, New Scientist</ref> By 1000 BC ancient civilizations were using technologies that formed the basis of the various branches of chemistry such as; extracting metal from their ores, making pottery and glazes, fermenting beer and wine, making pigments for cosmetics and painting, extracting chemicals from plants for medicine and perfume, making cheese, dying cloth, tanning leather, rendering fat into soap, making glass, and making alloys like bronze.
[[Image:Epicurus Louvre.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Democritus]]' atomist philosophy was later adopted by [[Epicurus]] (341–270 BCE).]]
The genesis of chemistry can be traced to the widely observed phenomenon of [[combustion|burning]] that led to [[metallurgy]]&mdash;the art and science of processing ores to get metals (e.g. [[History of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent|metallurgy in ancient India]]). The greed for gold led to the discovery of the process for its purification, even though the underlying principles were not well understood&mdash;it was thought to be a transformation rather than purification. Many scholars in those days thought it reasonable to believe that there exist means for transforming cheaper (base) metals into gold. This gave way to alchemy and the search for the [[Philosopher's Stone]] which was believed to bring about such a transformation by mere touch.<ref>[http://www.chemheritage.org/explore/ancients-time.html Alchemy Timeline] - Chemical Heritage Society</ref>

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[atomism]] dates back to 440 BC, as what might be indicated by the book ''De Rerum Natura'' (The Nature of Things)<ref>{{cite web

A tentative outline is as follows:

# Egyptian alchemy [3,000 BCE – 400 BCE], formulate early "element" theories such as the [[Ogdoad]].
# Greek alchemy [332 BCE – 642 CE], the Greek king [[Alexander the Great]] conquers Egypt and founds [[Alexandria]], having the world's largest library, where scholars and wise men gather to study.
# [[Alchemy (Islam)|Arab alchemy]] [642 CE – 1200], the Muslim conquest of Egypt (primarily Alexandria); development of the Scientific Method by [[Alhazen]] and [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] revolutionise the field of Chemistry. Jābir (Latin name Geber) accepted many of the ideas of [[Aristotle]] but also modified Aristotle's ideas.<ref name="chemistry"/>
#The House of Wisdom (Arabic: بيت الحكمة‎; Bait al-Hikma), Al-Andalus (Arabic: الأندلس‎) and Alexandria (Arabic: الإسكندرية) become the world leading institutions where scientists of all religious and ethnic backgrounds worked together in harmony expanding the reaches of Chemistry in a time known as the [[Islamic Golden Age]].
#Arabs and Persians continue to dominate the field of Chemistry, mastering it and expanding the boundaries of knowledge and experimentation. Besides technical advances in processes and apparatus, the Arabs had developed and improved the purity of substances such as [[alcohol]]s, [[acid]]s, and [[gunpowder]], which were not available to the Europeans.<ref name="chemistry">Richard Myers (2003).

The earliest pioneers of Chemistry, and inventors of the modern [[scientific method]],<ref>[[Morris Kline]] (1985) [http://books.google.com/books?id=f-e0bro-0FUC&pg=PA284&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''Mathematics for the nonmathematician''].

{{quote|"Chemistry as a science was almost created by the Muslims; for in this field, where the Greeks (so far as we know) were confined to industrial experience and vague [[hypothesis]], the [[Saracen]]s introduced precise [[observation]], controlled [[experiment]], and careful records.

The most influential Muslim chemists were [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (Geber, d. 815), [[al-Kindi]] (d. 873), [[al-Razi]] (d. 925), [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī|al-Biruni]] (d. 1048) and [[Alhazen]] (d. 1039).<ref>Dr. K.

The contribution of [[History of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent|Indian alchemists and metallurgists]] in the development of chemistry was also quite significant.<ref>[[Will Durant]] (1935): Our Oriental Heritage: Simon & Schuster:
<br />{{quote|"Something has been said about the chemical excellence of cast iron in ancient India, and about the high industrial development of the Gupta times, when India was looked to, even by Imperial Rome, as the most skilled of the nations in such chemical industries as dyeing, tanning, soap-making, glass and cement... By the sixth century the Hindus were far ahead of Europe in industrial chemistry; they were masters of calcination, distillation, sublimation, steaming, fixation, the production of light without heat, the mixing of anesthetic and soporific powders, and the preparation of metallic salts, compounds and alloys. The tempering of steel was brought in ancient India to a perfection unknown in Europe till our own times; King Porus is said to have selected, as a specially valuable gift from Alexander, not gold or silver, but thirty pounds of steel. The Moslems took much of this Hindu chemical science and industry to the Near East and Europe; the secret of manufacturing "Damascus" blades, for example, was taken by the Arabs from the Persians, and by the Persians from India.""}}</ref>

The emergence of chemistry in Europe was primarily due to the recurrent incidence of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] and blights there during the so called [[Dark Ages]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} This gave rise to a need for medicines. It was thought that there exists a universal medicine called the [[Elixir of Life]] that can cure all diseases{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}, but like the Philosopher's Stone, it was never found.
[[Image:Antoine lavoisier color.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier]] is considered the "Father of Modern Chemistry".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eagle |first=Cassandra T. |coauthors=Jennifer Sloan |title=Marie Anne Paulze Lavoisier: The Mother of Modern Chemistry |journal=The Chemical Educator |year=1998 |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=1 – 18 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x14v35m5n8822v42/fulltext.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-12-14 |doi=10.1007/s00897980249a }}</ref>]]
For some practitioners, alchemy was an intellectual pursuit, over time, they got better at it. [[Paracelsus]] (1493&ndash;1541), for example, rejected the 4-elemental theory and with only a vague understanding of his chemicals and medicines, formed a hybrid of alchemy and science in what was to be called ''[[iatrochemistry]]''. Similarly, the influences of philosophers such as [[Francis Bacon|Sir Francis Bacon]] (1561&ndash;1626) and [[René Descartes]] (1596&ndash;1650), who demanded more rigor in mathematics and in removing bias from scientific observations, led to a [[scientific revolution]]. In chemistry, this began with [[Robert Boyle]] (1627&ndash;1691), who came up with an equation known as [[Boyle's Law]] about the characteristics of gaseous state.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/boyle_robert.shtml BBC - History - Robert Boyle (1627 - 1691)]</ref>

Chemistry indeed came of age when [[Antoine Lavoisier]] (1743&ndash;1794), developed the theory of [[Conservation of mass]] in 1783; and the development of the [[Atomic Theory]] by [[John Dalton]] around 1800. The Law of Conservation of Mass resulted in the reformulation of chemistry based on this law{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} and the oxygen theory of combustion, which was largely based on the work of Lavoisier. Lavoisier's fundamental contributions to chemistry were a result of a conscious effort{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} to fit all experiments into the framework of a single theory. He established the consistent use of the chemical balance, used oxygen to overthrow the [[phlogiston theory]], and developed a new system of chemical nomenclature and made contribution to the modern metric system. Lavoisier also worked to translate the archaic and technical language of chemistry into something that could be easily understood by the largely uneducated masses, leading to an increased public interest in chemistry. All these advances in chemistry led to what is usually called the [[chemical revolution]]. The contributions of Lavoisier led to what is now called modern chemistry&mdash;the chemistry that is studied in educational institutions all over the world. It is because of these and other contributions that [[Antoine Lavoisier]] is often celebrated as the "[[People known as the father or mother of something|Father of Modern Chemistry]]".<ref>{{Cite book|title = Affinity, that Elusive Dream: A Genealogy of the Chemical Revolution | author = Mi Gyung Kim | publisher = MIT Press | year = 2003 |page = 440|isbn = 0262112736}}</ref> The later discovery of [[Friedrich Wöhler]] that many natural substances, [[organic compound]]s, can indeed be synthesized in a chemistry [[laboratory]] also helped the modern chemistry to mature from its infancy.<ref>{{Cite book| title = The Development of Modern Chemistry | author = Ihde, Aaron John | publisher = Courier Dover Publications | year = 1984 | page = 164 | isbn = 0486642356}}</ref>

The [[discoveries of the chemical elements|discovery of the chemical elements]] has a long history from the days of alchemy and culminating in the discovery of the [[periodic table]] of the chemical elements by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] (1834&ndash;1907)<ref>[http://chemistry.about.com/library/weekly/aa030303a.htm Timeline of Element Discovery] - About.com</ref> and later discoveries of some [[synthetic elements]].

==Etymology==
{{Main|Chemistry (etymology)}}

The word ''chemistry'' comes from the earlier study of alchemy, which is a set of practices that encompasses elements of chemistry, metallurgy, philosophy, astrology, astronomy, mysticism and medicine. Alchemy in turn is derived from the [[Arabic]] word "كيمياء" meaning "value"; it is commonly thought of as the quest to turn lead or another common starting material into gold.<ref>[http://www.alchemylab.com/history_of_alchemy.htm Alchemy Lab: History of Alchemy]</ref> This linguistic relation between the pursuit of value and alchemy is thought to have [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] origins. Many believe that the Arabic word "alchemy" is derived from the word '''Chemi''' or '''Kimi''', which is the ancient name of [[Egypt]] in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]].<ref>Science and Civilisation in China, by Joseph Needham, page 47. Published by Cambridge University Press, 1980. ISBN 0-521-08573-X, 9780521085731</ref><ref>Personal Alchemy: The Art of Transforming the Negative into the Positive, by Mary McCarthy. Page 2</ref><ref>The past, present, and future of chemometrics worldwide: some etymological, linguistic, and bibliometric investigations. R. Kiralj and Ma´rcia M. C. Ferreira. Laborato´ rio de Quimiometria Teo´ rica e Aplicada, Instituto de Quı´mica, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas 13083-970, SP, Brazil. Journal of Chemometrics 2006; 20: 247–272</ref> The word was subsequently borrowed by the [[Greeks]], and from the Greeks by the Arabs when they occupied [[Alexandria]] ([[Egypt]]) in the 7th century. The Arabs added the Arabic definite article "al" to the word, resulting in the word "الكيمياء" (al-kīmiyā). Thus, an alchemist was called a 'chemist' in popular speech, and later the suffix "-ry" was added to this to describe the art of the chemist as "chemistry".

==Definitions==
In retrospect, the definition of chemistry has changed over time, as new discoveries and theories add to the functionality of the science. Shown below are some of the standard definitions used by various noted chemists:
* '''Alchemy''' (330) – the study of the composition of waters, movement, growth, embodying, disembodying, drawing the spirits from bodies and bonding the spirits within bodies ([[Zosimos of Panopolis|Zosimos]]).<ref>Strathern, P.

==Basic concepts==
Several [[concepts]] are essential for the study of chemistry; some of them are:<ref>[http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/matter/ General Chemistry Online - Companion Notes: Matter]</ref>

===Atom===
{{Main|Atom}}

An ''atom'' is the basic unit of chemistry. It consists of a positively charged core (the [[atomic nucleus]]) which contains [[protons]] and [[neutrons]], and which maintains a number of [[electron]]s to balance the positive charge in the nucleus. The atom is also the smallest entity that can be envisaged to retain some of the [[chemical properties]] of the element, such as [[electronegativity]], [[ionization potential]], preferred [[oxidation state]](s), [[coordination number]], and preferred types of [[chemical bond|bonds]] to form (e.g., [[metallic]], [[ion]]ic, [[covalent]]).

===Element===
{{Main|Chemical element}}

The concept of ''chemical element'' is related to that of chemical substance. A chemical element is specifically a substance which is composed of a single type of atom. A chemical element is characterized by a particular number of [[proton]]s in the [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of its atoms. This number is known as the [[atomic number]] of the element. For example, all atoms with 6 protons in their nuclei are atoms of the chemical element [[carbon]], and all atoms with 92 protons in their nuclei are atoms of the element [[uranium]]. 94 different chemical elements or types of atoms based on the number of protons exist naturally. A further 18 have been recognised by [[IUPAC]] as existing artificially only.  Although all the nuclei of all atoms belonging to one element will have the same number of protons, they may not necessarily have the same number of [[neutrons]]; such atoms are termed [[isotopes]].  In fact several [[isotopes]] of an element may exist.

The most convenient presentation of the chemical elements is in the [[periodic table]] of the chemical elements, which groups elements by atomic number. Due to its ingenious arrangement, [[Periodic table group|groups]], or columns, and [[period (periodic table)|periods]], or rows, of elements in the table either share several chemical properties, or follow a certain trend in characteristics such as [[atomic radius]], [[electronegativity]], etc. Lists of the elements [[List of elements by name|by name]], [[List of elements by symbol|by symbol]], and by [[List of elements by number|atomic number]] are also available.

===Compound===
{{Main|Chemical compound}}

A ''compound'' is a substance with a ''particular ratio'' of atoms of particular [[chemical element]]s which determines its composition, and a particular [[chemical structure|organization]] which determines chemical properties. For example, [[water (molecule)|water]] is a compound containing [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] in the ratio of two to one, with the oxygen atom between the two hydrogen atoms, and an angle of 104.5° between them. Compounds are formed and interconverted by [[chemical reaction]]s.

===Substance===
{{Main|Chemical substance}}

A chemical substance is a kind of matter with a definite [[chemical composition|composition]] and set of [[chemical properties|properties]].<ref>{{Cite book| title = General Chemistry | author = Hill, J.W.; Petrucci, R.H.; McCreary, T.W.; Perry, S.S. | edition = 4th | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | city = Upper Saddle River, NJ | year = 2005 | page = 37}}</ref> Strictly speaking, a mixture of compounds, elements or compounds and elements is not a chemical substance, but it may be called a chemical. Most of the substances we encounter in our daily life are some kind of mixture; for example: [[Earth's atmosphere|air]], [[alloy]]s, [[biomass]], etc.

Nomenclature of substances is a critical part of the language of chemistry. Generally it refers to a system for naming [[chemical compound]]s. Earlier in the history of chemistry substances were given name by their discoverer, which often led to some confusion and difficulty. However, today the IUPAC system of chemical nomenclature allows chemists to specify by name specific compounds amongst the vast variety of possible chemicals. The standard nomenclature of chemical substances is set by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC). There are well-defined systems in place for naming chemical species. [[Organic compound]]s are named according to the [[organic nomenclature]] system.<ref>[http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/ IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry]</ref> [[Inorganic compound]]s are named according to the [[inorganic nomenclature]] system.<ref>IUPAC Provisional Recommendations for the Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry (2004) [http://www.iupac.org/reports/provisional/abstract04/connelly_310804.html]</ref> In addition the [[Chemical Abstracts Service]] has devised a method to index chemical substance. In this scheme each chemical substance is identifiable by a number known as [[CAS registry number]].

===Molecule===
{{Main|Molecule}}
A ''molecule'' is the smallest indivisible portion of a pure [[chemical substance]] that has its unique set of chemical properties, that is, its potential to undergo a certain set of chemical reactions with other substances. Molecules can exist as electrically neutral units unlike [[ions]]. Molecules are typically a set of atoms bound together by [[covalent bond]]s, such that the structure is electrically neutral and all valence electrons are paired with other electrons either in bonds or in [[lone pair]]s.
[[Image:Taxol.svg|400px|thumb|A molecular structure depicts the bonds and relative positions of atoms in a molecule such as that in [[Paclitaxel]] shown here]]

Not all substances consist of discrete molecules.  Most chemical elements are composed of lone atoms as their smallest discrete unit.  Other types of substances, such as [[ionic compounds]] and [[network solids]], are organized in such a way as to lack the existence of identifiable molecules ''per se''.  Instead, these substances are discussed in terms of [[formula unit]]s or [[unit cell]]s as the smallest repeating structure within the substance; as they lack identifiable molecules.

One of the main characteristic of a molecule is its geometry often called its [[molecular structure|structure]]. While the structure of diatomic, triatomic or tetra atomic molecules may be trivial, (linear, angular pyramidal etc.) the structure of polyatomic molecules, that are constituted of more than six atoms (of several elements) can be crucial for its chemical nature.

===Mole and amount of substance===
{{Main|Mole (unit)}}
Mole is a unit to measure [[amount of substance]] (also called chemical amount). A [[mole (unit)|mole]] is the amount of a [[Chemical substance|substance]] that contains as many elementary entities (atoms, molecules or ions) as there are atoms in 0.012 [[kilogram]] (or 12 [[gram]]s) of [[carbon-12]], where the carbon-12 atoms are unbound, at rest and in their [[ground state]].<ref>[http://www.bipm.org/en/si/base_units/ Official SI Unit definitions]</ref> The number of entities per mole is known as the [[Avogadro constant]], and is determined empirically. The currently accepted value is 6.02214179(30){{e|23}} mol<sup>−1</sup> (2007 [[CODATA]]). One way to understand the meaning of the term "mole" is to compare and contrast it to terms such as [[dozen]]. Just as one dozen eggs contains 12 individual eggs, one mole contains 6.02214179(30){{e|23}} atoms, molecules or other particles. The term is used because it is much easier to say, for example, 1 mole of carbon, than it is to say 6.02214179(30){{e|23}} carbon atoms, and because moles of chemicals represent a scale that is easy to experience.

The amount of substance of a solute per volume of [[solution]] is known as amount of substance concentration, or [[molarity]] for short. Molarity is the quantity most commonly used to express the [[concentration]] of a solution in the chemical laboratory. The most commonly used units for molarity are mol/L (the official SI units are mol/m<sup>3</sup>).

===Ions and salts===
{{Main|Ion}}

An ''ion'' is a charged species, an atom or a molecule, that has lost or gained one or more electrons. Positively charged [[cations]] (e.g. [[sodium]] cation Na<sup>+</sup>) and negatively charged [[anions]] (e.g. [[chloride]] Cl<sup>−</sup>) can form a crystalline lattice of neutral [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s (e.g. [[sodium chloride]] NaCl). Examples of [[polyatomic ion]]s that do not split up during [[Acid-base reaction theories|acid-base reactions]] are [[hydroxide]] (OH<sup>−</sup>) and [[phosphate]] (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup>).

Ions in the gaseous phase are often known as [[plasma (physics)|plasma]].

===Acidity and basicity===
{{Main|Acid–base reaction}}

A substance can often be classified as an [[acid]] or a [[base (chemistry)|base]]. There are several different theories which explain acid-base behavior.  The simplest is [[Arrhenius acid|Arrhenius theory]], which states than an acid is a substance that produces [[hydronium ion]]s when it is dissolved in water, and a base is one that produces [[hydroxide ion]]s when dissolved in water.  According to [[Brønsted–Lowry acid-base theory]], acids are substances that donate a positive [[hydrogen]] [[ion]] to another substance in a chemical reaction; by extension, a base is the substance which receives that hydrogen ion.  A third common theory is [[Lewis acids and bases|Lewis acid-base theory]], which is based on the formation of new [[chemical bond]]s.  Lewis theory explains that an acid is a substance which is capable of accepting a pair of electrons from another substance during the process of bond formation, while a base is a substance which can provide a pair of electrons to form a new bond.  According to concept as per Lewis, the crucial things being exchanged are charges.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.apsidium.com/theory/lewis_acid.htm | title = The Lewis Acid-Base Concept | accessdate = 2010-07-31 | date = May 19, 2003 | work = Apsidium | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080527132328/http://www.apsidium.com/theory/lewis_acid.htm | archivedate = 2008-05-27}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=July 2010}}<!-- A nicely layed-out and informative page on Lewis; unfortunately the apsidium.com web site was anonymous and thus not "reliable source" --> There are several other ways in which a substance may be classified as an acid or a base, as is evident in the history of this concept <ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A708257 History of Acidity]</ref>

Acid strength is commonly measured by two methods.  One measurement, based on the Arrhenius definition of acidity, is [[pH]], which is a measurement of the hydronium ion concentration in a solution, as expressed on a negative [[logarithm]]ic scale.  Thus, solutions that have a low pH have a high hydronium ion concentration, and can be said to be more acidic.  The other measurement, based on the Brønsted–Lowry definition, is the [[acid dissociation constant]] (K<sub>a</sub>), which measure the relative ability of a substance to act as an acid under the Brønsted–Lowry definition of an acid.  That is, substances with a higher K<sub>a</sub> are more likely to donate hydrogen ions in chemical reactions than those with lower K<sub>a</sub> values.

===Phase===
{{Main|Phase (matter)}}

In addition to the specific chemical properties that distinguish different chemical classifications chemicals can exist in several phases. For the most part, the chemical classifications are independent of these bulk phase classifications; however, some more exotic phases are incompatible with certain chemical properties. A ''phase'' is a set of states of a chemical system that have similar bulk structural properties, over a range of conditions, such as [[pressure]] or [[temperature]]. Physical properties, such as [[density]] and [[refractive index]] tend to fall within values characteristic of the phase. The phase of matter is defined by the ''[[phase transition]]'', which is when energy put into or taken out of the system goes into rearranging the structure of the system, instead of changing the bulk conditions.

Sometimes the distinction between phases can be continuous instead of having a discrete boundary, in this case the matter is considered to be in a [[supercritical fluid|supercritical]] state. When three states meet based on the conditions, it is known as a [[triple point]] and since this is invariant, it is a convenient way to define a set of conditions.

The most familiar examples of phases are [[solid]]s, [[liquid]]s, and [[gas]]es. Many substances exhibit multiple solid phases. For example, there are three phases of solid [[iron]] (alpha, gamma, and delta) that vary based on temperature and pressure. A principal difference between solid phases is the [[crystal structure]], or arrangement, of the atoms. Another phase commonly encountered in the study of chemistry is the ''aqueous'' phase, which is the state of substances dissolved in [[aqueous solution]] (that is, in water). Less familiar phases include [[plasma physics|plasmas]], [[Bose-Einstein condensate]]s and [[fermionic condensate]]s and the [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] and [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] phases of [[magnet]]ic materials. While most familiar phases deal with three-dimensional systems, it is also possible to define analogs in two-dimensional systems, which has received attention for its relevance to systems in [[biology]].

===Redox===
{{Main|Redox}}

It is a concept related to the ability of atoms of various substances to lose or gain electrons. Substances that have the ability to oxidize other substances are said to be oxidative and are known as [[oxidizing agents]], oxidants or oxidizers. An oxidant removes electrons from another substance. Similarly, substances that have the ability to reduce other substances are said to be reductive and are known as [[reducing agents]], reductants, or reducers. A reductant transfers electrons to another substance, and is thus oxidized itself. And because it "donates" electrons it is also called an electron donor. Oxidation and reduction properly refer to a change in oxidation number—the actual transfer of electrons may never occur. Thus, oxidation is better defined as an increase in [[oxidation number]], and reduction as a decrease in oxidation number.

===Bonding===
{{Main|Chemical bond}}
[[Image:Electron orbitals.svg|right|thumb|[[Electron]] atomic and [[molecular orbital]]s]]

Atoms sticking together in molecules or crystals are said to be bonded with one another. A chemical bond may be visualized as the [[multipole]] balance between the positive charges in the nuclei and the negative charges oscillating about them.<ref>[http://www.visionlearning.com/library/module_viewer.php?mid=55 visionlearning: Chemical Bonding by Anthony Carpi, Ph]</ref> More than simple attraction and repulsion, the energies and distributions characterize the availability of an electron to bond to another atom.

A [[chemical bond]] can be a [[covalent bond]], an [[ionic bond]], a [[hydrogen bond]] or just because of [[Van der Waals force]]. Each of these kind of bond is ascribed to some potential. These potentials create the [[chemical interaction|interaction]]s which hold [[atom]]s together in [[molecule]]s or [[crystal]]s. In many simple compounds, [[Valence Bond Theory]], the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion model ([[VSEPR]]), and the concept of [[oxidation number]] can be used to explain molecular structure and composition. Similarly, theories from [[classical physics]] can be used to predict many ionic structures. With more complicated compounds, such as [[complex (chemistry)|metal complexes]], valence bond theory is less applicable and alternative approaches, such as the [[molecular orbital]] theory, are generally used. See diagram on electronic orbitals.

===Reaction===
{{Main|Chemical reaction}}

When a chemical substance is transformed as a result of its interaction with another or energy, a chemical reaction is said to have occurred. ''Chemical reaction'' is therefore a concept related to the 'reaction' of a substance when it comes in close contact with another, whether as a mixture or a [[solution]]; exposure to some form of energy, or both. It results in some energy exchange between the constituents of the reaction as well with the system environment which may be a designed vessels which are often [[laboratory glassware]]. Chemical reactions can result in the formation or [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] of molecules, that is, molecules breaking apart to form two or more smaller molecules, or rearrangement of [[atom]]s within or across molecules. Chemical reactions usually involve the making or breaking of [[chemical bond]]s. [[Redox|Oxidation, reduction]], [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]], acid-base [[neutralization (chemistry)|neutralization]] and molecular [[rearrangement reaction|rearrangement]] are some of the commonly used kinds of chemical reactions.

A chemical reaction can be symbolically depicted through a [[chemical equation]]. While in a non-nuclear chemical reaction the number and kind of atoms on both sides of the equation are equal, for a nuclear reaction this holds true only for the nuclear particles viz. protons and neutrons.<ref>[http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01034.html Chemical Reaction Equation]- IUPAC Goldbook</ref>

The sequence of steps in which the reorganization of chemical bonds may be taking place in the course of a chemical reaction is called its [[Reaction mechanism|mechanism]]. A chemical reaction can be envisioned to take place in a number of steps, each of which may have a different speed. Many [[reaction intermediates]] with variable stability can thus be envisaged during the course of a reaction. Reaction mechanisms are proposed to explain the [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]] and the relative product mix of a reaction. Many [[chemists|physical chemists]] specialize in exploring and proposing the mechanisms of various chemical reactions. Several empirical rules, like the [[Woodward-Hoffmann rules]] often come handy while proposing a mechanism for a chemical reaction.

According to the [[IUPAC]] gold book a chemical reaction is a process that results in the interconversion of chemical species".<ref>[[Gold Book]] [http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01033.html Chemical Reaction] IUPAC Goldbook</ref> Accordingly, a chemical reaction may be an [[elementary reaction]] or a [[stepwise reaction]]. An additional caveat is made, in that this definition includes cases where the [[conformer|interconversion of conformers]] is experimentally observable. Such detectable chemical reactions normally involve sets of molecular entities as indicated by this definition, but it is often conceptually convenient to use the term also for changes involving single molecular entities (i.e. 'microscopic chemical events').

===Equilibrium===
{{Main|Chemical equilibrium}}

Although the concept of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] is widely used across sciences, in the context of chemistry, it arises whenever a number of different states of the chemical composition are possible. For example, in a mixture of several chemical compounds that can react with one another, or when a substance can be present in more than one kind of phase. A system of chemical substances at equilibrium even though having an unchanging composition is most often not [[static equilibrium|static]]; molecules of the substances continue to react with one another thus giving rise to a [[dynamic equilibrium]]. Thus the concept describes the state in which the parameters such as chemical composition remain unchanged over time. Chemicals present in biological systems are invariably not at equilibrium; rather they are far from equilibrium.

===Energy===
{{Main|Energy}}

In the context of chemistry, energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its [[atomic structure|atomic]], [[molecular structure|molecular]] or aggregate [[chemical structure|structure]]. Since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of structure, it is invariably accompanied by an [[endothermic reaction|increase]] or [[exothermic reaction|decrease]] of [[energy]] of the substances involved. Some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of [[heat]] or [[photochemistry|light]]; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants. A reaction is said to be [[exergonic reaction|exergonic]] if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state; in the case of [[endergonic reaction]]s the situation is the reverse. A reaction is said to be [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]] if the reaction releases heat to the surroundings; in the case of [[endothermic reaction]]s, the reaction absorbs heat from the surroundings.

Chemical reactions are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the [[activation energy]]. The ''speed'' of a chemical reaction (at given temperature T) is related to the activation energy E, by the Boltzmann's population factor <math>e^{-E/kT} </math> - that is the probability of molecule to have energy greater than or equal to E at the given temperature T. This exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the [[Arrhenius equation]].
The activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction can be in the form of heat, light, [[electricity]] or mechanical [[force]] in the form of [[ultrasound]].<ref>Reilly, Michael. (2007).
[http://www.newscientisttech.com/article/dn11427 Mechanical force induces chemical reaction], NewScientist.com news service, Reilly {{Dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref>

A related concept [[thermodynamic free energy|free energy]], which also incorporates entropy considerations, is a very useful means for predicting the feasibility of a reaction and determining the state of equilibrium of a chemical reaction, in [[chemical thermodynamics]]. A reaction is feasible only if the total change in the [[Gibbs free energy]] is negative, <math> \Delta G \le 0 \,</math>; if it is equal to zero the chemical reaction is said to be at [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]].

There exist only limited possible states of energy for electrons, atoms and molecules. These are determined by the rules of [[quantum mechanics]], which require [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of energy of a bound system. The atoms/molecules in a higher energy state are said to be excited. The molecules/atoms of substance in an excited energy state are often much more reactive; that is, more amenable to chemical reactions.

The phase of a substance is invariably determined by its energy and the energy of its surroundings. When the intermolecular forces of a substance are such that the energy of the surroundings is not sufficient to overcome them, it occurs in a more ordered phase like liquid or solid as is the case with water (H<sub>2</sub>O); a liquid at room temperature because its molecules are bound by [[hydrogen bonds]].<ref>[http://www.chem4kids.com/files/matter_changes.html Changing States of Matter] - Chemforkids.com</ref> Whereas [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H<sub>2</sub>S) is a gas at room temperature and standard pressure, as its molecules are bound by weaker [[dipole-dipole interaction]]s.

The transfer of energy from one chemical substance to another depends on the ''size'' of energy [[quanta]] emitted from one substance. However, heat energy is often transferred more easily from almost any substance to another because the [[phonons]] responsible for vibrational and rotational energy levels in a substance have much less energy than [[photons]] invoked for the electronic energy transfer. Thus, because vibrational and rotational energy levels are more closely spaced than electronic energy levels, heat is more easily transferred between substances relative to light or other forms of electronic energy. For example, ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation is not transferred with as much efficacy from one substance to another as thermal or electrical energy.

The existence of characteristic energy levels for different [[chemical substance]]s is useful for their identification by the analysis of [[spectral lines]]. Different kinds of spectra are often used in chemical [[spectroscopy]], e.g. [[infrared spectroscopy|IR]], [[microwave spectroscopy|microwave]], [[NMR]], [[electron spin resonance|ESR]], etc. Spectroscopy is also used to identify the composition of remote objects - like stars and distant galaxies - by analyzing their radiation spectra.
[[Image:Emission spectrum-Fe.png|none|frame|Emission spectrum of [[iron]]]]

The term [[Energy#Chemical energy|chemical energy]] is often used to indicate the potential of a chemical substance to undergo a transformation through a [[chemical reaction]] or to transform other chemical substances.

===Chemical laws===
{{Main|Chemical law}}

Chemical reactions are governed by certain laws, which have become fundamental concepts in chemistry. Some of them are:
<div style="-moz-column-count:2; column-count:2;">
* [[Avogadro's law]]
* [[Beer-Lambert law]]
* [[Boyle's law]] (1662, relating pressure and volume)
* [[Charles's law]] (1787, relating volume and temperature)
* [[Fick's law of diffusion]]
* [[Gay-Lussac's law]] (1809, relating pressure and temperature)
* [[Henry's law]]
* [[Hess's Law]]
* [[Conservation of energy|Law of conservation of energy]] leads to the important concepts of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[thermodynamics]], and [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]].
* [[Law of conservation of mass]], according to the modern physics it is actually [[energy]] that is conserved, and that energy and mass are [[Mass-energy equivalence|related]]; a concept which becomes important in [[nuclear chemistry]].
* [[Law of definite composition]], although in many systems (notably biomacromolecules and minerals) the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction.
* [[Law of multiple proportions]]
* [[Raoult's Law]]
</div>

==Subdisciplines==
Chemistry is typically divided into several major sub-disciplines. There are also several main cross-disciplinary and more specialized fields of chemistry.<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0001555 The Canadian Encyclopedia: Chemistry Subdisciplines]</ref>
* [[Analytical chemistry]] is the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their [[chemical composition]] and [[Chemical structure|structure]]. Analytical chemistry incorporates standardized experimental methods in chemistry. These methods may be used in all subdisciplines of chemistry, excluding purely theoretical chemistry.

* [[Biochemistry]] is the study of the [[chemical compound|chemicals]], [[chemical reaction]]s and [[chemical interaction]]s that take place in living [[organism]]s. Biochemistry and organic chemistry are closely related, as in [[medicinal chemistry]] or [[neurochemistry]]. Biochemistry is also associated with [[molecular biology]] and [[genetics]].

* [[Inorganic chemistry]] is the study of the properties and reactions of inorganic compounds. The distinction between organic and inorganic disciplines is not absolute and there is much overlap, most importantly in the sub-discipline of [[organometallic chemistry]].

* [[Materials science|Materials chemistry]] is the preparation, characterization, and understanding of substances with a useful function. The field is a new breadth of study in graduate programs, and it integrates elements from all classical areas of chemistry with a focus on fundamental issues that are unique to materials. Primary systems of study include the chemistry of condensed phases (solids, liquids, [[polymers]]) and [[interface (chemistry)|interfaces]] between different phases.

* [[Neurochemistry]] is the study of neurochemicals; including transmitters, peptides, proteins, lipids, sugars, and nucleic acids; their interactions, and the roles they play in forming, maintaining, and modifying the nervous system.

* [[Nuclear chemistry]] is the study of how subatomic particles come together and make nuclei. Modern [[Nuclear transmutation|Transmutation]] is a large component of nuclear chemistry, and the [[table of nuclides]] is an important result and tool for this field.

* [[Organic chemistry]] is the study of the structure, properties, composition, mechanisms, and [[chemical reaction|reactions]] of [[organic compound]]s. An organic compound is defined as any compound based on a carbon skeleton.

* [[Physical chemistry]] is the study of the physical and fundamental basis of chemical systems and processes. In particular, the energetics and dynamics of such systems and processes are of interest to physical chemists. Important areas of study include [[chemical thermodynamics]], [[chemical kinetics]], [[electrochemistry]], [[statistical mechanics]], [[spectroscopy]], and more recently, [[astrochemistry]].<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Herbst, Eric | title = Chemistry of Star-Forming Regions | journal = Journal of Physical Chemistry A | date = May 12, 2005 | volume = 109 | pages = 4017–4029 | issue = 18 | doi = 10.1021/jp050461c | pmid = 16833724}}</ref>  Physical chemistry has large overlap with [[molecular physics]]. Physical chemistry involves the use of [[calculus|infinitesimal calculus]] in deriving equations. It is usually associated with [[quantum chemistry]] and theoretical chemistry. Physical chemistry is a distinct discipline from [[chemical physics]], but again, there is very strong overlap.

* [[Theoretical chemistry]] is the study of chemistry via fundamental theoretical reasoning (usually within [[mathematics]] or [[physics]]). In particular the application of [[quantum mechanics]] to chemistry is called [[quantum chemistry]]. Since the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the development of computers has allowed a systematic development of [[computational chemistry]], which is the art of developing and applying [[computer program]]s for solving chemical problems. Theoretical chemistry has large overlap with (theoretical and experimental) [[condensed matter physics]] and [[molecular physics]].

Other fields include [[agrochemistry]], [[astrochemistry]] (and [[cosmochemistry]]), [[atmospheric chemistry]], [[chemical engineering]], [[chemical biology]], [[chemo-informatics]], [[electrochemistry]], [[environmental chemistry]], [[femtochemistry]], [[flavor|flavor chemistry]], [[flow chemistry]], [[geochemistry]], [[green chemistry]], [[histochemistry]], [[history of chemistry]], [[hydrogenation|hydrogenation chemistry]], [[immunochemistry]], [[marine chemistry]], [[materials science]], [[mathematical chemistry]], [[mechanochemistry]], [[medicinal chemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[molecular mechanics]], [[nanotechnology]], [[natural product chemistry]], [[oenology]], [[organometallic chemistry]], [[petrochemistry]], [[pharmacology]], [[photochemistry]], [[physical organic chemistry]], [[phytochemistry]], [[polymer chemistry]], [[radiochemistry]], [[solid-state chemistry]], [[sonochemistry]], [[supramolecular chemistry]], [[surface chemistry]], [[synthetic chemistry]], [[thermochemistry]], and many others.
