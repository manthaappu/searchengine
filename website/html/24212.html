<html> <head> <title>Metaserver</title></head><body>A '''MetaServer''' is considered a central [[Service broker|broker]] providing a collated view (similar to a [[view (database)|database view]]) for dispersed [[Resource (Web)|web resources]]. It is used to collect data from various [[web service]]s, [[web page]]s, [[database]]s, or other online resources/repositories and then present the combined results to the [[client (computing)|client]] using a standard web protocol (e.g. [[HTTP]] with [[HTML]], [[REST]], [[SOAP]], [[XML-RPC]], etc.).

==Styles of use==
The purpose of such a system is to provide one or several of the following:
* a unified view on multiple resources
* easy comparison of the data
* standardized access to different repositories
* calibration of the data
* determining the data consensus

==Example MetaServer projects==
Typical, wide spread implementations of MetaServers are:
* Meta-Search-Engines
* DNS MetaServers
* Protein Structure and Function Prediction Gateways
* Computer Game MetaServers
