<html> <head> <title>Citation style language</title></head><body>The '''Citation Style Language''' ('''CSL''') is an open [[XML]]-based language to describe the formatting of [[citation]]s and [[bibliographic|bibliographies]]. [[Reference_management_software|Reference management programs]] that support CSL include [[Zotero]] and [[Mendeley]].

==History==

CSL was originally created by Bruce D'Arcus for use with OpenOffice<ref>CiteProc at OpenOffice Bibliographic Project. http://bibliographic.openoffice.org/citeproc/index.html</ref><ref>
OpenOffice Bibliographic Project. http://bibliographic.openoffice.org/</ref>, using an [[XSLT]]-based "[[CiteProc]]" CSL processor. The CSL language was further developed in collaboration with [[Zotero]] developer Simon Kornblith. First released in 2006, [[Zotero]] became the first application to use CSL. Members of the [[Zotero]] user community subsequently contributed the majority of CSL styles currently available online at the [http://www.zotero.org/styles Zotero Style Repository]. In 2008 [[Mendeley]] appeared, becoming the second reference manager to use CSL.

The versioned releases of CSL are CSL 0.8 (released March 21, 2009), CSL 0.8.1 (February 1, 2010) and CSL 1.0 (March 22, 2010). CSL 1.0, developed by D'Arcus, Frank Bennett and Rintze Zelle, represented a major overhaul of the CSL language, introducing many new features and improved project documentation.

==Software Support==

[[Zotero]] 2.0.x and [[Mendeley]] versions prior to 0.9.8 support CSL 0.8.1, whereas Zotero 2.1 Beta and the latest Mendeley releases support CSL 1.0 by integrating the CSL 1.0-compatible JavaScript [http://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/wiki/Home citeproc-js] CSL processor. [http://code.haskell.org/citeproc-hs/ citeproc-hs] is a CSL 1.0-compatible CSL processor written in Haskell. Other "[[CiteProc]]" CSL processors, in various states of completeness, have been written in PHP, Python, and Ruby<ref name="jv">Jakob Vo√ü (May 2010), "Quick introduction to the Citation Style Language (CSL)", Lightning Talk proposal European Library Automation Group Conference. http://www.slideshare.net/nichtich/voss-elag-csl2010</ref>.

==Styles==

The [http://www.zotero.org/styles Zotero Style Repository] is currently the main repository for CSL styles with over a thousand CSL 0.8.1 styles. CSL 0.8.1 styles can be automatically updated to the CSL 1.0 format<ref>Update instructions to convert CSL 0.8.1 styles to the 1.0 format. http://citationstyles.org/downloads/upgrade-notes.html#updating-csl-0-8-styles</ref>.
