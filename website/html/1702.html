<html> <head> <title>American flag sort</title></head><body>An '''[[American flag]] sort''' is an efficient, [[in-place]] variant of [[Sorting_algorithm#Radix_sort|radix sort]] that distributes items into hundreds of [[Bucket_%28computing%29|buckets]]. The first step counts the number of items in each bucket, and the second step computes where each bucket will start in the [[array data structure|array]]. The last step cyclically [[Permutation|permutes]] items to their proper bucket. Since the buckets are in order in the array, there is no collection step. The name comes by [[analogy]] with the [[Dutch national flag]] problem in the last step: efficiently [[Partition of a set|partition]] the array into many "stripes". Using some efficiency techniques, it is twice as fast as [[quicksort]] for large sets of [[String_%28computer_science%29|strings]].

Note: This works especially well when sorting a byte at a time, using 256 buckets.
