'''X10''' is a [[programming language]] being developed by [[IBM]] at the [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]] as part of the [[PERCS]] project funded by [[DARPA]]'s [[High Productivity Computing Systems]] (HPCS) program. Its primary authors are Kemal Ebcioğlu, Vijay Saraswat, and Vivek Sarkar.<ref>

Ebcioğlu, Kemal; Saraswat,  Vijay; Sarkar, Vivek, [http://www.aurorasoft.net/workshops/lar04/Author_Files/Papers/Vivek_Sarkar_LaR_04_Paper_V1.pdf "X10: "Programming for Hierarchical Parallelism and NonUniform Data Access"]</ref>

X10 is designed specifically for [[parallel programming]] using the [[partitioned global address space]] (PGAS) model.
A computation is divided among a set of ''places'', each of which holds some data and hosts one or more ''activities'' that operate on those data.  It supports a constrained type system for object-oriented programming, as well as user-defined primitive ''struct'' types; globally distributed ''arrays'', and structured and unstructured parallelism.<ref>Saraswat, Vijay; Bloom,  Bard; Peshansky, Igor; Tardieu, Olivier; Grove, David, [http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/languagespec/x10-latest.pdf "Report on the Programming Language X10: Version 2.1"], October 18, 2010</ref>

X10 uses the concept of parent and child relationships for activities to prevent the lock stalemate that can occur when two or more processes wait for each other to finish before they can complete.  An activity may spawn one or more child activities, which may themselves have children.  Children cannot wait for a parent to finish, but a parent can wait for a child using the ''finish'' command.<ref>Biever, C. "Computer revolution poses problems for programmers", New Scientist (Vol 193, Number 2594)</ref>
