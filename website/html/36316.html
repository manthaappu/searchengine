The '''Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System''', abbreviated '''SCATS''', is an [[intelligent transportation system]] developed in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] by the [[Roads and Traffic Authority]] in the 1970s, and used in [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]] since 1982.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24086486-661,00.html Vehicle detectors to be installed to stop road congestion]</ref> It is also used in New Zealand, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tehran, Dublin, [[Rzesz√≥w]], [[Gdynia]] and soon in part of Metro Atlanta,<ref>[http://www.cobbrides.com/Traffic%20lights%20go%20with%20flow.htm]</ref> among several other places. The system is called '''Canberra Automated Traffic Signal System''' ('''CATSS''') in [[Canberra]].  In total, about 23,000 intersections in over 100 countries use the system. In Australia, the majority of signalised intersections are SCATS operated (around 11,000).

The system uses [[traffic camera]]s or [[Radio-frequency induction|induction]] loops installed within the road pavement to count vehicles at each intersection, and adapts the timing of traffic signals in the network through a centralised [[Data center|datacentre]]. Detailed signal diagnostics are also passed to the datacentre, with the ability to notify staff when a traffic signal has a fault.

A SCATS system is able to operate over [[Permitted Attached Private Lines|PAPL]], [[Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line|ADSL]] or [[Public Switched Telephone Network|PSTN]] network connections to each intersection.

While SCATS is a recognised worldwide market leader in intelligent transport systems, the New South Wales [[Roads and Traffic Authority]] is continuing to develop SCATS and has also entered into collaborative research and development agreements in order to progress research on a number of longer term improvements to managing traffic.

'''Hong Kong'''<br />
In Hong Kong, SCATS is currently adopted in the area traffic control systems at Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, Tsuen Wan and Shatin.

'''Instant response to traffic incidents and congestions''' <br />
All ATC systems are equipped with CCTV systems enabling instantaneous response to traffic incidents and congestions.

'''Instant fault detection and quick repair'''<br />
The ATC system is also equipped with the function of fault detection and logging the fault detected in order to facilitate repair and maintenance. Should there be a telecommunication breakdown, the ATC junction controller concerned will switch to standalone mode and continue to function.
<br />
'''Traffic Adaptive Operation'''<br />
ATC systems provide advanced method of traffic signal control called Traffic Adaptive Control where the operational timing plans including cycle length, splits and offsets are continuously reviewed and modified in small increment, almost on a cycle-by-cycle basis, to match with the prevailing demand measured by the detectors connected to the on-street traffic controllers.
