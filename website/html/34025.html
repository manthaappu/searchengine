'''Service Data Objects''' is a technology that allows [[heterogeneous]] data to be accessed in a uniform way. The SDO specification was originally developed in 2004 as a joint collaboration between [[BEA Systems|BEA]] and [[IBM]] and approved by the [[Java Community Process]].  Version 2.0 of the specification was introduced in November 2005 as key part of the [[Service component architecture | Service Component Architecture]].

==Relation to other technologies==
Originally, the technology was known as '''Web Data Objects''', or WDO, and was shipped in [[IBM WebSphere Application Server]] 5.1 and [[IBM WebSphere Studio Application Developer]] 5.1.2.<ref>[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-sdo/ Introduction to Service Data Objects]</ref> Other similar technologies are [[Java Data Objects|JDO]], [[Eclipse Modeling Framework|EMF]], [[JAXB]] and [[ADO.NET]].

==Design==

Service Data Objects denote the use of language-agnostic data structures that facilitate communication between structural tiers and various service-providing entities. They require the use of a [[tree structure]] with a [[root node]] and provide traversal mechanisms (breadth/depth-first) that allow client programs to navigate the elements. Objects can be static (fixed number of fields) or dynamic with a map-like structure allowing for unlimited fields. The specification defines [[meta-data]] for all fields and each object graph can also be provided with change summaries that can allow receiving programs to act more efficiently on them.

==Developers==
The specification is now being developed by [[BEA Systems|BEA]], [[IBM]], [[Rogue Wave (company)|Rogue Wave]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[Siebel]], [[Sybase]], [[Xcalia]], [[Software AG]], [[Sun Microsystems]] within the [[OASIS]] Member Section Open CSA<ref>[http://www.oasis-opencsa.org/ Activities and announcements | OASIS Open CSA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> since April 2007. Collaborative work and materials remain on the collaboration platform of Open SOA,<ref>[http://www.osoa.org Home - Open SOA Collaboration<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> an informal group of actors of the industry.

==Implementations==
The following SDO products are available:

* Rogue Wave Software ([http://www.roguewave.com/products/hydra/hydrasdo.php HydraSDO])
* [[CodeFutures Software]] (FireStorm/SDO)
* Xcalia (for Java and .Net)
* BEA ([[AquaLogic]] Data Services Platform) - Now [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] Data Service Integrator 
* IBM (Virtual XML Garden)
* IBM ([[WebSphere Process Server]])

There are open source implementations of SDO from:
* The Eclipse Persistence Services Project ([[EclipseLink]])
* The [[Apache Tuscany]] project for Java and C++
* The [[SCA and SDO for PHP]] project
