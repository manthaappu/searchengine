'''Linoma Software''' was founded in 1994 - writing database encryption/tokenization software and secure automated Managed File Transfer solutions. These applications protect data at rest and in motion while either achieving or maintaining regulatory compliance with data security standards found in state privacy laws, [[Payment_card_industry|PCI]], [[Sarbanesâ€“Oxley_Act|SOX]], [[Hipaa|HIPAA]], [[GLBA]], and [[ISO_17799|ISO 17999 and 27002]].

==History==
Linoma Software grew from Linoma Logic consultants. Linoma Logic was popular for helping clients with code upgrades to the IBM OS/400 and RPG IV languages running on IBM AS/400 servers. They also wrote programs that updated databases for Y2K preparedness. It was out of these engagements that Linoma Software was born. Linoma Software started developing these tools and primarily focused on the IBM mid-range servers class.

After releasing the original versions of RPG Toolbox and Surveyor/400, Linoma Software continued developing applications for database encryption, key management and secure data movement. The software titles became known as '''''Crypto Complete''''' and '''''Transfer Anywhere'''''. As the user-base for IBM systems began to request GUI based applications, Transfer Anywhere was updated from a green-screen environment to a true browser-based suite of programs known as GoAnywhere. See the Platform section below for Operating Systems supported by GoAnywhere.

==Current Software==
=== GoAnywhere Director ===
GoAnywhere Director automates retrieval, translation, encryption, compression and distribution of data as a managed file transfer ([[Managed file transfer|MFT]]) solution. GoAnywhere Director supports [[xml|XML]] and [[SQL]] scripts to extract data from incoming files and transform that information into existing databases. The encryption protocols, user management and audit reporting within the program meet [[PCI DSS]] requirements. GoAnywhere Director typically resides behind a company firewall.

===GoAnywhere Services===
GoAnywhere Services is a Web-based FTP server or file portal. It provides file transfer monitoring and will kick-off (trigger) events based on file activity. GoAnywhere Services uses role-based access and produces full audit logs for compliance reporting. It uses [[Transport Layer Security|SSL/TLS]], [[Secure Shell|SSH]], and [[Https|HTTPS]] protocols for internet security and permits ad-hoc file transfers with proper user credentials.

===GoAnywhere Gateway===
GoAnywhere Gateway provides trading partners a transparent connection through a network DMZ without opening incoming ports to the private network or storing sensitive information in the DMZ. It acts as an enhanced [[reverse proxy]] that provides an additional layer of network defense. GoAnywhere Gateway integrates with GoAnywhere Services.

===Crypto Complete===
A robust field-level database encryption, tokenization, and key management tool for IBM i (iSeries) servers. Crypto Complete can find unencrypted sensitive database fields, masks data, and supports fields with variable lengths.

===Surveyor/400===
A productivity suite for working with iSeries data, files, libraries, and objects. Surveyor/400 operates in a GUI front-end, but provides options for either [[IBM 5250]] or "Command Line" emulation.

===RPG Toolbox===
RPG Toolbox was developed to help developers upgrade their older [[IBM RPG|RPG]] and [[System/36]] code to the new RPG IV or OS/400 standard. The program allows developers to save code "snippets" for re-use or testing.

==Platforms==
The GoAnywhere applications are [[VMware|VMware Ready]] and operate in a virtualized environment.
* [[Linux]]
* [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server|Novell SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)]]
* [[RedHat|RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)]]
* [[Unix]]
* [[Mac_OS_X | Mac OS X]]
* [[Windows]]
* [[HP-UX]]
* [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]]
* [[IBM AIX|IBM System p (AIX)]]
* [[IBM System i]]
* [[IBM System z]]
