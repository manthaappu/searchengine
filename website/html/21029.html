'''LaFarr Stuart''' (born July 6, 1934 in [[Clarkston, Utah|Clarkston]], [[Utah]]), now retired, was an early [[computer music]] pioneer, computer engineer and member of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]].

==Career==
===Computer music===
In 1961, Stuart programmed [[Iowa State University]]'s [[CYCLONE]] computer (a derivative of the [[Illiac]]) to play simple, recognizable tunes through an amplified speaker that had been attached to the system originally for administrative and diagnostic purposes. A recording of an interview with Stuart and his [[computer music]] was broadcast nationally on the [[NBC]] [[radio network]] program [[Monitor (NBC Radio)|Monitor]] on February 10, 1962.

In a subsequent interview with the ''Harold Journal'', [[Navel Hunsaker]], head of the [[Utah State University]] mathematics department, said of Stuart, "He always was a whiz with calculators."

From the late 1970s, Stuart mentored [[John Carlsen]], who later contributed to the rapid growth of PC sound-card maker [[Media Vision]] and to [[SigmaTel]].

===Control Data===
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Stuart worked for [[Control Data Corporation]] (CDC) -- where [[Seymour Cray]] designed the [[CDC 6600]], the first commercial supercomputer.

===Zytrex===
In the 1980s, Stuart worked for [[Zytrex]], which manufactured CMOS [[Programmable Array Logic|PAL]] [[programmable logic devices]] (PLDs).

===Real-time clocks===
Stuart conceived installing battery-operated [[real-time clock]]s into computers, for which he received royalties until nearly 2000. Stuart jokingly admits contributing to the [[Year 2000 problem]].

==Preserving computer history==
Stuart owns the first [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-11]] to enter California and often visits the [[Computer History Museum]] in [[Mountain View, California]].
