<html> <head> <title>Pluggable look and feel</title></head><body>'''Pluggable look and feel''' is a mechanism used in the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[Swing (Java)|Swing]] [[widget toolkit]] allowing to change the [[Look and feel#Look and Feel in Widget Toolkits|look and feel]] of the [[graphical user interface]] at runtime.

Swing allows an application to specialize the look and feel of widgets, by modifying the default (via runtime parameters), deriving from an existing one, by creating one from scratch, or, beginning with '''J2SE 5.0''', by using the [[skinnable]] [[Synth Look and Feel|synth]] look and feel, which is configured with an [[XML]] property file.  The look and feel can be changed at runtime.

==Architecture==

The corresponding [[Application programming interface|API]] includes:
* [[Hooking|Hooks]] in [[Swing (Java)|Swing]] [[GUI widget|widgets]] to interact with their look and feel. Each widget defined in Swing can delegate its "painting" to its associated [[Graphical user interface|user interface]] classes called ''UI delegates''.
* An API to manage existing look and feel definitions. This API allow to set the look and feel or switch from look and feels at runtime.
* Another API to define a specific look and feel, or derive a look and feel from an existing one.

==Examples of look and feels==
===Platform look and feels===
The [[Java platform]] comes with several bundled look and feels<ref>{{cite web

| title=Java Tutorials: Available Look and Feels

* A default [[cross-platform]] look and feel, called ''Metal'' (see {{Javadoc:SE|javax/swing/plaf/metal|MetalLookAndFeel}}). This look and feel comes with several [[Theme (computing)|themes]]:
** The {{Javadoc:SE|javax/swing/plaf/Metal|DefaultMetalTheme}}, which was historically the first Swing default theme.
** The smoother {{Javadoc:SE|javax/swing/plaf/Metal|OceanTheme}}, which became the default theme for [[Java version history#J2SE 5.0 (September 30, 2004)|Java 5.0]].
* Other cross-platform look and feels:
** A [[skinnable]] look and feel called [[Synth Look and Feel|synth]] (see {{Javadoc:SE|package=synth|javax/swing/plaf/synth}}), which is configured with an [[XML]] property file.
** The ''Nimbus'' look and feel (based on ''synth''), which is added for the [[Java version history#Java SE 6 Update 10|Java SE 6 Update 10]]<ref>{{cite web

* Platform dependent look and feels<ref>{{cite web

** A [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] look and feel (this look and feel depends on the version of the Windows Operating System),
** A [[Motif (widget toolkit)|Motif]] or [[GTK+]] (for newer distributions) look and feel on [[Linux]] or [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], 
** A specific vendor look and feel for [[IBM AIX (operating system)|IBM AIX]], [[HP-UX]], and [[Mac OS X]].

===Third-party look and feels===
Numerous other look and feels have been developed by third parties, such as:
* [https://substance.dev.java.net/ Substance], a [[Skin (computing)|skinnable]] look and feel,
* [http://napkinlaf.sourceforge.net/ Napkin], which can be used to make GUI work look provisional,
* [http://www.javasoft.de/jsf/public/products/synthetica Synthetica], which is based on [[Synth Look and Feel|synth]],
* [https://liquidlnf.dev.java.net/ Liquid], which aim to look like the ''Liquid'' theme for [[KDE]],
* [http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/looks/index.html JGoodies] Windows and plastic look and feels.
