<html> <head> <title>Transcription (software)</title></head><body>'''Transcription software''' is software which assists in the conversion of human speech into a text transcript. The primary meaning of the term "transcription software" has changed over time, with the introduction of new technologies such as natural language speech recognition. References also depend on the context of the purpose for the transcript. The term "transcription software" can refer to a completely automated solution, or to software which helps a human transcriptionist manually transcribe spoken-word audio into text transcripts. In the latter case, the term [[Digital dictation|"digital dictation"]] is sometimes used.

Transcription software, as with [[transcription (service)|transcription service]] is often provided for business, legal, or [[medical transcription|medical purposes]]. Compared with audio content, a text transcript is searchable, takes up less computer memory, and can be used as an alternate communication method, such as for closed captions.

The definition of transcription "software" as compared with transcription "service" is generally defined by the ability of a user to run the entire system by itself on a local computer or server, without the use of a service-provider. However, the advent of [[SaaS|software-as-a-service]] and cloud computing models blur this distinction.
