<html> <head> <title>Boris Mordukhovich</title></head><body>'''Boris Mordukhovich''' is an [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] noted for his research in the areas of [[Nonlinear functional analysis|nonlinear analysis]], [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], and [[control theory]]. Mordukhovich is one of the founders of modern variational analysis and generalized differentiation.  Currently he is Distinguished University Professor and Lifetime Scholar of the Academy of Scholars at [[Wayne State University]].

Mordukhovich was born and educated in the [[Soviet Union]]; he immigrated to the United States with his family in December 1988. Among his best known achievements is the introduction of the most powerful constructions of generalized differentiation (bearing now his name), their development and applications to broad classes of problems in variational analysis, optimization, equilibrium, control, economics, engineering, and other fields.<ref>R.

Mordukhovich is a recipient of many international awards and honors, including [[Dr. honoris causa]] from the [[National Sun Yat-sen University]] in [[Taiwan]], [[Vasile Goldiş West University of Arad|Vasile Goldiş University]] in [[Romania]], and [[University of Alicante]] in [[Spain]].<ref>http://www.ua.es/es/servicios/comunicacion/notas/08073003.html</ref><ref>http://www.ua.es/dossierprensa/2009/01/29/11.html</ref><ref>http://www.ua.es/dossierprensa/2009/01/29/7.html</ref> He was the Founding Editor and remains the Editor-in-Chief of ''[http://www.springer.com/math/analysis/journal/11228 Set-Valued and Variational Analysis],'' an international journal.
