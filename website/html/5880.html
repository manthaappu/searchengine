:''Chaos 2 can also refer to the third form of [[Chaos (Sonic the Hedgehog)|Chaos]], a character from the [[Sonic the Hedgehog series]].''
'''Chaos 2''' is a [[robot]] from [[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]], designed and built by self-employed [[mechanic]] George Francis, from [[Ipswich]], and operated by Team Chaos. Twice winner of the UK Robot Wars Championship and the only robot with that distinction, it was the first robot to use its [[flipper]] to throw its opponents out of the [[arena]] altogether. This machine was also the first to defeat [[Hypno-Disc]], in Series 3. Its flipper is considered to be the most powerful in Robot Wars, although it is not as powerful as the catapult-style flipper of Wheely Big Cheese. However, its weapon is superior in terms of [[Mechanical efficiency|efficiency]], but has a limited supply of {{CO2}}, which provides the power for the weapon. The robot has been reincarnated several times over the years, previously appearing as Robot The Bruce and Chaos. Its flipper was also used as a [[self-righting]] mechanism when the robot was inverted, flipping the entire robot over in a half-[[somersault]] so it could continue fighting.

Chaos 2 is an inaugural member of the [[Combat Robot Hall of Fame]]. It also has its own [[pullback motor|pullback]] minibot and DVD.
