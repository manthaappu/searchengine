'''Steve "Slug" Russell''' is a programmer and computer scientist most famous for creating [[Spacewar!]], one of the earliest [[videogame]]s, in 1961 with the fellow members of the [[Tech Model Railroad Club]] at [[MIT]] working on a [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] Digital PDP-1.<ref name="nyt1">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/28/technology/a-long-time-ago-in-a-lab-far-away.html|title=A Long Time Ago, in a Lab Far Away . . .|last=Markoff|first=John|date=2002-02-28|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-04-27}}</ref> While there is some debate over priority regarding the concept of computer-based games in general, Spacewar! was unquestionably the first to gain widespread recognition, and is generally recognized as the first of the "shoot-'em' up" genre.

Steve Russell wrote the first two implementations of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] for the [[IBM 704]]. It was Russell who realized that the concept of [[universal function]]s could be applied to the language; by implementing the Lisp universal evaluator in a lower-level language, it became possible to create the Lisp [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] (previous development work on the language had focused on [[Compiler|compiling]] the language).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/lisp.ps | title = History of Lisp | author = John McCarthy}}</ref>  He invented the [[continuation]] to solve a double recursion problem for one of the users of his Lisp implementation.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.computernostalgia.net/articles/steveRussell.htm | title = Steve "Slug" Russell | work = Computer History}}</ref>

Steve Russell was educated at [[Dartmouth College]] from 1954 to 1958.
