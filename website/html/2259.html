An '''aptronym''' is a name aptly suited to its owner. Fictional examples of aptronyms include Mr. Talkative and Mr. Worldly Wiseman in [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' (1678), Truman Burbank (true-man), the lead character in the 1998 film ''[[The Truman Show]]'', the principal cast of the ''[[Mr Men]]'' (1971) and all the characters in [[Marc Blitzstein]]'s 1937 play ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]''.

==Other examples==
In the book ''What's in a Name?'' (1996), author [[Paul Dickson]] cites a long list of aptronyms originally compiled by Professor Lewis P. Lipsitt, of [[Brown University]]. A sampling from the list:
*''James Bugg'', [[pest control|exterminator]]
*''Dan Druff'', [[barber]]
*''Rev. James R. God'', [[minister of religion|minister]] of the [[Congaree Baptist Church]] in [[Gadsden, South Carolina]] and current minister of Bible Baptist Church in New Bloomfield, Pennsylvania.
*''Priscilla Flattery'', [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] [[publicist]]
*''[[William Headline]]'', [[Washington, D.C.]] bureau chief for [[CNN]]
*''C. Sharpe Minor'', an [[Organists|organist]]
*''Buck Naked, the name the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' character [[George Costanza]] said he would assume if he were ever in a [[porno]] film.
*''[[Quentin Jammer]]'', [[National Football League|NFL]] [[cornerback]]
*''Ima Assman'' [[proctology|proctologist]]
*''Robert Killingback, chiropractor''
*''Marge Innovera, statistician'' (and other fictional staff members) on NPR's ''Car Talk''
Some aptronyms are [[irony|ironic]] rather than descriptive. The former [[Archbishop]] of [[Manila]], [[Jaime Sin|Jaime L. Sin]] known as "[[Cardinal Sin]]," is a notable example. [[Lance Armstrong]] became a seven-time Tour de France champion because of leg, not arm, strength. Dickson's book also lists a Rev. Richard Sinner of [[Fargo, North Dakota]]. There was a Roman Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool called Derek Worlock.  The British barrister [[Christmas Humphreys]] was not only born on 15 February rather than 25 December, but was known as a [[theosophist]] and later [[Buddhist]]. Actress [[Tuesday Weld]] was born on a Friday. [[Gene Weingarten]] of the [[Washington Post]] has called these "inaptonyms"[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2006/07/11/DI2006071100616.html]
Place names can also be aptronyms, perhaps unintentionally, such as the former [[Liberty Jail]], so called because of its location in [[Liberty, Missouri]], [[USA]].

==Other issues==
Aptronyms may be called "aptonyms" by other writers. San Francisco columnist Herb Caen used the term "namephreaks". [[Washington Post]] columnist [[Bob Levey]] prefers the term PFLNs, or Perfect Fit Last Names. 

There does not yet seem to be a standard terminology for this linguistic curiosity.
