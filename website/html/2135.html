The '''Apple I''', also known as the '''Apple-1''', was an early [[personal computer]].  They were designed and [[Handicraft|hand-built]] by [[Steve Wozniak]].<ref>[http://www.ioltechnology.co.za/article_page.php?iSectionId=2892&iArticleId=3456594 IOL Technology - Co-founder tells his side of Apple story]</ref><ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6167297 NPR : A Chat with Computing Pioneer Steve Wozniak]</ref> Wozniak's friend [[Steve Jobs]] had the idea of selling the computer. The Apple I was [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s first product, demonstrated in April 1976 at the [[Homebrew Computer Club]] in Palo Alto, California.

==History==
The Apple I went on sale in July 1976 at a price of $666.66,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/1606-2-5937610.html|title=Video: Wozniak: $666.66 seemed like a good idea|date=2005-11-07|publisher=CNET News|accessdate=2009-02-19}}</ref> because Wozniak liked repeating digits<ref name="iWoz">[[Steve Wozniak|Wozniak, Steven]]: "[[iWoz]]", page 180. [[W. W. Norton]], 2006. ISBN 978-0-393-06143-7</ref> and because they originally sold it to a local shop for $500 and added a one-third markup. About 200 units were produced. Unlike other hobbyist computers of its day, which were sold as kits, the Apple I was a fully assembled circuit board containing about 60+ chips. However, to make a working computer, users still had to add a case, power supply transformers, power switch, ASCII keyboard, and composite video display. An optional board providing a cassette interface for storage was later released at a cost of $75.

The Apple I's built-in [[computer terminal]] circuitry was distinctive. All one needed was a [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] and an inexpensive [[television set]]. Competing machines such as the [[Altair 8800]] generally were programmed with front-mounted toggle switches and used indicator lights (red [[light-emitting diode|LED]]s, most commonly) for output, and had to be extended with separate hardware to allow connection to a computer terminal or a [[ASR33|teletypewriter machine]]. This made the Apple I an innovative machine for its day. In April 1977 the price was dropped to $475.<ref>[http://www.applefritter.com/node/2703 April 1977 Price List | Applefritter<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It  continued to be sold through August 1977, despite the introduction of the [[Apple II]] in April 1977, which began shipping in June of that year.<ref>[http://www.applefritter.com/node/2715 Bill of Sale | Applefritter<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Apple had dropped the Apple 1 from its price list by October 1977, officially discontinuing it.<ref>[http://www.applefritter.com/node/2707 October 1977 Price List | Applefritter<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

As of 2008, an estimated 30 to 50 Apple I computers are still known to exist, making it a very rare [[collectable|collector's item]]. An Apple I reportedly sold for $50,000 USD at auction in 1999, with another apparently selling in 2009 for $17,500; however, a more typical price for an Apple I is in the $14,000&ndash;$16,000 range. In November 2009 the Apple I with serial number 82 was listed on eBay with a starting bid of $50,000 but it is unreported as to whether the computer was actually sold on that occasion. However, in November 2010, this same Apple I (with serial number 82) sold for $178,000 ($213,600 including the 'buyer's premium') at Christie's auction house in London<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11825954 BBC News 24 November 2010 00:48]</ref>
, making it by far the highest price paid for this model to date, at £133,250 ($210,000). The high value of this particular example is likely due to the rare documents and packaging offered in the sale rather than the computer itself; namely (and amongst others) the original packaging (with the return label showing Steve Jobs' parents address, the original Apple Computer Inc 'headquarters' being their garage), a personally typed and signed letter from Jobs (answering technical questions about the computer) and the original invoice showing 'Steven' as the salesman.

==Emulators, clones, and replicas==
A software-compatible clone of the Apple I ([[Replica 1]]) produced using modern components, was released in 2003 at a price of around $200.<ref>[http://www.applefritter.com/briel replica I - the apple I(c) clone], retrieved 2009-08-15</ref><ref>[http://www.brielcomputers.com/wordpress/?cat=4 replica I] at official Briel computers web site, retrieved 2008-08-15</ref><ref>Gagne, Ken [http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9136257/Image_gallery_Building_an_Apple_1_replica_from_scratch Image gallery: Building an Apple-1 replica from scratch], ''[[Computerworld]]'', 2009-08-14, story with pictures for assembling a Briel replica I from a kit, retrieved 2009-08-15</ref> Other replicas and do-it-yourself kits and instructions are available.<ref>Owad, Tom ''[http://www.applefritter.com/replica Apple I Replica Creation]'', retrieved 2009-08-15</ref><ref>[http://www.sbprojects.com/projects/apple1/ A-one], retrieved 2009-08-15</ref>
