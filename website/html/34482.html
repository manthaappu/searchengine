The '''Simplified Instructional Computer''' (also abbreviated SIC) is a hypothetical [[computer]], that is used as a base to explain the operation of a real computer. It was stated that most real microprocessors have a complex instruction set and many subtleties to increase efficiency, that can be a distraction for students that are studying the essential and universal aspects of a [[microprocessor]] (that are common to different designs). Hence this hypothetical computer is used to explain all the basic concepts of microprocessor design even though it is impossible to cover every aspect. The architecture of the SIC uses 3 byte integers, 5 registers and can access 2<sup>15</sub>=32768 bytes of memory.

==The five registers==
* '''A''' register (accumulator): This is the three-byte register that is used for arithmetic operations.
* '''X''' register (index): The index register can operate in two modes, direct and indexed. 
* '''SW''' register (status word)
* '''PC''' register (program counter)it contains the address of next instruction to be fetched for execution.
* '''L''' register (linkage): This register is used for subroutine jumps.

Negative values are stored in 2's complement format. The SIC has two versions; a standard version SIC, and an extended version SIC/XE. The extended version has floating point numbers.
