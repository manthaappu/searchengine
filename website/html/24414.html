'''Microlinguistics''' is a branch of [[linguistics]] that concerns itself with the study of [[language]] systems in the abstract, without regard to the [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] or notional content of linguistic expressions.  In micro-linguistics, language is reduced to the abstract mental elements of [[syntax]] and [[phonology]].  It [[contrast]]s with [[macro-linguistics]], which includes meanings, and especially with [[sociolinguistics]], which studies how language and meaning function within human social systems.<ref>{{Citation
