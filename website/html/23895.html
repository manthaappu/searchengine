The failure or fracture of a product or component in a single event is known as '''mechanical overload'''. It is a common [[failure mode]], and may be contrasted with [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]], [[Creep (deformation)|creep]], [[rupture]], or [[stress relaxation]]. The terms are used in [[forensic engineering]] and [[structural engineering]] when analysing product failure. Failure may occur because either the product is weaker than expected owing to a [[stress concentration]], or the applied load is greater than expected and exceeds the normal [[tensile strength]], [[shear strength]] or [[compressive strength]] of the product.

==Examples==
{{Mechanical_failure_modes}}

Examples include the many components which fail in [[car crash]]es, [[train crash]]es, and [[airplane crash]]es as a result of [[impact (mechanics)|impact]] loading. The problem for the investigator is to determine which failures have been caused by the crash, and which may have caused the crash. It usually involves examining the broken parts for signs of [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] crack growth or other damage to the part which cannot be attributed to the crash itself. For very large [[structural failure]]s such as the collapse of bridges, it is necessarily a long and tedious process of sifting the broken parts.
