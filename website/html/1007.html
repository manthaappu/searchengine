'''Address Range Registers''' (ARRs) are [[control register]]s of the [[Cyrix]] [[6x86]], [[6x86MX]] and [[Cyrix MII|MII]] processors that are used as a control mechanism which provides system software with control of how accesses to memory ranges by the CPU are cached, similar to what [[Memory Type Range Registers]] (MTRRs) provide on other implementations of the [[x86 architecture]]<ref name="Linux Kernel">{{cite web
