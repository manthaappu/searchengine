'''PreAct''' is a [[cognitive engine]] technology that is driven both by changes in the state of the world and the intent of the system’s users called [[associate systems]].<ref>Sewell, D.R., Geddes, N.D., & Rouse, W.B. (1987) Initial evaluation of an intelligent interface for operators of complex systems. In G. Salvendy (Eds), Cognitive engineering in the design of human-computer interaction and expert systems 551-558. New York: Elsevier.</ref> [[Associate systems]] are a [[knowledge-based system]] that are designed to work in conjunction with a human operator.  An associate system observes the same data about the state of the world as the human operator, combining the information together to reach more abstract and aggregate conclusions about the state of the world.  An associate system also observes the actions undertaken by a human operator, combining those actions with the state of the world to determine the operator’s current objectives and activities.<ref>Geddes, N.D., (1997) Associate Systems: A framework for human-machine cooperation, in Smith, M. J., Slavendy, G. & Koubek, R.J. , (Eds) Design of Computing Systems: Social and ergonomic coniderations . Advances in Human Factiors/Ergonomics Vol 21B. New York: Elsevier. 237-242.</ref>  Based on the assessment of the state of the world and the activities and objectives of the human operator, the system can, within the bounds of its authority, carry out activities on behalf of the user, make the user aware of events particularly relevant to his activities, and manage the information content of the user’s displays.<ref>Geddes, N.D., Pullum, L. & Hoffman, M.A. (1992) Intelligent interfaces in command and control systems.

Associate systems stand in contrast to [[autonomous systems]], in which the software replaces the human operator, and decision-aiding systems, in which the software typically assists the human only when requested.  An associate system acts as a teammate to a human operator; it can act without explicitly being ordered while remaining within the bounds of its authority, without taking final control away from the human operator.<ref>Smith, P.J., Geddes, N.D. and Beatty, R.
