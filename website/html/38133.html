A '''transmission gate''' is an [[Electronics|electronic]] element. It is a good non-mechanical [[relay]], built with [[CMOS]] technology.  It can be used to simplify digital logic circuits or to switch analog signals, and so is also known as an [[analog electronics|analog]] [[logic gate|gate]], [[analogue switch]] or electronic relay depending on its use.  It is made by the parallel combination of an [[nMOS logic|nMOS]] and a [[pMOS logic|pMOS]] transistor with the input at the gate of one transistor being complementary to the input at the gate of the other.

== Operation ==
A [[current (electricity)|current]] can flow through this element in either direction. Depending on whether or not there is a [[voltage]] on the gate, the connection between the input and output is either low-resistance (R<sub>on</sub> = 100 [[Ohm (unit)|ohm]], for instance) or high-resistance (R<sub>off</sub> > 5 [[megohm]]). This can effectively isolate the output from the input.

Digital operation can also be understood this way: when the gate input to the [[nMOS logic|nMOS]] transistor is '0',and the complementary '1' is gate input to the [[pMOS logic|pMOS]], both are turned off.  However when gate input to the [[nMOS logic|nMOS]] is '1' and its complementary '0' is the gate input to the [[pMOS logic|pMOS]], both are turned on and passes any signal '1' or '0' equally well without degradation. See the truth table at the right.  The use of transmission gates eliminates the undesirable threshold voltage effects which give rise to loss of logic levels in [[pass transistor logic]].

This enables certain logic functions to be implemented with fewer transistors than possible using other CMOS logic, and can be used to design [[multiplexer]]s.

== Design ==
It would seem that a transmission gate could be constructed using simply a single [[pMOS logic|pMOS]] or [[nMOS logic|nMOS]] transistor. If only an individual [[nMOS logic|nMOS]] transistor were to be used, and there was a high voltage on the OUT and a low voltage on the IN and we are trying to transmit the zero to the OUT, then the [[nMOS logic|nMOS]] will drain some of the voltage but not all of it leaving the OUT somewhere in the "no man's land" voltage region of digital circuits. Adding the [[pMOS logic|pMOS]] gate in parallel allows all the voltage to drain after the [[nMOS logic|nMOS]] shuts off before all the voltage is drained. This also solves the problem when transmitting a high voltage to OUT.¹
