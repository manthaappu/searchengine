<html> <head> <title>Index Medicus</title></head><body>'''''Index Medicus''''' ('''IM''') is a comprehensive index of [[Medicine|medical]] [[scientific journal]] articles, published since 1879. It was initiated by [[John Shaw Billings]], head of the [[Library of the Surgeon General's Office]], [[United States Army]]. This library later evolved into the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM), which continues publication of the ''Index''.

== History ==
Publication began in 1879 and continued monthly through 1926, with a hiatus between 1899 and 1902.<ref name=Chronology>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/services/indexmedicus.html |title=FAQ: Index Medicus Chronology |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-09-06}}</ref><ref name=NLMHistory>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/about/collectionhistory.html |title=History of Historical Collections - History of Medicine - National Library of Medicine |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-09-06}}</ref> During this hiatus, a similar index, the ''Bibliographia medica'', was published in [[French language|French]] by the Institut de Bibliographie in [[Paris]].<ref name=Chronology/> The ''Index Medicus'' was amalgamated with the [[American Medical Association]]'s ''Quarterly Cumulative Index to Current Literature'' (QCICL) as the ''Quarterly Cumulative Index Medicus'' (QCIM) in 1927 and the AMA continued to publish this until 1956.<ref name=Chronology/> From 1960 to 2004 the printed edition  was published by the National Library of Medicine under the name ''Index Medicus/Cumulated Index Medicus'' (IM/CIM).<ref name=Chronology/> An abridged version was published from 1970 to 1997 as the ''Abridged Index Medicus''.<ref name=AbridgedIM>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/aim.html |title=Abridged Index Medicus Ceasing Publication |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-09-06}}</ref> The abridged edition lives on as a subset of the journals covered by [[PubMed]] ("core clinical journals").<ref name=lists>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/services/aim.html |title=FAQ: Finding a List of Abridged Index Medicus or Index Medicus Journal Titles |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-09-06}}</ref>

The last issue of ''Index Medicus'' was published in December 2004 (Volume 45). The stated reason for discontinuing the printed publication was that online resources had supplanted it,<ref>{{cite web | title = 'Index Medicus'' - NLM Technical Bulletin to Cease as Print Publication | publisher   = [[United States National Library of Medicine|National Library of Medicine]] - NLM Technical Bulletin | date = 2004-05-04 | url = http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/mj04/mj04_im.html | accessdate=2008-04-16}}</ref> most especially PubMed, which continues to include the ''Index'' as a subset of the journals it covers.<ref name=IM-MEDLINE-PubMed>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/num_titles.html |title=Number of Titles Currently Indexed for Index Medicus and MEDLINE on PubMed |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-09-06}}</ref>

== Journal selection ==
Inclusion into the ''Index'' is not automatic and depends on a journal's scientific policy and scientific quality.<ref name=slide3>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/index_4_medline/tsld003.htm |title=How are journals selected for Index Medicus and MEDLINE? |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-09-06}}</ref> These criteria are evaluated by the "Literature Selection Technical Review Committee" and the final decision is made by the NLM director.<ref name=slide3/> The review process may include outside reviewers and journals may also be dropped from inclusion.<ref name=LSTRC>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/index_4_medline/tsld006.htm |title=LSTRC |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-09-06}}</ref>
