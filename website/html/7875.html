The '''Construction Industry Council''' (CIC) is the representative body for the professional bodies, research organizations and specialist business associations in the [[construction industry]] in the [[United Kingdom]].  It was formed in 1988 as the ''Building Industry Council'' and changed its name in April 1990.

The Construction Industry Council aims to provide a single voice for professionals in all sectors of the built environment in the UK through its collective membership of 500,000 individual construction professionals and 25,000 firms of construction [[consultants]]. As representative of the views of professionals, it has a seat on the government/industry body, the [[Strategic Forum for Construction]].

The Construction Industry Council also represents the views of the higher level of the industry (professional, managerial and technical) in [[ConstructionSkills]], the [[Sector Skills Councils|Sector Skills Council]] for construction. ConstructionSkills is a partnership between CIC, [[CITB-ConstructionSkills]] and [[CITB Northern Ireland]].

The Construction Industry Council developed and operates the [[Design Quality Indicator]] ([[DQI]]) tool to measure the design quality of buildings.
