In modern terms, he gave a [[group presentation]] of the [[icosahedral group|icosahedral rotation group]] by [[Generating set of a group|generators]] and relations.

Hamilton’s discovery derived from his attempts to find an algebra of [[tuple|"triplets" or 3-tuples]] that he believed would reflect the three [[Cartesian coordinate system#Cartesian coordinates in three dimensions|Cartesian axes]]. The symbols of the Icosian Calculus can be equated to moves between vertices on a [[dodecahedron]]. Hamilton’s work in this area resulted indirectly in the terms [[Hamiltonian circuit]] and [[Hamiltonian path]] in graph theory.<ref name="biggs">{{cite book |author=Norman L. Biggs, E.

== Informal definition ==
[[Image:Icosian_grid_small_with_labels2.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[Stereographic projection]] of dodecahedron used for Hamilton's [[Icosian Game]]]] 

The algebra is based on three symbols that are each [[roots of unity]], in that repeated application of any of them yields the value 1 after a particular number of steps. They are:

:<math>
\begin{align}
\iota^2 & = 1, \\
\kappa^3 & = 1, \\
\lambda^5 & = 1.
\end{align}
</math>

Hamilton also gives one other relation between the symbols:

:<math>\lambda = \iota\kappa.\,\!</math>
(In modern terms this is the (2,3,5) [[triangle group]].)

The operation is [[associative]] but not [[commutative]]. They generate a group of order 60, isomorphic to the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of rotations of a regular [[icosahedron]] or [[dodecahedron]].

Although the algebra exists as a purely abstract construction, it can be most easily visualised in terms of operations on the edges and vertices of a dodecahedron. Hamilton himself used a flattened dodecahedron as the basis for his instructional game.

Imagine an insect crawling along a particular edge of Hamilton's labelled dodecahedron in a certain direction, say from <math>B</math> to <math>C</math>. We can represent this [[Graph_%28mathematics%29#Directed_graph|directed edge]] by <math>BC</math>.

*The Icosian symbol <math>\iota</math> equates to changing direction on any edge, so the insect crawls from <math>C</math> to <math>B</math> (following the directed edge <math>CB</math>).

*The Icosian symbol <math>\kappa</math> equates to rotating the insect's current travel anti-clockwise around the end point. In our example this would mean changing the initial direction <math>BC</math> to become <math>DC</math>.

*The Icosian symbol <math>\lambda</math> equates to making a right-turn at the end point, moving from <math>BC</math> to <math>CD</math>.

== Legacy ==
The Icosian Calculus is one of the earliest examples of many mathematical ideas, including:
* presenting and studying a group by [[generators and relations]];
* a [[triangle group]], later generalized to [[Coxeter group]]s;
* visualization of a group by a graph, which led to [[combinatorial group theory]] and later [[geometric group theory]];
* [[Hamiltonian circuit]]s and [[Hamiltonian path]]s in graph theory;<ref name="biggs" />
