== Definition ==
Big Data is a term applied to data sets whose size is beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture, manage, and process the data within a tolerable elapsed time.    Big data sizes are a constantly moving target currently ranging from a few dozen terabytes to many petabytes of data in a single data set.

== Examples ==
Examples include web logs, RFID, sensor networks, social networks, Internet text and documents, Internet search indexing, call detail records, genomics, astronomy, biological research, military surveillance, medical records, photography archives, video archives, and large scale eCommerce.

== Technologies ==
Big Data requires exceptional technologies to efficiently process large quantities of data within tolerable elapsed times.  Technologies being applied to Big Data include massively parallel processing (MPP) databases, datamining infrastructures such as the Apache [[Hadoop]] Framework, distributed file systems, distributed databases, [[MapReduce]] algorithms, cloud computing platforms, the Internet, and archival storage systems. 

Some but not all MPP relational databases have the ability to store and manage petabytes of data. Implicit is the ability to load, monitor, backup, and optimize the use of the large data tables in the RDBMS.
