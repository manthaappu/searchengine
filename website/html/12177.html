'''''English and Welsh''''' is the title of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s
[[valedictory]] address to the [[University of Oxford]] of 1955.
The lecture sheds light on Tolkien's conceptions of the connections of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[ethnicity]] and [[language]].

Tolkien begins with an overview of the terms "[[:wikt:British|British]]", "[[:wikt:Celtic|Celtic]]", "[[:wikt:Germanic|Germanic]]", "[[:wikt:Saxon|Saxon]]", "[[:wikt:English|English]]" and "[[:wikt:Welsh|Welsh]]", explaining the latter term's etymology in ''[[walha]]''.
Tolkien also addresses the historical [[language contact]] between English and Welsh since the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain]], including [[Welsh loanwords in English|Welsh loanwords]] and [[Welsh substrate in English|substrate influence]] found in English, and conversely [[:wikt:Appendix:Glossary of Welsh Words of English Origin|English loanwords in Welsh]]. Comparing the Germanic [[i-mutation|''i''-mutation]] and the Celtic [[Affection (linguistics)|affection]], Tolkien says
:"The north-west of Europe, in spite of its underlying differences of linguistic heritage – Goidelic, Brittonic, Gallic; its varieties of Germanic; and the powerful intrusion of spoken Latin – is as it were a single [[sprachbund|philological province]], a region so interconnected in race, culture, history, and linguistic fusions that its departmental philologies cannot flourish in isolation."

In the final part of the lecture, Tolkien explores the concept of [[phonaesthetics]], citing the phrase ''[[cellar door]]'' as a recognized beautiful-sounding phrase in English, adding that to his own taste, in Welsh "''cellar doors'' are extraordinarily frequent". Tolkien describes the working of phonaesthetics inherent in the moment of association of [[Phonestheme|sound and meaning]], 
:"this pleasure is felt most immediately and acutely in the moment of association: that is in the reception (or imagination) of a word-form which is felt to have a certain style, and the attribution to it of a meaning which is not received through it."
Tolkien alludes to his view that such tastes are inherited, "an aspect in linguistic terms of our individual natures. And since these are largely historical products, the predilections must be so too".
To refer to such an inherited taste of language, Tolkien introduces the term of "native tongue" as opposed to "cradle tongue".
