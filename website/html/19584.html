<html> <head> <title>JSyn</title></head><body>'''JSyn''' ("[[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[Sound synthesis|Synthesis]]") is a [[gratis|free]] [[API]] for developing interactive sound applications in Java.  Developed by [[Phil Burk]] and others, it is distributed through Burk's company, SoftSynth.  JSyn has a flexible, [[unit generator]]-based synthesis and [[Digital signal processing|DSP]] architecture that allows developers to create synthesizers, audio playback routines, and effects processing algorithms within a Java framework that allows for easy integration with other Java routines (e.g. graphics, [[user interface]], etc.).  A [[plugin]] is available for [[web browser]]s to run JSyn-enabled [[applet]]s distributed over the [[world wide web]].

Although fundamentally a synthesis language (imitative of if not directly inspired by [[Csound]] and other [[MUSIC-N]] languages), JSyn has a number of powerful extensions and ancillary libraries, including JMSL (a Java update to the [[HMSL]] music specification language) and [[JScore]] (a staff notation editor and library), which adds a significantly higher level of musical [[Music informatics|informatics]] to the package than would normally be supplied with a set of synthesis routines.  '''Wire''', a graphical editor for JSyn routines, also allows developers to create DSP chains using a simple [[GUI]] that gives the API some of the ease of use of programs such as [[Max/MSP]].

A commercial (though inexpensive) [[Software developer|developer]] license allows JSyn to be incorporated into commercial applications.
