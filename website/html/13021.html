In computing, '''FASTOPEN''' was an [[MS-DOS]] [[Terminate and Stay Resident|TSR]] command, introduced in version 3.3, that provided to accelerated access to frequently used [[File system|files and directories]].

It worked with [[hard disk]]s, but not with [[diskette]]s (probably for security versus swapping) or with network drives (probably because such drives did not offer block-level access, only file-level access).

It was possible to specify for which drives FASTOPEN should operate, how many files and directories should be [[Cache#Disk_cache|cached]] on each (10 by default, up to 999 total), how many regions for each drive should be cached and whether the cache should be located in conventional or [[expanded memory]].

If a disk [[defragmenter]] tool was used while FASTOPEN was installed, it was necessary to reboot the computer afterwards, because FASTOPEN would remember the old position of files and directories, causing MS-DOS to display garbage if e.g. "[[Dir (command)|DIR]]" was performed.

The "fastopen" name has since been reused for various other "accelerating" software products.
