==EDOS==

In 1970, [[IBM]] announced the IBM/370 product line along with new peripherals, software products, and operating systems, including [[DOS/VS]] that supplanted [[DOS]]. Although IBM was rightly focused on their new products, the computing world was dominated by the IBM/360 line, which left a lot of users nervous about their investment.

Although there were a couple of projects emulating the [[IBM/370]] on the [[IBM/360]] (e.g., CFS, Inc.), a couple of companies took a different approach, extending the then-current (and limited) DOS.

The Computer Software Company took the latter approach. Starting in 1972, they developed '''EDOS''', Extended Disk Operating System. They extended the number of fixed program space partitions from 3 to 6, added support for new hardware, and included features that IBM had offered separately.

They also made available other third party enhancements such as a [[spooler]] and [[DOCS (software)|DOCS]], from CFS, Inc.

==TCSC==

'''The Computer Software Company''' was founded by Jerry Enfield and Tom Steel, responsible for development and marketing, respectively. Company headquarters were in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. TCSC, as it was called, expanded into [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and [[Europe]].<ref>[http://itug-connection.blogspot.com/ article]</ref> The company was later acquired by [[Nixdorf]].
