<html> <head> <title>Inverse limit</title></head><body>In [[mathematics]], the '''inverse limit''' (also called the '''projective limit''') is a construction which allows one to "glue together" several related objects, the precise manner of the gluing process being specified by morphisms between the objects. Inverse limits can be defined in any [[category (mathematics)|category]].

== Formal definition ==
=== Algebraic objects ===

We start with the definition of an '''inverse''' (or '''projective''') '''system''' of [[group (mathematics)|groups]] and [[group homomorphism|homomorphisms]]. Let (''I'', &le;) be a [[directed set|directed]] [[poset]] (not all authors require ''I'' to be directed). Let (''A''<sub>''i''</sub>)<sub>''i''&isin;''I''</sub> be a [[family (mathematics)|family]] of groups and suppose we have a family of homomorphisms ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>: ''A''<sub>''j''</sub> &rarr; ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> for all ''i'' &le; ''j'' (note the order) with the following properties:
# ''f''<sub>''ii''</sub> is the identity in ''A''<sub>''i''</sub>,
# ''f''<sub>''ik''</sub> = ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub> <small>o</small> ''f''<sub>''jk''</sub> for all ''i'' &le; ''j'' &le; ''k''.
Then the pair ((''A''<sub>''i''</sub>)<sub>''i''&isin;''I''</sub>, (''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>)<sub>''i''&le; ''j''&isin;''I''</sub>) is called an inverse system of groups and morphisms over ''I'', and the morphisms ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub> are called the transition morphisms of the system.

We define the '''inverse limit''' of the inverse system ((''A''<sub>''i''</sub>)<sub>''i''&isin;''I''</sub>, (''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>)<sub>''i''&le; ''j''&isin;''I''</sub>) as a particular [[subgroup]] of the [[direct product]] of the ''A''<sub>''i''</sub>'s:
:<math>\varprojlim_{i\in I} A_i = \Big\{\vec a \in \prod_{i\in I}A_i \;\Big|\; a_i = f_{ij}(a_j) \mbox{ for all } i \leq j \mbox{ in } I\Big\}.</math>
The inverse limit, ''A'', comes equipped with ''natural projections'' &pi;<sub>''i''</sub>: ''A'' &rarr; ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> which pick out the ''i''th component of the direct product for each ''i'' in ''I''. The inverse limit and the natural projections satisfy a [[universal property]] described in the next section.

This same construction may be carried out if the ''A''<sub>''i''</sub>'s are [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[module (mathematics)|modules]] (over a fixed ring), [[algebra over a field|algebras]] (over a fixed field), etc., and the [[homomorphism]]s are homomorphisms in the corresponding [[category theory|category]]. The inverse limit will also belong to that category.

=== General definition ===

The inverse limit can be defined abstractly in an arbitrary [[category (mathematics)|category]] by means of a [[universal property]]. Let (''X''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>) be an inverse system of objects and [[morphism]]s  in a category ''C'' (same definition as above). The '''inverse limit''' of this system is an object ''X'' in ''C'' together with morphisms &pi;<sub>''i''</sub>: ''X'' &rarr; ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> (called ''projections'') satisfying &pi;<sub>''i''</sub> = ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub> <small>o</small> &pi;<sub>''j''</sub> for all ''i'' &le; ''j''. The pair (''X'', &pi;<sub>''i''</sub>)  must be universal in the sense that for any other such pair (''Y'', &psi;<sub>''i''</sub>) there exists a unique morphism ''u'': ''Y'' &rarr; ''X'' making all the "obvious" identities true; i.e., the diagram

<div style="text-align: center;">[[Image:InverseLimit-01.png]]</div>

must [[commutative diagram|commute]] for all ''i'' &le; ''j''. The inverse limit is often denoted
:<math>X = \varprojlim X_i</math>
with the inverse system (''X''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>) being understood. 

Unlike for algebraic objects, the inverse limit might not exist in an arbitrary category. If it does, however, it is unique in a strong sense: given any other inverse limit ''X''&prime; there exists a ''unique'' [[isomorphism]] ''X''&prime; &rarr; ''X'' commuting with the projection maps.

We note that an inverse system in a category ''C'' admits an alternative description in terms of [[functor]]s. Any partially ordered set ''I'' can be considered as a [[small category]] where the morphisms consist of arrows ''i'' &rarr; ''j'' [[if and only if]] ''i'' &le; ''j''. An inverse system is then just a [[contravariant functor]] ''I'' &rarr; ''C''. And the inverse limit functor
<math>\varprojlim:C^{I^{op}}\rightarrow C</math> is a [[covariant functor]].

== Examples ==

* The ring of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic integers]] is the inverse limit of the rings '''Z'''/''p''<sup>''n''</sup>'''Z''' (see [[modular arithmetic]]) with the index set being the [[natural number]]s with the usual order, and the morphisms being "take remainder". The natural topology on the ''p''-adic integers is the same as the one described here.
* The ring <math>\textstyle R[[t]]</math> of [[formal power series]] over a commutative ring ''R'' can be thought of as the inverse limit of the rings <math>\textstyle R[t]/t^nR[t]</math>, indexed by the natural numbers as usually ordered, with the morphisms from <math>\textstyle R[t]/t^{n+j}R[t]</math> to <math>\textstyle R[t]/t^nR[t]</math> given by the natural projection.
* [[Pro-finite group]]s are defined as inverse limits of (discrete) finite groups.
* Let the index set ''I'' of an inverse system (''X''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>) have a [[greatest element]] ''m''. Then the natural projection &pi;<sub>''m''</sub>: ''X'' &rarr; ''X''<sub>''m''</sub> is an isomorphism.
* Inverse limits in the [[category of topological spaces]] are given by placing the [[initial topology]] on the underlying set-theoretic inverse limit.  This is known as the '''limit topology'''.
** The set of infinite [[String (computer science)|strings]] is the inverse limit of the set of finite strings, and is thus endowed with the limit topology. As the original spaces are [[discrete topology|discrete]], the limit space is [[totally disconnected]]. This is one way of realizing the [[p-adic|''p''-adic numbers]] and the [[Cantor set]] (as infinite strings).
* Let (''I'', =) be the trivial order (not directed). The inverse limit of any corresponding inverse system is just the [[product (category theory)|product]].
* Let ''I'' consist of three elements ''i'', ''j'', and ''k'' with ''i'' &le; ''j'' and ''i'' &le; ''k'' (not directed). The inverse limit of any corresponding inverse system is the [[pullback (category theory)|pullback]].

==Derived functors of the inverse limit==
For an [[abelian category]] ''C'', the inverse limit functor
:<math>\varprojlim:C^I\rightarrow C</math>
is [[Exact functor|left exact]]. If ''I'' is ordered (not simply partially ordered) and [[countable]], and ''C'' is the category '''Ab''' of abelian groups, the Mittag-Leffler condition is a condition on the transition morphisms ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub> that ensures the exactness of <math>\varprojlim</math>. Specifically, [[Samuel Eilenberg|Eilenberg]] constructed a functor
:<math>\varprojlim{}^1:\operatorname{Ab}^I\rightarrow\operatorname{Ab}</math>
(pronounced "lim one") such that if (''A''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>), (''B''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''g''<sub>''ij''</sub>), and (''C''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''h''<sub>''ij''</sub>) are three projective systems of abelian groups, and
:<math>0\rightarrow A_i\rightarrow B_i\rightarrow C_i\rightarrow0</math>
is a [[short exact sequence]] of inverse systems, then
:<math>0\rightarrow\varprojlim A_i\rightarrow\varprojlim B_i\rightarrow\varprojlim C_i\rightarrow\varprojlim{}^1A_i</math>
is an exact sequence in '''Ab'''. An inverse system of abelian groups (''A''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>) is said to satisfy the Mittag-Leffler condition if for every ''k'' there exists ''j'' ≥ ''k'' such that for all ''i'' ≥ ''j''
:<math> f_{kj}(A_j)=f_{ki}(A_i).</math>
For example, a system in which the morphisms ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub> are surjective satisfies the Mittag-Leffler condition. If (''A''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>) satisfies the Mittag-Leffler condition, then
:<math>\varprojlim{}^1A_i=0.</math>
An example where this is non-zero is obtained by taking ''I'' to be the non-negative [[integer]]s, letting ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''p''<sup>''i''</sup>'''Z''', ''B''<sub>''i''</sub> = '''Z''', and ''C''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''B''<sub>''i''</sub> / ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> = '''Z'''/''p''<sup>''i''</sup>'''Z'''. Then
:<math>\varprojlim{}^1A_i=\mathbf{Z}_p/\mathbf{Z}</math>
where '''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub> denotes the [[p-adic integers]].

More generally, if ''C'' is an arbitrary abelian category that has [[Injective object#Enough injectives|enough injectives]], then so does ''C''<sup>''I''</sup>, and the right [[derived functors]] of the inverse limit functor can thus be defined. The ''n''th right derived functor is denoted
:<math>R^n\varprojlim:C^I\rightarrow C.</math>
In the case where ''C'' satisfies [[Grothendieck]]'s axiom [[Abelian category#Grothendieck's axioms|(AB4*)]], [[Jan-Erik Roos]] generalized the functor lim<sup>1</sup> on '''Ab'''<sup>''I''</sup> to series of functors lim<sup>n</sup> such that
:<math>\varprojlim{}^n\cong R^n\varprojlim.</math>
It was thought for almost 40 years that Roos had proved (in ''Sur les foncteurs dérivés de lim. Applications. '') that lim<sup>1</sup> ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> = 0 for (''A''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>) an inverse system with surjective transition morphisms and ''I'' the set of non-negative integers (such inverse systems are often called "[[Mittag-Leffler]] sequences"). However, in 2002, [[Amnon Neeman]] and [[Pierre Deligne]] constructed an example of such a system in a category satisfying (AB4) (in addition to (AB4*)) with lim<sup>1</sup> ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> ≠ 0. Roos has since shown (in "Derived functors of inverse limits revisited") that his result is correct if ''C'' has a set of generators (in addition to satisfying (AB3) and (AB4*)).

[[Barry Mitchell (mathematician)|Barry Mitchell]] has shown (in "The cohomological dimension of a directed set") that if ''I'' has [[cardinality]] <math>\aleph_d</math> (the ''d''th [[Aleph number|infinite cardinal]]), then ''R''<sup>''n''</sup>lim is zero for all ''n'' ≥ ''d'' + 2. This applies to the ''I''-indexed diagrams in the category of ''R''-modules, with ''R'' a commutative ring; it is not necessarily true in an arbitrary abelian category (see Roos' "Derived functors of inverse limits revisited" for examples of abelian categories in which lim^n, on diagrams indexed by a countable set, is nonzero for n>1).

== Related concepts and generalizations ==

The [[dual (category theory)|categorical dual]] of an inverse limit is a [[direct limit]] (or inductive limit). More general concepts are the [[limit (category theory)|limits and colimits]] of category theory. The terminology is somewhat confusing: inverse limits are limits, while direct limits are colimits.
