The '''Picower Institute for Learning and Memory''' is, along with the [[McGovern Institute for Brain Research]] and the Department of Brain and [[Cognitive Science]]s, one of the three [[neuroscience]] groups at [[MIT]]. The institute is focused on studying all aspects of learning and memory; specifically, it has received over [[US$]]50 million to study [[Alzheimer's]], [[schizophrenia]] and similar diseases.

When it was established in 1994, the institute was primarily funded by the [[Sherman Fairchild Foundation]], the [[RIKEN Brain Science Institute]] and the [[National Institute of Mental Health]].<ref name=About /> It was renamed after a massive grant by the [[Jeffry Picower#Involvement with Bernard Madoff|Picower Foundation]] in 2002, the eponymous charity group funded by profits from [[Bernard Madoff|Bernard Madoff's ponzi scheme]].<ref name=About>{{cite web|title=About|url=http://web.mit.edu/picower/about/index.html|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=2009-10-25}}</ref>
