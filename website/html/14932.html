<html> <head> <title>General Optical Council</title></head><body>The '''General Optical Council''' ('''GOC''') is an organisation in the [[United Kingdom]] which was set up by the [[Opticians Act 1958]] to maintain a register of [[optician]]s and to uphold the Act. Its purpose is to regulate the services provided by [[optician]]s and [[Optometry|optometrist]]s ([[ophthalmic optician]]s).  The stated function of the GOC is "''to protect the public and promote high standards of professional conduct and education amongst opticians''".

Opticians and optometrists must be registered with the GOC in order to continue to practise in the UK. It also maintains a register of companies who carry on business as opticians. The GOC can take action against opticians who are deemed "unfit to practise" and also against people or companies who break the terms of the Opticians Act.

The GOC was in the news at the end of September to the start of October 2005 after bringing charges against [[eBay]] UK for "''‘aiding and abetting’ sales of contact lenses without the involvement of a qualified optician.''"{{Fact|date=April 2007}}
