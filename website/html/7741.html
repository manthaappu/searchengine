'''Conformalizer''' is a Mac OS X software application designed and marketed by [[maggot software]] in Wellington, New Zealand.
It is designed to facilitate the process of [[re-conform]]ing audio data in film and television productions.

The application operates by comparing [[EDL]]s, [[cutlist]]s, or [[Final Cut Pro]] [[XML]] files to determine the changes made between two versions of an edited picture sequence.
Once the changes have been identified it is capable of automatically moving audio data into correct sync with the recut picture. This [[re-conform]] process can be applied to audio in a [[Pro Tools]] session or to [[timecode]] and  [[Feet+Frames]] information from a database.



==History==
Conformalizer was developed by Justin Webster, a Wellington, New Zealand sound editor and was first employed on [[Roger Donaldson]]'s [[The World's Fastest Indian]].
v2.0 was released in December 2006 and, amongst other things, added support for the [[Final Cut Pro]] XML interchange format.

Conformalizer has found widespread popularity amongst [[feature film]] sound editors, especially on large budget, [[VFX]] heavy productions where recuts and animation updates continue until very late in the sound post-production process.
In particular, director [[Peter Jackson]]'s sound team rely heavily on Conformalizer, using multiple copies to keep each editor up to date with rapidly changing cuts and [[VFX]].
Other notable facilities using Conformalizer are [[Skywalker Sound]] and [[Technicolor Sound Services]].
