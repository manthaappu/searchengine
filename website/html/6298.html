The CHBD was initially constructed with records from the [[Arctic Institute of North America]]'s database.  These were mainly [[northern Canada|northern Canadian]] records. It is expected to take several years to add non-Canadian records to the CHBD.<ref name="ijch" /> The Circumpolar Health Observatory, proposed in May 2008 in Norway, would disseminate its data through the CHBD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uit.no/getfile.php?PageId=2112&FileId=425|title=Establishing a Circumpolar Health Observatory|last=Young|first=Kue|date=May 2008|work=Annual Scientific Conference|publisher=University of Tromso, Norway|pages=24|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref>

Funding for the database increased by 50% for the period of 2008-2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.arctic.ucalgary.ca/index.php?page=aina_news|title=ASTIS News|date=June 2008|publisher=[[University of Calgary]]|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref>
