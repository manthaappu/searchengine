FUSE Services Framework is an open source SOAP and REST web services platform based on [[Apache CXF]] for use in enterprise IT organizations. It is productized and supported by the FUSE group at [[Progress Software]]. FUSE Services Framework service-enables new and existing systems for use in enterprise SOA infrastructure.

FUSE Services Framework is a pluggable, small-footprint engine that creates high performance, secure and robust services in minutes using front-end programming APIs like [[JAX-WS]] and [[JAX-RS]]. It supports multiple transports and bindings and is extensible so developers can add bindings for additional message formats so all systems can work together without having to communicate through a centralized server.

FUSE Services Framework is part of a family of enterprise open source SOA infrastructure tools that include [[FUSE ESB]] (based on [[Apache ServiceMix]]), [[FUSE Message Broker]] (based on [[Apache ActiveMQ]]) and [[FUSE Mediation Router]] (based on [[Apache Camel]]).
