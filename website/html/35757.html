'''Steve Gibson''' (born March 26, 1955, [[Dayton, Ohio]]) is a computer enthusiast, [[software engineer]] and security researcher who studied [[Electrical Engineering and Computer Science]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  Gibson currently lives in [[Laguna Hills, California]].  In 1985, Gibson founded Gibson Research Corporation, which is most well known for its [[SpinRite]] software.

==Works==
Gibson has had a very long career in the technology field; his resume lists jobs he had held back to the age of 13.<ref name="resume">http://www.grc.com/resume.htm</ref> He began in hardware projects but moved more toward software development in the 1980s. One of his early successes during this period was a [[light pen]] graphics system for the Apple II.

Gibson is an advocate of [[assembly language]] programming, and prides himself on writing smaller applications mostly in Intel x86 assembly language, including much of the code of the [[SpinRite]] hard disk utility used from the beginning of the PC era. He is one of several advocates of optimizing computer programs and reducing the size of their executables.

In the 1990s, Gibson began to move into the computer security field, developing and distributing a number of free security tools, including the ''ShieldsUp!'' port-scanner, and the ''LeakTest'' firewall tester. In 2000, Gibson created one of the first [[adware]] removal programs, OptOut.

Gibson's latest publicly released works are ''SecurAble'', last updated January 14, 2007 and more recently, ''DNS Benchmark'', released September 30, 2010.<ref>http://www.grc.com/freepopular.htm</ref>  ''SecurAble'' is a program that will tell the user if their CPU supports 64-bit computing, DEP ([[Data Execution Prevention]]) and hardware level virtualisation.<ref>http://www.grc.com/securable.htm</ref>  ''DNS Benchmark'' is a utility used for obtaining DNS nameserver performance characterization, profiling and comparison.<ref>http://www.grc.com/dns/benchmark.htm</ref>

Gibson is currently working on the ''DNS Nameserver Spoofability Test'', an online utility used to test whether the systems configured nameservers are vulnerable to [[DNS cache poisoning|DNS spoofing]].  Steve's future plans include work on his forthcoming [[VPN]] product [[CryptoLink]].

===Controversies===
Steve Gibson was involved with a notable controversy over the Microsoft WMF vulnerability,<ref name="Windows back door rumor is bunk">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/01/21/wmf_fud_from_grc/</ref> an issue raised in 2006 where a Windows Metafile image could trigger execution of arbitrary code. Gibson analyzed an unofficial patch issued by Ilfak Guilfanov, and publicly speculated both on a podcast called ''[[Security Now!]]''<ref name="Official Security Now! Episode #22 transcript">http://www.grc.com/sn/SN-022.htm</ref> as well as on his web site<ref name="GRC.com - Metafile Image Code Execution">http://www.grc.com/wmf/wmf.htm</ref> that Microsoft may have intentionally included this vulnerability because of the use of an API called SetAbortProc which was originally intended as a mechanism for canceling print jobs, which in his view made no sense. When Slashdot, a technology news web site, picked up the assertion, an Internet rumor that Microsoft intentionally built a back-door to its operating systems was promulgated.<ref name="WMF Vulnerability is an Intentional Backdoor?">http://it.slashdot.org/it/06/01/13/1519204.shtml?tid=201</ref>
 
Gibson has been associated with a number of more minor controversies<ref name="The Rise and Fall of GRC">http://radsoft.net/news/roundups/grc/</ref> in the computer security field, including his prediction of the "XP Christmas of Death" in 2001 describing the outcomes of Microsoft's implementation of the [[raw socket|SOCK_RAW]] protocol.<ref name="Security geek developing WinXP raw socket exploit, Has Steve Gibson finally lost his mind?">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/12/security_geek_developing_winxp_raw/</ref> 
   
Gibson is also known for attempting to replicate functionality of a tool called SYNcookies written by Dan Bernstein and Eric Schenk rebranded by Gibson as GENESIS as a preventative mechanism for SYN-flood attacks.<ref name="Steve Gibson invents broken SYNcookies">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/02/25/steve_gibson_invents_broken_syncookies/</ref>

===Gibson Research Corporation===
''Gibson Research Corporation'' or ''GRC'' is a computer [[software development]] firm founded in 1985 by Gibson. The company is registered in [[Laguna Hills, California]].<ref>[http://www.techadvice.com/help/company/g/gibson-r.htm Gibson Research Corporation], ''Techadvice.com''. Retrieved on 2 February 2007.</ref> GRC has created a number of niche [[utility software|utilities]] over the years, the foremost of which is [[SpinRite]], a [[hard disk]] scanning and [[data recovery]] utility.

As of mid-2009 ''GRC'' has three employees; Steve Gibson, Greg (technical support) and Sue (bookkeeper). Gibson also founded ''Gibson Laboratories, Inc.'' in 1981, a predecessor to ''GRC''.<ref name="resume"/>

==Media==
Gibson co-hosts a weekly computer security-focused [[podcast]] with [[Leo Laporte]] called ''[[Security Now!]]''. Gibson has appeared on Leo Laporte's technology podcast, ''[[This Week in Tech]]''.  Gibson also used to occasionally appear on ''[[The Lab with Leo Laporte]]'' on ''[[G4techTV Canada]]''.

Steve Gibson was a contributing editor to [[InfoWorld]] magazine.  His writings tried to provide visibility into the world of ''[[Hacker (computing)|hackers]]'' and ''[[Hacker (computing)#Hacker: Intruder and criminal|crackers]]'', of which he counts himself one of the former.

In April 2006, Gibson made an acting appearance alongside technology columnist [[John C. Dvorak]] in the [[vodcast|video podcast]] ''Up in Smoke''.
