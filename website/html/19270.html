<html> <head> <title>Inventory</title></head><body>In the USA and Canada the term has developed from a list of [[Good (economics and accounting)|goods]] and [[materials]] to the goods and materials themselves, especially those held available in stock by a [[business]]; and this has become the primary meaning of the term in North American English, equivalent to the term "stock" in British English. In accounting, inventory or stock is considered an [[asset]].

''Inventory management'' is primarily about specifying the size and placement of stocked goods. Inventory management is required at different locations within a facility or within multiple locations of a supply network to protect the regular and planned course of production against the random disturbance of running out of materials or goods. The scope of inventory management also concerns the fine lines between replenishment lead time, carrying costs of inventory, asset management, inventory forecasting, inventory valuation, inventory visibility, future inventory price forecasting, physical inventory, available physical space for inventory, quality management, replenishment, returns and defective goods and demand forecasting. Balancing these competing requirements leads to optimal inventory levels, which is an on-going process as the business needs shift and react to the widerenvironment. Inventory management involves a retailer seeking to acquire and maintain a proper merchandise assortment while ordering, shipping, handling, and related costs are kept in check. Systems and processes that identify inventory requirements, set targets, provide replenishment techniques and report actual and projected inventory status. Handles all functions related to the tracking and management of material. This would include the monitoring of material moved into and out of stockroom locations and the reconciling of the inventory balances. Also may include [[ABC analysis]], lot tracking, cycle counting support etc. Management of the inventories, with the primary objective of determining/controlling stock levels within the physical distribution function to balance the need for product availability against the need for minimizing stock holding and handling costs. See [[inventory proportionality]].

==Business inventory==
=== The reasons for keeping stock ===
There are three basic reasons for keeping an inventory:
#Time - The time lags present in the supply chain, from supplier to user at every stage, requires that you maintain certain amounts of inventory to use in this "lead time."
#Uncertainty - Inventories are maintained as buffers to meet uncertainties in demand, supply and movements of goods.
#Economies of scale -  Ideal condition of "one unit at a time at a place where a user needs it, when he needs it" principle tends to incur lots of costs in terms of logistics. So bulk buying, movement and storing brings in economies of scale, thus inventory.

All these stock reasons can apply to any owner or product stage.

* '''Buffer stock''' is held in individual workstations against the possibility that the upstream workstation may be a little delayed in long setup or change over time. This stock is then used while that changeover is happening. This stock can be eliminated by tools like [[SMED]].

These classifications apply along the whole [[Supply chain]], not just within a facility or plant.

Where these stocks contain the same or similar items, it is often the work practice to hold all these stocks mixed together before or after the sub-process to which they relate. This 'reduces' costs. Because they are mixed up together there is no visual reminder to operators of the adjacent sub-processes or [[line management]] of the stock, which is due to a particular cause and should be a particular individual's responsibility with inevitable consequences. Some plants have centralized stock holding across sub-processes, which makes the situation even more acute.

=== Special terms used in dealing with inventory ===
* ''[[Stock Keeping Unit]]'' (SKU) is a unique combination of all the components that are assembled into the purchasable item. Therefore, any change in the packaging or product is a new SKU. This level of detailed specification assists in managing inventory.
* ''Stockout'' means running out of the inventory of an SKU.<ref>Financial dictionary, formerly at http://www.specialinvestor.com/terms/1072.html, Special Investor</ref>
* "[[New old stock]]" (sometimes abbreviated NOS) is a term used in business to refer to merchandise being offered for sale that was manufactured long ago but that has never been used. Such merchandise may not be produced anymore, and the new old stock may represent the only market source of a particular item at the present time.

===Typology===
#Buffer/safety stock
#Cycle stock (Used in batch processes, it is the available inventory, excluding buffer stock)
#De-coupling (Buffer stock that is held by both the supplier and the user)
#Anticipation stock (Building up extra stock for periods of increased demand - e.g. ice cream for summer)
#Pipeline stock (Goods still in transit or in the process of distribution - have left the factory but not arrived at the customer yet)

===Inventory examples===
While [[accountant]]s often discuss inventory in terms of goods for sale, organizations -  [[manufacturer]]s, [[service provider|service-provider]]s and [[not-for-profit]]s -   also have inventories (fixtures, furniture, supplies, ...) that they do not intend to sell. Manufacturers', [[distribution (business)|distributor]]s', and wholesalers' inventory tends to cluster in [[warehouse]]s. [[Retailer]]s' inventory may exist in a warehouse or in a [[Retailing#Shops and stores|shop]] or store accessible to [[customers]]. Inventories not intended for sale to customers or to [[consumer|client]]s may be held in any premises an organization uses.  Stock ties up cash and, if uncontrolled, it will be impossible to know the actual level of stocks and therefore impossible to control them.

While the reasons for holding stock were covered earlier, most manufacturing organizations usually divide their "goods for sale" inventory into:
* [[Raw materials]] - materials and components scheduled for use in making a product.
* [[Work in process]], WIP - materials and components that have begun their transformation to finished goods.
* [[Finished goods]] - goods ready for sale to customers.
* Goods for resale - returned goods that are salable.

For example:

====Manufacturing====
A canned food manufacturer's materials inventory includes the ingredients to form the foods to be canned, empty cans and their lids (or coils of steel or aluminum for constructing those components), labels, and anything else (solder, glue, ...) that will form part of a finished can. The firm's work in process includes those materials from the time of release to the work floor until they become complete and ready for sale to wholesale or retail customers. This may be vats of prepared food, filled cans not yet labeled or sub-assemblies of food components. It may also include finished cans that are not yet packaged into cartons or pallets. Its finished good inventory consists of all the filled and labeled cans of food in its warehouse that it has manufactured and wishes to sell to food distributors (wholesalers), to grocery stores (retailers), and even perhaps to consumers through arrangements like [[factory outlet|factory store]]s and outlet centers.

Examples of case studies are very revealing, and consistently show that the improvement of inventory management has two parts: the capability of the organisation to manage inventory, and the way in which it chooses to do so.  For example, a company may wish to install a complex inventory system, but unless there is a good understanding of the role of inventory and its perameters, and an effective business process to support that, the system cannot bring the necessary benefits to the organisation in isolation.

Typical Inventory Management techniques include Pareto Curve ABC Classification<ref>http://www.inventorymatters.co.uk.noisegate2.webhoster.co.uk//userFiles/extending_the_pareto_principle.pdf</ref> and Economic Order Quantity Management. A more sophisticated method takes these two techniques further, combining certain aspects of each to create The K Curve Methodology.<ref>http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.25.6601</ref> A case study of k-curve<ref>http://www.inventorymatters.co.uk.noisegate2.webhoster.co.uk//userFiles/mk_kcurve_case_study.pdf</ref> benefits to one company shows a successful implementation.

Unnecessary inventory adds enormously to the working capital tied up in the business, as well as the complexity of the supply chain. Reduction and elimination of these inventory 'wait' states is a key concept in Lean.<ref>http://www.phitch.com/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=mWpeMu89r5Q=&tabid=64</ref>  Too big an inventory reduction too quickly can cause a business to be anorexic. There are well-proven processes and techniques to assist in inventory planning and strategy, both at the business overview and part number level. Many of the big MRP/and ERP systems do not offer the necessary inventory planning tools within their integrated planning applications.

==Principle of inventory proportionality==
===Purpose===
Inventory proportionality is the goal of demand-driven inventory management. The primary optimal outcome is to have the same number of days' (or hours', etc.) worth of inventory on hand across all products so that the time of runout of all products would be simultaneous. In such a case, there is no "excess inventory," that is, inventory that would be left over of another product when the first product runs out. Excess inventory is sub-optimal because the money spent to obtain it could have been utilized better elsewhere, i.e. to the product that just ran out.

The secondary goal of inventory proportionality is inventory minimization. By integrating accurate [[demand forecasting]] with inventory management, replenishment inventories can be scheduled to arrive just in time to replenish the product destined to run out first, while at the same time balancing out the inventory supply of all products to make their inventories more proportional, and thereby closer to achieving the primary goal. Accurate demand forecasting also allows the desired inventory proportions to be dynamic by determining expected sales out into the future; this allows for inventory to be in proportion to expected short-term sales or consumption rather than to past averages, a much more accurate and optimal outcome.

Integrating demand forecasting into inventory management in this way also allows for the prediction of the "can fit" point when inventory storage is limited on a per-product basis.

===Applications===
The technique of inventory proportionality is most appropriate for inventories that remain unseen by the consumer. As opposed to "keep full" systems where a retail consumer would like to see full shelves of the product they are buying so as not to think they are buying something old, unwanted or stale; and differentiated from the "trigger point" systems where product is reordered when it hits a certain level; inventory proportionality is used effectively by just-in-time manufacturing processes and retail applications where the product is hidden from view.

One early example of inventory proportionality used in a retail application in the United States is for motor fuel. Motor fuel (e.g. gasoline) is generally stored in underground storage tanks. The motorists do not know whether they are buying gasoline off the top or bottom of the tank, nor need they care. Additionally, these storage tanks have a maximum capacity and cannot be overfilled. Finally, the product is expensive. Inventory proportionality is used to balance the inventories of the different grades of motor fuel, each stored in dedicated tanks, in proportion to the sales of each grade. Excess inventory is not seen or valued by the consumer, so it is simply cash sunk (literally) into the ground. Inventory proportionality minimizes the amount of excess inventory carried in underground storage tanks. This application for motor fuel was first developed and implemented by [[Petrolsoft Corporation]] in 1990 for [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] Products Company. Most major oil companies use such systems today.<ref name=aspentech>{{cite|url=http://www.aspentech.com/solutions/industry_solutions/refining_marketing/aspenone_supply_distribution.cfm|title=aspenONE Supply & Distribution for Refining & Marketing}}</ref>

===Roots===
The use of inventory proportionality in the United States is thought to have been inspired by Japanese [[just-in-time (business)|just-in-time]] parts inventory management made famous by [[Toyota]] Motors in the 1980s.[http://www.bsu.edu/web/scfrazier2/jit/mainpage.htm]

==High-level inventory management==
It seems that around 1880<ref>Relevance Lost, Johnson and Kaplan, Harvard Business School Press, 1987, p126</ref> there was a change in manufacturing practice from companies with relatively homogeneous lines of products to vertically integrated companies with unprecedented diversity in processes and products. Those companies (especially in metalworking) attempted to achieve success through economies of scope - the gains of jointly producing two or more products in one facility. The managers now needed information on the effect of product-mix decisions on overall profits and therefore needed accurate product-cost information. A variety of attempts to achieve this were unsuccessful due to the huge overhead of the information processing of the time. However, the burgeoning need for financial reporting after 1900 created unavoidable pressure for [[financial accounting]] of stock and the management need to cost manage products became overshadowed. In particular, it was the need for audited accounts that sealed the fate of managerial cost accounting. The dominance of financial reporting accounting over [[management accounting]] remains to this day with few exceptions, and the financial reporting definitions of 'cost' have distorted effective management 'cost' accounting since that time. This is particularly true of inventory.

Hence, high-level financial inventory has these two basic formulas, which relate to the accounting period:

#Cost of [[Beginning Inventory]] at the start of the period + inventory [[purchase]]s within the period + cost of [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]] within the period =  cost of goods available
# Cost of goods available − cost of [[ending inventory]] at the end of the period = [[cost of goods sold]]

The benefit of these formulae is that the first absorbs all overheads of production and raw material costs into a value of inventory for reporting. The second formula then creates the new start point for the next period and gives a figure to be subtracted from the sales price to determine some form of sales-margin figure.

Manufacturing management is more interested in ''inventory turnover ratio'' or ''average days to sell inventory'' since it tells them something about relative inventory levels.

:Inventory turnover ratio (also known as [[inventory turns]]) = cost of goods sold / Average Inventory = Cost of Goods Sold / ((Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2)

and its inverse

:Average Days to Sell Inventory = Number of Days a Year / Inventory Turnover Ratio = 365 days a year / Inventory Turnover Ratio

This ratio estimates how many times the inventory turns over a year. This number tells how much cash/goods are tied up waiting for the process and is a critical measure of process reliability and effectiveness. So a factory with two inventory turns has six months stock on hand, which is generally not a good figure (depending upon the industry), whereas a factory that moves from six turns to twelve turns has probably improved effectiveness by 100%. This improvement will have some negative results in the financial reporting, since the 'value' now stored in the factory as inventory is reduced.

While these accounting measures of inventory are very useful because of their simplicity, they are also fraught with the danger of their own assumptions. There are, in fact, so many things that can vary hidden under this appearance of simplicity that a variety of 'adjusting' assumptions may be used. These include:
* [[Specific Identification]]
* [[Weighted Average Cost]]
* [[Moving-Average Cost]]
* [[FIFO and LIFO accounting|FIFO and LIFO]].

Inventory Turn is a financial accounting tool for evaluating inventory and it is not necessarily a management tool. Inventory management should be forward looking. The methodology applied is based on historical cost of goods sold. The ratio may not be able to reflect the usability of future production demand, as well as customer demand.

Business models, including Just in Time (JIT) Inventory, Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) and Customer Managed Inventory (CMI), attempt to minimize on-hand inventory and increase inventory turns. VMI and CMI have gained considerable attention due to the success of third-party vendors who offer added expertise and knowledge that organizations may not possess.

==Accounting for inventory==
{{Accounting}}

Each country has its own rules about [[accounting]] for inventory that fit with their financial-reporting rules.

For example, organizations in the U.S. define '''inventory''' to suit their needs within [[US generally accepted accounting principles|US Generally Accepted Accounting Practices]] (GAAP), the rules defined by the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB) (and others) and enforced by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and other federal and state agencies. Other countries often have similar arrangements but with their own GAAP and national agencies instead.

It is intentional that [[financial accounting]] uses standards that allow the public to compare firms' performance, [[cost accounting]] functions internally to an organization and potentially with much greater flexibility. A discussion of inventory from standard and [[Theory of Constraints]]-based ([[throughput]]) [[cost accounting]] perspective follows some examples and a discussion of inventory from a [[financial accounting]] perspective.

The internal costing/valuation of inventory can be complex. Whereas in the past most enterprises ran simple, one-process factories, such enterprises are quite probably in the minority in the 21st century. Where 'one process' factories exist, there is a market for the goods created, which establishes an independent market value for the good. Today, with multistage-process companies, there is much inventory that would once have been finished goods which is now held as 'work in process' (WIP). This needs to be valued in the accounts, but the valuation is a management decision since there is no market for the partially finished product. This somewhat arbitrary 'valuation' of WIP combined with the allocation of overheads to it has led to some unintended and undesirable results.

===Financial accounting===
An organization's inventory can appear a mixed blessing, since it counts as an [[asset]] on the [[balance sheet]], but it also ties up money that could serve for other purposes and requires additional expense for its protection. Inventory may also cause significant tax expenses, depending on particular countries' laws regarding depreciation of inventory, as in [[Thor Power Tool Company v. Commissioner]].

Inventory appears as a [[current asset]] on an organization's balance sheet because the organization can, in principle, turn it into cash by selling it. Some organizations hold larger inventories than their operations require in order to inflate their apparent asset value and their perceived profitability.

In addition to the money tied up by acquiring inventory, inventory also brings associated costs for warehouse space, for utilities, and for [[insurance]] to cover staff to handle and protect it from fire and other disasters, obsolescence, shrinkage (theft and errors), and others. Such [[holding cost]]s can mount up: between a third and a half of its acquisition value per year. <!-- An organization that reduced its inventory by $1,000,000 would add that amount to its net income [huh???  Its net income would only increase by the income received minus the cost of the goods sold], an attractive prospect that helps to explain the popularity of programs like [[Just in time]] (JIT) inventory.   -->

Businesses that stock too little inventory cannot take advantage of large orders from customers if they cannot deliver. The conflicting objectives of cost control and customer service often pit an organization's financial and operating managers against its [[sales]] and [[marketing]] departments. Salespeople, in particular, often receive sales-commission payments, so unavailable goods may reduce their potential personal income. This conflict can be minimised by reducing production time to being near or less than customers' expected delivery time. This effort, known as "[[Lean production]]" will significantly reduce [[working capital]] tied up in inventory and reduce manufacturing costs (See the [[Toyota Production System]]).

===Role of inventory accounting===
By helping the organization to make better decisions, the accountants can help the public sector to change in a very positive way that delivers increased value for the taxpayer’s investment. It can also help to incentivise progress and to ensure that reforms are sustainable and effective in the long term, by ensuring that success is appropriately recognized in both the formal and informal reward systems of the organization.

To say that they have a key role to play is an understatement. Finance is connected to most, if not all, of the key business processes within the organization. It should be steering the stewardship and accountability systems that ensure that the organization is conducting its business in an appropriate, ethical manner. It is critical that these foundations are firmly laid. So often they are the litmus test by which public confidence in the institution is either won or lost.

Finance should also be providing the information, analysis and advice to enable the organizations’ service managers to operate effectively. This goes beyond the traditional preoccupation with budgets – how much have we spent so far, how much do we have left to spend? It is about helping the organization to better understand its own performance. That means making the connections and understanding the relationships between given inputs – the resources brought to bear – and the outputs and outcomes that they achieve. It is also about understanding and actively managing risks within the organization and its activities.

===FIFO vs. LIFO accounting===
{{main|FIFO and LIFO accounting}}

When a merchant buys goods from inventory, the value of the inventory account is reduced by the [[cost of goods sold]] (COGS). This is simple where the CoG has not varied across those held in stock; but where it has, then an agreed method must be derived to evaluate it. For [[commodity]] items that one cannot track individually, accountants must choose a method that fits the nature of the sale. Two popular methods that normally exist are: [[FIFO and LIFO accounting]] (first in - first out, last in - first out). FIFO regards the first unit that arrived in inventory as the first one sold. LIFO considers the last unit arriving in inventory as the first one sold. Which method an accountant selects can have a significant effect on net income and [[book value]] and, in turn, on taxation. Using LIFO accounting for inventory, a company generally reports lower net income and lower book value, due to the effects of inflation. This generally results in lower taxation. Due to LIFO's potential to skew inventory value, [[UK GAAP]] and [[International Accounting Standards|IAS]] have effectively banned LIFO inventory accounting.

===Standard cost accounting===
Standard cost accounting uses [[ratio]]s called [[Efficiency (economics)|efficiencies]] that compare the labour and materials actually used to produce a good with those that the same goods would have required under "standard" conditions. As long as similar actual and standard conditions obtain, few problems arise. Unfortunately, standard cost accounting methods developed about 100 years ago, when labor comprised the most important cost in manufactured goods. Standard methods continue to emphasize labor efficiency even though that resource now constitutes a (very) small part of cost in most cases.

Standard cost accounting can hurt managers, workers, and firms in several ways. For example, a policy decision to increase inventory can harm a manufacturing manager's [[performance evaluation]]. Increasing inventory requires increased production, which means that processes must operate at higher rates. When (not if) something goes wrong, the process takes longer and uses more than the standard labor time. The manager appears responsible for the excess, even though s/he has no control over the production requirement or the problem.

In adverse economic times, firms use the same efficiencies to downsize, rightsize, or otherwise reduce their labor force. Workers laid off under those circumstances have even less control over excess inventory and cost efficiencies than their managers.

Many financial and cost accountants have agreed for many years on the desirability of replacing standard cost accounting. They have not, however, found a successor.

===Theory of constraints cost accounting===
[[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] developed the [[Theory of Constraints]] in part to address the cost-accounting problems in what he calls the "cost world." He offers a substitute, called [[throughput accounting]], that uses [[Throughput (business)|throughput]] (money for goods sold to customers) in place of output (goods produced that may sell or may boost inventory) and considers labor as a fixed rather than as a variable cost. He defines inventory simply as everything the organization owns that it plans to sell, including buildings, machinery, and many other things in addition to the categories listed here. Throughput accounting recognizes only one class of variable costs: the truly variable costs, like materials and components, which vary directly with the quantity produced.

Finished goods inventories remain [[balance sheet|balance-sheet]] assets, but labor-efficiency ratios no longer evaluate managers and workers. Instead of an incentive to reduce labor cost, throughput accounting focuses attention on the relationships between throughput (revenue or income) on one hand and controllable operating expenses and changes in inventory on the other. Those relationships direct attention to the constraints or [[Bottleneck (logistics)|bottlenecks]] that prevent the system from producing more throughput, rather than to people - who have little or no control over their situations.

==National accounts==
Inventories also play an important role in [[national accounts]] and the analysis of the [[business cycle]]. Some short-term [[macroeconomic]] fluctuations are attributed to the inventory cycle.

==Distressed inventory==
Also known as  distressed or expired stock, distressed inventory is inventory whose potential to be sold at a normal [[cost]] has passed or will soon pass. In certain industries it could also mean that the stock is or will soon be impossible to sell. Examples of distressed inventory include products that have reached their [[Expiration date|expiry date]], or have reached a date in advance of expiry at which the planned market will no longer purchase them (e.g. 3 months left to expiry), clothing that is defective or out of [[fashion]], and old newspapers or magazines. It also includes computer or consumer-electronic equipment that is obsolete or discontinued and whose manufacturer is unable to support it. One current example of distressed inventory is the [[VHS]] format.<ref>{{cite news |last=Boucher |first=Geoff |title=VHS era is winding down |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2008-12-22 |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-vhs-tapes22-2008dec22,0,5852342.story |accessdate=2008-12-28}}</ref>

In 2001, Cisco wrote off inventory worth US $2.25 billion due to duplicate orders.<ref>{{cite web|last=Armony |first=Mor
 |title=The Impact of Duplicate Orders on Demand Estimation and Capacity Investment |url=http://ormstomorrow.informs.org/archive/Summerfall06/TheImpactOfDuplicateOrders.pdf}}</ref> This is one of the biggest inventory write-offs in business history.

==Inventory credit==
Inventory credit refers to the use of stock, or inventory, as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] to raise finance. Where banks may be reluctant to accept traditional collateral, for example in [[developing countries]] where [[land registration|land title]] may be lacking, inventory credit is a potentially important way of overcoming financing constraints. This is not a new concept; archaeological evidence suggests that it was practiced in Ancient Rome. Obtaining finance against stocks of a wide range of products held in a [[bonded warehouse]] is common in much of the world. It is, for example, used with Parmesan cheese in Italy.<ref>Italian Notebook.com [http://www.italiannotebook.com/local-interest/parmigiano-hedge/]"Who moved my parmigiano?" 24 February 2009</ref> Inventory credit on the basis of stored agricultural produce is widely used in Latin American countries and in some Asian countries.<ref>Jonathan Coulter and Andrew W. Shepherd [http://www.fao.org/docrep/v7470e/v7470e00.htm], Inventory Credit – An approach to developing agricultural markets, FAO, Rome, 1995</ref> A precondition for such credit is that banks must be confident that the stored product will be available if they need to call on the collateral; this implies the existence of a reliable network of certified warehouses. Banks also face problems in valuing the inventory. The possibility of sudden falls in commodity prices means that they are usually reluctant to lend more than about 60% of the value of the inventory at the time of the loan.
