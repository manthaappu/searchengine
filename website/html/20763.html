<html> <head> <title>Knowledge Search</title></head><body>'''Knowledge Search''' ([[Korean language|Korean]]:지식iN) service is an information-sharing tool launched in 2002 for [[Naver (web portal)|Naver]] users. The tool allows users to ask just about any question, such as how to cook "[[ramen]]" or how to subscribe to international magazines via the Internet, and get answers from other users. In this way, Knowledge Search was an early example of harnessing [[user-generated content]] to expand the amount of information available in the web, particularly in the [[Korean language]]. [[Bradley Horowitz]], Vice President of Product Strategy at Yahoo!, has cited<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elatable.com/blog/?p=35 |title=Buzz by Bradley Horowitz from Twitter |author= |date=April 13, 2010 |work=Blog |publisher= |accessdate=20 September 2010}}</ref> the South Korean experience with knowledge search as the inspiration for [[Yahoo! Answers]], which was launched three years after Naver introduced the original service. As of January 2008 the Knowledge Search database included more than 80 million pages of user-generated information.

'''Knowledge Search''' has four sub-categories:
*''Knowledge Q&A'' allows for general questions about anything
*''Local Q&A'' allows people to ask for local information such as good restaurants, cheap stores, and real estate.
*''Agony Q&A'' is for people seeking advice on relationships, love, career, and sex (with anonymous posting enabled.) While ''Knowledge Q&A'' and ''Local Q&A'' provide factual answers, ''Agony Q&A'' usually returns more opinionated responses.
*''Open Dictionary'' is a database of informative articles generated by users. Users can create an article alone, or enable other users to collaborate to create a thread of articles on the same subject. In addition, the user may add his or her own answers from ''Knowledge Q&A'' to ''Open Dictionary''.
