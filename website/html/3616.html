<html> <head> <title>Benz plane</title></head><body>In [[mathematics]], a '''Benz plane''' is a [[Geometry|geometrical]] object, named after the [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] [[Walter Benz]]. The term was applied to a group of objects that arise from a common [[axiomatization]] of certain structures and split into three families, which were introduced separately: [[Möbius plane]]s, [[Laguerre plane]]s, and [[Minkowski plane]]s. <ref>W.
