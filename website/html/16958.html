'''Horse Isle (Video Game)''' is a browser based MMORPG first released in 2007.<ref>Game Ogre ''Game Ogre MMORPG and Online Mega Site'', September 28th, 2009, "[http://www.gameogre.com/reviewdirectory/reviews/Horse_Isle.php]", Retrieved 11/18/2010</ref> The game is developed and published independently by Joe and Miranda Durbin.<ref>Peter Passi ''Duluth News Tribune'', July 30th, 2007, "[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-166941599.html?key=01-42160D517E19126F1A0E031A0F674B2E224E324D3417295C30420B61651B617F137019731B7B1D6B39]", Retrieved 11/19/2010</ref> In May 2010 a second version of the game was released with completely different gameplay and graphics '''Horse Isle: Legend of the Esrohs'''.

'''Horse Isle''' is set in a fictional world that centers around horses.<ref>Tim Wilson ''RPG Land'', July 1st, 2007, "[http://rpgland.com/games/reviews/horse-isle-the-secret-land-of-horses/]", Retrieved 11/18/2010</ref> The focus is on individual player's capture and care of horses, mini games, arena competitions and the dozens of horse breeds the game offers. The game is geared to include gamers of all ages so it has parental filters in place. The game currently has a player of base of around 10,000.<ref>Heath Hindman ''RPG Land'', November 9th, 2010, "[http://rpgland.com/news/horse-isle-2-out-of-the-gate-tops-10k/]", Retrieved 11/18/2010</ref> Player criticism of the game seems to center around lag issues and lack of challenge for experienced gamers. One of the biggest features of the game is that it is completely browser based but is a fully graphical online rpg. The artwork in Horse Isle has a 2D style with hand drawn images.

The '''Horse Isle''' series uses educational elements involved in progressing through the games. These focus around reading comprehension, spelling, mathematics, science, and a lot of problem solving.<ref>''Super Smart Games'', December 30th, 2007, "[http://www.supersmartgames.com/Big_Kids/Life_Skills/Horse_Isle/]", Retrieved 11/19/2010</ref>
