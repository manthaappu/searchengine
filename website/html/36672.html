'''TI InterActive!''' is a [[Texas Instruments]] computer program which combines the functionality of all of the TI [[graphing calculator]]s with extra features into a [[text editor]] which allows you to save [[equation]]s, [[Graph of a function|graph]]s, tables, [[spreadsheet]]s, and text onto a document.  TI InterActive! also includes a web browser, but it is just an embedded version of [[Internet Explorer]].  It also works with [[TI Connect]] to share data with the TI Graphing Calculators.
