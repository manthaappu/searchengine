Typical examples of such communication include:
*Telemetry data ([[TELINT]]). Missiles, satellites, and other remotely-monitored devices often transmit streams of data concerning their location, speed, engine status and other metrics.  

*Video data links. These may be present in [[Unmanned Aerial Vehicle|UAVs]] or from satellites used for reconnaissance.
