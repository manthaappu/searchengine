<html> <head> <title>VP-tree</title></head><body>A '''vantage point tree''', or '''vp-tree''' is a [[Binary space partitioning|BSP tree]] that segregates data in a [[metric space]] by choosing a position in the space (the "vantage point") and dividing the data points into two partitions: those that are nearer to the vantage point than a threshold, and those that are not. By repeatedly applying this procedure to partition the data into smaller and smaller sets, a [[Tree (data structure)|tree data structure]] is created where neighbors in the tree are likely to be neighbors in the space.<ref name="pny93">{{cite conference

This iterative partitioning process is similar to that of a [[kd-tree]], but uses circular (or spherical, hyperspherical, etc.) rather than rectilinear partitions. In 2D Euclidean space, this can be visualized as a series of circles segregating the data.  

The vp-tree is particularly useful in dividing data in a non-standard metric space into a [[Binary space partitioning|BSP tree]].
