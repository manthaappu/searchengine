<html> <head> <title>Clausal normal form</title></head><body>The '''clausal normal form''' (or '''clause normal form''', '''conjunctive normal form''', '''CNF''') of  a logical formula is used in [[logic programming]] and many [[automated theorem proving|theorem proving]] systems. A formula in clause normal form is a set of clauses, interpreted as a conjunction. A [[Clause (logic)|clause]] is an implicitly universally quantified set of literals, interpreted as a disjunction.<ref>{{cite book|last=Loveland|first=Donald W.|title=Automated Theorem Proving: A Logical Basis|publisher=North Holland|date=1978}}</ref>

==Conversion to clausal normal form==

The procedure to convert a formula into clausal form can destroy the structure of the formula, and naive translations often causes [[exponential growth|exponential blowup]] in the size of the resulting formula.

The procedure begins with any formula of classical [[First-order predicate calculus|first-order logic]]:

# Put the formula into [[negation normal form]].
# Standardize variables
#* <math>(\forall x\, P(x)) \vee (\exists x\, P(x))</math> becomes <math>(\forall x\, P(x)) \vee (\exists c\, P(c))</math>, where <math>c</math> is new
# [[Skolem normal form|Skolemize]] -- replace [[Existential quantification|existential]] variables with Skolem constants or Skolem functions of [[Universal quantification|universal]] variables, from the outside inward. Make the following replacements:
#* <math>\forall x \exists y \, P(y)</math> becomes <math>, \forall x \, P(f_c(x))</math>, where <math>f_c</math> is new
# Discard the [[universal quantifier]]s (which are implicit in CNF).
# Put the formula into [[conjunctive normal form]].
# Replace <math>C1 \wedge \cdots \wedge Cn</math> with <math>\{ C1 , \dots , Cn \}</math>. Each conjunct is of the form <math>\neg A1 \vee \cdots \vee \neg Am \vee B1 \vee \cdots \vee Bn</math>, which is equivalent to <math>( A1 \wedge \cdots \wedge Am ) \to ( B1 \vee \cdots \vee Bn )</math>.
# Finally, replace each conjunct <math>( A1 \wedge \cdots \wedge Am ) \to ( B1 \vee \cdots \vee Bn )</math> with <math>\{ A1 \wedge \cdots \wedge Am \to B1 , A1 \wedge \cdots \wedge Am \to B2 , \cdots , A1 \wedge \cdots \wedge Am \to Bn \}</math>.
When ''n'' ≤ 1 for all clauses, the logic is called [[Horn clause]] logic and is equivalent in computational power to a [[universal Turing machine]]. Horn logic is the basis of [[Prolog]], the most widely used [[logic programming]] language. 

Often it is sufficient to generate an equisatisfiable (not an equivalent) CNF for a formula. In this case, the worst-case exponential blow-up can be avoided by introducing ''definitions'' and using them to ''rename'' parts of the formula.
