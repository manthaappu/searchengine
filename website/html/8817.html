==Examples in history==
In 1966, [[Kit Pedler]], a medical scientist, created the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] for the TV program ''[[Doctor Who]]'', based on his concerns about science changing and threatening humanity. The Cybermen had replaced much of their bodies with mechanical prostheses and were now supposedly emotionless creatures driven only by logic.   

[[Isaac Asimov]]'s short story "[[The Bicentennial Man]]" explored cybernetic concepts. The central character is NDR, a robot who begins to modify himself with [[organic compound|organic]] components. His explorations lead to breakthroughs in human [[medicine]] ''via'' artificial [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s and prosthetics. By the end of the story, there is little physical difference between the body of the hero, now called Andrew, and humans equipped with advanced prosthetics, save for the presence of Andrew's artificial positronic brain. Asimov also explored the idea of the cyborg in relation to robots in his short story "[[Segregationist (short story)|Segregationist]]", collected in ''[[The Complete Robot]]''.   

The 1972 [[science fiction]] novel [[Cyborg (novel)|''Cyborg'']], by [[Martin Caidin]], told the story of a man whose damaged body parts are replaced by mechanical devices ("bionics"). This novel was adapted into a [[Television program|TV series]], ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'', in 1973, and a spin-off, ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'' in 1976. Caidin also addressed bionics in his 1968 novel, ''[[The God Machine (1968 novel)|The God Machine]]''.

In 1974, [[Marvel Comics]] writer [[Rich Buckler]] introduced the cyborg [[Deathlok|Deathlok the Demolisher]], and a [[dystopian]] [[post-apocalyptic]] future, in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #25. Buckler's character dealt with rebellion and loyalty, with allusion to [[Frankenstein]]'s monster, in a twelve-issue run. Deathlok was later resurrected in ''[[Captain America]]'', followed by two others in 1990 and 1999.  

The 1982 film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' featured creatures called [[replicants]], bio-engineered or bio-robotic beings. The Nexus series—genetically designed by the [[Blade Runner#Tyrell Corporation|Tyrell Corporation]]—are virtually identical to an adult human, but have superior strength, agility, and variable intelligence depending on the model. Because of their physical similarity to humans a replicant must be detected by its lack of emotional responses and empathy to questions posed in a [[Voight-Kampff machine|Voight-Kampff]] test. A derogatory term for a replicant is "skin-job," a term heard again extensively in ''[[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|Battlestar Galactica]]''. In the opening crawl of the film, they are first said to be the next generation in robotics. The crawl also states genetics play some role in the creation of replicants. The original novel makes mention of the biological components of the androids, but also alludes to the mechanical aspects commonly found in other material relating to robots.   

The 1987 science fiction [[action film]] ''[[RoboCop]]'' features a cyborg protagonist. After being killed by a criminal gang, police officer Alex Murphy is transformed by a private company into a cyborg cop. The transformation is used to explore the theme of [[resurrection]]  and [[Psychological identity|identity]]. There are cyborg ''[[kaiju]]'' in the [[Godzilla]] films such as [[Gigan]] and [[Mechagodzilla]].   

Although frequently referred to onscreen as a cyborg, [[The Terminator]] might be more properly an [[android (robot)|android]]. While it has skin and blood (cellular organic systems), these serve mainly as a disguise and are not [[symbiotic]] with the machine components, a trait of true cyborgs. The endoskeletons beneath are fully functional robots and have been seen operating independently, especially during the future segments of the Terminator movies. The [[T-1000]] (which is said to be made completely of a liquid metal) of ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' is definitely an android. The Terminator [[Cameron (Terminator)|Cameron Phillips]] seen in the TV series ''[[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles]]'' is of a previously unseen model, and is once again referred to on screen (including once by another Terminator) as a cyborg. [[Terminator Salvation]] introduces Marcus Wright, a death-row convict who donated his body to Cyberdyne Systems, who was later revived as a one of a kind Terminator with his original brain and heart placed into an endoskeleton which was then covered by a copy of his original organic tissue. 

Cyborgs have also been present in [[real-time strategy]] video games. The "[[Command & Conquer]]" video game series had cyborgs as a part of its plot - specifically Cyborgs created by the "[[Brotherhood of Nod]]" via [[Tiberium Infusion]] experimentation. They were frequently used for anti-personnel, though the Cyborg Commando proved to be useful in most situations. Cyborgs were brought back by the [[AI]] named [[Nod characters of Command & Conquer#LEGION|LEGION]], (a predecessor to [[CABAL]]) under direct orders from [[Kane (Command & Conquer)|Kane]]. The 'Marked of Kane' units also contain Cyborgs.  

The [[Metal Gear Solid]] series of video games has a recurring character known as [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Grey Fox|Grey Fox]] or the "Cyborg Ninja" who is a person wearing a cybernetic exoskeleton (either worn as a suit or grafted directly to the character's body) and wielding a high-frequency blade.   

The cyborg ninja suit has been donned by multiple characters, most recently by the character [[Raiden (Metal Gear)|Raiden]] in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]''. He became the newest incarnation of the Cyborg Ninja after he was captured by [[Patriots (Metal Gear)|The Patriots]] after he stole the body of [[Big Boss (Metal Gear)|Big Boss]] for the Paradise Lost Army. His body was heavily experimented on for the purpose of creating the ultimate soldier and the only remaining organic parts of his original body are his head and spinal cord. His cyborg body is composed of artificial muscle, organs, bones, and blood( a "white" artificial blood that the PLA substituted for his old, [[nanomachine]] primed blood). His cyborg body was optimized for war and enabled him to fight on a superhuman level and withstand what would normally be considered fatal injuries.    

One of the most famous cyborgs is [[Darth Vader]] from the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films. Vader was once [[Anakin Skywalker]], a famous [[Jedi]] turned to the Dark Side. After a furious battle with his former master, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], Anakin is left for dead beside a lava flow on Mustafar, and is outfitted with an artificial life support system as well as robotic arms and legs. [[General Grievous]], [[List of Star Wars characters#L|Lobot]], and [[Luke Skywalker]] are the three other most prominent cyborgs in the Star Wars universe.   

In [[Akira Toriyama]]'s ''[[manga]]'' and ''[[anime]]'' series ''[[Dragon Ball]]''', a scientist named [[Dr. Gero]] created several [[cyborgs]], including villain [[Cell (Dragon Ball)|Cell]], sibling cyborgs [[Android 17]] and [[Android 18]], as well as [[Android 20]], who was built from Gero himself.   

A direct brain-to-computer interface is a valuable, but expensive, luxury in [[Larry Niven]] and [[Jerry Pournelle]]'s novel ''[[Oath of Fealty (novel)|Oath of Fealty]]''.

In the ''manga'' and ''anime'' series ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'', Motoko Kusanagi lived in a world where the majority of adults are cyborgs and can connect wirelessly to the Internet for real-time communication and data research. The most common augmentation in the series were artificial brains called cyberbrains.   

[[Bruce Sterling]] in his universe of [[Shaper/Mechanist]] suggested an idea of alternative cyborg called [[lobster (cyborg)|Lobster]], which is made not by using internal implants, but by using an external shell (''e.g.'' a [[Artificial powered exoskeleton|Powered Exoskeleton]]).<ref>Sterling, Bruce. Schismatrix. Arbor House. 1985.</ref> Unlike human cyborgs that appear human externally while being synthetic internally, a Lobster looks inhuman externally but contains a human internally. The computer game ''[[Deus Ex: Invisible War]]'' prominently featured the [[Omar (Deus Ex)|Omar]], where "Omar" is a Russian translation of the word "Lobster" (since the Omar are of Russian origin in the game).   

In the ''Brain and Brawn'' series of novels series by [[Anne McCaffrey]] and others, beginning with ''[[The Ship Who Sang]]'', a "brainship" is a human body, usually one that could not develop normally, encased in the strongest materials available in that universe, and mentally connected to the controls of a spacecraft. Later novels link the brainship to fully functional humanoid androids.

However, as Franky did these adjustments to himself, only the front part of his body is cyborg. His backside (which he couldn't reach) is as vulnerable as any human back, rendering this his weak point. His cyborg abilities are powered by cola, stored in a refrigeration unit in Franky's stomach.
