Input / Output Scheduling or '''I/O Scheduling''' is a term used to describe the method [[computer]] [[operating system]]s decide the order that block [[Input/output|I/O]] operations will be submitted to [[Volume (computing)|storage volumes]]. I/O Scheduling is sometimes called 'disk scheduling'.

==Purpose==
I/O schedulers can have many purposes depending on the goal of the I/O scheduler, some common goals are:
* To minimize time wasted by [[hard disk]] seeks.
* To prioritize a certain [[process (computing)|processes]]' I/O requests.
* To give a share of the disk bandwidth to each running process.
* To guarantee that certain requests will be issued before a particular deadline.

==Implementation==
I/O Scheduling usually has to work with hard disks which share the property that there is long  
[[Access Time|access time]] for requests which are far away from the current position of the disk head (this operation is called a seek). To minimize the effect this has on system performance, most I/O schedulers implement a variant of the [[elevator algorithm]] which re-orders the incoming randomly ordered requests into the order in which they will be found on the disk.

==Common disk scheduling disciplines==
* [[Random Scheduling]] (RSS)
* First In, First Out ([[FIFO (computing)|FIFO]]), also known as First Come First Served (FCFS)
* Last In, First Out ([[LIFO (computing)|LIFO]])
* [[Shortest seek first]], also known as Shortest Seek / Service Time First (SSTF)
* [[Elevator algorithm]], also known as SCAN (including its variants, C-SCAN, LOOK, and C-LOOK)
* [[N-Step-SCAN]] SCAN of N records at a time
* [[FSCAN]], N-Step-SCAN where N equals queue size at start of the SCAN cycle.
* [[CFQ|Completely Fair Queuing (Linux)]]
* [[Anticipatory scheduling]]
* [[Noop scheduler]]
* [[Deadline scheduler]]
