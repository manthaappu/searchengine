:<math>\Phi_{12}(r) = A \exp \left(-Br\right) - \frac{C}{r^6}</math>

where <math>\Phi_{12}(r)</math> is the [[intermolecular pair potential]], <math>r = |\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2|</math>, and <math>A</math>, <math>B</math> and <math>C</math> are constants.

It is named for R. A. Buckingham,<ref>[http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspa.1938.0173 R. A. Buckingham "The Classical Equation of State of Gaseous Helium, Neon and Argon", Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences '''168''' pp. 264-283 (1938)]</ref> and not as is often thought for [[A. David Buckingham| David Buckingham]].

The Buckingham potential describes the repulsive [[exchange repulsion]] that originates from the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] by a more realistic exponential function of distance, in contrast to the inverse twelfth power used by the [[Lennard-Jones potential]]. However, since the Buckingham potential is finite even at very small distances, it runs the risk of an unphysical "Buckingham catastrophe" at short range when used in simulations of charged systems; this occurs when the electrostatic attraction artifactually overcomes the repulsive barrier. The [[Lennard-Jones potential]] is also quicker to compute, and is more frequently used in [[molecular dynamics]] and other simulations.
