'''Gregory Dominic Abowd''' is a [[computer scientist]] best known for his work in [[ubiquitous computing]], [[software engineering]], and technologies for [[autism]]. He is a distinguished [[professor]] at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], where he joined the faculty in 1994.  

==Biography==
===Personal life===
Gregory Abowd was born on September 12, 1964 and raised in [[Farmington Hills]], a suburb of [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. He graduated [[summa cum laude]] with a [[B.S.]] in Honors [[Mathematics]] from the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1986. He attended the [[University of Oxford]] in the [[United Kingdom]] as a [[Rhodes Scholar]], where he received his [[M.Sc.]] in 1987 and his [[D.Phil.]] in 1991, both in the field of [[Computation]].  He was a research associate from 1989 to 1992 at the [[University of York]] and a postdoctoral research associate from 1992 to 1994 at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. In 1994, he became a professor at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], where he remains today.<ref>[http://www.cc.gatech.edu/directory/gregory-abowd Georgia Tech Directory for Gregory Abowd]</ref> Abowd is married to Dr. Meghan Burke, and they have three children, Aidan, Blaise, and Mary Catherine. Two of Abowd's children have been diagnosed with [[autism]], which has been a primary inspiration for much of his technology and autism research agenda.

===Professional career===
Abowd's published work is primarily in the areas of [[Human-Computer Interaction]], [[ubiquitous computing|Ubiquitous Computing]], [[Software Engineering]], and [[Computer Supported Cooperative Work]].  He is particularly known for his work in ubiquitous computing, where he has made contributions in the areas of automated capture and access, [[context awareness|context-aware computing]], and [[home automation|smart home]] technologies.  Abowd's research primarily has an applications focus, where he has worked to develop systems for health care, education, the home, and individuals with [[autism]].

At Georgia Tech, he teaches in the [[Georgia Institute of Technology School of Interactive Computing|School of Interactive Computing]] in the [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Computing|College of Computing]]. He is a member of the [[GVU Center]] and directs the Ubiquitous Computing and Autism and Technology research groups. Abowd was the founding Director of the Aware Home Research Initiative and is Executive Director of the Health Systems Institute at Georgia Tech. In 2008, he founded the Atlanta Autism Consortium, a group of researchers interested in [[autism]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. He is one of the authors of ''Human-Computer Interaction'' (Prentice Hall), a popular human-computer interaction textbook.<ref>[http://www.hcibook.com/e3/ Human Computer Interaction - 3rd Edition]</ref>

Abowd's contributions to the fields of Human-Computer Interaction and Ubiquitous Computing have been recognized through his numerous awards and extensive published work. In 2008, he was named a Fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]], one of the top honors for computer science researchers.<ref>[http://fellows.acm.org/fellow_citation.cfm?id=N984112&srt=year&year=2008 2008 ACM Fellows]</ref> Within the field of Human-Computer Interaction, he has been recognized at the [[CHI (conference)|CHI Conference]], the most prestigious publication venue in HCI, as a top researcher through induction to the [[CHI Academy]] in 2008 and was awarded the Social Impact Award in 2007.<ref>[http://www.sigchi.org/documents/awards/awards-2008.html SIGCHI 2008 Awards]</ref><ref>[http://sigchi.org/documents/awards/awards-2007.html SIGCHI 2007 Awards]</ref> He is also one of the most prolific authors in computer science and in the field of Human-Computer Interaction.<ref>[http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/prolific/index.html DBLP Most Prolific Authors]</ref><ref>[http://hcibib.org/authors.html HCI Bibliography Most Frequent Authors]</ref>
