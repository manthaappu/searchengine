'''''Life and Energy''''' is one of [[Isaac Asimov]]'s most famous and popular [[science|scientific]] books. {{Fact|date=August 2007}}

''Life and Energy'' is about the [[biology|biological]] and [[physics|physical]] [[world]], and their contrasts and comparisons. The first chapters deal with the common questions of the distinctions between [[life|living]] and inanimate objects. Asimov then explains in a step by step manner about the physical world first through slow, but interesting chapters. He writes about the effect and major role of the [[evolution]] and advance of [[man]] by [[fire]] and heat, he tells about [[thermodynamics]] (and its laws), he recollects the thoughts of previous scientists, and their painstaking works, and finally, the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and [[radiation]], which has revolutionised physics and [[technology]]. An explanation of [[electricity]] and basic [[chemistry]] laws and features are also included.
The physical section ends here, and continues into biology. He now continues on with special chemistry, and leaves behind physics. From this, the book leads into the functions of [[enzyme]]s, [[amino acid]]s, [[biological cell|cells]], the body as a whole, and the process of the cells and [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s to work together to become one.
