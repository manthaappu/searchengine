<html> <head> <title>WMLScript</title></head><body>'''WMLScript''' is the dialect of '''[[JavaScript]]''' used for WML pages and is part of the [[Wireless Application Protocol]] (WAP).

WMLScript is a [[client-side scripting]] language and is very similar to JavaScript. Just like JavaScript WMLScript is used for tasks such as user input validation, generation of error message and other [[Dialog boxes]] etc.

WMLScript is based on '''[[ECMAScript]]''' (European Computer Manufacturers Association Script), which is JavaScript's standardized version. Thus the syntax of WMLScript is very similar to JavaScript. 

A major difference between JavaScript and WMLScript is that JavaScript code can be embedded in the [[HTML]] markup, whereas WMLScript code is always placed in a file separate from the WML markup. URLs are used to refer to the actual WMLScript code in the WML document.
