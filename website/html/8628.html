[[Cryptography]] is the practice and study of hiding [[information]]. There are many different '''cryptography laws in different nations'''. Some countries prohibit export of cryptography software and/or [[encryption algorithm]]s or [[cryptoanalysis]] methods. In some countries a license is required to use encryption software, and a few countries ban citizens from encrypting their internet communication. Some countries require decryption keys to be recoverable in case of a police investigation.
