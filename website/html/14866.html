<html> <head> <title>Gecos field</title></head><body>The '''gecos field''', or '''GECOS field''' is an entry in the [[/etc/passwd]] file on [[Unix]], and similar [[operating system]]s. 

It is typically used to record general information about the account or its user(s) such as their real name and phone number.

==Format==
The typical format for the GECOS field is a comma-delimited list<ref>[http://www.manpages.info/freebsd/passwd.5.html "man page" for the <tt>passwd</tt>-file, FreeBSD]</ref><ref>[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-aixuseradmin/index.html AIX at IBM]</ref>, with this order:
#User's [[full name]] (or application name, if the account is for a program)
#Building and room number or contact person
#Office [[telephone number]]
#Any other contact information ([[pager]] number, [[fax]], etc.)
In most UNIX systems this informations can be changed by normal users using the <tt> chfn </tt> command from the shell

==History==
Some early Unix systems at Bell Labs used [[General Comprehensive Operating System|GECOS]] machines for [[print spooling]] and various other services<ref>[http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/enterprise/RHEL-4-Manual/en-US/Introduction_To_System_Administration_/s3-acctsgrps-passwd.html#ftn.id2700936 Redhat.com]</ref>, so this field was added to carry information on a user's GECOS identity.
