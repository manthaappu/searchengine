<html> <head> <title>List of mathematical functions</title></head><body>In [[mathematics]], several [[function (mathematics)|function]]s or groups of functions are important enough to deserve their own names. This is a listing of pointers to those articles which explain these functions in more detail. There is a large theory of [[special functions]] which developed out of [[statistics]] and [[mathematical physics]]. A modern, abstract point of view contrasts large [[function space]]s, which are infinite-dimensional and within which most functions are 'anonymous', with special functions picked out by properties such as [[symmetry]], or relationship to [[harmonic analysis]] and [[group representation]]s.

==Elementary functions==
[[Elementary functions]] are functions built from basic operations (e.g. addition, exponentials, logarithms...)
