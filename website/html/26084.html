'''NetBSD''' is a freely available [[open source]] version of the [[Unix]]-derivative [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] (BSD) [[computer]] [[operating system]]. It was the second open source BSD descendant to be formally released, after [[386BSD]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/kirkmck.html|title=Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution|publisher=oreilly.com}}</ref> and continues to be actively developed. The NetBSD project is primarily focused on high quality design, stability and performance of the system.<ref name=netbsd-about>{{cite web|url=http://www.netbsd.org/about/|title=About the NetBSD Project}}</ref> Due to convenient license and portability, NetBSD is often used in [[embedded systems]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-netbsd.html|title=Get to know NetBSD: An operating system that travels|publisher=ibm.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=HLpTtLjEXqcC&lpg=PT291&pg=PT291|title=Embedded Hardware|isbn=9780750685849|author1=Ganssle, Jack G|author2=Noergaard, Tammy|author3=Eady, Fred|author4=Edwards, Lewin|author5=Katz, David J|date=2007-09-14}} pp. 291&ndash;292.</ref>

The current stable release of NetBSD is version '''5.1''' (November 19, 2010).

==History==
NetBSD was originally derived from the 4.3BSD release of the Berkeley Software Distribution from the [[Computer Systems Research Group]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], via their Net/2 [[source code]] release and the [[386BSD]] project. The NetBSD project began as a result of frustration within the 386BSD developer community with the pace and direction of the operating system's development.<ref name="netbsd-hist">{{cite web|url=http://www.netbsd.org/about/history.html|title=The History of the NetBSD Project|work=www.netbsd.org|publisher=The NetBSD Foundation|accessdate=29 November 2009}}</ref> The four founders of the NetBSD project, Chris Demetriou, [[Theo de Raadt]], Adam Glass and Charles Hannum, felt that a more open development model would be beneficial to the project: one which was centered on portable, clean, correct code. Their aim was to produce a unified, multi-platform, production-quality, BSD-based operating system. The name "NetBSD" was suggested by de Raadt, based on the importance and [[Internet#Growth|growth of networks]] such as the [[Internet]] at that time, and the distributed, collaborative nature of its development.<ref name=netbsd-about/>

The NetBSD source code repository was established on March 21, 1993 and the first official release, NetBSD 0.8, was made in April, 1993.<ref name="netbsd-0.8">{{cite newsgroup|url=http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/misc/release/NetBSD/NetBSD-0.8|title=So you say you want an interim release of 386bsd?|author=Chris G. Demetriou|date=1993-04-19|id=1qvpc9$1e8@agate.berkeley.edu|newsgroup=comp.os.386bsd.announce|accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> This was derived from 386BSD 0.1 plus the version 0.2.2 unofficial patchkit, with several programs from the Net/2 release missing from 386BSD re-integrated, and various other improvements.<ref name="netbsd-0.8"/> The first multi-platform release, NetBSD 1.0, was made in October 1994. Also in 1994, for disputed reasons, one of the founders, Theo de Raadt, left the project. He later founded a new project, [[OpenBSD]], from a forked version of NetBSD 1.0 near the end of 1995.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theos.com/deraadt/coremail.html |first=Theo |last=de Raadt |authorlink=Theo de Raadt |title=Archive of the mail conversation leading to Theo de Raadt's departure |date=March 29, 2009 |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}</ref>
In 1998, NetBSD 1.3 introduced the [[pkgsrc]] packages collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netbsd.org/docs/pkgsrc/introduction.html#supported-platforms|title=Platforms supported by pkgsrc|work=www.netbsd.org|publisher=The NetBSD Foundation|accessdate=10 January 2010}}</ref>

Until 2004, NetBSD 1.x releases were made at roughly annual intervals, with minor "patch" releases in between. From release 2.0 onwards, each major NetBSD release corresponds to an incremented major version number, i.e. the major releases following 2.0 are 3.0, 4.0 and so on. The previous minor releases are now divided into two categories: ''x.y'' "stable" maintenance releases and ''x.y.z'' releases containing only security and critical fixes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.netbsd.org/releases/release-map.html |title=NetBSD release glossary and graphs |date=January 13, 2010 |publisher=[[The NetBSD Project]] |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}</ref>

==Features==
===Portability===
As the project's motto (''"Of course it runs NetBSD"'' <ref name="netbsd-about"/>) suggests, NetBSD has been ported to a large number of [[32-bit|32-]] and [[64-bit]] [[computer architecture|architectures]]. These range from [[VAX]] [[minicomputers]] to [[Pocket PC]] [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDAs]]. As of 2009, NetBSD supports 57 hardware platforms (across 15 different processor architectures). Although the Linux 2.6 ''kernel'' includes support for more processor architectures,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kroah.com/log/linux/ols_2006_keynote.html|title=Myths, Lies, and Truths about the Linux kernel|last=Kroah-Hartman|first=Greg|date=July 23, 2006|accessdate=June 11, 2007}}</ref> the NetBSD distribution supports more platforms than any single [[Linux distribution]].{{fact|date=January 2011}} The kernel and [[Userland (computing)|userland]] for these platforms are all built from a central unified source-code tree managed by [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]]. Currently, unlike other kernels such as [[μClinux]], the NetBSD kernel requires the presence of an [[Memory management unit|MMU]] in any given target architecture.

NetBSD's portability is aided by the use of [[hardware abstraction layer]] interfaces for low-level hardware access such as [[bus (computing)|bus]] input/output or [[direct memory access|DMA]]. Using this portability layer, [[device driver]]s can be split into "machine-independent" and "machine-dependent" components. This allows a single driver to be easily used on several platforms by hiding details of exactly how the driver accesses the hardware, and reduces the amount of work needed to port it to a new architecture.<ref name="netbsd-port">{{cite web|url=http://netbsd.org/about/portability.html|title=Portability and supported hardware platforms|work=www.netbsd.org|publisher=The NetBSD Foundation|accessdate=29 November 2009}}</ref>

This enables, for instance, a driver for a specific [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] card to work whether that card is in a PCI slot on an [[IA-32]], [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]], [[PowerPC]], [[SPARC]], or other architecture with a PCI bus. Also, a single driver for a specific device can operate via several different buses, for example [[industry standard architecture|ISA]], PCI, [[PC card]], etcetera.

In comparison, [[Linux]] device driver code often needs to be reworked for every new architecture. As a consequence, in recent porting efforts by NetBSD and Linux developers, NetBSD has taken much less time to port to new hardware.<ref name="LINUX_OR_BSD"/>

This [[platform independence]] aids the development of [[embedded systems]], particularly since NetBSD 1.6, when the entire toolchain of [[compiler]]s, [[Assembly language#Assembler|assemblers]], [[Linker (computing)|linkers]], and other tools fully supported [[cross compiler|cross-compiling]].

In 2005, as a demonstration of NetBSD's portability and suitability for embedded applications, Technologic Systems, a vendor of embedded systems hardware, designed and demonstrated a NetBSD-powered kitchen [[toaster]].<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.embeddedarm.com/software/arm-netbsd-toaster.php|title=Technologic Systems Designs NetBSD Controlled Toaster|date=August 2005|accessdate=June 11, 2007}}</ref>

Commercial ports to embedded platforms, including the [[AMD Geode]] LX800, [[Freescale]] [[PowerQUICC]] processors, Marvell Orion, [[Applied Micro Circuits Corporation|AMCC]] [[PowerPC 400|405]] family of PowerPC processors, [[Intel]] [[XScale]] IOP and IXP series, were available from and supported by Wasabi Systems (defunct as of March, 2009<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.nifelheim.info/tech/2009/04/02/whats-up-with-wasabi-systems-inc/ |title=What’s up with Wasabi Systems Inc.? |work=Nifelheim Tech-Blog |first=Volkmar |last=Seifert |date=April 2, 2009 |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}</ref>).

===Portable build framework===
The NetBSD cross-compiling framework (also known as "build.sh" <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.netbsd.org/docs/guide/en/chap-build.html |title=Chapter 31. Crosscompiling NetBSD with build.sh |work=The NetBSD Guide |author=The NetBSD Foundation |date=January 10, 2010 |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}</ref>) allows a complete NetBSD system for an architecture to be built from another system of different architecture (usually faster or with more hardware resources), even on a different operating system, since the framework supports most [[POSIX]]-compliant systems. Several embedded systems using NetBSD have required no additional software development other than toolchain and target rehost.<ref name="LINUX_OR_BSD">{{cite web |url=http://wasabisystems.com/pdfs/Linux_or_BSD.pdf |title=BSD or Linux: Which Unix is better for embedded applications? |year=2003 |publisher=Wasabi Systems Inc. |format=PDF |accessdate=June 11, 2007 |archivedate=December 30, 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061230075423/http://www.wasabisystems.com/pdfs/Linux_or_BSD.pdf}}</ref>

===The pkgsrc packages collection===
NetBSD features ''[[pkgsrc]]'' (short for "package source"), a framework for building and managing third-party [[application software]] packages. The pkgsrc collection consists of more than 8100 packages as of {{As of|2009|alt=January 2009}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/netbsd-announce/2009/01/12/msg000052.html|title=The pkgsrc-2008Q4 Release}}</ref> Building and installing packages such as [[KDE]], [[GNOME]], the [[Apache HTTP server]] or [[Perl]] is performed through the use of a system of [[makefile]]s. This can automatically fetch the source code, unpack, patch, configure, build and install the package such that it can be removed again later. An alternative to compiling from source is to use a precompiled binary package. In either case, any prerequisites/dependencies will be installed automatically by the package system, without need for manual intervention.

pkgsrc supports not only the hardware platforms that run NetBSD, but also — with the help of an [[autoconf]]-based bootstrap system — several other [[Unix-like]] operating systems, such as [[Linux]], other BSD variants like [[FreeBSD]], [[Solaris Operating System|Solaris]], [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]/[[Mac OS X]], [[IRIX]], [[Interix]] and others. [[pkgsrc]] has also been adopted as the official package system for [[DragonFly BSD]].<ref>{{cite mailing list |url=http://leaf.dragonflybsd.org/mailarchive/users/2005-08/msg00347.html |title=PKGSRC will be officially supported as of the next release |first=Matthew |last=Dillon |mailinglist=DragonFly users List |date=August 31, 2005 |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}</ref>

===Symmetric multiprocessing===
NetBSD has had support for [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]] since the NetBSD 2.0 release in 2004,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netbsd.org/changes/2004.html#netbsd-2.0|title=NetBSD 2.0 release notes}}</ref> which was initially implemented using the [[giant lock]] approach. During the development cycle of the NetBSD 5 release, major work was done to improve SMP support; most of the kernel subsystems were modified to be [[MP safe]] and use the [[fine-grained locking]] approach. New [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronization primitives]] were implemented and [[scheduler activations]] was replaced with a [[Thread_(computer_science)#1:1|1:1 threading model]] in February 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.netbsd.org/changes/changes-5.0.html |title=Significant changes from NetBSD 4.0 to 5.0 |date=December 23, 2009 |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}</ref> A scalable M2 thread scheduler was implemented, though the old 4.4BSD scheduler still remains the default but was modified to scale with SMP. Threaded [[Interrupt|software interrupts]] were implemented to improve synchronization. The [[virtual memory]] system, [[Slab allocation|memory allocator]] and [[Trap (computing)|trap handling]] were made MP safe. The file system framework, including the [[Virtual file system|VFS]] and major [[file system]]s were modified to be MP safe. Since April, 2008 the only subsystems running with a giant lock are the [[Protocol (computing)|network protocols]] and most [[device driver]]s.

===Security===
NetBSD provides various features in the security area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?security+8+NetBSD-current|title=NetBSD security(8) manual page}}</ref> The Kernel Authorization framework<ref>{{cite web |url=http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?kauth+9+NetBSD-current |title=kauth(9) |work=NetBSD Manual Pages |date=August 10, 2009 |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}</ref> (or Kauth) is a subsystem managing all authorization requests inside the kernel, and used as system-wide security policy. It allows external modules to plug-in the authorization process. NetBSD also incorporates exploit mitigation features,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?paxctl+8+NetBSD-current|title=NetBSD paxctl(8) manual page}}</ref> ASLR, MPROTECT and Segvguard from [[PaX]] project, and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] [[Stack-smashing protection|Stack Smashing Protection]] (SSP, or also known as ProPolice, enabled by default since NetBSD 6.0) compiler extensions. [[Veriexec|Verified Executables]] (or Veriexec) is an in-kernel file integrity subsystem in NetBSD. It allows the user to set digital fingerprints (hashes) of files, and take a number of different actions if files do not match their fingerprints. For example, one can allow [[Perl]] to run only scripts that match their fingerprints.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netbsd.org/docs/guide/en/chap-veriexec.html|title=Chapter 19. NetBSD Veriexec subsystem}}</ref> The cryptographic device driver (CGD) allows using disks or partitions (including CDs and DVDs) for encrypted storage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netbsd.org/docs/guide/en/chap-cgd.html|title=Chapter 14. The cryptographic device driver (CGD)}}</ref>

===Virtualization===
The Xen [[Hypervisor|virtual-machine monitor]] is supported in NetBSD since the 3.0 release. To use Xen, the system requires a special pre-kernel boot environment that loads a specialized Xen kernel as the "host OS" (known as Dom0). Any number of "guest OS" (known as DomU) virtualized computers, with or without (using "hypervisor" options) specific Xen/DomU support, can be run in parallel with the appropriate hardware resources.

With NetBSD 5, which greatly improves disk I/O and network I/O performance over NetBSD 4, some guest Operating Systems running under Xen are known to operate faster than when installed natively on the same hardware without NetBSD and Xen behind the scenes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  The need for a boot manager, such as GRUB, was also eliminated with NetBSD 5's new built-in Xen-compatible configurable boot manager.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?boot++NetBSD-current |title=boot(8) |work=NetBSD Manual Pages |date=September 4, 2009 |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}</ref>

User-space [[Platform virtualization|virtualization]] such as [[VirtualBox]] and [[QEMU]] are also supported on NetBSD.

===Storage===
NetBSD includes many enterprise features like [[iSCSI]], a [[journaling filesystem]], [[logical volume management]] and the [[ZFS]] filesystem.

The WAPBL journalling filesystem, an extension of the BSD FFS filesystem, was contributed by Wasabi Systems in 2008.<ref>{{cite mailing list |url=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-kern/2008/03/02/msg000504.html |title=Patches for journalling support |first=Simon |last=Burge |date=March 2, 2008 |maillinglist=tech-kern@NetBSD.org |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}</ref>

The NetBSD Logical Volume Manager is based on a BSD reimplementation of a device-mapper driver and a port of the Linux [[Logical Volume Manager]] tools. It was mostly written during the [[Google Summer of Code]] 2008.<ref>{{cite mailing list |url=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-kern/2008/08/28/msg002554.html |title=HEADS UP NetBSD lvm support |first=Adam |last=Hamsik |date=August 29, 2008 |maillinglist=tech-kern@NetBSD.org |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}</ref>

The [[ZFS]] filesystem developed by [[Sun Microsystems]] was imported in to the NetBSD base system in 2009. Currently, the NetBSD ZFS port is based on ZFS version 13.

===Compatibility with other operating systems===
At the source code level, NetBSD is very nearly entirely compliant with [[POSIX]].1 (IEEE 1003.1-1990) standard and mostly compliant with POSIX.2 (IEEE 1003.2-1992).

NetBSD also provides [[system call]]-level binary compatibility on the appropriate processor architectures with several UNIX-derived and UNIX-like operating systems, including [[Linux]], other BSD variants like [[FreeBSD]], Apple's [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]], [[Solaris Operating System|Solaris]] and [[SunOS]] 4. This allows NetBSD users to run many applications that are only distributed in binary form for other operating systems, usually with no significant loss of performance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.netbsd.org/docs/compat.html |title=NetBSD Binary Emulation |date=January 13, 2010 |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}</ref>

A variety of "foreign" disk [[filesystem]] formats are also supported in NetBSD, including [[File Allocation Table|FAT]], [[NTFS]], Linux [[ext2fs]], [[Mac OS X]] [[Unix File System|UFS]], [[RISC OS]] FileCore/ADFS, [[AmigaOS]] [[Amiga Fast File System|Fast File System]], [[IRIX]] [[Extent File System|EFS]] and many more through [[Filesystem in Userspace|FUSE]].

==Licensing==
All of the NetBSD kernel and most of the core userland source code is released under the terms of the [[BSD licenses|BSD License]] (two, three, and four-clause variants). This essentially allows everyone to use, modify, redistribute or sell it as they wish, as long as they do not remove the copyright notice and license text (the four-clause variants also include terms relating to publicity material). Thus, the development of products based on NetBSD is possible without having to make modifications to the source code public. In contrast, the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] stipulates that changes to source code of a product must be released to the product recipient when products derived from those changes are released.

On June 20, 2008, the NetBSD Foundation announced a transition to the two clause BSD license, citing concerns with UCB support of clause 3 and industry applicability of clause 4.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.netbsd.org/about/redistribution.html#why2clause|title=NetBSD Licensing and Redistribution|date=June 2008|accessdate=June 20, 2008}}</ref>

NetBSD also includes the [[GNU]] development tools and other packages, which are covered by the GPL and other open source licenses.  As is the case for the other [[BSD#Significant_BSD_descendants|BSD]] projects, NetBSD separates those in its base source tree, in order to make removal of code under more restrictive licenses easier.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}<!-- need a source giving the policy itself --> As for packages, the installed software licenses may be controlled by modifying the list of allowed licenses in the pkgsrc configuration file (<code>mk.conf</code>).

==Logo==
The NetBSD "flag" logo, designed by Grant Bissett, was introduced in 2004 and is an abstraction of their older logo<ref>[http://www.netbsd.org/images/NetBSD-old.jpg Old NetBSD logo]</ref>, designed by Shawn Mueller in 1994. This was based on the famous [[World War II]] photograph [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]], which some perceived as culturally sensitive and inappropriate for an international project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/netbsd-advocacy/2004/01/14/0001.html|title=NetBSD logo design competition}}</ref>

==The NetBSD Foundation==
The NetBSD Foundation is the legal entity that owns the intellectual property and trademarks associated with NetBSD,<ref>[http://www.netbsd.org/foundation/ The NetBSD Foundation, Inc.]</ref> and on January 22, 2004, became a [[501(c)#501.28c.29.283.29|501(c)3]] tax-exempt non-profit organization. The members of the foundation are developers who have CVS commit access.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.netbsd.org/people/developers.html |title=NetBSD Developers |date=January 7, 2010 |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}</ref> The NetBSD Foundation has a Board of Directors, elected by the voting of members for two years.

==Examples of use==
[[Image:ISS on 20 August 2001.jpg|thumb|NetBSD was used in [[NASA]]'s [[SAMS-II Project]] of measuring the microgravity environment on the [[International Space Station]], and for investigations of [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] for use in [[satellite]] networks.]]

NetBSD's clean design, high performance, scalability, and support for many architectures has led to its use in embedded devices and servers, especially in networking applications.<ref name="f10"/>

A commercial [[real-time operating system]], [[QNX]], uses a network stack which is based on NetBSD code <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qnx.com/legal/licensing/dev_license/eula/tposltg1_01.html#BSD2|title=Third Party Open Source License Terms Guide|publisher=qnx.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.qnx.com/sf/docman/do/downloadDocument/projects.networking/docman.root/doc1280?logged=1|title=Core Networking 6.4: Neutrino's Next Gen Networking Stack and Foundry27|format=PDF}}</ref>, and provides various drivers ported from NetBSD.<ref name="f10">{{cite web|url=http://community.qnx.com/sf/wiki/do/viewPage/projects.networking/wiki/Drivers_wiki_page|title=Foundry27: Project Networking - Driver wiki page}}</ref>

[[Force10|Force10 Networks]] uses NetBSD as the underlying operating system that powers FTOS (the Force10 Operating System), which is used in high scalability switch/routers.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.force10networks.com/news/pressreleases/2007/pr-2007-02-13.asp|title=Force10 Networks uses NetBSD to build software scalability into operating system}}</ref> Force10 also made a donation to the NetBSD Foundation in 2007 to help further research and the open development community.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.force10networks.com/news/pressreleases/2008/pr-2008-01-28b.asp|title=Force10 Networks introduces unified operating system across product portfolio to lower total cost of owning and operating networks}}</ref>

[[Wasabi Systems]] provides a commercial Wasabi Certified BSD product based on NetBSD with proprietary enterprise features and extensions, which are focused on embedded, server and storage applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wasabisystems.com/docs/WasabiCertifiedBSD.pdf|title=Wasabi Certified BSD}}</ref>

NetBSD was used in [[NASA]]'s [[SAMS-II Project]] of measuring the microgravity environment on the [[International Space Station]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-i386/1997/12/04/0022.html|title=Re: NetBSD/i386 and single board computers}}</ref>, and for investigations of [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] for use in [[satellite]] networks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://roland.grc.nasa.gov/~jgriner/papers/nash98.pdf|title=HTTP Page Transfer Rates over Geo-Stationary Satellite Links}}</ref>

In 2004, [[SUNET]] used NetBSD to set the [[Internet2]] Land Speed Record. NetBSD was chosen "due to the scalability of the TCP code".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://proj.sunet.se/LSR2/|title=SUNET Internet2 Land Speed Record: 69.073 Pbmps}}</ref>

NetBSD is also used in [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[Airport Extreme]] and [[Time Capsule (Apple)|Time Capsule]] products, instead of their own [[Mac OS X]] (which uses FreeBSD's userland) platform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://superuser.com/questions/23816/how-to-jailbreak-an-apple-time-capsule|title=How to jailbreak an Apple Time Capsule?|work=superuser.com|accessdate=27 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wifinetnews.com/archives/2007/02/airport_extreme_apple_breaks_90_mbps.html|title=AirPort Extreme: Apple Breaks 90 Mbps|last=Fleishman|first=Glenn|date=February 16, 2007|work=wifinetnews.com|accessdate=28 December 2009}}</ref>

The operating system of the [[T-Mobile Sidekick]] LX 2009 [[smartphone]] is based on NetBSD.<ref name="sidekick">{{cite web|url=http://www.hiptop3.com/archives/sidekick-lx-2009-blade-will-run-netbsd/|title=Sidekick LX 2009 / Blade Will Run NetBSD|date=January 30, 2009|work=www.hiptop3.com|accessdate=February 5, 2009}}</ref>

==Hosting==
Hosting for the project is provided primarily by the [[Internet Systems Consortium]] Inc, the [[Luleå University of Technology]], [[Columbia University]], and [[Western Washington University]]. Mirrors for the project are spread around the world and provided by volunteers and supporters of the project.
