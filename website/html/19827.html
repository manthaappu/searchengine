'''Jean Paul Frédéric Serra''' (born 1940 in [[Algeria]]) is a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]] and [[engineer]], and known as one of the co-founders (together with [[Georges Matheron]]) of [[mathematical morphology]].

==Biography==
===Education===
Serra received a scientific [[baccalauréat]] in 1957, and an [[engineering]] [[academic degree|degree]] from the [[École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Nancy]] in 1962. He also obtained a [[Bachelor]] degree in [[philosophy]]/[[psychology]], from the [[University of Nancy]], in 1965. He obtained a [[PhD]] in [[Mathematical Geology]] from the University of Nancy in 1967, and a ''[[doctorat]] d'etat'' in [[Mathematics]], from the [[Pierre and Marie Curie University]], [[Paris]], in 1986. He speaks [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[English language|English]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

===Mathematical morphology===
From 1962 to 1966, while a research engineer at the ''[[Institut de recherche de la sidérurgie]]'', France, Serra was a PhD student under the supervision of [[Georges Matheron]]. The subject of his [[thesis]] was "[[stochastic]] [[Geologic modelling|modeling]] of the [[iron]] [[Deposition (geology)|deposit]] of [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]], at various scales," one of the goals of which was to quantify [[petrographic]] characteristics of its iron [[ore]]body. During that period, Serra came up with the idea of using [[structuring element]]s for transforming images of [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]]s of the ore, in order to gain information about it. The result was a device called "Texture Analyser", which was [[patent]]ed in 1965. This work also lead to the concept of [[hit-or-miss transform]], which evolved into the concepts of [[erosion (morphology)|erosion]], [[dilation (morphology)|dilation]], [[opening (morphology)|opening]] and [[closing (morphology)|closing]] due to Matheron. [[Granulometry (morphology)|Granulometry]] and other concepts followed. In the Winter of 1966, in a pub of Nancy,<ref>"Appendix A: The 'centre de morphologie mathematique': An overview" by Jean Serra, in ([[#serra94|Serra and Soille (Eds.) 1994]]).</ref> Matheron, [[Philippe Formery]], and Serra decided to give a name to this body of works: "Mathematical morphology". The new theory and method has since evolved to be applied in a variety of [[image processing]] problems and tasks, and is researched worldwide<ref>See, e.g., ([[#banon07|Banon, Barrera, and Braga-Neto (Eds.) 2007]])</ref> (''main article: [[Mathematical morphology]]'').

In 1968, the [[Centre of Mathematical Morphology]] (CMM) of the [[École des Mines de Paris]] was created (after 1979, it was called ''Centre of Geostatistics and Mathematical Morphology''). Matheron was named director, and Serra was hired as master of research ("Maître de Recherches") and [[assistant director]].  In 1986, upon the split of the ''Centre of Geostatistics and Mathematical Morphology'' into two separate centers, Serra became director of research ("Directeur de Recherches") and the director of the new CMM.

Serra has continued to contribute to mathematical morphology over the years; In fact, some of the most important theoretical developments are due to him:
* Generalization of mathematical morphology to [[complete lattice]]s
* Theory for [[morphological filtering]], with Matheron
* [[Connection (morphology)|Connections]]
