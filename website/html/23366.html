<html> <head> <title>Management system</title></head><body>A '''management system''' is the framework of [[business process|processes]] and [[procedure]]s used to ensure that an [[organization]] can fulfill all tasks required to achieve its objectives.

For instance, an environmental management system enables organizations to improve their environmental performance through a process of continuous improvement. An oversimplification is "[[PDCA|Plan, Do, Check, Act]]". A more complete system would include accountability (an assignment of personal responsibility) and a schedule for activities to be completed, as well as auditing tools to implement corrective actions in addition to scheduled activities, creating an upward spiral of continuous improvement.

Also as in the aforementioned management system, an occupational health and safety management system (OHSMS) enables an organization to control its occupational health and safety risks and to improve its performance by means of continuous improvement.

Examples of management system standards include:
* ISO 9001 Quality Management,
* ISO 14001 Environmental Management,
* ISO/IEC 27001 Information Security Management,
* SA8000 Social Accountability.
