'''PCLinuxOS''', often shortened to '''PCLOS''', is a [[GNU/Linux distribution]], with [[KDE Plasma Desktop]] as its default user interface. It is a primarily [[free software]] [[operating system]] for personal computers aimed at ease of use. It is partially considered as a [[rolling release]].

==History==
{{Confusing|date=November 2009}}
The precursor to PCLinuxOS was a set of [[RPM Package Manager|RPM packages]] created to improve successive versions of Mandrake Linux (now [[Mandriva Linux]]). These packages were created by Bill Reynolds, a packager better known as ''Texstar''.<ref>{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2007-07-03 }}</ref> From 2000 to 2003, Texstar maintained his repository of RPM packages in parallel with the [http://www.pclinuxonline.com/ PCLinuxOnline] site. In an interview, Reynolds said he started PCLinuxOS "to provide an outlet for [his] crazy desire to package [[source code]] without having to deal with egos, arrogance and politics."<ref name="Linuxblog">{{cite web|url=http://linux-blog.org/index.php?/archives/91-Experiment-Interview-with-Texstar-of-PCLinuxOS.html|title=Experiment: Interview with Texstar of PCLinuxOS - Yet Another Linux Blog|date=8 June 2005|publisher=linux-blog.org|accessdate=2007-07-03}}</ref>

In October 2003, Texstar created a [[Fork (software)|fork]] of Mandrake Linux 9.2. Working closely with [http://livecd.berlios.de/ The Live CD Project], Texstar has since developed that fork independently into a full-fledged distribution. The initial releases were successively numbered as "previews": p5, p7, p8 up to p81a, then p9, p91, p92, and p93.

==Release history==
Almost all{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} major releases have been accompanied by new boot-up and login screens, along with some changes in icon sets, and login sounds.

===PCLinuxOS 2007===

With the advent of PCLinuxOS 2007, PCLinuxOS was rebased on Mandriva Linux 2007. This implied a shift to a more modern code, which required a complete reinstall to this version. The new version featured a new look, and built-in 3D effects. A new logo was also designed for the new version, and was incorporated into the boot screen. A new login screen was designed, entitled "Dark". The final/official PCLinuxOS 2007 version was released on 2007-05-21.

===PCLinuxOS 2009===

The last version of the main Live CD, PCLinuxOS 2009.2, was released on June 30, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://distrowatch.com/?newsid=05560|title=Distribution Release: PCLinuxOS 2009.2|date=2009-06-30|accessdate=2009-07-31}}</ref> Improvements include bug fixes, new backgrounds, sounds, start-up screen, and quicker start-up times. It will be the last PCLinuxOS live CD to ship with [[K Desktop Environment 3]], and the last of the PCLinuxOS 2007 backward compatible series.

Remasters of PCLinuxOS, featuring the Xfce (Phoenix), LXDE (PCLinuxOS-LXDE), and Gnome (PCLinuxOS-Gnome) desktops were also made available.

===PCLinuxOS 2010===

The 2010 version of the Live CD was released on April 19, 2010<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxcritic.com/pclinuxos-2010-review/|title=Distribution Review: PCLinuxOS 2010}}</ref>. It includes the new KDE SC 4.4.2, a new graphical theme and a new version of the Linux Kernel (Kernel 2.6.32.11). It is also the first PCLinuxOS Live CD to include the ext4 file system support. This version requires a complete reinstall of the operating system.

While a version of PCLinuxOS that features the [[GNOME]] desktop environment was introduced in 2008, the 2010 version is the first one to not only offer the [[KDE]] and [[GNOME]] versions, but also versions with [[Xfce]], [[LXDE]], [[Enlightenment (window manager)|Enlightenment]], and [[Openbox]].

Version 2010.1 was released on May 5, 2010. Changes made since last version: the Kernel has been updated to version 2.6.32.12-bfs. [[KDE Plasma Desktop]] has been upgraded to version 4.4.3. Support has been added for Realtek RTL8191SE/RTL8192SE WiFi cards and Microdia webcams. Vim console text editor and udftools has been added. Fixed cdrom ejection when using the Copy to Ram feature.  Fixed kde new widget download. Updated Nvidia (195.36.24) and Ati fglrx (8.723) drivers. Updated all supporting applications and libraries from the software repository which include security updates and bug fixes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pclinuxos.com/?p=605|title=PCLinuxOS 2010.1 KDE 4 Edition}}</ref>

==Features==
=== Summary===

PCLinuxOS is distributed as a [[Live CD]], which can also be installed to a local [[hard disk drive]] or [[USB flash drive]]. Version 2009.1 provides a USB installer to create a [[Live USB]], where the user's configuration and personal data can be saved if desired.  A live USB of older versions of PCLinuxOS can be created manually or with [[UNetbootin]] <ref>[http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/ UNetbootin - Homepage and Downloads] Retrieved on 2009-5-1</ref>. The entire CD can be run from memory, assuming the system has sufficient RAM. PCLinuxOS uses [[APT-RPM]], based on [[Advanced Packaging Tool]] (or APT), a [[package management system]] (originally from the [[Debian]] distribution), together with [[Synaptic Package Manager]], a [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] front-end to APT, in order to add, remove or update [[package]]s. If there is enough memory on the machine, and an active network connection, the Live CD can update packages. PCLinuxOS is also designed to be easy to [[Software remastering|remaster]] after installation, creating one's own personalized Live CD, using the [[mklivecd]] tool.

==Mandriva Linux==

Although it retains a similar "look and feel" to Mandriva Linux, PCLinuxOS has diverged significantly. The code was officially forked from Mandrake 9.2 into an independent project in 2003. After three years of continuous development, the developers took advantage of further development in (the renamed) Mandriva, and forked the code again late in 2006 for PCLinuxOS 2007.

PCLinuxOS maintains its own software repository, available via the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) and its Synaptic front-end, completely replacing Mandriva's [[urpmi]]. This means that an installation could be continuously updated to the latest versions of packages, hence forgoing the need to re-install the entire distribution upon each successive release. In the releases before 2007, it was sometimes necessary to perform a re-installation.

Other differences include its own menu arrangement, custom graphics, and icon sets.

PCLinuxOS places specific emphasis on [[desktop computer|desktop computing]], concentrating its efforts for home or small business environments, hence paying less attention to other more "traditional" uses, like servers, although packages for most server tasks are available.

==Projects==

There are several community projects associated with PCLinuxOS.

===MiniMe===
MiniMe is a minimal [[Live CD|"Live & Install" CD]] for experienced users wishing to add their own selection of packages. PCLinuxOS 2008 "MiniMe" edition was released on 2008-01-07.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pclinuxos.com/index.php?option=com_smf&Itemid=58&topic=38535.0|title=PCLinuxOS MiniMe 2008 Released|date=2008-01-07|accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref>

===PCLinuxOS Magazine===
The [http://www.pclosmag.com/html/enter.html PCLinuxOS Magazine project] is a community driven free publication focused on the users of PCLinuxOS by [http://www.mypclinuxos.com/ MyPCLinuxOS]. PCLinuxOS Magazine is published on a monthly basis. All content for the publication is solicited from the PCLinuxOS user base.

===Third-party distributions===

Since PCLinuxOS includes the [[mklivecd]] script, there are several third-party distributions based on PCLinuxOS:

* [[Karoshi (operating system)|Karoshi]]
* [http://www.bugnux.org BugnuX] - Based on a development version of Enlightenment
* [http://belproject.org?title=Main_Page BEL Project]
* [http://zen.pclinuxos.org.pl/ ZEN-mini Gnome]
