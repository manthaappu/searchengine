'''Network emulation''' is a technique where the properties of an existing, planned and/or non-ideal [[telecommunications network|network]] are simulated in order to assess performance, predict the impact of change, or otherwise optimize technology decision-making.

==Methods of emulation==
Network [[Emulator|emulation]] can be accomplished by introducing a device on the [[LAN]] that alters packet flow in a way that imitates the behavior of application traffic in the environment being emulated. This device may be either a general-purpose computer running [[computer software|software]] to perform the network emulation or a [[emulator|dedicated emulation device]]. The device incorporates a variety of network attributes into its emulation model â€“ including the round-trip time across the network ([[Lag|latency]]), the amount of available [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], a given degree of [[packet loss]], duplication of packets, reordering packets, and/or the severity of network [[jitter]].  Desktop PCs can be connected to the emulated environment, so that users can experience the performance and behavior of applications in that environment first-hand.  Similarly, phones can be connected to the emulated environment so that users can directly assess [[Voice over IP|VoIP]] call quality for themselves.

==Emulation, simulation and traffic generation==
Emulation differs from [[simulation]] in that a network emulator appears to ''be'' a network; end-systems such as [[computer]]s can be attached to the emulator and will behave as if they are attached to a network.  Network simulators are typically programs which run on a single computer, take an abstract description of the network traffic (such as a flow arrival process) and yield performance statistics (such as buffer occupancy as a function of time).

A network emulator emulates the network which connects end-systems, not the end-systems themselves.  Systems which emulate the end-systems are called [[traffic generator]]s.
