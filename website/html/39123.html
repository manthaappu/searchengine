The software program '''VICE''', standing for '''''V'''ersat'''I'''le '''C'''ommodore '''E'''mulator'', is an [[emulator]] for [[Commodore International|Commodore]]'s [[8-bit]] computers, running on [[Amiga]], [[Unix]], [[MS-DOS]], [[Win32]], [[Mac OS X]], [[OS/2]], Acorn [[RISC OS]], and [[BeOS]] host machines. VICE is [[free software]], released under the [[GNU General Public Licence]].

As of 2004, VICE was one of the most widely-used emulators of the Commodore 8-bit microcomputers.<ref>Carless, p. 5</ref> It is also one of the few usable Commodore emulators to exist on free *NIX platforms, and one of the first to be distributed under GNU GPL. It is available for most Linux distributions.

As of version 2.1, released December 19, 2008, VICE emulates the [[Commodore 64]], the [[Commodore 128|C128]], the [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]], the [[Commodore Plus/4|Plus/4]], the [[C64 Direct-to-TV]] (with its additional video modes) and all the [[Commodore PET|PET]] models including the [[Commodore CBM-II|CBM-II]] but excluding the 'non-standard' features of the SuperPET 9000. VICE for [[Microsoft Windows]] (Win32) is known as '''WinVICE''', the OS/2 variant is called Vice/2, and the emulator running on BeOS is called BeVICE. WinVICE supports digital [[joystick]]s via a [[parallel port]] [[device driver|driver]], and, with a [[CatWeasel]] [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] card, is planned to perform hardware [[MOS Technology SID|SID]] playback (requires optional SID [[Integrated circuit|chip]] installed in socket).
