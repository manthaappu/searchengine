'''''TinkerPlots''''' is [[exploratory data analysis]] software designed for use by students in grades 4-8. It was designed by [[Clifford Konold]] and [[Craig Miller]] at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] and is published by [[Key Curriculum Press]].  It has some similarities with [[Fathom (software)|Fathom]], and runs on [[Windows 98]] or later and [[Mac OS 10.1]] or later. The program allows users to enter their own [[data]] or to import them from other applications or [[the Web]].  The program also comes with 40 [[multivariate]] data sets.  

Using TinkerPlots, students can make a large variety of [[graphics|graphs]], including those specified for middle school in [[NCTM]]’s [[Principles and Standards for School Mathematics]].  But rather than making these graphs directly using commands, students construct them by progressively organizing cases using basic operations including “stack,” “order,” and “separate.”  Responding to these operations, case icons animate into different screen positions.  The interface was based on observations of people organizing “data cards” on a table to make graphs to answer specific questions <ref>Harradine, A., & Konold, C. (2006).

Innovations of TinkerPlots include using a superimposed color gradient<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Konold | first1 = C. | year = 2002 | title = Teaching concepts rather than conventions | url = | journal = New England Journal of Mathematics | volume = 34 | issue = 2| pages = 69–81 }}</ref> to detect [[covariation]] in two numeric attributes  and a “hat plot,”<ref>Konold, C.
