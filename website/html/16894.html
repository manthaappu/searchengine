[[Homelessness]] in Canada has grown in size and complexity in recent years.<ref>Gaetz, S., Tarasuk, V., Dackner, N., Kirkpatrick, S.

Canadian Review of Social Policy, 58(43), 1-19.</ref> While historically known as a crisis only of urban centres such as Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, and Montreal, the increasing incidence of homelessness in the suburbs is necessitating new services and resources.<ref name="chumirethicsfoundation.ca">Laird, Gordon (2007).

[http://www.chumirethicsfoundation.ca/files/pdf/SHELTER.pdf]</ref> 

The demographic profile of Canada's homeless population is also changing. While in the past men used to comprise the vast majority of homeless persons, now women and children represent the fastest growing subgroup of the homeless population, followed by youth.<ref name="cprn.org">Hulchanski, J.D. (2009). Conference keynote address, Growing Home: Housing and Homelessness in Canada. University of Calgary, February 18, 2009 [http://www.cprn.org/documents/51110_EN.pdf]</ref> In recent years homelessness has become a major political issue in Canada.

==Definition==
The lack of a consistent definition of homelessness is a contentious issue, however most research and programs focus on "absolute homelessness"<ref name="Frankish, C. 2005">Frankish, C., Hwang, S., & Quantz, D. (2005). Homelessness and health in Canada: Research lessons and priorities. Canadian Journal of Public Health, 96(2)</ref> and public policy initiatives.<ref name="Frankish, C. 2005"/>

==Scope==
While counting the homeless is a politically charged and methodologically contentious issue, the federal estimate of the number of homeless people in Canada was 150,000 in 2005, or about 0.5 per cent of the population. Homeless advocates estimated it to be closer to 300,000.<ref name="chumirethicsfoundation.ca"/>  Based on the more conservative figure, the annual cost of homelessness in Canada in 2007 was approximately $4.5 to $6 billion in emergency services, community organizations, and non-profits.<ref>Laird, Gordon (2007). "Shelter-Homelessness in a growth economy: Canada's 21st century paradox." A Report for the Sheldon Chumir Foundation for Ethics in Leadership as reported at the Teapots/OCAP Seminar on Homelessness. [http://www.chumirethicsfoundation.ca/files/pdf/SHELTER.pdf]</ref>

==Myths==
There are many myths about "the homeless."

Contrary to popular stereotypes, only a small proportion, about 6% in Toronto, of the homeless population suffers from schizophrenia.<ref name="Frankish, C. 2005"/> Much more common are [[Affective spectrum|affective disorders]], self-reported by 20-40% of Toronto's homeless.<ref name="Frankish, C. 2005"/>  According to Toronto's Street Health Report in 2007, one in ten homeless people reports attempted suicide in the past year.<ref>The Street Health Report 2007: Highlights and Action Plan. Toronto. [www.streethealth.ca]</ref>

Homelessness is actually a chronic problem for only a small minority of people, the vast majority of individuals are "one-time only" shelter users or experience episodic homelessness. However, the distinctly different subgroup of individuals who are "chronically homeless"  consume about half of shelter beds and available resources at any given time.<ref name="chumirethicsfoundation.ca"/>

Many of "the homeless" who make use of homeless shelters are also employed.<ref>Housing Works: A Special Report 2007. Giving voice to the crisis [www.endhomelessnessottawa.ca]</ref> Individuals and families are simply priced out of private housing markets. In 2000, about 22% or 2.5 million Canadian households fell below the minimum amount required to afford a basic home, gauged at $25, 920. Five years later, this number rose to 26% or 3.2 million households.<ref>Shapcott, M. (2008). New income numbers confirm growing income inequality; One-in-four Canadian households below fair housing income; New figures underline urgent need for national housing strategy. Wellesley Institute Backgrounder: Growing Income Inequality.</ref>

While some of the "homeless" do perish in the extreme cold of Canadian winters, more die due the extreme heat in summers.<ref>Gulliver, T. (2008). York MES Student coordinates first heat registry program [http://www.yorku.ca/yfile/archive/index.asp?Article=10875]</ref> The first heat registry system in North America was set up in Toronto's west end to address this problem in the summer of 2008. 

Another common misunderstanding surrounds the homeless who prefer not to use the shelter system.  In addition to rules and regulations, shelter users must accept crowded shelter conditions, which carry a high likelihood of TB exposure in inadequately ventilated room, along with risks of bedbugs, scabies, and lice infestations.<ref name="Frankish, C. 2005"/>

==History==

While in Canada there has always been a certain portion of the population that was very poor, it is not until recently, after the 1980s, that "homeless" has come to mean the "unhoused" versus those simply living in poor quality housing.<ref name="cprn.org"/> Previously, the "homeless" was a general term applied mostly to transient men with no family ties, such as the migrant workers who travelled by [[freight hopping]] during the Great Depression.<ref name="cprn.org"/>  

Homelessness remained a minor concern as extremely cheap accommodation was available in '[[skid row]]' rooming houses or flophouses located in the poorest parts of most major cities. Even the most destitute could find some form of housing, even if its quality was abysmal. 

At the end of the Second World War in 1946, the federal government created the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) to make mortgages and home ownership more accessible to people and organizations.<ref name="chumirethicsfoundation.ca"/> The surplus generated by the CMHC was used in the 1980s to fund non-profit, Aboriginal, and rent supplement housing. 

However, following changes to Canada's National Housing Act housing act in 1996 to give the CMHC "more flexibility", it was able to directly fund social housing and its role in supporting new and existing affordable housing diminished.<ref name="United Nations 2009">United Nations (2009). Report of the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, Miloon Kothari. Based on Mission to Canada 9â€“22 October 2007.</ref> Today the CMHC still exists, and its annual surpluses ($7.6 billion in 2006) raises questions as to why some of this money cannot be spent on new housing initiatives.<ref>Shapcott, M. (September 2006). Executive Summary from "Blueprint to End Homelessness in Toronto. Wellesley Institute (p.7).</ref> 

About 20,000 social housing units were created every year following the 1973 amendments to the National Housing Act.<ref name="cprn.org"/> Starting in the mid 1980s, the federal government initiated a series of cuts in funding for national housing programs.<ref name="United Nations 2009"/> While accurate statistics on the homeless population are hard to gather, it is the general consensus that the number of homeless increased considerably beginning in the 1980s. 

Despite Canada's economy this trend continued, and perhaps even accelerated in the 1990s. In [[Toronto]], for instance, admissions to homeless shelters increase by 75% between 1988 and 1998<ref>[http://www.toronto.ca/homelessness/index.htm  2000 Report Card on Homelessness, City of Toronto]</ref> After 1993 the national affordable housing program initiated in 1973 was cut and Canada's focus in addressing homelessness in the 1990s was to create more homeless shelters and emergency services<ref name="chumirethicsfoundation.ca"/> A decade later, in 2003, the federal government resumed spending on housing investment at $2.03 billion, a 25% decline from 1993 levels of $1.98 billion when adjusted for inflation.<ref>Laird, Gordon (2007). "Shelter-Homelessness in a growth economy: Canada's 21st century paradox." A Report for the Sheldon Chumir Foundation for Ethics in Leadership, p.15. [http://www.chumirethicsfoundation.ca/files/pdf/SHELTER.pdf]</ref>

==Causes==
Why people become homeless is a complex question and the answers are as unique as each individual person's history. People become homeless by many different paths how ever the most common reason are "inability to pay rent (53%) conflict or abuse (26%)alchol or drug use problems(8%)(http://www.endhomelessnessottawa.ca/homeless-to-home/homeless-to-home.cfm), other factors can include mental disorders, foster care exits, exiting from jail or hospitalization, immigration, rising housing costs and decreased rent controls, federal and provincial downloading of housing programs, and low social assistance rates.<ref name="cprn.org"/> 

While the causes are complex, the solutions to homelessness may be simple: "Homelessness may not be only a housing problem, but it is always a housing problem; housing is necessary, although sometimes not sufficient, to solve the problem of homelessness."<ref>Cushing N. Dolbeare, 1996, "Housing Policy: A General Consideration," in Homelessness in America, 1996, p, 34</ref>

===Lack of low income housing===
[[Image:Toronto homeless lady.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A homeless Toronto woman sits on a park bench]] 
While in 1986 30,000 new low income housing units had been built across Canada this had fallen to 7,000 in 1999. In the city of Calgary, with one of the most acute housing shortages, only 16 new units of rental housing were built in 1996.

===Deinstitutionalization===
[[Image:Homeless in Toronto.jpg|thumb|275px||A homeless man sleeps on the [[Toronto Transit Commission|TTC subway]].]] 
{{main|Deinstitutionalization}}

The 1960s and 1970s also saw an international movement towards deinstitutionalization of the [[mentally ill]], moving them out of [[History of psychiatric institutions|asylums]] and other facilities, and releasing them into the community. Studies found that the vast majority of those who had been placed in asylums could be healthy and productive members of society if placed in the community and provided with the proper care and medication. 

Thus over these decades the number of people confined to mental institutions fell dramatically from just under 70,000 to about 20,000. However, while great savings were made by shutting down empty institutions much of this money was absorbed by general government funds, and did not make it into community care. 

No assurances were made that those discharged had access and were taking the medication they needed. While some of those discharged did integrate with the community, a significant number estimated at around 75% did not. Many of these individuals became homeless. Today up to 40% of homeless have some sort of mental illness.<ref>Murphy, Barbara. ''On the Street: How We Created the Homeless.'' Winnipeg: J. Gordon Shillingford, c2000.</ref>

===Poverty in Canada===
{{main|Poverty in Canada}}

Poverty in Canada remains prevalent with certain groups in Canada.  The measurement of poverty has been a challenge as there is no official government measure. Some groups, like the Canadian Council on Social Development and the National Anti-Poverty Organization, believe the low-income cut off published by Statistics Canada is applicable as a poverty measure regardless of whether its intent or designation is to be one. They have argued, that as it stands, the LICO is the best measure available that accurately measures a relative poverty rate.  The LICO has fallen to a near a record low at 9.4% as of 2008, down from a recent high of 15.7% in 1996.[http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/famil19a-eng.htm]

In the 2001 census, 702, 600 Canadians were considered to be at-risk for homelessness, in that they spent more than 50 per cent of their household income on shelter.  Lack of income security combined with the lack of affordable housing creates the problem of "hidden" homelessness. The "hidden homeless" may actually fall back and forth between homelessness and being housed, making the problem of homelessness much larger than that identified in street or shelter counts<ref name="chumirethicsfoundation.ca"/>

==Solutions==
The National Homeless Initiative (NHI), created in 1999, was the federal secretariat most directly responsible for homelessness matters until its closure in 2007. The NHI was created to fund transitional housing and a range of services for homeless people across the country. NHI funded the federal program Supporting Community Partnerships Initiative (SCPI) which covered the costs of temporary shelters and services for the homeless.<ref>Shapcott, M. (October 2007). "Ten Things You Should Know about housing and homelessness." Wellesley Institute. Policy Primer.</ref> 

The federal government replaced the NHI with the Homelessness Partnering Strategy (HPS) which was allocated to spend $270 million between 2007 and 2009<ref>Laird, Gordon (2007). "Shelter-Homelessness in a growth economy: Canada's 21st century paradox." A Report for the Sheldon Chumir Foundation for Ethics in Leadership, p.30. [http://www.chumirethicsfoundation.ca/files/pdf/SHELTER.pdf]</ref> In September 2008, the Government of Canada announced that it would set aside funding for housing and homelessness programs of $387.9 million per year for the next five years<ref>Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Government of Canada website [http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/nero/nere/2008/2008-09-19-1000.cfm]</ref>

Canada is one of the few countries in the world without a national housing strategy (United Nations, 2009). Many of the federal governments' expenditures are cost-sharing, one-time only funding initiatives that lack long-term leadership on homelessness. The United Nations has also noted the lack of information on these expenditures, including the number of houses produced.<ref name="United Nations 2009"/>

Housing has been declared a fundamental human right. Canada helped to draft the 1948 UN Declaration of Human Rights that includes a right to access housing in Article 25. Canada also ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights in 1976, which recognizes an adequate standard of living, including housing, in Article 11.<ref>Experiencing Homelessness: Fourth Report Card on Ending Homelessness in Ottawaâ€”January to December 2007. The Alliance to End Homelessness in Ottawa, 2008. [www.endhomelessnessottawa.ca]</ref>

Homeless advocates maintain that government funding should be spent on securing affordable housing versus funding more homelessness programs.<ref name="chumirethicsfoundation.ca"/> In British Columbia, the service and shelter costs of homeless people ranged from $30,000 to $40,000 annually versus $22,000 to $28,000 per year for formerly homeless persons housed in social housing.<ref>Margaret, E. et al, (2001). "Homelessnessâ€”Causes and Effects, Volume 3: The Costs of Homelessness in British Columbia. Ministry of Social Development and Economic Security." Government of British Columbia.</ref> 

A plan to house Vancouver's homeless was proposed by a local architect. It called for the rapid erection of temporary villages assembled from the same type of modular units that mining companies provide for remote workers. "Stop Gap Shelters" is what architect [[Gregory Henriquez]] calls it. "All of us in this community have long been advocates for permanent housing," he said. "But we've gotten to the point where the numbers of homeless are so staggering that I'm left wondering if we will ever catch up doing it that way. I don't think we can. I think there has to be a stop-gap measure. And that's what this is." Henriquez drew up plans for a motel-like village, with 48 to 120 suites clustered around  central courtyards. The colourful compound includes a managers' office, a covered patio, and a second storey meeting room. [The Tyee, 2008]
