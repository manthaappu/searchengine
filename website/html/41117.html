'''[[Zombie]]s''' are regularly encountered in [[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[fantasy]] themed [[horror fiction|fiction]] and entertainment. They are typically depicted as mindless, shambling, decaying corpses with a [[Cannibalism|hunger for human flesh]], and in some cases, [[human brain]]s in particular.  As of 2009, zombies are challenging [[Vampires in popular culture|vampires]] for their popularity.<ref name="USA Today">Craig Wilson, "Zombies lurch into popular culture via books, plays, more," ''[[USA Today]]'', April 9, 2009, p. 1D (1st page of Life section, [[above the fold]]), found at [http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2009-04-08-zombies-pop-culture_N.htm Zombies lurch into popular culture article at USA Today].  Accessed April 13, 2009.</ref>

==Evolution of the zombie archetype==
The flesh-hungry [[undead]], often in the form of [[ghoul]]s and [[vampire]]s, have been a fixture of world mythology dating at least since ''[[The Epic of Gilgamesh]]''<ref>[http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/mesopotamian/gilgamesh/tab6.htm] [[The Epic of Gilgamesh]], Tablet VI</ref>, in which the goddess Ishtar promises: 

''I will knock down the Gates of the Netherworld'',<br>
''I will smash the door posts, and leave the doors flat down'',<br>
''and will let the dead go up to eat the living!''<br>
''And the dead will outnumber the living!''<ref>[http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/mesopotamian/gilgamesh/tab6.htm] [[The Epic of Gilgamesh]], Tablet VI</ref><br>

[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' is another early piece of literature to reference ghouls. A prime example is the story "The History of Gherib and His Brother Agib" (from ''Nights'' vol. 6), in which Gherib, an outcast prince, fights off a family of ravenous ghouls, enslaves them, and converts them to Islam.<ref>{{cite web|title="The Story of Gherib and his Brother Agib"|work=Thousand Nights and One Night|author=Al-Hakawati|accessdate=October 2, 2008|url=http://www.al-hakawati.net/english/Stories_Tales/laila170.asp}}</ref>

''[[Frankenstein]]'' by [[Mary Shelley]], while not a zombie novel proper, prefigures many 20th century ideas about zombies in that the resurrection of the dead is portrayed as a scientific process rather than a mystical one, and that the resurrected dead are degraded and more violent than their living selves. ''Frankenstein'', published in 1818, has its roots in European folklore,<ref>Warner, Marina. ''A forgotten gem: Das Gespensterbuch ('The Book of Ghosts'), An Introduction'' [http://www.new-books-in-german.com/aut2006/book15a.htm#top book review]</ref> whose tales of vengeful dead also informed the evolution of the modern conception of [[vampire]]s as well as zombies. Later notable 19th century stories about the avenging undead included [[Ambrose Bierce]]'s "[http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=BieCans.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=1&division=div1 The Death of Halpin Frayser]", and various [[Gothic Romanticism]] tales by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Though their works couldn't be properly considered zombie fiction, the supernatural tales of Bierce and Poe would prove influential on later undead-themed writers such as [[H. P. Lovecraft]], by Lovecraft's own admission.<ref>H. P. Lovecraft, ''Supernatural Horror in Literature'' (1927, 1933–1935) http://gaslight.mtroyal.ca/superhor.htm</ref>

One book to expose more recent western culture to the concept of the zombie was ''The Magic Island'' by W.B. Seabrook in 1929. ''Island'' is the sensationalized account of a narrator in [[Haiti]] who encounters [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] cults and their resurrected thralls. [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] claimed that the book "introduced 'zombi' into U.S. speech".<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764649,00.html "Mumble-Jumble"], [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']], 9 September 1940.</ref>

In the 1920s and early 1930s, the American horror author H. P. Lovecraft wrote several novelettes that explored the zombie or undead theme from different angles.  "[[Cool Air]]", "[[In the Vault]]" (which includes perhaps the first recorded character ''bitten'' by a zombie), "[[s:The Thing on the Doorstep|The Thing on the Doorstep]]", "[[The Outsider (short story)|The Outsider]]" and "[[Pickman's Model]]" are all undead or zombie-related, but the most definitive zombie story in Lovecraft's oeuvre was 1921's ''[[Herbert West--Reanimator]]'', which "helped define zombies in popular culture".<ref>[http://www.ugo.com/a/zombies-attack/?cur=favorite-zombies&content=reanimator "Our Favorite Zombies"], Underground Online</ref> This ''Frankenstein''-inspired series featured [[Herbert West]], a [[mad scientist]] who attempts to revive human corpses with mixed results. Notably, the resurrected dead are uncontrollable, mostly mute, primitive and extremely violent; though they are not referred to as zombies, their portrayal was prescient, anticipating the modern conception of zombies by several decades.

[[Image:Tor Johnson.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tor Johnson]] as a zombie with his victim in cult movie ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (1959)]]
In 1932, [[Victor Halperin]] directed ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]'', a horror film starring [[Bela Lugosi]]. This film, capitalizing on the same voodoo zombie themes as Seabrook's book of three years prior, is often regarded as the first legitimate zombie film ever made.<ref>Roberts, Lee. [http://www.best-horror-movies.com/white-zombie.html "''White Zombie'' is regarded as the first zombie film"], November 2006.</ref> Here zombies are depicted as mindless, unthinking henchmen under the spell of an evil magician. Zombies, often still using this voodoo-inspired rationale, were initially uncommon in cinema, but their appearances continued sporadically through the 1930s to the 1960s,<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/keyword/zombie/?start=601&sort=date Search results for keyword "zombie"], [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref> with notable films including ''[[I Walked With a Zombie]]'' (1943) and the infamous ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (1959). 

The 1936 film ''[[Things to Come]]'', based on the novel by [[H. G. Wells]], anticipates later zombie films with an apocalyptic scenario surrounding "the wandering sickness", a highly contagious viral plague that causes the infected to wander slowly and insensibly, very much like zombies, infecting others on contact.<ref>''Things to Come'' ([http://monsterhunter.coldfusionvideo.com/ThingsToCome.html film review])</ref> Though this film's direct influence on later films isn't known, ''Things to Come'' is still compared favorably by some critics<ref>Philip French, [http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,824813,00.html ''28 Days Later'' (film review)], ''[[The Observer]]'', 3 November 2002.</ref> to modern zombie movies.

Avenging zombies would feature prominently in the early 1950s [[EC Comics]] such as ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comic)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', which [[George A. Romero]] would later claim as an influence.<ref name="Biodrowski">Biodrowski, Steve. [http://www.hollywoodgothique.com/nightofthelivingdead.html "''Night of the Living Dead'': The classic film that launched the modern zombie genre"]</ref> The comics, including ''Tales'', ''Vault of Horror'' and ''Weird Science'', featured avenging undead in the Gothic tradition quite regularly, including adaptations of Lovecraft's stories which included "In the Vault", "Cool Air" and ''Herbert West—Reanimator''.<ref>[http://www.yankeeclassic.com/miskatonic/library/stacks/periodicals/comics/lovecraft/comics1.htm "H. P. Lovecraft in the comics"]</ref>

The 1954 publication of ''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]'', by author [[Richard Matheson]], would further influence the zombie genre. It is the story of a future [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], overrun with undead bloodsucking beings. Notable as influential on the zombie genre is the portrayal of a worldwide [[apocalypse]] due to the infestation, in addition to the initial conception of vampirism as a [[disease]] (a scenario comparable to recent zombie media such as ''[[Resident Evil]]''). The novel was a success, and would be adapted to film as ''[[The Last Man on Earth (1964 film)|The Last Man on Earth]]'' in 1964, as ''[[The Omega Man]]'' in 1971, and again in 2007 as ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]''. 

Although classified as a vampire story and referred to as "the first modern vampire novel",<ref>David Carroll and Kyla Ward, ''The Horror Timeline'', Burnt Toast No. 13 http://www.tabula-rasa.info/DarkAges/Timeline2.html</ref> ''Legend'' had definitive impact on the zombie genre by way of George A. Romero. Romero was heavily influenced by the novel and its 1964 adaptation when writing the film ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'',<ref>''House of Horrors Presents: The Night of the Living Dead'' http://www.houseofhorrors.com/night68.htm</ref> by his own admission.<ref name="Biodrowski"/> Critics have also noted extensive similarities between ''Night'' and ''Last Man on Earth'',<ref>Danel Griffin ''The Last Man on Earth'' (film review) http://uas.alaska.edu/pub/filmasart/lastmanonearth.htm</ref> indicating further influence.

''Night of the Living Dead'', a taboo-breaking and genre-defining classic, would prove to be more influential on the concept of zombies than any literary or cinematic work before it.<ref>Richard Scheib,

==George A. Romero and the modern zombie film==
{{seealso|List of zombie films}}
[[Image:Girl zombie eating her victim Night of the Living Dead bw.jpg|left|thumb|A young zombie ([[Kyra Schon]]) feeding on human flesh, from ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968)]]
The modern conception of the zombie owes itself almost entirely to [[George A. Romero]]'s 1968 film ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''.<ref>Stephen Harper, ''Night of the Living Dead: Reappraising an Undead Classic''. Bright Lights Film Journal, Issue 50, November 2005. http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/50/night.htm</ref><ref>June Pulliam, “The Zombie,” Icons of Horror and the Supernatural, S. T. Joshi, editor (Greenwood Press) 2006.</ref> In his films, Romero "bred the zombie with the vampire, and what he got was the hybrid vigour of a ghoulish plague monster".<ref>James B. Twitchell, ''Dreadful Pleasures: An Anatomy of Modern Horror''. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1985.</ref> This entailed an apocalyptic vision of monsters that have come to be known as [[Living Dead#Romero's versus O'Bannon's zombies|Romero zombies]].

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' chided theater owners and parents who allowed children access to the film. "I don't think the younger kids really knew what hit them," complained Ebert. "They were used to going to movies, sure, and they'd seen some horror movies before, sure, but this was something else." According to Ebert, the film affected the audience immediately:<blockquote>''The kids in the audience were stunned. There was almost complete silence. The movie had stopped being delightfully scary about halfway through, and had become unexpectedly terrifying. There was a little girl across the aisle from me, maybe nine years old, who was sitting very still in her seat and crying.''<ref name="Ebertreview">Roger Ebert, review of ''Night of the Living Dead'', Chicago ''Sun-Times'', January 5, 196[9], at [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19670105/REVIEWS/701050301/1023 RogerEbert.com]; last accessed June 24, 2006.</ref></blockquote> Romero's reinvention of zombies is notable in terms of its thematics; he used zombies not just for their own sake, but as a vehicle "to criticize real-world social ills—such as government ineptitude, bioengineering, slavery, greed and exploitation—while indulging our post-apocalyptic fantasies".<ref>Liz Cole, ''Zombies'' http://www.greencine.com/static/primers/zombies1.jsp</ref> ''Night'' was the first of five films in the [[Living Dead#Romero's Dead series|''Living Dead'' series]].

Innately tied with the conception of the modern zombie is the "[[zombie apocalypse]]", the breakdown of society as a result of zombie infestation, portrayed in countless zombie-related media post-''Night''.<ref name="Paffenroth">Kim Paffenroth, ''Gospel of the Living Dead: George Romero's Visions of Hell on Earth''. Waco: Baylor University Press, 2006.</ref> Scholar Kim Paffrenroth notes that "more than any other monster, zombies are fully and literally apocalyptic ... they signal the end of the world as we have known it."<ref name="Paffenroth"/>

''Night'' made no reference to the creatures as "zombies". In the film, they are referred as "[[ghoul]]s" on the TV news reports. However, the word ''zombie'' is used continually by Romero in his 1978 script for ''[[Dawn of the Dead]]'',<ref>George A. Romero ''Dawn of the Dead'' (Working draft 1977) http://www.horrorlair.com/scripts/dawnofthedead.txt</ref> including once in dialog. This "retroactively fits (the creatures) with an invisible [[Haiti]]an/[[African]] prehistory, formally introducing the zombie as a new archetype".<ref>American Stranger, '' I Am Legend (Zombie Apocalypse part 1)'' http://amstranger.blogspot.com/2007/03/i-am-legend-zombie-apocalypse-part-1.html</ref>

[[File:Night of the Living Dead.jpg|right|thumb|Movie poster for the 1968 film ''Night of the Living Dead'']]
''Dawn of the Dead'' was released under this title just months before the release of [[Lucio Fulci]]'s ''[[Zombi II]]'' (1979). Fulci's gory epic was filmed at the same time as Romero's ''Dawn'', despite the popular belief that it was made in order to cash in on the success of ''Dawn''. The only reference to ''Dawn'' was the title change to ''Zombi II'' (''Dawn'' generally went by ''Zombi'' or ''Zombie'' in other countries.)<ref>{{imdb title|id=0077402|title=Dawn of the Dead}}</ref>

The early 1980s was notable for the introduction of zombies into [[Cinema of China|Chinese]] and other Asian films, often martial arts/horror crossover films, that featured zombies as thralls animated by magic for purposes of battle.<ref>{{imdb title|id=0199148|title=Wu long tian shi zhao ji gui}}</ref> Though the idea never had large enough appeal to become a sub-genre, zombies are still used as martial-arts villains in some films today.<ref>{{imdb title|id=0275773|title=Versus}}</ref>

1981's ''[[Hell of the Living Dead]]'' was the first film to reference a mutagenic gas as a source of zombie contagion, later echoed by Trioxin in [[Dan O'Bannon]]'s 1985 film, ''[[Return of the Living Dead]]''. ''RotLD'' took a more comedic approach than Romero's films; ''Return'' was the first film to feature zombies which hungered specifically for brains instead of all human flesh (this included the vocalization of "Brains!" as a part of zombie vocabulary), and is the source of the now-familiar cliché of brain-devouring zombies seen elsewhere.

The mid-1980s produced few zombie films of note (the ''[[Evil Dead]]'' series, while highly influential and notable on their own, are not technically zombie films but films about [[demonic possession]]). 1985's ''[[Re-Animator]]'', loosely based on the Lovecraft story, stood out in the genre, achieving nearly unanimous critical acclaim,<ref>[[Rotten Tomatoes]] http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/reanimator/?critic=columns</ref> and becoming a modest success, nearly outstripping 1985's ''[[Day of the Dead]]'' for box office returns. Lovecraft's prescient depiction is notable here; the zombies in the film are consistent with other zombie films of the period, and it may escape the viewer that they are nearly unchanged from the 1921 story.

The 1988 [[Wes Craven]] film ''[[The Serpent and the Rainbow (film)|The Serpent and the Rainbow]]'', based on the non-fiction book by [[Wade Davis]], attempted to re-connect the zombie genre with the [[Haitian Vodou|Haitian vodou]] ("voodoo") roots that inspired it. The film poses both supernatural and scientific possibilities for "zombification" and other aspects of [[Haitian Vodou|vodou]], though the scientific explanations for them, which involve use of the poison [[tetrodotoxin]], have been dismissed by the scientific community.<ref>Hines, Terence; "Zombies and Tetrodotoxin"; ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''; May/June 2008; Volume 32, Issue 3; Pages 60-62.</ref> The film was relatively well-reviewed<ref>Roger Ebert, ''The Serpent And The Rainbow'', Feb. 1988 (film review) http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19880205/REVIEWS/802050302/1023</ref><ref>Rotten Tomatoes http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/serpent_and_the_rainbow/</ref> and enjoyed modest financial success,<ref>Internet Movie Database http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096071/business</ref> and is notable as perhaps the only vodou-themed zombie film of recent times.

Also in 1988, the Romero zombies were featured in ''[[Waxwork (1988 film)|Waxwork]]'', where the protagonists are drawn to the world of ''Night of the Living Dead''.

After the mid-1980s, the subgenre was mostly relegated to the underground. Notable entries include director [[Peter Jackson|Peter Jackson's]] ultra-gory film ''[[Braindead (1992 film)|Braindead]]'' (1992) (released as ''Dead Alive'' in the U.S.), [[Bob Balaban|Bob Balaban's]] comic 1993 film ''[[My Boyfriend's Back (film)|My Boyfriend's Back]]'' where a self-aware high school boy returns to profess his love for a girl and his love for human flesh, and Michele Soavi's ''[[Dellamorte Dellamore]]'' (1994) (released as ''Cemetery Man'' in the U.S.). Several years later, zombies experienced a renaissance in low-budget Asian cinema, with a sudden spate of dissimilar entries including ''[[Bio Zombie]]'' (1998), ''[[Wild Zero]]'' (1999), ''[[Junk (film)|Junk]]'' (1999), ''[[Versus (film)|Versus]]'' (2000) and ''[[Stacy (film)|Stacy]]'' (2001).

In Disney's 1993 film ''[[Hocus Pocus (film)|Hocus Pocus]]'', a "good zombie", Billy Butcherson played by [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]], was introduced, giving yet a new kind of zombie in an intelligent, gentle, kind, and heroic being.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thedougjonesexperience.com/hocuspocus~prosthetics.htm |title=The Creation of Billy Butcherson |accessdate=6 December 2008 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=The Doug Jones Experience}}</ref>

The turn of the millennium coincided with a decade of box office successes in which the zombie sub-genre experienced a resurgence: the ''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]'' movies (2002, 2004, 2007, 2010); the [[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|''Dawn of the Dead'' remake]] (2004), the British films ''[[28 Days Later]]'' and ''[[28 Weeks Later]]'' (2002, 2007)<ref name="guardian2">{{cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,2073292,00.html|title=A capital place for panic attacks|accessdate=2007-05-12|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|author=Mark Kermode | location=London | date=May 6, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{ cite web | title = Stylus Magazine’s Top 10 Zombie Films of All Time | url = http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/movie_review/stylus-magazines-top-10-zombie-films-of-all-time.htm }}</ref> and the comedy/homage ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' (2004).  The new interest allowed Romero to create the fourth entry in his zombie series: ''[[Land of the Dead]]'', released in the summer of 2005.  Romero has recently returned to the beginning of the series with the films ''[[Diary of the Dead]]'' (2008) and ''[[Survival of the Dead]]'' (2010).

The depiction of zombies as biologically infected people has become increasingly popular, likely due to the ''28 Days Later'' and ''Resident Evil'' series. 2006's ''[[Slither (2006 film)|Slither]]'' featured zombies infected with alien parasites, and 2007's ''[[Planet Terror]]'' featured a zombie outbreak caused by a biological weapon. The comedy films ''[[Zombie Strippers]]'', ''[[Zombieland]]'' and ''[[Fido (film)|Fido]]'' have also taken this approach.

Zombies in recent popular culture have considerably increased their locomotion, as exampled in recent movies like ''[[28 Days Later]]'' (and its sequel, ''[[28 Weeks Later]]''), the [[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|''Dawn of the Dead'' remake]], ''[[House of the Dead (film)|House of the Dead]]''<ref name=josh>[http://www.slate.com/id/2180271/ The Running Dead - How did movie zombies get so fast?] By Josh Levin Posted Wednesday, Dec. 19, 2007, at 7:34 AM ET</ref>, ''[[Zombieland]]'' and the video game ''[[Left 4 Dead]]''. In contrast, zombies have historically been portrayed as slow.

As part of this resurgence, there have been numerous [[direct-to-video]] (or [[DVD]]) zombie movies made by low-budget filmmakers using [[digital video]]. A proliferation of 'documentary-style' zombie films has resulted, including ''The Zombie Diaries'', ''American Zombie'' and ''[[Colin (film)|Colin]]'', each taking distinct approaches to the undead phenomenon.

==The modern zombie in print and literature==
{{seealso|List of zombie novels}}
Though zombies have appeared in many books prior to and after ''Night of the Living Dead'', it wouldn't be until 1990 that zombie fiction emerged as a distinct literary subgenre, with the publication of ''[[Book of the Dead (anthology)|Book of the Dead]]'' in 1990 and its follow-up ''Still Dead: Book of the Dead 2'' in 1992, both edited by horror authors [[John Skipp]] and [[Craig Spector]]. Featuring Romero-inspired stories from the likes of [[Stephen King]] and other famous names, the ''Book of the Dead'' compilations are regarded as influential in the horror genre and perhaps the first true "zombie literature".

Recent zombie fiction of note includes [[Brian Keene]]'s 2005 novel ''[[The Rising (Keene novel)|The Rising]]'', followed by its sequel ''City of the Dead'', which deal with a worldwide apocalypse of intelligent zombies, caused by demonic possession. Though the story took many liberties with the zombie concept, ''The Rising'' proved itself to be a success in the subgenre, even winning the 2005 Bram Stoker award.<ref>Past Stoker Nominees & Winners http://www.horror.org/stokerwinnom.htm</ref>

Famed horror novelist [[Stephen King]] has mined the zombie theme, first with 1990's "[[Home Delivery (short story)|Home Delivery]]", written for the aforementioned ''Book of the Dead'' compilation and detailing a small town's attempt to defend itself from a classic zombie outbreak. In 2006 King published ''[[Cell (novel)|Cell]]'', which concerns a struggling young artist on a trek from [[Boston]] to [[Maine]] in hopes of saving his family from a possible worldwide zombie outbreak, created by "The Pulse", a global electromagnetic phenomenon that turns the world's cellular phone users into bloodthirsty, zombie-like maniacs. ''Cell'' was a number-one bestseller upon its release<ref>''[[The New York Times]]'', 12 Feb. 2006</ref>

Aside from ''Cell'', the most well-known current work of zombie fiction is 2006's ''[[World War Z]]'' by [[Max Brooks]], which was an immediate hit upon its release and a New York Times bestseller<ref>''The New York Times'', 15 Nov. 2006</ref>. Brooks had previously authored the cult hit ''[[The Zombie Survival Guide]]'', an exhaustively researched, zombie-themed parody of pop-fiction survival guides published in 2003.<ref name="USA Today" />  Brooks has said that zombies are so popular because:
{{Quote|Other monsters may threaten individual humans, but the living dead threaten the entire human race.... Zombies are slate wipers.}}

[[David Wellington (author)|David Wellington]]'s trilogy of zombie novels began in 2004 with ''[[Monster Island (novel)|Monster Island]]'', followed by two sequels, ''[[Monster Nation (novel)|Monster Nation]]'' and ''[[Monster Planet (novel)|Monster Planet]]''. The Monster Trilogy reveals the flesh-eating urge of the zombie is caused by a desire for life force, a golden energy that is found in living organisms. When pushed, Wellington's zombies will even consume plant matter. The reader is informed of this golden energy via the accounts of Liches, individuals who have voluntarily or involuntarily managed to maintain the flow of oxygen to the brain during death and emerge 'zombified' yet intelligent.

[[Jonathan Maberry]]'s ''Zombie CSU: The Forensics of the Living Dead'', released in August 2008, interviewed over 250 experts in forensics, medicine, science, law enforcement, the military and similar disciplines to discuss how the real world would react, research and respond to zombies.

In the fantasy trilogy ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' by [[Philip Pullman]], a zombie is described as a human who has been artificially separated from his soul (which, in the alternate world of the novels, takes the form of a visible animal-shaped companion called ''[[Dæmon (His Dark Materials)|dæmon]]'') by means of a process called ''[[intercision]]''. When the intercision is performed on an adult, the victim is prived of many human characteristics, most notably his free will. Some African tribes traditionally use this process in order to create slaves that will work day and night without ever running away or complaining, and with no fear of death or injury. The novels' main villain, [[Marisa Coulter]], also uses intercision to create apathic and obedient servants, bodyguards and soldiers.

[[J. K. Rowling]] includes zombies, known as [[Inferius|Inferi]], in the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|sixth book]] of her Harry Potter series.  The Inferi are dead humans who are re-animated by Dark Magic.

By 2009, zombies became all the rage in literature:
{{quote|In the world of traditional horror, nothing is more popular right now than zombies.... The living dead are here to stay.|Katy Hershbereger, [[St. Martin's Press]]<ref name="USA Today" />}}

The 2009 mashup novel ''[[Pride and Prejudice and Zombies]]'' by [[Seth Grahame-Smith]] combines the full text of ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' by [[Jane Austen]] with a story about a zombie epidemic within the novel's [[British Regency]] period setting.<ref name="USA Today" /> Other [[pastiche]]s of classic works include Canadian [[Coscom Entertainment]]'s adaptations of [[War of the Worlds]], [[Huckleberry Finn]], [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]], [[Dracula]], [[Robin Hood]] mythos  and [[Alice in Wonderland]], now all with added zombie content. 

Other zombie appearances have been cataloged in dozens of novels,<ref>'' The Monster Librarian Presents: Reviews of Zombie Fiction '' http://www.monsterlibrarian.com/zombies.htm</ref> comics, and webcomics. Like [[vampires]] and other famous archetypal creatures, the zombie archetype has spread so far and wide that it is impossible to provide a definitive list of resources, though certain websites keep note of zombie references in detail.

==Zombies in comics==

The fictional Disney cartoon character [[Bombie the Zombie]], created by [[Carl Barks]], first appeared in the ''Voodoo Hoodoo'' strip in 1949. Bombie had been reanimated by an African voodoo sorcerer, and was sent on a mission to poison [[Scrooge McDuck]]. Later on [[Don Rosa]] reused the character in his own McDuck stories.

[[Robert Kirkman]], an admirer of Romero, has contributed to the recent popularity of the genre in comics, first by launching his self-published comic book ''[[The Walking Dead]]'', then by writing [[Marvel Zombies]] in 2006. In response to its competitor's popular series, [[DC Comics]]' [[Geoff Johns]] introduced a revenant-staffed [[Black Lantern Corps]], consisting of the maliciously animated corpses of fallen DC metahumans during its current [[Blackest Night]] story arc. 

[[DC Comics]] continued producing zombie comics on their digital imprint [[Zuda Comics]]. [[The Black Cherry Bombshells]] takes place in a world of all where all the men have turned into zombies and women gangs fight with them and each other.

The [[Amazing Joy Buzzards]] from [[Image Comics]] presents Hollywood Zombies who have been zombified by the villain Hypno who are attacking the band.

In the webcomic ''Hanna Is Not A Boy's Name'', the narrator is a zombie. He has been dead for the past decade, and cannot remember his own name, his name on the website's character profiles being { ... }. He has stitches all over his body and glowing orange eyes.

The manga and anime series [[Highschool of the Dead]], which was released in 2006 for manga and anime in July 2010. The series follows a group of high school students who were caught in a middle of a pandemic attack throughout Japan and around the world. The survivors are now currently trying to live through the pandemic attack, wandering throughout Japan to find refuge.

==Zombies on television==

One of the most famous zombie-themed television appearances was 1983's ''[[Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]'', a [[Michael Jackson]] [[music video]], directed by [[John Landis]]. One of the most popular music videos of all time, it is a [[horror film]] [[parody]] featuring choreographed zombies performing with [[Michael Jackson|Jackson]]. Many pop culture media have paid tribute to this scene alone, including zombie films such as ''Return of the Living Dead 2'', cementing ''Thriller'''s place in zombie history.

Fantasy-themed shows such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[The X-Files]]'' sometimes include zombies as part of their horror/fantasy settings.

Zombies are a popular theme for video games, particularly of but not limited to the [[first-person shooter]] and [[role-playing]] genre. Some important titles in this area include the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series, ''[[Dead Rising]]'', ''[[The House of the Dead (series)|House of the Dead]]'' and ''[[Left 4 Dead]]''.<ref name=4dead>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/12/01/DD4R14F77J.DTL |title=Playing Games: Left 4 Dead |accessdate=3 December 2008 |author=Christopher T. Fong |date=December 2, 2008 |work=Video game review |publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}</ref> [[PopCap Games]] ''[[Plants vs. Zombies]]'' - a humorous [[tower defense]] game - was an [[Independent video game development|indie]] hit in 2009, featuring in several best-of lists at the end of that year. The [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] ''[[Urban Dead]]'', a free grid-based browser game where zombies and survivors fight for control of a ruined city, is one of the most popular games of its type, with an estimated  30,680 visits per day.<ref>[http://www.surcentro.com/en/info/www.urbandead.com/ www.urbandead.com web stats from SurCentro.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Some games even allow the gamer to play as a zombie. In the game ''[[Stubbs the Zombie in "Rebel Without a Pulse"]]'', zombies are impervious to most attacks, except trauma to the head (which would instantly "kill" the zombie). The game ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'' and its sequel ''[[Left 4 Dead 2]]'' pit two teams against each other, one team consists of humans attempting to make it to a safe room while the other team consists of "specialized" zombies attempting to stop them. Early platforms to feature zombie games included the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis, which featured a game entitled [[Zombies Ate My Neighbors]] that was produced in 1993.

Outside of video games, zombies frequently appear in [[collectible card game|trading card games]] such as ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'', as well as in role-playing games such as ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' and tabletop wargames such as [[Warhammer Fantasy Battle|Warhammer Fantasy]] and [[Warhammer 40,000|40K]]. The RPG ''[[All Flesh Must Be Eaten]]'' is premised upon a zombie outbreak and features rules for zombie campaigns in many historical settings. <!-- The popularity of zombies as antagonists or cannon-fodder in games makes it impossible to create a definitive list of references.  xxx Commented out as NPOV, but it's good advice to editors: don't try to make a list of all zombie RPGs here. Create a [[List of RPGs featuring zombies]] if you see fit.  -->

The award-winning ''[[Zombies!!!]]'' series of board games by Twilight Creations features players attempting to escape from a zombie-infested city. [[Cheapass Games]] has released five other zombie-themed games, including ''[[Give Me the Brain]]'', ''[[The Great Brain Robbery]]'', and ''[[Lord of the Fries]]'', which takes place at [[Friedey's]], a fast-food restaurant staffed by minimum wage zombies. ''[[Last Night on Earth: The Zombie Game|Last Night on Earth]]'' is a boardgame covering many stereotypes of the zombie movie genre.

The game, [[Humans vs. Zombies]], is a popular zombie-themed [[live-action game]] played on many college campuses. The game starts with one "Zombie" and a group of "Humans." The ultimate goal of the game is for either all Humans to be turned into Zombies, or for the humans to survive a set amount of time. Humans defend themselves using socks or dart guns, stunning the Zombie players; Zombies are unarmed and must tag a Human in order to turn him or her into a Zombie. Safe zones are established so that players can eat and sleep in safety.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/04/11/ST2008041102658.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Commando Performance | first=Laura | last=Wexler | accessdate=April 20, 2010}}</ref>

==In music==
<!-- ATTENTION EDITORS: Because of the huge number of zombie references in various media, all non-essential pop culture references and trivia should be placed in the linked list articles (below) rather than in the main article.

Zombies and horror have become so popular that many songs and bands have been based on these flesh-eating ghouls; most notably, the musician [[Rob Zombie]] has incorporated zombie aesthetics and references into virtually all of his work, while [[Brain Drill]] has dealt with the theme in five of their songs to date. Zombie references crop up in every genre from pop to [[death metal]] and some subgenres such as [[horror punk]] mine the zombie aesthetic extensively.  Horror punk has also been linked with the subgenres of [[deathrock]] and [[psychobilly]].  The success of these genres has been mainly underground, although psychobilly has reached some mainstream popularity.

The zombie also appears in protest songs, symbolizing mindless adherence to authority, particularly in law enforcement and the armed forces.  Well-known examples include [[Fela Kuti]]'s 1976 single ''[[Zombie (album)|Zombie]]'', and [[The Cranberries]]' 1994 single ''[[Zombie (song)|Zombie]]''.
