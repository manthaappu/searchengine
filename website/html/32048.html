<html> <head> <title>Richard Crandall</title></head><body>'''Richard E. Crandall''' is an [[United States|American]] [[computer scientist]] and physicist who has made contributions to [[computational number theory]].

He is most notable for the development of the [[irrational base discrete weighted transform]], an important method of finding very large primes. He has, at various times, been Chief Scientist at [[NeXT]] Inc. and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s Chief Cryptographer. He is currently Vollum Adjunct Professor of Science and director of the Center for Advanced Computation<ref>{{cite news
