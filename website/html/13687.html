<html> <head> <title>Fitness function</title></head><body>A '''fitness function''' is a particular type of [[objective function]] that prescribes the optimality of a solution (that is, a [[chromosome (genetic algorithm)|chromosome]]) in a [[genetic algorithm]] so that that particular chromosome may be ranked against all the other chromosomes. Optimal chromosomes, or at least chromosomes which are ''more'' optimal, are allowed to [[crossover (genetic algorithm)|breed]] and mix their datasets by any of several techniques, producing a new generation that will (hopefully) be even better.

An ideal fitness function correlates closely with the algorithm's goal, and yet may be computed quickly. Speed of execution is very important, as a typical genetic algorithm must be iterated many, many times in order to produce a usable result for a non-trivial problem. This is one of the main drawbacks of [[genetic algorithm|GAs]] in real world applications and limits their applicability in some industries. It is apparent that amalgamation of [[Fitness approximation|approximate models]] may be one of the most promising approaches, especially in the following cases: 
* Fitness computation time of a single solution is extremely high, 
* Precise model for fitness computation is missing, 
* The fitness function is uncertain or noisy.

Two main classes of fitness functions exist: one where the fitness function does not change, as in optimizing a fixed function or testing with a fixed set of test cases; and one where the fitness function is mutable, as in [[niche differentiation]] or [[co-evolution|co-evolving]] the set of test cases.

Another way of looking at fitness functions is in terms of a [[fitness landscape]], which shows the fitness for each possible chromosome.

Definition of the fitness function is not straightforward in many cases and often is performed iteratively if the fittest solutions produced by GA are not what is desired. In some cases, it is very hard or impossible to come up even with a guess of what fitness function definition might be. [[Interactive genetic algorithms]] address this difficulty by outsourcing evaluation to external agents (normally humans).
