==nForce 680i SLI hotfix==
<!-- Since I have suspicions about "ANONYMOUS" clean ups, I removed the clean up tag and added protection to this page as this hotfix info affects a currently shipping high performance and price chipset used in some motherboards.Some people might simply not like that info... !-->

NVIDIA has issued a fix named [http://www.nvidia.com/object/680i_hotfix.html NV121906] in late December 2006 for 680i SLI motherboards. This hotfix was released because users have reported disconnect or write error issues with Serial ATA disk drives on their nForce 680i motherboards. It is an update specifically for SATA Disk Drives and system instability. System instability is observed in the following ways (not a complete list):

*Random application shutdown
*Corrupted boot drive
*BSOD (Blue screen of death)
*Corrupt data

To address them, BIOS updates were released for some NVIDIA nForce 680i SLI based motherboards that eliminate those symptoms. Affected motherboards include: 
*EVGA nForce 680i SLI
*[http://www.bfgtech.com/680i_bios_update_page.htm BFG nForce 680i SLI]
*Biostar TF680i SLI Deluxe
*ECS PN2-SLI2+

This update is supposed to improve system stability and prevent future stability issues related to SATA disk drives on those systems requiring this hotfix. NVIDIA has strongly recommended that all customers upgrade their motherboards to the newest available BIOS revision that their nForce 680i-based motherboards could support, regardless of whether or not they have experienced the issues. Also, NVIDIA has stated that this upgrade will preserve the user's current computer settings.
