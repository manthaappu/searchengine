'''fuser''' is a [[UNIX]] command used to show which [[process (computing)|process]]es are using a specified [[file (computing)|file]], [[file system]], or socket. For example:
<source lang="bash">
 # fuser -m -u /mnt/usb1
 /mnt/usb1:   1347c(root)  1348c(guido)  1349c(guido)
</source>

fuser displays the PIDs of processes using the specified files or  file
systems.   In the default display mode, each file name is followed by a
letter denoting the type of access:

; c : current directory.
; e : executable being run.
; f : open file.
; F : open file for writing. 
; r : root directory.
; m : mmap'ed file or shared library

fuser  returns a non-zero code if none of the files are
accessed or in case of a fatal error. If at least one access has succeeded, fuser returns zero. 
The output of "fuser" may be useful in diagnosing "resource busy" messages arising when attempting to [[mount (Unix)|unmount]] filesystems.

==Options==

; -k : kills all process accessing a file. For example <tt>fuser -k /path/to/your/filename</tt> kills all processes accessing this directory without confirmation. Use -i for confirmation
; -i : interactive mode. Prompt before killing process
; -v : verbose.
; -u : append username
; -a : display all files
; -m : <tt>name</tt> specifies a file on a mounted file system or a block device that is mounted. All processes accessing files on that file system are listed.  If a directory file is specified, it is automatically changed to <tt>name</tt>/. to use any file system that might be mounted on that directory.

Also note that -k sends a SIGKILL to all process. Use the -signal to send a different signal. For a list of signals supported by the fuser run 'fuser -l'

==Related commands==
* The list of all open files and the processes that have them open can be obtained through the [[lsof]] command.
* The equivalent command on BSD operating systems is <tt>fstat(1)</tt>
