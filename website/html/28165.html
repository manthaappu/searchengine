'''PRAM consistency''' (pipelined [[random access memory]]) also known as ''[[FIFO]] [[Consistency model|consistency]]'', or ''[[Central processing unit|Processor]] [[Consistency model|consistency]]''.

All [[Process (computing)|processes]] see [[Computer storage|memory]] writes from one process in the order they were issued from the process.

Writes from different processes may be seen in a different order on different processes.  Only the write order needs to be [[consistent]], thus the name  ''pipelined''.
PRAM consistency is easy to implement. In effect it says that there are no guarantees about the order in which different processes see writes, except that two or more writes from a single source must arrive in order, as though they were in a pipeline.

   P3:                  R(x)1R(x)2
   P4:                  R(x)2R(x)1

Fig: A valid sequence of events  for PRAM consistency.

While the above sequence is not valid for [[Causal consistency]] because W(x)1 and W(x)2 are causal so different processes must read it in same sequence.
