'''''Welltris''''' is a [[computer puzzle game|puzzle]] [[video game]], developed by [[Doka (video game developer)|Doka]] and licensed to [[Bullet-Proof Software]]. Adaptations were made by [[Sphere, Inc]] for [[Spectrum Holobyte]], and by [[Infogrames]]. It was originally released for [[DOS]] [[1989 in video gaming|in 1989]]. It was subsequently ported to the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] [[1990 in video gaming|in 1990]] and the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Commodore 64]] [[1991 in video gaming|in 1991]].

==Gameplay==
''Welltris'' was the first ''[[Tetris]]'' sequel designed by original designer [[Alexey Pajitnov]], with Andrei Sgenov. It retains that game's falling-block puzzle gameplay but extends the pit into three dimensions while the blocks remain two-dimensional, with the board viewed from above.

==Critical reaction==
<!--DOS, Mac, Amiga and Atari ST review scores to go here (being the earlier releases)-->
The ZX Spectrum version had luke-warm reviews, with ''[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]'' awarding 79%,<ref>CRASH issue 87, April 1991</ref> ''[[Sinclair User]]'' awarded 45%<ref>''Sinclair User'' issue 110</ref> and ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' gave 79%.<ref>''Your Sinclair'' issue 64, April 1991</ref> The actual gameplay and addictiveness were highlighted as good areas, but criticisms included the fiddly controls and minimal sound and looks.

The Commodore 64 version, with its more colourful graphics, fared better, receiving 80% from ''[[Zzap!64]]''.<ref>[http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=071&page=017&magazine=zzap ''Zzap!64''] issue 71, March 1991 at the Def Guide to Zzap!64</ref>

The game was reviewed in 1990 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #159 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars.<ref name="Dragon159">{{cite journal
