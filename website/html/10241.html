'''Die attachment''' is the step during the [[integrated circuit packaging]] phase of [[Fabrication (semiconductor)|semiconductor device fabrication]] during which a die is mounted and fixed to the [[Chip carrier|package]] or support structure.

For high-powered applications, the die is usually [[eutectic]] bonded onto the package, using e.g. gold-tin or gold-silicon [[solder]] (for good [[heat conduction]]). For low-cost, low-powered applications, the die is often glued directly onto a substrate (such as a [[printed wiring board]]) using an [[epoxy]] [[adhesive]].
