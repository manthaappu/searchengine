'''VRML''' ('''[[Virtual reality|Virtual Reality]] Modeling Language''', pronounced ''vermal'' or by its initials, originally—before 1995—known as the Virtual Reality Markup Language) is a standard [[file format]] for representing [[3-D computer graphics|3-dimensional]] (3D) interactive [[vector graphics]], designed particularly with the [[World Wide Web]] in mind. It has been superseded by [[X3D]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Is a 3D web more than just empty promises? |author= Paul Festa and John Borland |work=CNET News.com |date= May 19, 2005 |url=http://news.zdnet.co.uk/internet/0,1000000097,39199121,00.htm }}</ref>

==Format==

VRML is a [[text file]] format where, e.g., [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] and edges for a 3D [[polygon]] can be specified along with the surface color, [[UV mapping|UV mapped]] [[texture mapping|texture]]s, [[specularity|shininess]], [[transparency (optics)|transparency]], and so on.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/vrml/VRML1.0/index.html |title=Version 1.0 Specification |publisher=Web3d.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref> [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]s can be associated with [[graphic]]al components so that a [[web browser]] might fetch a webpage or a new VRML file from the [[Internet]] when the [[user (computing)|user]] clicks on the specific graphical component. [[Animation]]s, [[sound]]s, [[lighting]], and other [[aspect]]s of the [[virtual world]] can interact with the user or may be triggered by external [[Event-driven programming|event]]s such as [[timer]]s. A special Script Node allows the addition of [[program code]] (e.g., written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] or [[JavaScript]] (ECMAScript)) to a VRML file.

VRML files are commonly called "worlds" and have the *.wrl [[filename extension|extension]] (for example island.wrl). Although VRML worlds use a text format, they may often be compressed using [[gzip]] so that they transfer over the internet more quickly (some gzip compressed files use the *.wrz [[filename extension|extension]]). Many [[3D computer graphics software|3D modeling programs]] can save [[object (image processing)|object]]s and [[scene]]s in VRML format.

==Standardization==

The [[Web3D Consortium]] has been formed to further the collective development of the format. VRML (and its successor, [[X3D]]), have been accepted as international standards by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO). 

The first version of VRML was specified in November 1994. This version was specified from, and very closely resembled, the [[Application Programming Interface|API]] and [[file format]] of the [[Open Inventor]] [[software component]], originally developed by [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]]. The current and functionally complete version is VRML97 (ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997). VRML has now been superseded by [[X3D]] (ISO/IEC 19775-1)

==Emergence, popularity, and rival technical upgrade==

The term VRML was coined by [[Dave Raggett]] in a paper submitted to the [[World Wide Web Conference 1|First World Wide Web Conference]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www94.web.cern.ch/WWW94/ |title=First World Wide Web Conference |publisher=4.web.cern.ch |date= |accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref> in 1994, and first discussed at the WWW94 VRML BOF established by [[Tim Berners-Lee]], where [[Mark Pesce]] presented the Labyrinth demo he developed with [[Tony Parisi (software developer)|Tony Parisi]]<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080302070914/http://mediamachines.com/management.php Media Machines Management]</ref> and [[Peter Kennard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livingwork.com/peterk/ |title=Peter Kennard's page |publisher=Livingwork.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref>

In 1997, a new version of the format was finalized, as VRML97 (also known as VRML2 or VRML 2.0), and became an [[ISO]] standard. VRML97 was used on the Internet on some personal homepages and sites such as "CyberTown", which offered 3D chat using Blaxxun Software. The format was championed by SGI's Cosmo Software; when SGI restructured in 1998 the division was sold to Platinum Technologies, which was then taken over by [[Computer Associates]], which did not develop or distribute the software. To fill the void a variety of proprietary Web 3D formats emerged over the next few years, including [[Microsoft Chrome]] and [[Adobe Atmosphere]], neither of which is supported today. VRML's capabilities remained largely the same while realtime 3D graphics kept improving. The VRML Consortium changed its name to the [[Web3D Consortium]], and began work on the successor to VRML—[[X3D]].

SGI ran a web site at vrml.sgi.com on which was hosted a string of regular short performances of a character called "Floops" who was a VRML character in a VRML world. Floops was a creation of a company called "Protozoa".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biota.org/book/chbi/chbi2.htm |title=Floops general narrative |publisher=Biota.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspace.com/avatars/book/authorp/floplate.jpg |title=Floops in his first episode |date= |accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref>

H-Anim is a standard for animated Humanoids, which is based around VRML, and later X3D. The initial version 1.0 of the H-Anim standard was scheduled for submission at the end of March 1998.

VRML provoked much interest but has never seen much serious widespread use.<ref>{{cite web |author=[[David Sabine]] |url=http://www.virb.com/DavidSabine/posts/text/3658075 |title=What is (was) VRML?}}</ref> One reason for this may have been the lack of available [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]]. At the time of VRML's popularity, a majority of users, both business and personal, were using slow [[dial-up internet access]]. This had the unfortunate side effect of having users wait for extended periods of time only to find a blocky, ill-lit room with distorted text hanging in seemingly random locations.

VRML experimentation was primarily in education and research where an open specification is most valued. It has now been re-engineered as [[X3D]]. The [[MPEG-4]] Interactive Profile (ISO/IEC 14496) was based on VRML (now on X3D), and X3D is largely backward-compatible with it. VRML is also widely used as a file format for interchange of 3D models, particularly from [[CAD]] systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-matters43/index.html |title=XML Matters |publisher=Ibm.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref>

A free cross-platform runtime implementation of VRML is available in [[OpenVRML]]. Its libraries can be used to add both VRML and X3D support to applications, and a GTK+ plugin is available to render VRML/X3D worlds in web browsers.

In a September 17, 1998 [[Computergram International]] essay, "''VRML Versus Chromeffects: Microsoft Replies''", [[Rachel Chalmers]] sharply criticized VRML as having "no integration with HTML", whereas "[[ChromEffects]] is based on 56 multimedia XML tags".<ref>[[Rachel Chalmers]]: [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CGN/is_3497/ai_n27545305/ VRML Versus Chromeffects: Microsoft Replies] (BNET)</ref><ref>[[Rachel Chalmers]]: [http://www.cbronline.com/news/vrml_versus_chromeffects_microsoft_replies VRML Versus Chromeffects: Microsoft Replies] (CBR)</ref> She did not criticize [[X3D]] (though extended from VRML as well as XML), because [[X3D]] already had this integration. However, VRML survived Chromeffects, canceled in November 1998.<ref>[http://news.com.com/2100-1001-213566.html Microsoft Debuts Chromeffects]; [http://news.com.com/Microsoft+shelves+Chromeffects/2100-1023_3-217885.html?tag=st.rc.targ_mb Microsoft Shelves Chromeffects]</ref>

In the 2000s, many companies like Bitmanagement improved the quality level of virtual effects in VRML to the quality level of [[DirectX]] 9.0c, but at the expense of using proprietary solutions. All main features like game modeling are already complete. They include multi-pass render with low level setting for Z-buffer, BlendOp, AlphaOp, Stencil<ref>[http://www.bitmanagement.com/developer/contact/examples/multitexture/drawgroup.html DrawGroup & DrawOp]</ref>, Multi-texture <ref>[http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/ISO-IEC-19775-1.2-X3D-AbstractSpecification/Part01/components/texturing.html#Multitexturing  Multitexturing]</ref>, Shader with HLSL and GLSL support<ref>[http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/ISO-IEC-19775-1.2-X3D-AbstractSpecification/Part01/components/shaders.html Programmable shaders component]</ref>, realtime Render To Texture, Multi Render Target (MRT) and PostProcessing<ref>[http://www.bitmanagement.com/developer/contact/relnotes72.html#postprocessing Scene postprocessing support]</ref>. Many demos shows that VRML already supports lightmap, normalmap, SSAO, CSM and Realtime Environment Reflection along with other virtual effects.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/user/m17design VRML X3D and Realtime Web3D]</ref>
