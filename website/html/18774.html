The term '''''intelligent transport system''''' (ITS) refers to efforts to add [[information and communications technology]] to [[transport]] [[infrastructure]] and [[vehicle]]s in an effort to manage factors that typically are at odds with each other, such as vehicles, loads, and routes to improve safety and reduce vehicle wear, transportation times, and [[fuel]] consumption.

==Background==

Interest in ITS comes from the problems caused by [[traffic congestion]] and a synergy of new [[information technology]] for simulation, real-time control, and communications networks. [[Traffic congestion]] has been increasing worldwide as a result of increased [[motorization]], [[urbanization]], [[population growth]], and changes in [[population density]]. Congestion reduces efficiency of [[transportation infrastructure]] and increases travel time, [[air pollution]], and [[fuel consumption]]. 

The United States, for example, saw large increases in both motorization and urbanization starting in the 1920s that led to migration of the population from the sparsely populated [[rural]] areas and the densely packed [[Urban area|urban]] areas into [[suburbs]]. The [[industrial economy]] replaced the [[agricultural economy]], leading the population to move from rural locations into urban centers. At the same time, motorization was causing cities to expand because motorized transportation could not support the [[population density]] that the existing [[mass transit]] systems could. Suburbs provided a reasonable compromise between population density and access to a wide variety of employment, goods, and services that were available in the more densely populated urban centers. Further, suburban infrastructure could be built quickly, supporting a rapid transition from a rural/agricultural economy to an industrial/urban economy.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Recent governmental activity in the area of ITS &ndash; specifically in the [[United States]] &ndash; is further motivated by the perceived need for [[homeland security]]. Many of the proposed ITS systems also involve surveillance of the roadways, which is a priority of homeland security.<ref>Monahan, Torin. 2007. "War Rooms" of the Street: Surveillance Practices in Transportation Control Centers. ''The Communication Review'' 10 (4): 367-389.</ref> Funding of many systems comes either directly through homeland security organizations or with their approval. Further, ITS can play a role in the rapid [[mass evacuation]] of people in urban centers after large casualty events such as a result of a natural disaster or threat. Much of the infrastructure and planning involved with ITS parallels the need for homeland security systems.

In the [[developing world]], the migration of people from rural to urbanized habitats has progressed differently. Many areas of the developing world have urbanized without significant motorization and the formation of suburbs. In areas like [[Santiago, Chile]], a high population density is supported by a [[multimodal]] system of walking, [[bicycle]] transportation, [[motorcycle]]s, [[bus]]es, and [[trains]]. A small portion of the population can afford [[automobiles]], but the automobiles greatly increase the congestion in these multimodal transportation systems. They also produce a considerable amount of air pollution, pose a significant safety risk, and exacerbate feelings of inequities in the society.

Other parts of the developing world, such as [[China]], remain largely rural but are rapidly urbanizing and industrializing. In these areas a motorized infrastructure is being developed alongside motorization of the population. Great disparity of wealth means that only a fraction of the population can motorize, and therefore the highly dense multimodal [[transportation system]] for the poor is cross-cut by the highly motorized transportation system for the rich.  The urban infrastructure is being rapidly developed, providing an opportunity to build new systems that incorporate ITS at early stages.

==Intelligent transport technologies==

Intelligent transport systems vary in technologies applied, from basic management systems such as [[car navigation]]; [[traffic signal]] control systems; container management systems; variable message signs; [[automatic number plate recognition]] or [[speed cameras]] to monitor applications, such as security [[CCTV]] systems; and to more advanced applications that integrate live data and feedback from a number of other sources, such as [[parking guidance and information]] systems; weather information; bridge [[deicing]] systems; and the like. Additionally, predictive techniques are being developed in order to allow advanced modeling and comparison with historical baseline data. Some of the constituent technologies typically implemented in ITS are described in the following sections.

===Wireless communications===

Various forms of wireless communications technologies have been proposed for intelligent transportation systems.

[[Radio modem]] communication on [[UHF]] and [[VHF]] frequencies are widely used for short and long range communication within ITS.

Short-range communications (less than 500 yards) can be accomplished using [[IEEE 802.11]] protocols, specifically [[IEEE 802.11p|WAVE]] or the [[Dedicated Short Range Communications]] standard being promoted by the [[Intelligent Transportation Society of America]] and the [[United States Department of Transportation]]. Theoretically, the range of these protocols can be extended using [[Mobile ad-hoc network]]s or [[Mesh networking]]. 

Longer range communications have been proposed using infrastructure networks such as [[WiMAX]] ([[IEEE 802.16]]), [[Global System for Mobile Communications]] (GSM), or [[3G]]. Long-range communications using these methods are well established, but, unlike the short-range protocols, these methods require extensive and very expensive infrastructure deployment. There is lack of consensus as to what business model should support this infrastructure.

===Computational technologies===

Recent advances in [[vehicle electronics]] have led to a move toward fewer, more capable computer processors on a vehicle. A typical vehicle in the early 2000s would have between 20 and 100 individual networked [[microcontroller]]/[[Programmable logic controller]] modules with non-real-time [[operating system]]s. The current trend is toward fewer, more costly [[microprocessor]] modules with hardware [[memory management]] and [[Real-Time Operating System]]s. The new [[embedded system]] [[platforms (computing)|platforms]] allow for more sophisticated [[software application]]s to be implemented, including model-based [[process control]], [[artificial intelligence]], and [[ubiquitous computing]]. Perhaps the most important of these for Intelligent Transportation Systems is [[artificial intelligence]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

===Floating car data/floating cellular data===
{{main|Floating car data}}
Virtually every car contains one or more [[mobile phones]]. These mobile phones routinely transmit their location information to the network – even when no voice connection is established. This allows them to be used as anonymous traffic probes. As the car moves, so does the signal of the mobile phone. By measuring and analyzing network data, using [[triangulation]], pattern matching or cell-sector statistics – in an anonymous format – the data is converted into accurate traffic flow information. With more congestion, there are more cars, more phones, and thus, more probes. In metropolitan areas, the distance between antennas is shorter and, thus, accuracy increases. No infrastructure needs to be built along the road; only the mobile phone network is leveraged. In some metropolitan areas, RFID signals from ETC transponders are used. Floating car data technology provides great advantages over existing methods of traffic measurement: 
* much less expensive than sensors or cameras
* more coverage: all locations and streets
* faster to set up (no work zones) and less maintenance
* works in all weather conditions, including heavy rain
Travel time data on freeways and arterial roadways is also being collected using sensors based on Bluetooth technology.<ref>Tarnoff, Philip John,Bullock, Darcy M, Young, Stanley E, et al. ''Continuing Evolution of Travel Time Data Information Collection and Processing'','''Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2009 Paper #09-2030'''
TRB 88th Annual Meeting Compendium of Papers DVD</ref> Travel times and speed are calculated by comparing the time at which a specific device signal is recorded by pairs of sensors.

===Sensing technologies===

Technological advances in telecommunications and information technology coupled with state-of-the-art microchip, [[RFID]](Radio Frequency Identification), and [[inexpensive]] intelligent [[beacon]] sensing technologies have enhanced the technical capabilities that will facilitate motorist safety benefits for Intelligent transportation systems [[globally]]. Sensing systems for ITS are vehicle and infrastructure based networked systems, e.g., [[Intelligent vehicle technologies]]. Infrastructure sensors are indestructible (such as in-road reflectors) devices that are installed or embedded on the road, or surrounding the road (buildings, posts, and signs for example) as required and may be manually disseminated during preventive [[road construction]] maintenance or by sensor injection machinery for rapid deployment of the embedded radio frequency powered (or [[RFID]]) in-ground road sensors. Vehicle-sensing systems include deployment of infrastructure-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure electronic beacons for identification communications and may also employ the benefits of CCTV [[automatic number plate recognition]] technology at desired intervals in order to increase sustained monitoring of suspect vehicles operating in critical zones.

===Inductive loop detection===

[[Inductive loop]]s can be placed in a roadbed to detect vehicles as they pass over the loop by measuring the vehicle's magnetic field. The simplest detectors simply count the number of vehicles during a unit of time (typically 60 seconds in the [[United States]]) that pass over the loop, while more sophisticated sensors estimate the speed, length, and weight of vehicles and the distance between them. Loops can be placed in a single lane or across multiple lanes, and they work with very slow or stopped vehicles as well as vehicles moving at high-speed.

===Video vehicle detection===

Traffic flow measurement and automatic incident detection using video [[cameras]] is another form of vehicle detection.  Since video detection systems such as those used in [[automatic number plate recognition]] do not involve installing any components directly into the road surface or roadbed, this type of system is known as a "non-intrusive" method of traffic detection.  Video from black-and-white or color cameras is fed into [[processors]] that analyze the changing characteristics of the video image as vehicles pass.  The cameras are typically mounted on [[utility pole|poles]] or structures above or adjacent to the roadway.  Most video detection systems require some initial configuration to "teach" the processor the baseline background image.  This usually involves inputting known measurements such as the distance between [[lane]] lines or the height of the camera above the roadway.  A single video detection processor can detect traffic simultaneously from one to eight cameras, depending on the brand and model. The typical output from a video detection system is lane-by-lane vehicle speeds, counts, and lane occupancy readings.  Some systems provide additional outputs including gap, headway, stopped-vehicle detection, and wrong-way vehicle alarms.

==Intelligent transport applications==
===Electronic toll collection===
[[Image:Chile Costanera Norte crossing downtown Santiago.JPG|thumb|right|[[Electronic toll collection]] at "''Costanera Norte''" Freeway, downtown [[Santiago, Chile]]]]
{{Main|Electronic toll collection}}
[[Electronic toll collection]] (ETC) makes it possible for vehicles to drive through toll gates at traffic speed, reducing congestion at toll plazas and automating toll collection. Originally ETC systems were used to automate toll collection, but more recent innovations have used ETC to enforce [[congestion pricing]] through [[cordon zones]] in city centers and ETC lanes. 

Until recent years, most ETC systems were based on using radio devices in vehicles that would use proprietary protocols to identify a vehicle as it passed under a [[gantry]] over the roadway. More recently there has been a move to standardize ETC protocols around the [[Dedicated Short Range Communications]] protocol that has been promoted for vehicle safety by the [[Intelligent Transportation Society of America]], [[ERTICO]] and [http://www.its-jp.org/english/ ITS Japan].

While communication frequencies and standards do differ around the world, there has been a broad push toward [[vehicle infrastructure integration]] around the 5.9 GHz frequency (802.11.x WAVE).   

Via its National Electronic Tolling Committee representing all jurisdictions and toll road operators, [[ITS Australia]] also facilitated interoperability of toll tags in Australia for the multi-lane free flow tolls roads.

Other systems that have been used include [[barcode]] stickers, [[license plate recognition]], [[Infrared#Communications|infrared communication]] systems, and [[Radio Frequency Identification]] Tags (see [[M6 Toll tag]]).

===High occupancy toll lanes===
[[High-occupancy toll|High occupancy toll lanes (HOT lanes)]] is a road pricing scheme that gives motorists in single-occupant vehicles access to high-occupancy vehicle lanes (or "HOV lanes"). Sometimes, entire roads are designated for the use of HOVs. Tolls are collected either by manned toll booths, automatic number plate recognition, or electronic toll collection systems. Typically, these tolls increase as traffic density and congestion within the tolled lanes increases, a policy known as congestion pricing. The goal of this pricing scheme is to minimize traffic congestion within the lanes

===Emergency vehicle notification systems===
The in-vehicle [[eCall]] is an emergency call generated either manually by the vehicle occupants or automatically via activation of in-vehicle sensors after an accident. When activated, the in-vehicle eCall device will establish an emergency call carrying both voice and data directly to the nearest emergency point (normally the nearest E[[1-1-2]] [[Public-safety answering point]], PSAP). The voice call enables the vehicle occupant to communicate with the trained eCall operator. At the same time, a minimum set of data will be sent to the eCall operator receiving the voice call.

The minimum set of data contains information about the incident, including time, precise location, the direction the vehicle was traveling, and vehicle identification. The pan-European eCall aims to be operative for all new type-approved vehicles as a standard option. Depending on the manufacturer of the eCall system, it could be mobile phone based (Bluetooth connection to an in-vehicle interface), an integrated eCall device, or a functionality of a broader system like navigation, Telematics device, or tolling device. eCall is expected to be offered, at earliest, by the end of 2010, pending standardization by the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] and commitment from large EU member states such as France and the United Kingdom.

===Cordon zones with congestion pricing===
{{Main|Congestion pricing}}
Cordon zones have been implemented in [[Electronic Road Pricing|Singapore]], [[Stockholm congestion tax|Stockholm]], and [[London congestion charge|London]], where a [[congestion pricing|congestion charge]] or fee is collected from vehicles entering a congested city center. This fee or toll is charged automatically using [[electronic toll collection]] or [[automatic number plate recognition]], since stopping the users at conventional toll booths would cause long queues, long delays, and even [[gridlock]]. The main objective of this charge is to reduce traffic congestion within the cordon area.

===Automatic road enforcement===
{{Main|Traffic enforcement camera}}
[[Image:BSB 04 2008 412 ETS.JPG|thumb|right|[[Traffic enforcement camera|Automatic speed enforcement]] gantry or "''Lombada Eletrônica''" with ground sensors at [[Brasilia|Brasilia, D.F]].]]
A traffic enforcement camera system, consisting of a [[camera]] and a [[vehicle]]-monitoring device, is used to detect and identify vehicles disobeying a [[speed limit]] or some other road legal requirement and automatically ticket offenders based on the license plate number. Traffic tickets are sent by mail. Applications include:

* Speed cameras that identify vehicles traveling over the legal [[speed limit]].  Many such devices use [[radar]] to detect a vehicle's speed or electromagnetic loops buried in each lane of the road.
* [[Red light camera]]s that detect vehicles that cross a stop line or designated stopping place while a red [[traffic light]] is showing.
* [[Bus lane]] cameras that identify vehicles traveling in lanes reserved for [[bus]]es. In some jurisdictions, bus lanes can also be used by taxis or vehicles engaged in [[car pooling]].
* [[Level crossing]] cameras that identify vehicles crossing [[railways]] [[at-grade intersection|at grade]] illegally.
* Double white line cameras that identify vehicles crossing these lines.
* [[High-occupancy vehicle lane]] cameras for that identify vehicles violating HOV requirements.
* Turn cameras at intersections where specific turns are prohibited on red. This type of  camera is mostly used in cities or heavy populated areas.

===Variable speed limits===
{{See|Speed limit#Variable speed limits}}
[[Image:Variable speed limit.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Example variable speed limit sign in the United States.]]
Recently some jurisdictions have begun experimenting with variable speed limits which change with road congestion and other factors. Typically such speed limits only change to decline during poor conditions, rather than being improved in good ones. One example is on Britain's [[M25 motorway]], which circumnavigates London.  On the most heavily-traveled {{convert|14|mi|0|adj=on}} section (junction 10 to 16) of the M25 variable speed limits combined with automated enforcement have been in force since 1995.  Initial results indicated savings in journey times, smoother-flowing traffic, and a fall in the number of accidents, so the implementation was made permanent in 1997.  Further trials on the M25 have been thus far proved inconclusive.<ref>{{cite

===Collision avoidance systems===
Japan has installed sensors on its highways to notify motorists that a car is stalled ahead.<ref>[http://www.nilim.go.jp/english/conference/asia2006/8-6.pdf Trend in Road Accidents, Japan]</ref>

===Dynamic Traffic Light Sequence===
Intelligent [[RFID]] traffic control has been developed for dynamic [[traffic light]] sequence. It has circumvented or avoided the problems that usually arise with systems such as those, which use image processing and beam interruption techniques. [[RFID]] technology with appropriate [[algorithm]] and database were applied to a multi vehicle, multi lane and multi road junction area to provide an efficient time management scheme. A dynamic time schedule was worked out for the passage of each column. The simulation has shown that, the dynamic sequence [[algorithm]] has the ability to intelligently adjust itself even with the presence of some extreme cases. The real time operation of the system able to emulate the judgment of a traffic policeman on duty, by considering the number of vehicles in each column and the routing proprieties.<ref>[http://www.scipub.org/fulltext/jcs/jcs47517-524.pdf Dynamic Traffic Light Sequence, Science Publications]</ref>

==ITS World Congress==

The [http://www.itsworldcongress.org/ World Congress and Exhibition on Intelligent Transport Systems] is an annual event, which rotates between Europe, the Americas and the Asia-Pacific region. The 18th ITS World Congress will be held in Orlando, FL, USA from 16&ndash;20, October 2011 with the theme 'Keeping the Economy Moving'.

The 17th ITS World Congress, which took place at the Busan Exhibition & Convention Center from 25&ndash;29, October 2010, in Busan, Korea, centered on the theme, 'Ubiquitous Society with ITS'.

The 16th annual event comes to Sweden for the first time and took place at [[Stockholm International Fairs]] from 21&ndash;25, September 2009. The theme of this prestigious event is ‘ITS in Daily Life’, exploring how ITS can improve everyday mobility with strong emphasis on co-modality.

==Cooperative systems on the road==
{{Refimprovesect|date=May 2008}}
Communication cooperation on the road includes car-to-car, car-to-infrastructure, and vice versa. Data available from vehicles is acquired and transmitted to a server for central fusion and processing. This data can be used to detect events such as rain (wiper activity) and congestion (frequent braking activities). The server processes a driving recommendation dedicated to a single or a specific group of drivers and transmits it wirelessly to vehicles. The goal of cooperative systems is to use and plan communication and sensor infrastructure in order to increase road safety.
The definition of cooperative systems in road traffic is according to the [[European Commission]]:<ref>3rd eSafety Forum, 25 March 2004</ref> 
:"Road operators, infrastructure, vehicles, their drivers and other road users will cooperate to deliver the most efficient, safe, secure and comfortable journey. The vehicle-vehicle and vehicle-infrastructure co-operative systems will contribute to these objectives beyond the improvements achievable with stand-alone systems."
