<html> <head> <title>Prolative case</title></head><body>The '''prolative [[declension|case]]''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''prol'''}}; also '''vialis''' case, [[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''via'''}}) is a [[declension]] of a [[noun]] or [[pronoun]] that has the basic meaning of "by way of".

In the [[Finnish language]], it has a highly restricted, almost fossilized meaning "by (medium of transaction)". For example, "postitse" ("by [[mail|post]]"), "puhelimitse" ("by [[telephone|phone]]"), "meritse" ("by [[sea]]"), "netitse" ("over the Internet").   The prolative is considered more to be an adposition by some Finnish grammarians as a result of the fact that it does not show agreement on adjectives like the other Finnish cases. The case exists in a similar state in the [[Estonian language]].

The '''vialis case''' in [[Eskimo-Aleut languages]] has a similar interpretation, used to express movement using a surface or way. For example, ''by way of or through the house''.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

[[Basque language|Basque]] grammars frequently list the ''nortzat / nortako'' case (suffix ''-tzat'' or ''-tako'') as "prolative" (''prolatiboa'')<ref>Check for example: Ilari Zubiri and Entzi Zubiri's ''Euskal Gramatika Osoa'' (Bilbao: Didaktiker, 1995); the [http://www.habe.org/ikaslearengunea/pdf/Deklinabidea.pdf declension reference] at the website of the Basque Autonomous Government's Institute for Euskaldunization and Alphabetization of Adults (HABE); etc.</ref>. However, the meaning of this case is unrelated to the one just described above for other languages and alternatively has been called "[[essive case|essive]] / [[translative case|translative]]"<ref>Jon D. Patrick, Ilari Zubiri: ''A Student Grammar of Euskara'' (Munich: Lincom Europa, 2001) [http://linguistlist.org/issues/12/12-2831.html]</ref>, as it means "for [something else], as (being) [something else]"; e.g., ''hiltzat eman'' "to give up for dead", ''lelotzat hartu zuten'' "they took him for a fool"<ref>Examples (translated from Spanish) given in Luis Baraiazarra's ''Diccionario 3000 Hiztegia'' (available online at [http://www1.euskadi.net/hizt_3000/ euskadi.net]), under the entry for Spanish "dar" [http://www1.euskadi.net/cgi-bin_m33/DicioIe.exe?Diccionario=CAS&Idioma=CAS&Codigo=7931].</ref>. The meaning "by way of" of the case labelled prolative in the above languages is expressed in Basque by means of the [[instrumental case|instrumental]] (suffix ''-[e]z'').
