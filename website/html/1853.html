Booth was raised in [[Weybridge]], [[Surrey]], and educated at the [[Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School]]. In 1937, he won a scholarship to read mathematics at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]]. Booth left [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] without taking a degree, having become disaffected with [[pure mathematics]] as a subject. He chose an external degree from the [[University of London]] instead, which he obtained with a first.<ref name="Times"/>

From 1943 to 1945, Booth worked as a mathematical physicist in the X-ray team at the [[British Rubber Producers' Research Association]] (BRPRA), [[Welwyn Garden City]], Hertfordshire. In 1945, he moved to [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]], [[University of London]], where Booth's research in [[crystallography]] led him to build some of the first [[electronic computer]]s in the [[United Kingdom]]<ref>[http://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/about/history/booth.html The work of Professor Andrew D.
