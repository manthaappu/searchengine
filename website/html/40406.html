A '''wireless repeater''' is a [[computer networking device]] which acts as a [[repeater]] between a [[wireless router]] and computers. Typical use of a wireless repeater is to add one when your computer is too far away from any of the buildings' other wireless access points. If set up properly it will then extend the range of the local wireless network.  The open source firmware [[DD-WRT]] enables home network routers to function as wireless repeaters.
