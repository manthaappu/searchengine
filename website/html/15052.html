'''Genism''' is the [[hypothesis]] that distinctive human characteristics and capacities are [[genetic determinism|determined by genes]].<ref name="Annas 2003">{{cite paper|    last = Annas | first = George | authorlink = George Annas | title = Genism, Racism, and the Prospect of Genetic Genocide | date = 2003 | url = http://www.gjga.org/inside.asp?a=1&action=item&source=documents&id=19 | accessdate=2008-07-31}}</ref> Genism may also refer to any and all prejudice or discrimination based on the [[genotype]] of a person rather than their individual merits. In some circumstances this type of genism may constitute [[genetic discrimination]], which in some forms is illegal in some countries (see the U.S. [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] of May 21, 2008).

==Popular culture==

'''Genoism''' is a [[neologism]] coined by [[Andrew Niccol]], director and writer of the 1997 film ''[[Gattaca]]'', used to describe unethical and illegal [[genetic discrimination]]. Predictions of physical and mental performance are computed via [[genetics]] from [[DNA]] collected from hair, fingernails, skin flakes, spit swabs, eyelashes, etc.  Upon birth, a number of genetically-induced characteristics are calculated: physical and intellectual capacity, life expectancy, probable successful diseases, and likely causes of death, all determined via [[blood sample]]s and [[genetic testing]]. Job interviews, health insurance purchasing, and even potential dates can be sized up according to the perceived quality of the person's DNA due to advancements in [[genome sequencing]].  This put an ironic twist to [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s [[sexual selection]] for good [[genes]].  According to the movie, "We now have discrimination down to a [[science]]."

{{quote|My father was right. It didn't matter how much I lied on my resume. My real resume was in my cells. Why should anybody invest all that money to train me when there were a thousand other applicants with a far cleaner profile? Of course, it's illegal to discriminate, 'genoism' it's called. But no one takes the law seriously. If you refuse to disclose, they can always take a sample from a door handle or a handshake, even the saliva on your application form. If in doubt, a legal [[drug test]] can just as easily become an illegal peek at your future in the company.|Vincent Freeman ([[Ethan Hawke]])|' 1997}}
