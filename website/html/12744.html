== Pictor PCPaint PIC image format ==

'''[[PICtor PIC image format|PICtor]]''' is an [[graphics file formats|image file format]] developed by [[John Bridges]], the principal author of [[PCPaint]], the first Paintbrush program for the PC. It was also the native file format for [[Pictor Paint]] and [[GRASP (multimedia authoring software)]]  (also by Bridges) and became the first widely accepted [[MS-DOS|DOS]] imaging standard.

The PICtor format is quite well documented, but lacks a programming example like the one below.

// This source code is herewith released by me into the Public Domain.
// Bill Buckels, May 21, 2007
// You have a royalty-free right to use, modify, reproduce and distribute this
// source code and the binaries that it produces in any way you find useful

// this is a highly simplified run length encoder for encoding a raw image block
// of up to 8 bit pixel depth into an encoded block for a Pictor File.
// if the buffer contains all 256 ascii values the LEAST used byte is used for a marker.

// Note also, if you are encoding a planar image such as an ega 4 plane
// image, each bit plane must be split into 4 separate contiguous blocks
// of monochrome data (sometimes referred to a "SEGMENTS") of the height and width
// of the image that you are encoding before encoding takes place (below).
// This is done outside of here.

// The code below works for monochrome, 2 bit CGA, 4 bit EGA, and 8 bit MCGA

// I am assuming a 32 bit Windows platform with a BOOL and a TRUE and a FALSE
// no hardship to compile this in 'nix tho'
#define PICTOR_Int unsigned short // for 32 bit Windows
#define SUCCESS 0
#define FAILURE -1
