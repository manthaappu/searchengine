<html> <head> <title>Weight-balanced tree</title></head><body>A '''weight-balanced binary tree''' is a [[binary tree]] which is balanced based on knowledge of the probabilities of searching for each individual node. Within each [[subtree]], the node with the highest weight appears at the root. This can result in more efficient searching performance.

Construction of such a tree is similar to that of a [[Treap]], but node weights are chosen randomly in the latter.

==The diagram==
In the diagram to the right, the letters represent node ''values'' and the numbers represent node ''weights''. Values are used to order the tree, as in a general [[binary search tree]]. The weight may be thought of as a probability or activity count associated with the node. In the diagram, the root is G because its weight is the greatest in the tree. The left subtree begins with A because, out of all nodes with values that come before G, A has the highest weight. Similarly, N is the highest-weighted node that comes after G.

==Timing analysis== 
A weight balanced tree gives close to optimal values for the expected length of successful search calculations. From the above example we get

ELOSS = depth(node A)*probability(node A) + depth(node C)*probability(node C) + ...

ELOSS =  2*0.17 + 5*0.03 + 4*0.09 + 3*0.12 + 1*0.20 + 3*0.11 + 3*0.10 + 2*0.18

ELOSS = 2.4

This is the expected number of nodes that will be examined before finding the desired node.
