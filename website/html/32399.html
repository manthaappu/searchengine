<html> <head> <title>RollBack Rx</title></head><body>'''RollBack Rx''' is a [[Third party software component|third party]] [[Hard disk drive|disk]] utility for [[Microsoft Windows]], that uses a [[Disk sector|sector]] mapping [[algorithm]] and incremental sector redirection to capture and manage its snapshots. This product is marketed under other names and price points such as EAZ-FIX.

Due to its sector based mapping, RollBack Rx does not recreate [[Computer file|files]] or [[folders]] into a temporary [[Mass storage|drive]] space â€” resulting in a larger capacity of incremental snapshots and faster snapshot times. The RollBack Rx snapshots can be taken manually, on a schedule or when a particular file is executed.

== How it works ==
RollBack Rx installs to the hard drive's [[master boot record]], which loads prior to the Windows [[operating system]], which allows the hard drive to be reverted to a previous snapshot state even in the event that Windows is unable to [[Booting|boot]]. The user can also select to revert to a snapshot from within Windows, which requires a reboot or logoff to take effect.

== Description ==
A [[Snapshot (computer storage)|snapshot]] is a [[bit]]-for-bit map of the hard [[disk sector]]. It is a record of how the PC's hard drive is configured at the time a snapshot is taken. The snapshot includes all files including system, [[data]], [[computer program|programs]], settings, the [[Windows registry|registry]], [[Computer wallpaper|wallpaper]], [[Icon (computing)|icons]], etc.

== Incremental sector redirection ==
RollBack Rx's core [[algorithm]] is based on incremental sector redirection. [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operates at a [[Cluster (file system)|cluster]] level, which consists of multiple disk sectors. RollBack Rx works at the [[disk sector]] level. 

When a snapshot is taken, RollBack Rx freezes sectors to their current data. If Windows attempts to update that particular sector, RollBack Rx grabs the write and redirects it into unprotected sectors. If Windows attempts to delete that sector, Rollback Rx intercepts the delete. Additional snapshots freezes only those sectors that have been written since the last snapshot.

== Incompatible products ==
It can be beneficial to disable RollBack Rx prior to using any Windows [[defragmentation]] utility, as file relocations are treated by RollBack Rx as relatively large data changes and can therefore cause large snapshots. The current version 9.1 does not support any third party disk defragmenter. However, defragmentation can be carried out without disabling RollBack Rx, and the data used can be freed by "re-baselining" (which will cause the removal of all snapshots taken so far).

== Precautions ==
RollBack Rx does not support [[RAID]] or any server-based operating systems. RollBack Rx will not be accessible at bootup if the Master Boot Record is erased or altered. RollBack Rx, being a Windows application, cannot protect the hard drive from changes occurring under DOS or other operating systems (such as Linux).
