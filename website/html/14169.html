<html> <head> <title>Fredkin gate</title></head><body>The '''Fredkin gate''' is a computational circuit suitable for [[reversible computing]], invented by [[Ed Fredkin]]. It is ''universal'', which means that any logical or arithmetic operation can be constructed entirely of Fredkin gates.

The basic Fredkin gate<ref>Brown, Julian, [http://books.google.com/books?id=ECWm59h2pLAC&pg=PAS8 The Quest for the Quantum Computer], New York : Touchstone, 2000.</ref> is a ''controlled swap gate'' that [[function (mathematics)|maps]] three inputs (''C'', ''I''<sub>1</sub>, ''I''<sub>2</sub>) onto three outputs (''C'', ''O''<sub>1</sub>, ''O''<sub>2</sub>). The ''C'' input is mapped directly to the ''C'' output. If ''C'' = 0, no swap is performed; ''I''<sub>1</sub> maps to ''O''<sub>1</sub>, and ''I''<sub>2</sub> maps to ''O''<sub>2</sub>. Otherwise, the two outputs are swapped so that ''I''<sub>1</sub> maps to ''O''<sub>2</sub>, and ''I''<sub>2</sub> maps to ''O''<sub>1</sub>. It is easy to see that this circuit is reversible, i.e., "undoes itself" when run backwards. A generalized ''n''×''n'' Fredkin gate passes its first ''n''-2 inputs unchanged to the corresponding outputs, and swaps its last two outputs if and only if the first ''n''-2 inputs are all 1.

The Fredkin gate is the reversible three-bit gate that swaps the last two bits if the first bit is 1. Its [[truth table]] is shown to the right.

It has the useful property that the numbers of 0s and 1s are conserved throughout, which in the [[billiard-ball computer|billiard ball model]] means the same number of balls are output as input. This corresponds nicely to the [[conservation of mass]] in physics, and helps to show that the model is not wasteful.

== Logic function with XOR and AND gates ==
''O''<sub>1</sub> = ''I''<sub>1</sub> XOR ''S''

''O''<sub>2</sub> = ''I''<sub>2</sub> XOR ''S''

with ''S'' = (''I''<sub>1</sub> XOR ''I''<sub>2</sub>) AND ''C''

== Example ==
Here is a diagram of a three-bit adder implemented using Fredkin gates. The three inputs are A, B and C, supplemented by the constant T and F. In the diagram, the leftmost input (before the colon) swaps the two rightmost inputs if it is true.
