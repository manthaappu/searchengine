<html> <head> <title>Component-Integrated ACE ORB</title></head><body>The '''Component-Integrated ACE ORB''' ('''CIAO''') is a [[CORBA]] Component Model (CCM) implementation built on top of  [[TAO (software)|TAO]].

CIAO is currently aiming to provide component-oriented paradigm to the distributed, real-time, embedded (DRE) system developers by abstracting DRE-critical systemic aspects, such as [[Quality of Service|QoS]] requirements, [[Real-time computing|RT]] policies, as installable/configurable units supported by the component framework. Promoting these DRE-critical aspects as first-class metadata disentangles code for controlling these non-function aspects from application logic and makes DRE system development more flexible. Since mechanisms to support various DRE-critical non-functional aspects can be easily verified, CIAO will also make configuring and managing these aspects easier.
