<html> <head> <title>LIFER/LADDER</title></head><body>'''LIFER/LADDER''' was one of the first database [[natural language processing]] systems. It was designed as a natural language
interface to a database of information about [[US Navy]] ships. This system, as described in a paper by
Hendrix (1978), used a semantic grammar to parse
questions and query a distributed database. 

The LIFER/LADDER system used a [[semantic grammar]]. 

The LIFER/LADDER system could only support simple
one-table queries or multiple table queries with easy
join conditions.<ref>[www.enggjournals.com/ijcse/doc/IJCSE10-02-02-20.pdf NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERY PROCESSING USING SEMANTIC GRAMMAR]</ref>

Some examples of queries it could accept:
*What are the length, width, and draft of the Kitty Hawk?
*When will Reeves achieve readiness rating C2?
*What is the nearest ship to Naples with a doctor on board?
*What ships are carrying cargo for the United States?
*Where are they going?
*Print the American cruisersâ€™ current positions and states of readiness?
