'''CD Player''' is a [[computer program]] that plays audio [[CD]]s using the computer's [[sound card]]. It was included in [[Windows 98]], [[Windows NT 3.51]], [[Windows NT 4.0]] and [[Windows 2000]]. CD Player can be downloaded separately for other versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] as well. It has been removed from modern versions of Windows, starting with [[Windows Me]].

==Features==

When the CD Player is launched, it searches the optical drive looking for [[Compact Disc Audio track|CD Audio Tracks]], looks up disc [[metadata]] with an internet service, and plays the disc. CD recognition, track and artist data can be manually entered and are redisplayed on next load. If no disc is inserted, the message "Data or no disc loaded, Please insert an audio compact disc." is displayed.

==Deluxe CD Player==
''Deluxe CD Player'', a modified version of CD Player with a different skin, was also included in [[Microsoft Plus!#Microsoft Plus! 98|Microsoft Plus! for Windows 98]] and [[Windows 2000]].

==Compatibility==
*The version downloaded from the [http://download.microsoft.com/download/win95upg/cdrom_b/1/w95/en-us/cdply.exe Microsoft website] works on any [[Windows 9x]] operating system such as Windows 95/98/Me.
*To get it working on any [[Windows NT]] operating system such as Windows XP, users can copy these files from a computer running either Windows NT 3.51 or Windows 4.0 for the regular edition, or Windows 2000 for the deluxe edition:
**cdplayer.exe
**cdplayer.cnt
**cdplayer.hlp
*In Windows Vista/7, the time display in CD Player is frozen, resulting in the Time Elapsed/Remaining information and Track number not shown correctly.
