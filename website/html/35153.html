In [[computer science]], '''source code''' is text written in a computer [[programming language]].  Such a language is specially designed to facilitate the work of computer [[programmer]]s, who specify the actions to be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code, which can then be automatically translated to binary [[machine code]] that the computer can directly read and execute.
An [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] translates to machine code and executes it [[on the fly]], while a [[compiler]] only translates to machine code that it stores as [[executable]] files; these can then be executed as a separate step.

Most [[computer application]]s are distributed in a form that includes executable files, but not their source code, which is only useful to a [[computer programmer]] who wishes to understand or modify the program.

The source code which constitutes a [[computer program|program]] is usually held in one or more [[text file]]s stored on a computer's [[hard disk]]; usually these files are carefully arranged into a [[Directory (file systems)|directory tree]], known as a '''source tree'''.  Source code can also be stored in a database (as is common for [[stored procedure]]s) or elsewhere.

Source code also appears in books and other media; often in the form of small [[code snippets]], but occasionally complete code bases; a well-known case is the source code of [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]].

The notion of source code may also be taken more broadly, to include machine code and notations in graphical languages, neither of which are textual in nature.  An example from an article presented on the annual IEEE conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation<ref>[http://www.ieee-scam.org/ SCAM Working Conference], 2001-2010.</ref>:

<blockquote> "For the purpose of clarity ‘'''source code'''’ is taken to mean any fully executable description of a software system. It is therefore so construed as to include machine code, very high level languages and executable graphical representations of systems.<ref>[http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/M.Harman/scam10.pdf  Why Source Code Analysis and Manipulation Will Always Be Important] by [[Mark Harman (computer scientist)|Mark Harman]], 10th IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2010).
Timişoara, Romania, 12–13 September 2010.</ref> "</blockquote>

The '''code base''' of a [[programming]] project is the larger collection of all the source code of all the [[computer program]]s which make up the project.

It has become common practice to maintain code bases in [[version control system]]s.

== Organization ==
The source code for a particular piece of software may be contained in a single file or many files. Though the practice is uncommon, a program's source code can be written in different programming languages.<ref>Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter — Python v2.6 Documentation [http://docs.python.org/extending/]</ref> For example, a program written primarily in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], might have portions written in [[assembly language]] for optimization purposes. It is also possible for some components of a piece of software to be written and compiled separately, in an arbitrary programming language, and later integrated into the software using a technique called [[library linking]]. This is the case in some languages, such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]]: each class is compiled separately into a file and linked by the interpreter at runtime.

Yet another method is to make the main program an interpreter for a programming language{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}, either designed specifically for the application in question or general-purpose, and then write the bulk of the actual user functionality as [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] or other forms of add-ins in this language, an approach taken for example by the [[GNU Emacs]] text editor.

Moderately complex software customarily requires the compilation or assembly of several, sometimes dozens or even hundreds, of different source code files. In these cases, instructions for compilations, such as a [[Makefile]], are included with the source code. These describe the relationships among the source code files, and contain information about how they are to be compiled.

The [[revision control]] system is another tool frequently used by developers for source code maintenance.

== Purposes ==
Source code is primarily used as input to the process that produces an executable program (i.e., it is [[compiler|compiled]] or [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreted]]). It is also used as a method of communicating [[algorithm]]s between people (e.g., [[code snippets]] in books).<ref name=Spinellis>Spinellis, D: ''Code Reading: The Open Source Perspective''. Addison-Wesley Professional, 2003. ISBN 0-201-79940-5</ref>

[[Programmers]] often find it helpful to review existing source code to learn about programming techniques.<ref name=Spinellis/> The sharing of source code between developers is frequently cited as a contributing factor to the maturation of their programming skills.<ref name=Spinellis/> Some people consider source code an expressive [[Media (arts)|artistic medium]].<ref>"''Art and Computer Programming''" [http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/06/30/artofprog.html ONLamp.com], (2005)</ref>

[[Porting]] software to other [[computer platform]]s is usually prohibitively difficult without source code. Without the source code for a particular piece of software, portability is generally computationally expensive {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}.  Possible porting options include [[binary translation]] and emulation of the original platform.

[[Decompilation]] of an executable program can be used to generate source code, either in [[assembly code]] or in a [[high level language]].

Programmers frequently adapt source code from one piece of software to use in other projects, a concept known as [[software reusability]].

== Licensing ==
{{main|software license}}
Software, and its accompanying source code, typically falls within one of two licensing paradigms: [[free software]] and [[proprietary software]].

Generally speaking, software is ''free'' if the source code is free to use, distribute, modify and study, and ''proprietary'' if the source code is kept secret, or is privately owned and restricted. Note that "free" refers to freedom, not price. Under many licenses it is acceptable to charge for "free software". The first free software license to be published and to explicitly grant these freedoms was the [[GNU General Public License]] in 1989. The GNU GPL was originally intended to be used with the [[GNU operating system]]. The GNU GPL was later adopted by other non-GNU software projects such as the [[Linux kernel]].

For proprietary software, the provisions of the various copyright laws, [[trade secret|trade secrecy]] and [[patent]]s are used to keep the source code closed.  Additionally, many pieces of [[retail software]] come with an [[Software license agreement|end-user license agreement]] (EULA) which typically prohibits [[decompilation]], [[reverse engineering]], analysis, modification, or circumventing of [[copy protection]].  Types of source code protection &mdash; beyond traditional [[compiler|compilation]] to [[object code]] &mdash;  include code encryption, [[code obfuscation]] or [[code morphing]].

== Legal issues in the United States ==
{{update|date=November 2010}}
In a 2003 court case in the United States, it was ruled that source code should be considered a constitutionally protected form of [[free speech]]. Proponents of free speech argued that because source code conveys information to programmers, is written in a language, and can be used to share humour and other artistic pursuits, it is a protected form of communication.

One of the first court cases regarding the nature of source code as free speech involved [[University of California]] [[mathematics]] professor [[Dan Bernstein]], who had published on the internet the source code for an [[encryption]] program that he created. At the time, encryption algorithms were classified as [[munition]]s by the United States government; exporting encryption to other countries was considered an issue of [[national security]], and had to be approved by the [[United States Department of State|State Department]]. The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] sued the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] on Bernstein's behalf; the court ruled that source code was free speech, protected by the First Amendment.

== Quality ==
{{main|Software quality}}
The way a program is written can have important consequences for its maintainers. [[Coding conventions]], which stress readability and some language-specific conventions, are aimed at the maintenance of the software source code, which involves debugging and updating. Other priorities, such as the speed of the programs execution, or the ability to compile the program for multiple architectures, often make code readability a less important consideration, since code ''quality'' depends entirely on its ''purpose''.
