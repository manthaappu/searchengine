The VH Dissector is a software application for anatomy instruction and visualization created by Touch of Life Technologies. The VH Dissector is based on the [[Visible Human Project]] dataset, and contains the original cross section images as well as a 3D model built from the stacked cross sections. The VH Dissector provides a simulated dissection experience by allowing the user to add and remove structures from the 3D dissection. As well, structures within the dissection and cross sections can be highlighted for better visualization. The dissector contains a content development and presentation platform also, in the form of lessons integrated into the VH Dissector. There are multiple lesson packs available for purchase, including the Cadaver Dissection Guide, Suface Palpation Gude, Virtual Edge and Anatomy Pathways. In addition to paid content, the VH Dissector includes access to free online lessons including the Clinical Relevance Library, a collection of short lessons describing common procedures and conditions with an emphasis on underlying anatomy.

The VH Dissector is currently being used at a number of allopathic<ref name="fogg2007"/> and osteopathic medical schools, nursing programs, physicians assistant programs, as well as being used for undergraduate and K-12 anatomy and biology instruction.
