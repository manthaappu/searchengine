'''eCos''' (''embedded configurable operating system'') is an [[open source]], royalty-free, [[real-time operating system]] intended for [[embedded system]]s and applications which need only one [[Process (computing)|process]] with [[Thread (computer science)|multiple threads]]. It is designed to be customizable to precise application requirements of run-time performance and hardware needs. It is implemented in [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]] and has [[emulator|compatibility]] layers and [[Application programming interface|API]]s for [[POSIX]] and [[TRON Project|µITRON]].

== Design ==

eCos was designed for devices with memory size in the tens to hundreds of [[kilobyte]]s<ref>{{Cite news|last=Larmour|first=Jonathan|title=How eCos can be shrunk to fit|newspaper=Embedded Systems Europe|pages=34|date=May 2005|url=http://i.cmpnet.com/embedded/europe/esemay05/esemay05p32.pdf|format=PDF|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>, or with real-time requirements. It can be used on hardware with too little [[Random Access Memory|RAM]] to support [[Embedded system|embedded]] [[Linux]], which currently needs a minimum of about 2 MB of RAM, not including application and service needs.

eCos runs on a  wide variety of hardware platforms, including [[ARM architecture|ARM]], [[CalmRISC]], [[FR-V]], [[Hitachi H8]], [[IA-32]], [[Motorola 68000]], [[Matsushita AM3x]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[NEC V8xx]], [[Nios II]], [[PowerPC]], [[SPARC]], and [[SuperH]].

Included with the eCos distribution is [[RedBoot]], an [[open source]] [[application software|application]] that uses the eCos [[Hardware Abstraction Layer]] to provide [[booting|bootstrap]] [[firmware]] for [[embedded system]]s.

==History==
eCos was initially developed by [[Cygnus Solutions]] which was later bought by [[Red Hat]]. In early 2002, Red Hat ceased development of eCos and laid off the staff that were working on the project<ref>{{cite news|title=Red Hat backs away from eCos?|publisher=linuxdevices.com|date=2002-06-19|url=http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS5933176616.html|accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref>. Many of the laid-off staff continued to work on eCos, and some formed their own companies providing services for the software. In January 2004, at the request of the eCos developers, Red Hat agreed to transfer its eCos copyrights to the [[Free Software Foundation]]<ref>{{cite press release|title=Red Hat to contribute copyrights held in the eCos code base to the Free Software Foundation|publisher=Red Hat|date=2004-01-13|url=http://www.redhat.com/about/presscenter/2004/press_eCosFSF.html}}</ref>. The transfer was executed in October 2005 and finally implemented in May 2008.

==Non-free versions==
'''eCosPro''' is a [[proprietary software|proprietary]] eCos and [[RedBoot]] distribution created by [[eCosCentric]] that is targeted towards developers looking to integrate eCos and [[RedBoot]] within commercial products. It is claimed as a "stable, fully tested, certified and supported version"<ref>{{cite press release|title=eCosCentric announces eCosPro Developer's Kit|publisher=OSNews|date=2003-09-02|url=http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=4395|accessdate=2007-03-31}}</ref>, however, some of the additional features have not been released as free software.

==Criticisms==
The [[FreeBSD]] TCP/IP network stack port included with eCos is out of date—circa 2001—and exposes systems using such to numerous security and stability vulnerabilities (FreeBSD RELENG 4 4 0 RELEASE for IPv4 and FreeBSD's origin [[KAME project|KAME]] for IPv6), despite being claimed as "recent" in [http://ecos.sourceware.org/docs-latest/ref/tcpip-freebsd.html eCos documentation].  Official eCos maintainers do not appear to monitor FreeBSD or KAME for security or stability updates, but rather rely on minimal and insufficient bug reports from users of eCos.

The [[SNMP]] package is rudimentary at best, once again, apparently due to its age.
