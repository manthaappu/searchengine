'''Google Translate''' is a free [[Statistical machine translation|statistical]] [[machine translation]] service provided by [[Google|Google Inc.]] to translate a section of text, document or webpage, into another language. 

The service was introduced in 2007. Prior to that Google used a [[SYSTRAN]] based translator<ref>[http://searchengineland.com/google-translate-drops-systran-for-home-brewed-translation-12502 Google Translate Drops Systran For Home Brewed Translation] 23/12/2007 , Barry Schwartz , ''searchengineland.com''</ref>  which is used by other translation services such as [[Babel Fish (website)|Babel Fish]], [[AOL]], and [[Yahoo!|Yahoo]].

==Features and limitations==
The service limits the number of paragraphs, or range of technical terms, that will be translated. It is also possible to enter searches in a source language that are first translated to a destination language allowing you to browse and interpret results from the selected destination language in the source language.<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://translate.google.com/ 
|title=Google Translate
|accessdate=2009-01-24
|publisher=Google
}}</ref> For some languages, users are asked for alternate translations such as for technical terms, to be included for future updates to the translation process. Text in a foreign language can be typed, and if "Detect Language" is selected, it will not only detect the language but also translate it into English by default.

Google Translate, like other automatic translation tools, has its limitations. While it can help the reader to understand the general content of a foreign language text, it does not always deliver accurate translations. Some languages produce better results than others. As of 2010, French to English translation is very good;<ref name="tr1">[http://www.tcworld.info/index.php?id=175 Comparison of online machine translation tools] 6/2010 , Ethan Shen , ''www.tcworld.info''</ref> however, rule-based machine translations perform better if the text to be translated is shorter; this effect is particularly evident in Chinese to English translations.<ref name="tr1"/> 

Texts written in the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Devanagari]], [[Cyrillic]] and [[Arabic script|Arabic]] scripts can be transliterated automatically from phonetic equivalents written in the [[Latin alphabet]].

=== Browser integration ===
A number of [[List of Firefox extensions#Google|Firefox extensions]] exist for Google services, and likewise for Google Translate, which allow right-click command access to the translation service.

An extension for Google's Chrome browser also exists;<ref>[https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb?hl=en Google Translate by chrome.translate.extension] ''chrome.google.com''</ref> in February 2010, Google translate was integrated into the standard Google Chrome browser for automatic webpage translation.<ref>[http://www.ghacks.net/2010/02/07/google-translate-integrated-in-google-chrome-5/ Google Translate Integrated In Google Chrome 5]</ref><ref>[http://stuff.techwhack.com/8388-google-chrome-5-translate Google Chrome 5 features an integrated Google Translate service] 15/2/2010 , ''stuff.techwhack.com''</ref>

===Android version===
Created by Google Inc. Google translate avaliable as free downloadable application for [[Android_(operating_system)|Android OS]] users. The first version was launched in January 2010. It works simply like browser version. Google translation for Android contains two main options "SMS translation" and "History". 
Current verison also supports Conversation Mode in alpha testing when translating between English and Spanish. This is a new interface within Google Translate that allows to communicate fluidly with a nearby person in another language.
Application supports 53 languages and voice input for 15 languages. Application is available for devices running Android 2.1 and above and can be downloaded by searching for “Google Translate” in [[Android_Market|Android Market]].

==Translation methodology ==

Google Translate does not apply [[Grammar|grammatical]] rules, since its algorithms are based on statistical analysis rather than traditional rule-based analysis. Indeed, the system's original creator, [[Franz Josef Och]], has criticized the effectiveness of rule-based algorithms in favor of empirical approaches.<ref name="och_2005">{{citation | first = Franz Josef | last = Och | contribution = Statistical Machine Translation: Foundations and Recent Advances | title = The Tenth Machine Translation Summit | place = Phuket, Thailand | date = [[2005-09-12]] | id = | contribution-url = http://www.mt-archive.info/MTS-2005-Och.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-12-19}}</ref> It is based on a method called [[statistical machine translation]], and more specifically, on research by Och who won the [[DARPA]] contest for speed machine translation in 2003. He is now the head of Google's machine translation group.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.google.com/research/pubs/och.html | title = Franz Josef Och | accessdate = 2010-12-19 | publisher = [[Google]] | quote = "Franz Josef Och joined Google in 2004 as a research scientist, where he leads the machine translation group."}}</ref>

According to Och, a solid base for developing a usable statistical machine translation system for a new pair of languages from scratch, would consist in having a bilingual [[text corpus]] (or [[parallel text|parallel collection]]) of more than a million words and two monolingual corpora of each more than a billion words.<ref name="och_2005" /> Statistical [[Mathematical model|models]] from this data are then used to translate between those languages. 

To acquire this huge amount of linguistic data, Google used [[United Nations]] documents.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSN1921881520070328 Google seeks world of instant translations] ([[Reuters]])</ref> The UN typically publishes documents in all six [[Official languages of the United Nations|official UN languages]], which has produced a very large 6-language corpus.

Google representatives have been involved with domestic conferences in Japan where it has solicited bilingual data from researchers.<ref>Google was an official sponsor of the annual Computational Linguistics in Japan Conference ("[[Gengoshorigakkai]]") in 2007. Google also sent a delegate from its headquarters to the meeting of the members of the Computational Linguistic Society of Japan in March 2005, promising funding to researchers who would be willing to share text data.</ref>

===Translation mistakes and oddities===
Because Google Translate uses statistical matching to translate rather than a dictionary/grammar rules approach, translated text can often include apparently nonsensical and obvious errors,<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/0809/technology-computer-learning-google-translate.html Google Translate Tangles With Computer Learning] Lee Gomes , Forbes Magazine , 9/8/2010</ref> often swapping common terms for similar but nonequivalent common terms in the other language,<ref>[http://google.blognewschannel.com/archives/2007/09/10/google-translates-ivan-the-terrible-as-abraham-lincoln/ Google Translates Ivan the Terrible as “Abraham Lincoln”] ''google.blognewschannel.com''</ref> as well as inverting sentence meaning.<ref>[http://www.mn.ru/news/20100128/55406807.html Google Lost in Translation] 28/01/2010 , Alyona Topolyanskaya , ''www,mn.ru''</ref>
====Easter Eggs====
On 'English to German' translating, typing in 'pv zk pv pv zk pv zk kz zk pv pv pv zk pv zk zk pzk pzk pvzkpkzvpvzk kkkkkk bsch' will give a 'beatbox' function.<ref>http://www.geekosystem.com/how-to-make-google-translate-beatbox/</ref><ref>http://translate.google.com/#de|de|pv%20zk%20pv%20pv%20zk%20pv%20zk%20kz%20zk%20pv%20pv%20pv%20zk%20pv%20zk%20zk%20pzk%20pzk%20pvzkpkzvpvzk%20kkkkkk%20bsch%0A%0A</ref>
