<html> <head> <title>Silicon Fen</title></head><body>'''Silicon Fen''' (sometimes '''the Cambridge Cluster''') is the name given to the region around [[Cambridge]], [[England]], which is home to a large [[business cluster|cluster]] of [[high-tech]] [[business]]es, especially those related to [[software]], [[electronics]], and [[biotechnology]]. Many of these have connections with the [[University of Cambridge]], and the area is now one of the most important technology centres in [[Europe]]. 

It is called "Silicon Fen" by analogy with [[Silicon Valley]] in [[California]], because it lies at the south of [[The Fens|Fenland]].

==Business growth==
In 2004, 24% of all UK [[venture capital]] (9% of all the EU's) was received by Silicon Fen companies, according to the Cambridge Cluster Report 2004 produced by Library House and Grant Thornton. 

The so-called ''Cambridge phenomenon'', giving rise to start-up companies in a town previously only having a little light industry in the [[electrical engineering|electrical sector]], is usually dated to the founding of the [[Cambridge Science Park]] in 1970: this was an initiative of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and moved away from a traditional low-development policy for Cambridge.

The characteristic of Cambridge is small companies (as few as three people, in some cases) in sectors such as [[computer-aided design]]. Over time the number of companies has grown; it has not proved easy to count them, but recent estimates have placed the number anywhere between 1,000 and 3,500 companies.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} They are spread over an area defined perhaps by the CB [[postcode]] or 01223 [[telephone]] [[area code]], or more generously in an area bounded by [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]], [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]], [[Saffron Walden]], [[Royston, Hertfordshire|Royston]] and [[Huntingdon]].

In February 2006, the [[Judge Business School]] reported estimates that suggested that at that time, there were around 250 active start-ups directly linked to the University, valued at around US$6 billion.  Only a tiny proportion of these companies have so far grown into [[multinational corporation|multinational]]s: [[ARM Ltd|ARM]] and [[Autonomy Corporation]] are the most obvious examples, and more recently [[Cambridge Silicon Radio|CSR]] has seen rapid growth due to the uptake of [[Bluetooth]].

==Area characteristics==
The region has one of the most flexible job markets in the technology sector, and people are often employed by other companies after a start-up fails. Although everyone wants their company to succeed, failures are tolerated, indeed almost expected.

One explanation for the area's success is that after a while such an employment market is self-sustaining, since employees are willing to move to an area that promises a future beyond any one company. Another factor is the high degree of 'networking', enabling people across the region to find partners, jobs, funding, and know-how. Organisations have sprung up to facilitate this process, for example the [[Cambridge Network]].

Another explanation is that Cambridge has the academic pre-eminence of [[Cambridge University]], a high [[standard of living]] available in the county, good transport links, and a relatively low incidence of social problems such as [[crime]] and [[hard and soft drugs|hard drug]] use. Many graduates from the university choose to stay on in the area, giving local companies a rich pool of talent to draw upon {{Fact|date=November 2008}}. The high-technology industry has little by way of competition, unlike say in [[Oxfordshire]] where plenty of other competing industries exist. Because Cambridgeshire was not until recently a high-technology centre, commercial rents were generally lower than in other parts of the UK, giving companies a head-start on those situated in other more expensive regions; this has, however, recently changed and Cambridgeshire now has one of the highest costs of living in the UK outside London.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

A downside is that lower-skilled workers may find it hard to find jobs, or to afford living costs.
