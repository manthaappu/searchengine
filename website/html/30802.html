<html> <head> <title>Quantum fingerprinting</title></head><body>'''Quantum fingerprinting''' is a proposed technique that uses a [[quantum computer]] to generate a string with a similar function to the [[cryptographic hash function]].

If unconditional guarantees of security are needed, and if it is impractical for the communicating parties to arrange to share a secret that can be used in a [[Carter-Wegman MAC]], this technique might one day be faster than classical techniques given a [[quantum computer]] with 5 to 10 [[qubit]]s.  However, these circumstances are very unusual and it is unlikely the technique will ever have a practical application; it is largely of theoretical interest.
