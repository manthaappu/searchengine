<html> <head> <title>IFSP</title></head><body>'''IFSP''' ({{lang-de|Interface sternförmig parallel}}, {{lang-ru|Интерфейс радиальный параллельный (ИРПР)}}),  radial parallel interface, was a [[Parallel port|parallel]] [[Interface (computer science)|interface]]  similar to [[Centronics]] but incompatible, as it had different signal polarities and handshake protocol. Used in [[printer (computing)|printer]]s and [[computer]]s manufactured in [[Comecon]].

All printer input signal lines were pulled up to +5V by 220 [[Ohm]] [[resistor]], and pulled down to ground by 330 [[Ohm]] resistor. This allowed usage of longer cables comparing to [[Centronics]], but overloaded most usual '''Centronics''' adapters.

Some devices allowed switching between '''IFSP''' and '''Centronics''' modes, i.e. [[Robotron]] 6319—6329 were manufactured with interchangeable interface modules, allowed usage of '''IFSP''', [[IFSS]] and [[Centronics]].
