'''FOAF''' (an acronym of '''[[Friend of a friend]]''') is a [[machine-readable]] [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] describing [[person]]s, their activities and their relations to other people and objects. Anyone can use FOAF to describe him or herself. FOAF allows groups of people to describe [[social networks]] without the need for a centralised database.

FOAF is a descriptive vocabulary expressed using the [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF) and the [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL). Computers may use these FOAF profiles to find, for example, all people living in Europe, or to list all people both you and a friend of yours know<ref>[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-foaf.html XML Watch: Finding friends with XML and RDF] by Edd Dumbill in [[IBM DeveloperWorks]]</ref><ref>[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-foaf2.html XML Watch: Support online communities with FOAF] by Edd Dumbill in [[IBM DeveloperWorks]]</ref>. This is accomplished by defining relationships between people. Each profile has a unique identifier (such as the person's [[e-mail address]]es, a [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|Jabber ID]], or a [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]] of the homepage or weblog of the person), which is used when defining these relationships.

The FOAF project, which defines and extends the vocabulary of a FOAF profile, was started in 2000 by [[Libby Miller]] and [[Dan Brickley (computer scientist)|Dan Brickley]]. It can be considered the first [[Social Semantic Web]] application, in that it combines RDF technology with 'Social Web' concerns.

[[Tim Berners-Lee]] in a 2007 essay <ref>[http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/215 Giant Global Graph], Tim Berners Lee</ref> redefined the [[Semantic web]] concept into something he calls the [[Giant Global Graph]], where relationships transcend networks/documents. He considers the GGG to be on equal grounds with [[Internet]] and [[World Wide Web]], stating that "I express my network in a FOAF file, and that is a start of the revolution."

==FOAF+SSL==
FOAF+SSL<ref>[http://esw.w3.org/topic/foaf+ssl FOAF+SSL] decentralized authentication protocol.</ref> is the decentralized secure authentication protocol utilizing the FOAF profile information as well as the [[Transport Layer Security|SSL security layer]] usually available in virtually all modern web browsers. It was first presented<ref>[http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/foaf_ssl_adding_security_to foaf+ssl: adding security to open distributed social networks] - for the "[http://www.w3.org/2008/09/msnws/ W3C Workshop on the Future of Social Networking]", which took place in Barcelona January 2009</ref> for the W3C Workshop on the Future of Social Networking in 2009. Contrary to the usual SSL utilization patterns, it does not require<ref>http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/more_on_authorization_in_foaf - foaf+ssl: creating a web of trust without key signing parties</ref> the dedicated key signing parties such as [[Certificate authority]] to perform the user authorization.

==Deployment== 
Being an early example of a Semantic Web application, and having a relatively simple use-case and standard has led FOAF to be adopted widely on the web. For example, the [[Live Journal]] and [[DeadJournal]] blogging sites exports FOAF profiles for all their members<ref>Details on LiveJournal FOAF, http://community.livejournal.com/ljfoaf</ref>, [[My Opera]] community exports FOAF profiles for the members as well as for the groups, the FOAF support is known to be present on [[Identi.ca]], [[MyBlogLog]], [[FriendFeed]], [[TypePad]] services, as well as on various other ones<ref>[http://wiki.foaf-project.org/w/DataSources Known FOAF data providers].</ref>.
[[Yandex]] blog search platform supports<ref>[http://company.yandex.com/press_center/press_releases/2008/2008-08-15.xml Yandex press release] on the social networking support.</ref> search over the FOAF profile information. The prominent client-side FOAF support is available in [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]]<ref>[http://ejohn.org/blog/foaf-support-in-safari-rss/ FOAF Support in Safari RSS]</ref> web browser, in the Semantic Radar<ref>[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3886 Semantic Radar] plugin for Firefox browser</ref> plugin for [[Firefox (web browser)|Firefox]] browser, and in the RDF Detective<ref>[https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ghenajlebmgkoohljekdpahbnejiijfm RDF Detective] plugin for Google Chrome</ref> plugin for [[Google Chrome]].

There are also modules or plugins to support FOAF profiles or FOAF+SSL authorization for programming languages<ref>http://search.cpan.org/~btrott/XML-FOAF-0.03/lib/XML/FOAF.pm - FOAF support module for Perl</ref><ref>http://search.cpan.org/~tobyink/CGI-Auth-FOAF_SSL-0.52/lib/CGI/Auth/FOAF_SSL.pm - FOAF+SSL authentication support for Perl</ref>, as well as for content management systems<ref>http://drupal.org/project/foaf - FOAF support for [[Drupal]]</ref>.

==Example==
The following FOAF profile (written in [[Turtle (syntax)|Turtle]] format) states that [[Jimmy Wales]] is the name of the person described here. His e-mail address, homepage and depiction are [[Resource (Web)|resources]], which means that each of them can be described using RDF as well. He has Wikimedia as an interest, and knows [[Angela Beesley]] (which is the name of a 'Person' resource).
