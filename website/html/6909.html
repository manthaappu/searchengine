Named in honor of the crew who died in the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]], '''Columbia''' is a [[supercomputer]] built by [[Silicon Graphics]] for [[NASA]]. Its main purpose was to simulate the violent collision and merger of spiral galaxies that lead to the formation of elliptical galaxies. It is connected to the [[NASA Research and Engineering Network]] and was installed at the [[NASA Advanced Supercomputing facility]] in 2004.

According to the [[TOP500]] list of the fastest supercomputers, it entered the list in November 2004 at position 2,<ref>

each of which has 512 [[Intel Corporation|Intel]] [[Itanium 2]] [[central processing unit|processor]]s bringing the total number of processors to 10,240.
It has 20 terabytes of memory (Provided by [[Dataram]]), 440 terabytes of storage, and 10 petabytes of archive storage.<ref name=facts>{{cite web |date=2007-01-31 |title=Columbia System Facts |publisher=NASA |url=http://www.nas.nasa.gov/Resources/Systems/columbia.html |accessdate=2007-03-27 }}</ref>

The SGI Altix platform was selected due to a positive experience with [[Kalpana (supercomputer)|Kalpana]], a single Altix 512-CPU system operated by NASA Ames which was integrated into the Columbia supercomputer system.

The computers are connected together with a Voltaire [[InfiniBand]] ISR 9288 288 port [[network switch|switch]] with transfer speeds of up to 10 [[gigabit]]s (or 12500 [[megabyte]]s) per second, [[10 Gigabit Ethernet]] and multiple 1 gigabit Ethernet nodes.
