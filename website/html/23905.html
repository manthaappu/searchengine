It is a guarantee by the transferring [[financial institution]] that the signature is genuine and the financial institution accepts [[legal liability|liability]] for any forgery. Signature guarantees protect [[shareholder]]s by preventing unauthorized transfers and possible [[investor]] losses. They also limit the liability of the [[transfer agent]] who accepts the certificates. 

Different institutions have different policies as to what type of identification they require to provide the guarantee and whether they charge a fee for such service (usually nominal if any.) Most institutions will not guarantee a signature of someone who has not already been their customer. 

A medallion signature guarantee is not the same as an acknowledgment by a [[notary public]], in the sense that a "signature guarantee" is a certification by the institution that the signature is authentic, and an acknowledgment is a certification by a notary public attesting that the signer signed a document voluntarily.
