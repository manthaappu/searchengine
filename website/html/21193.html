The '''Konami LaserScope''' is a head-mounted [[light gun]] used with and licensed for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] [[video game console]]. [[Konami]] originally released the peripheral in 1990, in [[Japan]] for the [[Famicom]] under the name '''Gun Sight'''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The LaserScope was manufactured specifically for one [[Konami]] game, ''[[Laser Invasion]]'', but could be used with any game that used the [[NES Zapper]] as a peripheral.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The system did not use an actual gun, but instead was a headset with a microphone and a laser-guided crosshair that covered one eye.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nesplayer.com/database/accessories/laserscope.htm |title=Accessories: Konami Laser Scope |publisher=NES Player |date= |accessdate=2010-08-17}}</ref> The LaserScope was powered through the audio port of the NES, which enabled the user to hear the game audio as well. All a user was required to do was say "fire" and the gun, supposedly, would fire at the target. However, the peripheral would often malfunction and fire at any background noise, which led to the negative reception the LaserScope eventually received.
