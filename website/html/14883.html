'''GemStone''' is a proprietary [[application framework]] that was first available for [[Smalltalk]] as an [[object database]].

GemStone Systems was founded in 1982 as Servio Logic, and then became GemStone Systems, Inc in 1995. GemStone developed its first prototype in 1982, and shipped its first product in 1986.  The engineering group resides in [[Beaverton, Oregon]]. Three of the original co-founding engineers, Bob Bretl, Allen Otis and Monty Williams, have been with the company since its inception.  

GemStone's owners pioneered implementing [[distributed computing]] in business systems{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}. Many information system features now associated with [[Java EE]] were implemented earlier in GemStone.  GemStone and VisualWave were an early [[web application]] server platform (VisualWave and [[VisualWorks]] are now owned by [[Cincom]].)  GemStone played an important sponsorship role in the Smalltalk Industry Council at the time when [[IBM]] was backing VisualAge Smalltalk (VA is now at [http://www.instantiations.com Instantiations]).  After a major transition, GemStone for Smalltalk continues as "GemStone/S" and various [[C++]] and Java products for scalable, multi-tier [[distributed systems]]. GemStone Systems, Inc. now develops and markets GemFire, which is notable for CEP ([[complex event processing]]), [[Event Stream Processing]], data virtualization and distributed caching.

Gemstone builds on the [[Smalltalk programming language]]. Although Gemstone isn't often mentioned in print, GemStone systems serve as mission-critical applications<ref>[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.smalltalk/msg/9560a50c14522f13 Slovenian national gas operator has its billing system running on Smalltalk for 10 years]</ref> even though many computing industry business publications focus attention on other ecosystems and languages, such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] or [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] for [[Microsoft .NET]] for new development. GemStone frameworks still see some interest for [[web service]]s and [[service-oriented architecture]]s.

A recent revival of interest in Smalltalk has occurred as a result of its use to generate Javascript for e-commerce web pages or in [[web application framework]]s such as the [[Seaside web framework]]. Systems based on [[object database]]s are not as common as those based on ORM or [[Object-relational mapping]] frameworks such as [[TopLink]] or [[Hibernate (Java)|Hibernate]]. In the area of web application frameworks, [[JBoss]] and [[BEA Weblogic]] are somewhat analogous to GemStone.
