'''Electronic commerce''', commonly known as '''e-commerce''' or '''eCommerce''', consists of the buying and selling of [[product (business)|product]]s or [[Service (economics)|service]]s over electronic systems such as the Internet and other [[computer network]]s. The amount of trade conducted electronically has grown extraordinarily with  widespread Internet usage. The use of commerce is conducted in this way, spurring and drawing on innovations in [[electronic funds transfer]], [[supply chain management]], [[Internet marketing]], [[online transaction processing]], [[electronic data interchange]] (EDI), [[inventory management]] systems, and automated data collection systems. Modern electronic commerce typically uses the [[World Wide Web]] at least at some point in the transaction's lifecycle, although it can encompass a wider range of technologies such as [[e-mail]] as well.


A large percentage of electronic commerce is conducted entirely electronically for [[virtual]] items such as access to premium content on a website, but most electronic commerce involves the transportation of physical items in some way. Online retailers are sometimes known as [[e-tailer]]s and online retail is sometimes known as '''e-tail'''. Almost all big retailers have electronic commerce presence on the [[World Wide Web]].

Electronic commerce that is conducted between businesses is referred to as [[business-to-business]] or B2B. B2B can be open to all interested parties (e.g. [[commodity exchange]]) or limited to specific, pre-qualified participants ([[private electronic market]]). Electronic commerce that is conducted between businesses and consumers, on the other hand, is referred to as [[business-to-consumer]] or [[B2C]]. This is the type of electronic commerce conducted by companies such as [[Amazon.com]]. [[Online shopping]] is a form of electronic commerce where the buyer is directly online to the seller's computer usually via the internet. There is no intermediary service. The sale and purchase transaction is completed electronically and interactively in real-time such as Amazon.com for new books. If an intermediary is present, then the sale and purchase transaction is called electronic commerce such as [[eBay.com]].

Electronic commerce is generally considered to be the sales aspect of [[e-business]]. It also consists of the exchange of data to facilitate the financing and payment aspects of the business transactions.

==History==
====Early development====
Originally, electronic commerce was identified as the facilitation of commercial transactions electronically, using technology such as Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). These were both introduced in the late 1970s, allowing businesses to send commercial documents like purchase orders or invoices electronically. The growth and acceptance of credit cards, automated teller machines (ATM) and telephone banking in the 1980s were also forms of electronic commerce. Another form of e-commerce was the airline reservation system typified by Sabre in the USA and Travicom in the UK.

From the 1990s onwards, electronic commerce would additionally include [[enterprise resource planning]]  systems (ERP), [[data mining]] and [[data warehousing]]. 

In 1990, [[Tim Berners-Lee]] invented the [[WorldWideWeb]] [[web browser]] and transformed an academic telecommunication network into a worldwide everyman everyday communication system called internet/www. Commercial enterprise on the [[Internet]] was strictly prohibited until 1991.<ref>[[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]]: [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/tech.html?pg=2 We Are the Web] [[Wired magazine]], Issue 13.08, August 2005</ref> Although the Internet became popular worldwide around 1994 when the first internet online shopping started, it took about five years to introduce security protocols and [[DSL]] allowing continual connection to the Internet. By the end of 2000, many European and American business companies offered their services through the [[World Wide Web]]. Since then people began to associate a word "[[ecommerce]]" with the ability of purchasing various goods through the Internet using secure protocols and electronic payment services.

==Government regulations==
In the United States, some electronic commerce activities are regulated by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC).  These activities include the use of commercial e-mails, online advertising and consumer [[privacy]].  The [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003]] establishes national standards for direct marketing over e-mail. The [[Federal Trade Commission Act]] regulates all forms of advertising, including online advertising, and states that advertising must be truthful and non-deceptive.<ref>{{Cite web| url= http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/ruleroad.shtm |title= Advertising and Marketing on the Internet: Rules of the Road |publisher= [[Federal Trade Commission]]}}</ref> Using its authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive practices, the FTC has brought a number of cases to enforce the promises in corporate privacy statements, including promises about the security of consumers’ personal information.<ref>{{Cite web| url= http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/promises.html |title= Enforcing Privacy Promises: Section 5 of the FTC Act |publisher= [[Federal Trade Commission]]}}</ref> As result, any corporate privacy policy related to e-commerce activity may be subject to enforcement by the FTC.

The Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008, which came into law in 2008, amends the [[Controlled Substances Act]] to address [[Online pharmacy|online pharmacies]].<ref>{{Cite web| url= http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-6353&tab=summary |title= H.R. 6353: Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008 |publisher= [[Govtrack]]}}</ref>

==Forms==
Contemporary electronic commerce involves everything from ordering "digital" content for immediate online consumption, to ordering conventional goods and services, to "meta" services to facilitate other types of electronic commerce.

On the consumer level, electronic commerce is mostly conducted on the World Wide Web. An individual can go online  to purchase anything from books or groceries, to expensive items like real estate. Another example would be online banking, i.e. online bill payments, buying stocks, transferring funds from one account to another, and initiating wire payment to another country. All of these activities can be done with a few strokes of the keyboard.

On the institutional level, big corporations and financial institutions use the internet to exchange financial data to facilitate domestic and international business. Data integrity and security are very hot and pressing issues for electronic commerce.

==Impact on markets and retailers==

{{Expand section|date=July 2010}}

Economists have theorized that e-commerce ought to lead to intensified price [[competition (economics)|competition]], as it increases consumers' ability to gather information about products and prices. Research by four economists at the University of Chicago has found that the growth of online shopping has also affected industry structure in two areas that have seen significant growth in e-commerce, [[book selling|bookshops]] and [[travel agencies]]. Generally, larger firms have grown at the expense of smaller ones, as they are able to use [[economies of scale]] and offer lower prices. The lone exception to this pattern has been the very smallest category of bookseller, shops with between one and four employees, which appear to have withstood the trend.<ref>{{cite news|title=Economics focus: The click and the dead|newspaper=The Economist|date=July 3–9, 2010|page=78}}</ref>
