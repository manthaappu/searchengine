'''Portable Document Format''' ('''PDF''') is an [[open standard]] for document exchange. The [[file format]] created by [[Adobe Systems]] in 1993 is used for representing two-dimensional documents in a manner independent of the application software, hardware, and operating system.<ref name="pdf-ref-1.7">Adobe Systems Incorporated, [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf PDF Reference, Sixth edition, version 1.23 (30 MB)], Nov 2006, p. 33.</ref>
Each PDF file encapsulates a complete description of a fixed-layout 2D document that includes the text, fonts, images, and 2D [[vector graphics]] which compose the documents. Today, 3D drawings can be embedded in PDF documents with Acrobat 3D using [[U3D]] or [[PRC (file format)|PRC]] and various other data formats.<ref name="3d#1" /><ref name="3d#2" />

In 1991 [[Adobe Systems]] co-founder [[John Warnock]] outlined a system called "Camelot"<ref>{{cite web

|quote=This document describes the base technology and ideas behind the project named “Camelot.” This project’s goal is to solve a fundamental problem [...] there is no universal way to communicate and view ... printed information electronically.}}</ref> that evolved into the Portable Document Format (PDF).

Originally a [[proprietary format]], PDF was officially released as an [[open standard]] on July 1, 2008, and published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] as ISO/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 32000-1:2008.<ref>{{cite web | last = Orion | first = Egan | title = PDF 1.7 is approved as ISO 32000 | work = [[The Inquirer]] | publisher = [[The Inquirer]] | date = 2007-12-05 | url = http://www.theinquirer.net/gb/inquirer/news/2007/12/05/pdf-approved-iso-32000 | accessdate = 2007-12-05 }}; {{cite web | url = http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2205065/pdf-takes-first-step-towards | title = Adobe wins backing for PDF 1.7 | publisher = vnunet.com }}</ref><ref name="iso-standard" /> The ISO 32000-1 allows use of some specifications, which are not standardized (e.g. Adobe XML Forms Architecture<ref name="gnupdf-fdf">{{cite web |url=http://gnupdf.org/Forms_Data_Format |title=Gnu PDF - PDF Knowledge - Forms Data Format |quote="Apparently Adobe introduced something newer called XFA (XML Forms Architecture) which doesn't seem standardized." |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref name="acroforms-appligent">{{citation |url=http://www.appligent.com/files/faq-whatisthedifferencebetweenacroformaxfa/Acroforms%2BWhitePaper.pdf |title=A Quick Introduction to Acrobat Forms Technology |quote="Adobe's XFA Forms is a closed standard that competes with the fully open W3C Xforms standard." |date=2006-05-14 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref>). ISO 32000-1 does not specify methods for validating the conformance of PDF files or readers.<ref name="iso-standard" />

== History ==
PDF's adoption in the early days of the format's history was slow.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.prepressure.com/pdf/basics/history |title=The history of PDF|author=Laurens Leurs|accessdate=2007-09-19}}</ref> [[Adobe Acrobat]], Adobe's suite for reading and creating PDF files, was not freely available; early versions of PDF had no support for external hyperlinks, reducing its usefulness on the Internet; the larger size of a PDF document compared to plain text required longer download times over the slower [[modem]]s common at the time; and rendering PDF files was slow on the less powerful machines of the day. 

Additionally, there were competing formats such as [[Envoy (WordPerfect)|Envoy]], [[Common Ground Digital Paper]], Farallon Replica and even Adobe's own [[PostScript]] format (.ps); in those early years, PDF was popular mainly in [[desktop publishing]] [[workflow]]s. In 1995, AT&T Labs commenced work on another electronic document standard targeted at libraries and archives for preserving their books and documents, [[DjVu]]. This standard has evolved into the .djv/ .djvu format, which has had growing success and penetration in the online world for eBooks, catalogs, and image-sharing.

Adobe soon started distributing its Acrobat Reader (now Adobe Reader) program at no cost, and continued supporting the original PDF, which eventually became the [[de facto standard]] for printable documents on the web (a standard [[web document]]).

===Adobe's PDF specifications===
Adobe changed the PDF specification several times and continues to develop new specifications with new versions of Adobe Acrobat. There have been nine versions of PDF with corresponding Acrobat releases:<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20071014010805/http://www.acrobatusers.com/blogs/leonardr/history-of-pdf-openness/ History of PDF Openness]</ref>
* (1993) – PDF 1.0 / Acrobat 1.0
* (1994) – PDF 1.1 / Acrobat 2.0
* (1996) – PDF 1.2 / Acrobat 3.0
* (1999) – PDF 1.3 / Acrobat 4.0
* (2001) – PDF 1.4 / Acrobat 5.0
* (2003) – PDF 1.5 / Acrobat 6.0
* (2005) – PDF 1.6 / Acrobat 7.0
* (2006) – PDF 1.7 / Acrobat 8.0
* (2008) – PDF 1.7, Adobe Extension Level 3 / Acrobat 9.0
* (2009) – PDF 1.7, Adobe Extension Level 5 / Acrobat 9.1

The ISO standard ISO 32000-1:2008 is equivalent to Adobe's PDF 1.7. Adobe declared that it is not producing a PDF 1.8 Reference. The future versions of the PDF Specification will be produced by ISO technical committees. However, Adobe published documents specifying what extended features for PDF, beyond ISO 32000-1 (PDF 1.7), are supported in its newly released products. This makes use of the extensibility features of PDF as documented in ISO 32000-1 in Annex E. Adobe declared all extended features in ''Adobe Extension Level 3'' and ''5'' have been accepted for a new proposal of ISO 32000-2 (a.k.a. PDF 2.0).<ref name="pdf-ref">{{cite web |url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html |title=Adobe Developer Connection: PDF Reference and Adobe Extensions to the PDF Specification |publisher=Adobe Systems Incorporated |accessdate=2010-12-13}}</ref>

The specifications for PDF are backward inclusive. The PDF 1.7 specification includes all of the functionality previously documented in the Adobe PDF Specifications for versions 1.0 through 1.6. It should be noted that where Adobe removed certain features of PDF from their standard, they too are not contained in ISO 32000-1.<ref name="iso-standard" />

PDF documents conforming to ISO 32000-1 carry the PDF version number 1.7. Documents containing Adobe extended features still carry the PDF base version number 1.7 but also contain an indication of which extension was followed during document creation.<ref name="pdf-ref" />

====Full function PDF====
=====PDF 1.7=====
The final revised documentation for PDF 1.7 was approved by ISO Technical Committee 171 in January 2008 and published as ISO 32000-1:2008 on July 1, 2008. PDF is now a published ISO standard, titled ''Document management—Portable document format—Part 1: PDF 1.7''. 

ISO 32000-1:2008 is the first ISO standard for the full function PDF. The previous ISO PDF standards (PDF/A, PDF/X, etc.) are for more specialized uses. The ISO 32000-1 includes all of the functionality previously documented in the Adobe PDF Specifications for versions 1.0 through 1.6, but it should be noted that where Adobe removed certain features of PDF from their standard, they too are not contained in PDF 1.7.<ref name="iso-standard" />{{vague|date=January 2011}}

ISO 32000 document was prepared by Adobe Systems Incorporated based upon ''PDF Reference, sixth edition, Adobe Portable Document Format version 1.7, November 2006''. It was reviewed, edited and adopted, under a special fast-track procedure, by ''ISO Technical Committee 171 (ISO/TC 171), Document management application, Subcommittee SC 2, Application issues'', in parallel with its approval by the ISO member bodies.

According to the ISO PDF standard abstract:<ref>ISO 32000-1:2008, Page 1, section "1 Scope"</ref>

<blockquote>''ISO 32000-1:2008 specifies a digital form for representing electronic documents to enable users to exchange and view electronic documents independent of the environment in which they were created or the environment in which they are viewed or printed. It is intended for the developer of software that creates PDF files (conforming writers), software that reads existing PDF files and interprets their contents for display and interaction (conforming readers) and PDF products that read and/or write PDF files for a variety of other purposes (conforming products).''
</blockquote>

=====PDF 2.0=====
A new version of PDF standard is under development under the name ''ISO/NP 32000-2 - Document management—Portable document format—Part 2: PDF 2.0'' (as of January 2011).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=53041 |title=ISO/NP 32000-2 - Document management -- Portable document format -- Part 2: PDF 2.0 |date=2009-10-06 |accessdate=2010-02-24}}</ref> Adobe has submitted the ''Adobe Extension Level 5'' and ''Adobe Extension Level 3'' specifications to ISO for inclusion into the next version of the ISO 32000 specification. Adobe declared they have all been accepted for part 2 of ISO 32000.<ref name="pdf-ref" />

== Technical foundations ==
Anyone may create applications that can read and write PDF files without having to pay royalties to [[Adobe Systems]]; Adobe holds patents to PDF, but licenses them for [[royalty-free]] use in developing software complying with its PDF specification.<ref>[http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/support/topic_legal_notices.html partners.adobe.com - Developer Resources]</ref>

The PDF combines three technologies:
* A subset of the [[PostScript]] page description programming language, for generating the layout and graphics.
* A font-embedding/replacement system to allow fonts to travel with the documents.
* A structured storage system to bundle these elements and any associated content into a single file, with [[data compression]] where appropriate.

=== PostScript ===
[[PostScript]] is  a [[page description language]] run in an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] to generate an image, a process requiring many resources. It can handle not just graphics, but standard features of programming languages such as <code>if</code> and <code>loop</code> commands. PDF is largely based on PostScript but simplified to remove flow control features like these, while graphics commands such as <code>lineto</code> remain.

Often, the PostScript-like PDF code is generated from a source PostScript file. The graphics commands that are output by the PostScript code are collected and [[Lexical analysis|tokenized]]; any files, graphics, or fonts to which the document refers also are collected; then, everything is compressed to a single file. Therefore, the entire PostScript world (fonts, layout, measurements) remains intact.

As a document format, PDF has several advantages over PostScript:
* PDF contains tokenized and interpreted results of the PostScript source code, for direct correspondence between changes to items in the PDF page description and changes to the resulting page appearance.
* PDF (from version 1.4) supports true [[transparency (graphic)|graphic transparency]]; PostScript does not.
* PostScript is an [[interpretive programming|interpretive programming language]] with an implicit global state, so instructions accompanying the description of one page can affect the appearance of any following page. Therefore, all preceding pages in a PostScript document must be processed in order to determine the correct appearance of a given page, whereas each page in a PDF document is unaffected by the others. As a result, PDF viewers allow the user to quickly jump to the final pages of a long document, whereas a Postscript viewer needs to process all pages sequentially before being able to display the destination page (unless the optional PostScript [[Document Structuring Conventions]] have been carefully complied with).

== Technical overview ==
=== File structure ===
A PDF file consists primarily of ''objects'', of which there are eight types:<ref>Adobe Systems, PDF Reference, p. 51.</ref>
* [[Boolean data type|Boolean]] values, representing ''true'' or ''false''
* Numbers
* [[String (computer science)|Strings]]
* Names
* [[Array data type|Array]]s, ordered collections of objects
* Dictionaries, collections of objects indexed by Names
* [[Stream (computing)|Streams]], usually containing large amounts of data
* The [[Pointer (computing)|null]] object

Objects may be either ''direct'' (embedded in another object) or ''indirect''. Indirect objects are numbered with an ''object number'' and a ''generation number''. An index table called the ''xref table'' gives the byte offset of each indirect object from the start of the file.<ref>Adobe Systems, PDF Reference, pp. 39–40.</ref> This design allows for efficient [[random access]] to the objects in the file, and also allows for small changes to be made without rewriting the entire file (''incremental update'').  Beginning with PDF version 1.5, indirect objects may also be located in special streams known as ''object streams''. This technique reduces the size of files that have large numbers of small indirect objects and is especially useful for ''Tagged PDF''.

There are two layouts to the PDF files—non-linear (not "optimized") and linear ("optimized").  Non-linear PDF files consume less disk space than their linear counterparts, though they are slower to access because portions of the data required to assemble pages of the document are scattered throughout the PDF file.  Linear PDF files (also called "optimized" or "web optimized" PDF files) are constructed in a manner that enables them to be read in a Web browser plugin without waiting for the entire file to download, since they are written to disk in a linear (as in page order) fashion.<ref name="pdf-ref">{{cite web |url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html |title=Adobe Developer Connection: PDF Reference and Adobe Extensions to the PDF Specification |publisher=Adobe Systems Incorporated |accessdate=2010-12-13}}</ref> PDF files may be optimized using [[Adobe Acrobat]] software or [[QPDF]].

=== Imaging model ===
The basic design of how [[graphics]] are represented in PDF is very similar to that of PostScript, except for the use of [[transparency (graphic)|transparency]], which was added in PDF 1.4.

PDF graphics use a [[device independent]] [[Cartesian coordinate system]] to describe the surface of a page. A PDF page description can use a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] to [[scale (ratio)|scale]], [[rotate]], or [[Shear mapping|skew]] graphical elements. A key concept in PDF is that of the ''graphics state'', which is a collection of graphical parameters that may be changed, saved, and restored by a ''page description''. PDF has (as of version 1.6) 24 graphics state properties, of which some of the most important are:
* The ''current transformation matrix'' (CTM), which determines the coordinate system
* The ''[[clipping path]]''
* The ''[[color space]]''
* The ''[[alpha compositing|alpha constant]]'', which is a key component of transparency

==== Vector graphics ====
Vector graphics in PDF, as in PostScript, are constructed with ''paths''. Paths are usually composed of lines and cubic [[Bézier curve]]s, but can also be constructed from the outlines of text. Unlike PostScript, PDF does not allow a single path to mix text outlines with lines and curves. Paths can be stroked, filled, or used for [[clipping path|clipping]]. Strokes and fills can use any color set in the graphics state, including ''patterns''.

PDF supports several types of patterns. The simplest is the ''tiling pattern'' in which a piece of artwork is specified to be drawn repeatedly. This may be a ''colored tiling pattern'', with the colors specified in the pattern object, or an ''uncolored tiling pattern'', which defers color specification to the time the pattern is drawn. Beginning with PDF 1.3 there is also a ''shading pattern'', which draws continuously varying colors. There are seven types of shading pattern of which the simplest are the ''axial shade'' (Type 2) and ''radial shade'' (Type 3). <!-- Pictures desperately needed here! -->

==== Raster images ====
Raster images in PDF (called ''Image XObjects'') are represented by dictionaries with an associated stream. The dictionary describes properties of the image, and the stream contains the image data. (Less commonly, a raster image may be embedded directly in a page description as an ''inline image''.) Images are typically ''filtered'' for compression purposes. Image filters supported in PDF include the general purpose filters
* '''ASCII85Decode''' a deprecated filter used to put the stream into 7-bit [[ASCII]]
* '''ASCIIHexDecode''' similar to ASCII85Decode but less compact
* '''FlateDecode''' a commonly used filter based on the [[DEFLATE]] or Zip algorithm
* '''LZWDecode''' a deprecated filter based on [[LZW]] Compression
* '''RunLengthDecode''' a simple compression method for streams with repetitive data using the [[Run-length encoding]] algorithm
and the image-specific filters
* '''DCTDecode''' a [[lossy]] filter based on the [[JPEG]] standard
* '''CCITTFaxDecode''' a [[lossless]] filter based on the [[CCITT]] [[fax]] compression standard
* '''JBIG2Decode''' a lossy or lossless filter based on the [[JBIG2]] standard, introduced in PDF 1.4
* '''JPXDecode''' a lossy or lossless filter based on the [[JPEG 2000]] standard, introduced in PDF 1.5

Normally all image content in a PDF is embedded in the file. But PDF allows image data to be stored in external files by the use of ''external streams'' or ''Alternate Images''. Standardized subsets of PDF, including [[PDF/A]] and [[PDF/X]], prohibit these techniques.

==== Text ====
Text in PDF is represented by ''text elements'' in page content streams. A text element specifies that ''characters'' should be drawn at certain positions. The characters are specified using the ''encoding'' of a selected ''font resource''.

===== Fonts =====
A font object in PDF is a description of a digital [[typeface]]. It may either describe the characteristics of a typeface, or it may include an embedded ''font file''. The latter case is called an ''embedded font'' while the former is called an ''unembedded font''. The font files that may be embedded are based on widely used standard digital font formats: '''[[PostScript fonts|Type 1]]''' (and its compressed variant '''CFF'''), '''[[TrueType]]''', and (beginning with PDF 1.6) '''[[OpenType]]'''. Additionally PDF supports the '''Type 3''' variant in which the components of the font are described by PDF graphic operators. <!--- Type 3 bit is awkward and should be cleaned up --->

===== Encodings =====
Within text strings, characters are shown using ''character codes'' (integers) that map to glyphs in the current font using an ''encoding''. There are a number of predefined encodings, including ''WinAnsi'', ''MacRoman'', and a large number of encodings for East Asian languages, and a font can have its own built-in encoding. (Although the WinAnsi and MacRoman encodings are derived from the historical properties of the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Macintosh]] operating systems, fonts using these encodings work equally well on any platform.)  PDF can specify a predefined encoding to use, the font's built-in encoding or provide a lookup table of differences to a predefined or built-in encoding (not recommended with TrueType fonts).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf |title=PDF Referencem Sixth Edition, version 1.7, table 5.11}}</ref>  The encoding mechanisms in PDF were designed for Type 1 fonts, and the rules for applying them to TrueType fonts are complex.

For large fonts or fonts with non-standard glyphs, the special encodings ''Identity-H'' (for horizontal writing) and ''Identity-V'' (for vertical) are used. With such fonts it is necessary to provide a ''ToUnicode'' table if semantic information about the characters is to be preserved.

==== Transparency ====
The original imaging model of PDF was, like PostScript's, ''opaque'': each object drawn on the page completely replaced anything previously marked in the same location. In PDF 1.4 the imaging model was extended to allow transparency. When transparency is used, new objects interact with previously marked objects to produce blending effects. The addition of transparency to PDF was done by means of new extensions that were designed to be ignored in products written to the PDF 1.3 and earlier specifications. As a result, files that use a small amount of transparency might view acceptably in older viewers, but files making extensive use of transparency could view completely wrongly in an older viewer without warning.

The transparency extensions are based on the key concepts of ''transparency groups'', ''blending modes'', ''shape'', and ''alpha''. The model is closely aligned with the features of [[Adobe Illustrator]] version 9. The blend modes were based on those used by [[Adobe Photoshop]] at the time. When the PDF 1.4 specification was published the formulas for calculating blend modes were kept secret by Adobe. They have since been published.<ref>[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdfs/blend_modes.pdf PDF Blend Modes Addendum]</ref>

The concept of a transparency group in PDF specification is independent of existing notions of "group" or "layer" in applications such as Adobe Illustrator. Those groupings reflect logical relationships among objects that are meaningful when editing those objects,
but they are not part of the imaging model.

=== Interactive elements ===
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
PDF files may contain interactive elements such as annotations and form fields.

'''Interactive Forms''' is a mechanism to add forms to the PDF file format.

PDF currently supports two different methods for integrating data and PDF forms. Both formats today coexist in PDF specification:<ref name="acroforms-appligent">{{citation |url=http://www.appligent.com/files/faq-whatisthedifferencebetweenacroformaxfa/Acroforms%2BWhitePaper.pdf |title=A Quick Introduction to Acrobat Forms Technology |date=2006-05-14 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref name="iso32000">{{citation |url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf |title=Document Management – Portable Document Format – Part 1: PDF 1.7, First Edition |author=Adobe Systems Incorporated |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gnupdf.org/Forms_Data_Format |title=Gnu PDF - PDF Knowledge - Forms Data Format  |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/8/htmldocs/help.html?content=formsPDF_02.html |title=About PDF forms  |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://forums.adobe.com/thread/301733 |title=Convert XFA Form to AcroForm? |year=2008 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref>

==== AcroForms ====
AcroForms were introduced in the PDF 1.2 format.<ref name="acroforms-and-xfa">{{cite web |url=http://www.appligent.com/faq-whatisthedifferencebetweenacroformaxfa |title=What is the difference between Acroforms and XFA? |date=2009-03-27 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref> AcroForms permit using objects (text boxes, radiobuttons, etc.) and some code ([[JavaScript]]).

Alongside the standard PDF action types, interactive forms (AcroForms) support submitting, resetting, and importing data. The "submit" action transmits the names and values of selected interactive form fields to a specified uniform resource locator (URL). Interactive form field names and values may be submitted in any of the following formats, (depending on the settings of the action’s ExportFormat, SubmitPDF, and XFDF flags):<ref name="iso32000" />
* HTML Form format (HTML 4.01 Specification since PDF 1.5; HTML 2.0 since 1.2)
* Forms Data Format (FDF)
* XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) (external XML Forms Data Format Specification, Version 2.0; supported since PDF 1.5; it replaced the "XML" form submission format defined in PDF 1.4.)
* PDF (the entire document can be submitted rather than individual fields and values). (defined in PDF 1.4)

AcroForms can keep form field values in external stand-alone files containing key:value pairs. The external files may use Forms Data Format (FDF) and XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) files.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/325/325874.html |title=Using Acrobat forms and form data on the web |author=Adobe Systems Incorporated |date=2007-10-15 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref name="xfdf">{{citation |url=http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/xml/xfdf_2.0.pdf |format=PDF |title=XML Forms Data Format Specification, version 2 |date=2007-09 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref name="fdf-exchange">{{citation |url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/fdf_data_exchange.pdf |format=PDF |title=FDF Data Exchange Specification |date=2007-02-08 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref> The usage rights (UR) signatures define rights for import form data files in FDF, XFDF and text ([[comma-separated values|CSV]]/[[delimiter-separated values|TSV]]) formats, and export form data files in FDF and XFDF formats.<ref name="iso32000" />

The Forms Data Format (FDF) is based on PDF, it uses the same syntax and has essentially the same file structure, but is much simpler than PDF, since the body of an FDF document consists of only one required object. Forms Data Format is defined in the PDF format specification (since PDF 1.2). The Forms Data Format can be used when submitting form data to a server, receiving the response, and incorporating into the interactive form. It can also be used to export form data to stand-alone files that can be imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form. Beginning in PDF 1.3, FDF can be used to define a container for annotations that are separate from the PDF document to which they apply. FDF is typically used to encapsulate information such as X.509 certificates, requests for certificates, directory settings, timestamp server settings, and embedded PDF files for network transmission.<ref name="fdf-exchange" /> The FDF uses the MIME content type application/vnd.fdf, filename extension .fdf and on Mac OS it uses file type 'FDF '.<ref name="iso32000" /> A support for importing and exporting FDF stand-alone files is not widely implemented in free or freeware PDF software. For example, there is no support in Evince, Okular, KPDF or Sumatra PDF. Import support for stand-alone FDF files is implemented in Adobe Reader; export and import support (including saving of FDF data in PDF) is for example implemented in Foxit Reader and PDF-XChange Viewer Free; saving of FDF data in a PDF file is also supported in pdftk.

XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) is the XML version of Forms Data Format, but the XFDF implements only a subset of FDF containing forms and annotations. There are not XFDF equivalents for some entries in the FDF dictionary - such as the Status, Encoding, JavaScript, Pages keys, EmbeddedFDFs, Differences and Target. The XFDF specification is referenced (but not included) in PDF 1.5 specification (and in later versions). It is described separately in ''XML Forms Data Format Specification''<ref name="xfdf" />. The PDF 1.4 specification allowed form submissions in XML format, but this was replaced by submissions in XFDF format in the PDF 1.5 specification. XFDF conforms to the XML standard. XFDF can be used the same way as FDF - e.g. form data is submitted to a server, modifications are made, then sent back and the new form data is imported in an interactive form. It can also be used to export form data to stand-alone files that can be imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form. A support for importing and exporting FDF stand-alone files is not widely implemented in free or freeware PDF software. Import of XFDF is implemented in Adobe Reader 5 and later versions; import and export is implemented in PDF-XChange Viewer Free; embedding of XFDF data in PDF form is implemented in pdftk (pdf toolkit).

==== Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA) ====
{{Main|XFA|l1=XML Forms Architecture}}
In the PDF 1.5 format, [[Adobe Systems]] introduced a new, proprietary format for forms, namely Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA) forms. The XFA 2.02 is referenced in the PDF 1.5 specification (and also in later versions) but is described separately in ''Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA) Specification'', which has several versions.<ref name="acroforms-and-xfa" /><ref name="xfa-adobe">{{cite web |url=http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/xml/index_arch.html |title=Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA) |author=Adobe Systems Incorporated |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref> Adobe XFA Forms are not compatible with AcroForms. Creating XFA Forms for use in Adobe Reader requires Adobe LiveCycle Forms Designer or Avoka SmartForm Composer.<ref name="acroforms-appligent" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adobe.com/products/livecycle/readerextensions/ |title=Adobe LiveCycle Reader Extensions ES2 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref> Adobe Reader contains "disabled features" for use of XFA Forms, that will activate only when opening a PDF document that was created using enabling technology available only from Adobe.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.adobe.com/products/eulas/pdfs/Reader_Player_AIR_WWEULA-Combined-20080204_1313.pdf |format=PDF |title=Adobe Reader - Software license agreement  |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adobe.com/go/readerextensions |title=LiveCycle Reader Extensions ES features and benefits |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref> The XFA Forms are not compatible with Adobe Reader prior to version 6.<ref name="acroforms-appligent" />

XFA forms can be created and used as PDF files or as XDP ([[XML Data Package]]) files. The format of an XFA resource in PDF is described by the XML Data Package Specification.<ref name="iso32000" /> The XDP may be a standalone document or it may in turn be carried inside a PDF document. XDP provides a mechanism for packaging form components within a surrounding XML container. An XDP can also package a PDF file, along with XML form and template data.<ref name="xfa-adobe" /> PDF may contain XFA (in XDP format), but also XFA may contain PDF.<ref name="xfa-adobe" /> When the XFA (XML Forms Architecture) grammars used for an XFA form are moved from one application to another, they must be packaged as an XML Data Package.<ref name="xfa25">{{citation |url=http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/xml/xfa_spec_2_5.pdf |format=PDF |title=XML Forms Architecture (XFA) Specification Version 2.5 |date=2007-06-08 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref>

When the PDF and XFA are combined, the result is a form in which each page of the XFA form overlays a PDF background. This architecture is
sometimes referred to as XFAF (XFA Foreground). The alternative is to express all of the form, including boilerplate, directly in XFA. It is sometimes called ''full'' XFA.<ref name="xfa25" />

Starting with PDF 1.5, the text contents of variable text form fields, as well as markup annotations may include formatting information (style information). These rich text strings are XML documents that conform to the rich text conventions specified for the XML Forms Architecture specification 2.02, which is itself a subset of the XHTML 1.0 specification, augmented with a restricted set of CSS2 style attributes.<ref name="iso32000" />
In PDF 1.6, PDF supports the rich text elements and attributes specified in the XML Forms Architecture (XFA) Specification, 2.2.
In PDF 1.7, PDF supports the rich text elements and attributes specified in the XML Forms Architecture (XFA) Specification, 2.4<ref name="iso32000" />

=== Logical structure and accessibility ===
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
A PDF may contain structure information to enable better text extraction and accessibility. When published, [[PDF/UA]], now [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?ics1=35&ics2=240&ics3=30&csnumber=54564 ISO/AWI 14289], will provide definitive information on how the contents of PDF files are to be tagged with accurate structure information. Tagged PDFs also allow a page-limited [[reflowable document|reflow of documents]] for smaller devices, sometimes called "reflowable PDFs".<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=dlJ94KZqwqcC&pg=PA379</ref>

=== Security and signatures ===
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
A PDF file may be encrypted for security, or digitally signed for authentication.

The standard security provided by Acrobat PDF consists of two different methods and two different passwords, "user password" and "owner password". A PDF document may be protected by password to open ('user' password) and the document may also specify operations that should be restricted even when the document is decrypted: printing, copying text and graphics out of the document, modifying the document, or adding or modifying text notes and [[Acroforms|AcroForm]] fields (using 'owner' password). However, all operations (except the document open password protection, if applicable) which are restricted by "owner" or "user" passwords are trivially circumvented by many commonly available "PDF cracking" software and even freely online,<ref>[http://freemypdf.com/ FreeMyPDF - A website that removes PDF "user password" restrictions]</ref> and if circumvented these restrictions no longer let the author control what can and cannot be done with the pdf file once distributed. This warning is also displayed when applying such restrictions using Adobe Acrobat software to create or edit PDF files.

Even without removing the password, most freeware or open source PDF readers will ignore the [[digital rights management]] "protections" and will allow the user to print or make copy of excerpts of the text as if the document were not limited by password protection.

==== Usage rights ====
Beginning with PDF 1.5, Usage rights (UR) signatures are used to enable additional interactive features that are not available by default in a particular PDF viewer application. The signature is used to validate that the permissions have been granted by a bonafide granting authority. For example, it can be used to allow a user:<ref name="iso32000" />
* to save the PDF document along with modified form and/or annotation data
* import form data files in FDF, XFDF and text (CSV/TSV) formats
* export form data files in FDF and XFDF formats
* submit form data
* instantiate new pages from named page templates
* apply a [[digital]] [[signature]] to existing [[digital signature]] form field
* create, delete, modify, copy, import, export annotations

For example, Adobe Systems grants permissions to enable additional features in Adobe Reader, using public-key [[cryptography]]. Adobe Reader will verify that the signature uses a [[Public key certificate|certificate]] from an Adobe-[[authorize]]d certificate authority. The PDF 1.5 specification declares that other PDF viewer applications are free to use this same mechanism for their own purposes.<ref name="iso32000" />

=== File attachments ===
{{Expand section|date=August 2008}}

PDF files can have document-level and page-level file attachments, which the reader can access and open or save to their local filesystem. PDF attachments can be added to existing PDF files for example using [http://www.pdfhacks.com/pdftk/ pdftk]. Adobe Reader provides support for attachments, and [[poppler (software)|poppler]] based readers like [[Evince]] or [[Okular]] also have some support for document-level attachments.

=== Metadata ===

PDF files can contain two types of metadata.<ref>[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf Adobe PDF reference version 1.7], section 10.2</ref> The first is the Document Information Dictionary, a set of key/value fields such as author, title, subject, creation and update dates. This is stored in the optional Info trailer of the file. A small set of fields is defined, and can be extended with additional text values if required.

Later, in PDF 1.4, support was added for the Metadata Streams, using the [[Extensible Metadata Platform]] (XMP) to add XML standards-based extensible metadata as used in other file formats. This allows metadata to be attached to any stream in the document, such as information about embedded illustrations, as well as the whole document (attaching to the document catalog), using an extensible schema.

=== Subsets ===
Proper subsets of PDF have been, or are being, standardized under [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] for several constituencies:
* [[PDF/X]] for the printing and graphic arts as ISO 15930 (working in ISO TC130)
* [[PDF/A]] for archiving in corporate/government/library/etc environments as ISO 19005 (work done in ISO TC171)
* [[PDF/E]] for exchange of engineering drawings (work done in ISO TC171)
* [[PDF/UA]] for universally accessible PDF files

A [[PDF/H]] variant (PDF for Healthcare) is being developed.<ref>{{cite web
|title=New Best Practices Guide Addresses Exchange of Healthcare Information

|date=2006-10-20
|accessdate=2007-03-09
|author=AIIM}}</ref> However, it may consist more of a set of "best practices" than of a specific format or subset.

=== Mars ===
:''See also: [[Page description markup language]]''

Adobe is exploring an XML-based next-generation PDF [[code name]]d Mars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gcn.com/blogs/tech/42740.html|title=Adobe plunges PDF into XML|publisher=Government Computer News|date=2006-12-07|accessdate=2008-01-12|first=Joab|last=Jackson}}</ref> Information about the Mars file format is published by Adobe at http://www.adobe.com/go/mars and also [http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Mars http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Mars].

The format of graphic elements of Mars is sometimes described simply as "[[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]]",{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} but according to the version 0.8 draft specification of November 2007 (§3 Mars SVG Support) the format is actually merely similar to SVG: it contains both additions to and subtractions from SVG, so it is in general neither viewable by nor creatable with standard SVG tools: some things will look noticeably different between SVG viewers and Mars viewers.

== Technical issues ==
=== Accessibility ===

PDF files can be created specifically to be accessible for disabled people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/ |title=PDF Accessibility |publisher=WebAIM |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alistapart.com/articles/pdf_accessibility |title=Facts and Opinions About PDF Accessibility |author=Joe Clark |date=2005-08-22 |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wac.osu.edu/pdf/ |title=Accessibility and PDF documents |publisher=Web Accessibility Center |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/accessibility/accessible_pdf.shtml |title=PDF Accessibility Standards v1.2  |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.csus.edu/training/handouts/workshops/creating_accessible_pdfs.pdf |format=PDF |title=PDF Accessibility |publisher=California State University |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref> Current PDF file formats can include tags ([[XML]]), text equivalents, captions, audio descriptions, et cetera. Some software can automatically produce tagged PDFs, however this feature is not always enabled by default. Leading [[screen reader]]s, including [[JAWS (screen reader)|JAWS]], [[Window-Eyes]], Hal, and [[Kurzweil Educational Systems|Kurzweil 1000 and 3000]] can read tagged PDFs; current versions of the Acrobat and Acrobat Reader programs can also read PDFs aloud.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://help.adobe.com/en_US/Reader/8.0/help.html?content=WS58a04a822e3e50102bd615109794195ff-7d15.html |title=Adobe Reader 8 - Read a PDF with Read Out Loud |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/10/tip-of-the-week-adobe-readers-read-aloud-feature/  |title=Tip of the Week: Adobe Reader’s ‘Read Aloud’ Feature |accessdate=2010-04-24 | work=The New York Times | date=2009-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.adobe.com/accessibility/pdfs/accessing-pdf-sr.pdf |format=PDF |title=Accessing PDF documents with assistive technology: A screen reader user's guide |publisher=Adobe |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref> Moreover, tagged PDFs can be re-flowed and magnified for readers with visual impairments. Problems remain with adding tags to older PDFs and those that are generated from scanned documents. In these cases, accessibility tags and re-flowing are unavailable, and must be created either manually or with [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] techniques. These processes are inaccessible to some disabled people. [[PDF/UA]], the PDF/Universal Accessibility Committee, an activity of [[AIIM]], is working on a specification for PDF accessibility based on ISO 32000.

One of the significant challenges with PDF accessibility is that PDF documents have three distinct views, which, depending on the document's creation, can be inconsistent with each other. The three views are (i) the physical view, (ii) the tags view, and (iii) the content view. The physical view is displayed and printed (what most people consider a PDF document). The tags view is what screen readers read (useful for people with poor eyesight). The content view is displayed when the document is re-flowed to Acrobat (useful for people with mobility disability). For a PDF document to be accessible, the three views must be consistent with each other.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=1056 |title=Why PDF is a Hamburger |author=Chris Rusbridge |date=2008-04-29 |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref>

=== Security ===
PDF attachments carrying viruses were first discovered in 2001. This virus, named "OUTLOOK.PDFWorm" or "Peachy", uses [[Microsoft Outlook]] to send itself as an attachment to an Adobe PDF file. It was activated with Adobe Acrobat, but not with Acrobat Reader.<ref>Adobe Forums, [http://www.adobeforums.com/webx/.ef39082 Announcement: PDF Attachment Virus "Peachy"], 15 August 2001.</ref>

From time to time, new vulnerabilities are discovered<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/support/security/#readerwin |title=Security bulletins and advisories |publisher=Adobe |date= |accessdate=2010-02-21}}</ref> in various versions of Adobe Reader, prompting the company to issue security fixes. One aggravating factor is that Adobe Reader can be configured to start automatically if a web page has an embedded PDF file, providing a vector for attack. If a malicious web page contains an infected PDF file that takes advantage of a vulnerability in Adobe Reader, the system may be compromised even if the browser is secure. Some of these vulnerabilities are a result of the PDF standard allowing PDF documents to be scripted with JavaScript. Disabling JavaScript execution in Adobe Reader can help mitigate unknown exploits that may be discovered in the future, although it will not provide protection against exploits in other parts of the PDF viewing software. Security experts argue that JavaScript is a nonessential feature and that the security benefit that comes from disabling JavaScript outweighs any incompatibility issues that may arise from doing so.<ref>[http://www.grc.com/sn/sn-187.txt Steve Gibson - SecurityNow Podcast]</ref> PDF file exploits can be mitigated to a much greater degree by having a third party web service convert them to another file format before viewing.<ref>[http://pdfcleaner.ossbox.com/ PDFCleaner - PDF Exploit Sanitizer]</ref> 

On March 30, 2010 security researcher Didier Stevens reported an Adobe Reader and Foxit Reader "exploit".  The exploit results in an arbitrary executable being run if the user accepts a "launch executable" warning prompt.<ref>[http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2010/03/malicious_pdfs_execute_code_wi.php PCmag.com blogs]</ref>

=== Usage restrictions and monitoring ===
PDFs may be [[encrypted]] so that a password is needed to view or edit the contents.  The PDF Reference defines both 40-bit and 128-bit encryption, both making use of a complex system of [[RC4]] and [[MD5]].  The PDF Reference also defines ways in which third parties can define their own encryption systems for use in PDF.

PDF files may also contain embedded [[digital rights management|DRM]] restrictions that provide further controls that limit copying, editing or printing. The restrictions on copying, editing, or printing depend on the reader software to obey them, so the security they provide is limited.

The PDF Reference has technical details or see <ref>{{cite web|url=http://createpdf.adobe.com/cgi-feeder.pl/help_security?BP=&LOC=en_US |title=Create Adobe PDF Online - Security Settings Help |publisher=Createpdf.adobe.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-21}}</ref> for an end-user overview. Like HTML files, PDF files may submit information to a web server. This could be used to track the [[IP address]] of the client PC, a process known as [[phoning home]]. After update 7.0.5 to Acrobat Reader, the user will be notified "via a dialogue box that the author of the file is auditing usage of the file, and be offered the option of continuing."<ref>[http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=332208&sliceId=2 New features and issues addressed in the Acrobat 7.0.5 Update (Acrobat and Adobe Reader for Windows and Mac OS)]</ref>

Through its [[Adobe LiveCycle|LiveCycle Policy Server]] product, Adobe provides a method to set security policies on specific documents. This can include requiring a user to authenticate and limiting the timeframe a document can be accessed or amount of time a document can be opened while offline. Once a PDF document is tied to a policy server and a specific policy, that policy can be changed or revoked by the owner. This controls documents that are otherwise "in the wild." Each document open and close event can also be tracked by the policy server. Policy servers can be set up privately or Adobe offers a public service through Adobe Online Services.  As with other forms of DRM, adherence to these policies and restrictions may or may not be enforced by the reader software being used.

=== Default display settings ===
PDF documents can contain display settings, including the page display layout and zoom level. Adobe Reader will use these settings to override the user's default settings when opening the document.<ref>{{cite web | title=Getting Familiar with Adobe Reader > Understanding Preferences | url=http://www.adobepress.com/articles/article.asp?p=412914 | accessdate=2009-04-22}}</ref> The free Adobe Reader cannot remove these settings.

== Content ==
A PDF file is often a combination of [[vector graphics]], text, and [[raster graphics]].  The basic types of content in a PDF are:
* text stored as such
* vector graphics for illustrations and designs that consist of shapes and lines
* raster graphics for photographs and other types of image

In later PDF revisions, a PDF document can also support links (inside document or web page), forms, JavaScript (initially available as plugin for Acrobat 3.0), or any other types of embedded contents that can be handled using plug-ins.

PDF 1.6 supports interactive 3D documents embedded in the PDF - 3D drawings can be embedded using [[U3D]] or [[PRC (file format)|PRC]] and various other data formats.<ref name="3d#1">{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/manufacturing/resources/3dformats/ |title=3D supported formats |publisher=Adobe |date=2009-07-14 |accessdate=2010-02-21}}</ref><ref name="3d#2">{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat3d/ |title=Acrobat 3D Developer Center |publisher=Adobe |date= |accessdate=2010-02-21}}</ref>

Two PDF files that look similar on a computer screen may be of very different sizes. For example, a high resolution raster image takes more space than a low resolution one. Typically higher resolution is needed for printing documents than for displaying them on screen. Other things that may increase the size of a file is embedding full fonts, especially for Asiatic scripts, and storing text as graphics.

=== Standard Type 1 Fonts ===
There are fourteen typefaces that have a special significance to PDF documents:
* Times (v3) (in regular, italic, bold, and bold italic)
* [[Courier (typeface)|Courier]] (in regular, oblique, bold and bold oblique)
* [[Helvetica]] (v3) (in regular, oblique, bold and bold oblique)
* [[Symbol (typeface)|Symbol]]
* [[Zapf Dingbats]]
These fonts, sometimes referred to as the "base fourteen fonts"<ref>[http://desktoppub.about.com/od/glossary/g/base14fonts.htm Adobe Acrobat Base 14 Fonts]</ref> should always be present (actually present or a close substitute) and so need not be embedded in a PDF.<ref>[http://www.planetpdf.com/planetpdf/pdfs/pdf2k/03e/merz_fontaquarium.pdf The PDF Font Aquarium]</ref> PDF viewers must know about the metrics of these fonts. Other fonts may be substituted if they are not embedded in a PDF.

== Implementations ==
PDF-viewing software is generally provided free of charge, and many versions are available from a variety of sources ([[List of PDF software]]).

There are many software options for creating PDFs, including the PDF printing capabilities built in to [[Mac OS X]] and most [[Linux]] distributions, the multi-platform [[OpenOffice.org]], [[Microsoft Office 2007]] (if updated to [[Office 2007#Service Pack 2|SP2]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953195|title=Description of 2007 Microsoft Office Suite Service Pack 2 (SP2) |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=2009-05-09}}</ref> [[WordPerfect]] since version 9, [[Free PDF XP]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://freepdf-xp.en.softonic.com/|title=Free PDF XP |accessdate=2010-07-27}}</ref> and numerous PDF print drivers for [[Microsoft Windows]], the [[pdfTeX]] typesetting system, the [[DocBook]] PDF tools, applications developed around [[Ghostscript]] and [[Adobe Acrobat]] itself. [[Google]]'s online office suite [[Google Docs]] also allows for uploading, and saving to the Portable Document Format.

[[Raster image processor]]s (RIPs) are used to convert PDF files into a [[raster graphics|raster format]] suitable for imaging onto paper and other media in printers, digital production presses and [[prepress]] in a process known as [[rasterisation]]. RIPs capable of processing PDF directly include the Adobe PDF Print Engine<ref>[http://www.adobe.com/products/pdfprintengine/overview.html www.adobe.com/products/pdfprintengine/overview.html]</ref> from [[Adobe Systems]] and Jaws<ref>[http://www.globalgraphics.com/products/jaws_rip/ www.globalgraphics.com/products/jaws_rip/]</ref> and the [[Harlequin rip|Harlequin RIP]] from [[Global Graphics]].

==Editing PDFs (structure)==
{{Expand section|date=July 2010}}
There is also specialized software for editing PDF files, though the choices are much more limited and often expensive. As of version 0.46, [[Inkscape]] also allows PDF editing through an intermediate translation step involving [[Poppler (software)|Poppler]]. A PDF editor most similar to word processor is called [[Infix PDF Editor]].<ref>[http://www.iceni.com/infix3_competition.htm PDF Editor Review and Comparison Chart]</ref>

See [[List of PDF software]] for a more complete list of PDF editors.

==Annotating PDFs==
{{See also|Comparison of notetaking software|Category:Web annotation}}
[[Adobe Acrobat]] is one example of proprietary software that allows the user to annotate, highlight, and add notes to already created PDF files. One UNIX application available as [[free software]] (under the [[GNU General Public License]]) is [[PDFedit]]. Another GPL-licensed application native to the Linux environment is [[Xournal]]. Xournal allows for annotating in different fonts and colours, as well as a rule for quickly underlining and highlighting lines of text or paragraphs. Xournal also has a shape recognition tool for squares, rectangles and circles. In Xournal annotations may be moved, copied and pasted. The [[freeware]] [[Foxit Reader]] allows annotating but adds a watermark on each annotated page. The commercial version of the package does not have this limitation. Tracker Software's [[PDF-XChange Viewer]] allows annotations and markups without restrictions in its freeware alternative. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Mac OS X]]'s integrated PDF viewer, Preview, does also enable annotations. For mobile annotation, [[iAnnotate PDF]] for the [[iPad]] and [[Aji Annotate]] for the [[iPhone]], both produced by Aji, allow annotation of PDFs as well as exporting summaries of the annotations.

There are also [[web annotation]] systems which allow to annotate pdf and other documents formats, e.g. [[A.nnotate]], [[crocodoc]], [[WebNotes]].

In cases where PDFs are expected to have all of the functionality of paper documents, ink annotation is required.  Many programs which accept ink input from the mouse are not responsive enough for handwriting using an input tablet or tablet PC.  Existing solutions on the PC include [[Bluebeam PDF Revu]], and [[PDF Annotator]].

==Other applications and functionalities==
Several applications embracing the PDF standard are now available as an online service including [[Scribd]] for viewing and storing, [[Pdfvue]] for online editing, and [[Zamzar]] for PDF Conversion.

In 1993 the Jaws [[Raster image processor|RIP]] from [[Global Graphics]] became the first shipping prepress RIP that interpreted PDF natively without conversion to another format. The company released an upgrade to their Harlequin RIP with the same capability in 1997.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

[[Agfa-Gevaert]] introduced and shipped Apogee, the first prepress workflow system based on PDF, in 1997.

Many commercial offset printers have accepted the submission of press-ready PDF files as a print source, specifically the PDF/X-1a subset and variations of the same.<ref>[http://www.prepressx.com Press-Ready PDF Files] "For anyone interested in having their graphic project commercially printed directly from digital files or PDFs." (last checked on 2009-02-10).</ref> The submission of press-ready PDF files are a replacement for the problematic need for receiving collected native working files.

PDF was selected as the "native" [[metafile]] format for Mac OS X, replacing the [[PICT]] format of the earlier [[Mac OS]]. The imaging model of the [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz]] graphics layer is based on the model common to [[Display PostScript]] and PDF, leading to the nickname "Display PDF". The Preview application can display PDF files, as can version 2.0 and later of the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser. System-level support for PDF allows Mac OS X applications to create PDF documents automatically, provided they support the Print command. The files are then exported in PDF 1.3 format according to the file header. When taking a screenshot under Mac OS X versions 10.0 through 10.3, the image was also captured as a PDF; in 10.4 and 10.5 the default behaviour is set to capture as a [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] file, though this behaviour can be set back to PDF if required.

Some desktop printers also support direct PDF printing, which can interpret PDF data without external help. Currently, all PDF capable printers also support PostScript, but most PostScript printers do not support direct PDF printing.

The [[Free Software Foundation]] considers one of their [[Free Software Foundation#High priority projects|high priority projects]] to be "developing a free, high-quality and fully functional set of libraries and programs that implement the PDF file format and associated technologies to the ISO 32000 standard."<ref>[http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority.html Current FSF High Priority Free Software Projects] (last checked on 2009-02-10)</ref><ref>[http://gnupdf.org/Goals_and_Motivations Goals and Motivations - GNUpdf]</ref>  The [[GNU PDF|GNUpdf]] library has, however, not been released yet, while [[Poppler (software)|Poppler]] has enjoyed wider use in applications such as [[Evince]], which comes with the [[GNOME]] desktop environment, at the expense of relying on the GPLv2-licensed [[Xpdf]]<ref>[http://poppler.freedesktop.org/ Poppler homepage] "Poppler is a PDF rendering library based on the xpdf-3.0 code base." (last checked on 2009-02-10)</ref><ref>[http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/about.html Xpdf license] "Xpdf is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2." (last checked on 2009-02-10).</ref> code base that can't be used by GPLv3 programs. There are also commercial development libraries available as listed in [[List of PDF software]].

The [[Apache PDFBox]] project of the [[Apache Software Foundation]] is an open source Java library for working with PDF documents. PDFBox is licensed under the [[Apache License]].<ref>[http://incubator.apache.org/pdfbox/ The Apache PDFBox project] . Retrieved 2009-09-19.</ref>
