In [[quantum computing]], the '''quantum phase estimation algorithm''' is a [[quantum algorithm]] that finds many applications as a subroutine in other algorithms. The quantum phase estimation algorithm allows one to estimate the eigenphase of an eigenvector of a unitary gate, given access to a quantum state proportional to the eigenvector and a procedure to implement the unitary conditionally.

==The Problem==
Let ''U'' be a [[unitary operator]] that operates on ''m'' qubits. Then all of the eigenvalues of ''U'' have absolute value 1. Thus the [[spectrum]] of a unitary operator consists of phases <math>e^{2\pi i\theta}</math>. Given an eigenvector <math>\left| \psi \right\rangle</math>, such that <math>U\left| \psi \right\rangle =  e^{2\pi i \theta}\left|\psi \right\rangle</math>, the objective is to estimate <math>\theta</math>. The phase estimation algorithm solves this problem.

==The Algorithm==

Suppose we wish to compute the phases to an accuracy of ''n'' bits. We achieve this by subjecting our eigenvector <math>\left| \psi \right\rangle</math> of <math>U</math> to  a succession of ''n'' controlled operators, followed by the inverse of the [[quantum Fourier transform]]. The controlled operators are the powers of <math>U</math> from <math>U</math> to controlled <math>U^{2^{n-1}}</math>.

After putting the control lines into the Hadamard state, we have
:<math>\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n}}} \sum_x \left| x \right\rangle \otimes \left| \psi \right\rangle</math>.
After the controlled application of <math>U</math>, we have
:<math>\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n}}} \sum_x e^{ix\theta} \left| x \right\rangle \otimes \left| \psi \right\rangle</math>.

Applying the inverse of the [[quantum Fourier transform]] upon the ''n'' qubits yields
:<math>\frac{1}{2^n} \sum_y \sum_x e^{-2\pi i x\cdot y/2^n} e^{ix\theta} \left| y \right\rangle \otimes \left| \psi \right\rangle = \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_y \frac{ e^{i 2^n \theta} - 1 }{ e^{i\left( \theta - 2\pi y/2^n \right)} - 1 } \left| y \right\rangle \otimes \left| \psi \right\rangle</math>.

If the phase is exactly a <math>2^n</math> root of unity, the quantum Fourier transform will single out that phase in binary expansion. If
not, there will  be a probability distribution clustered around the correct phase.

If <math>\left| \psi \right\rangle</math> is really a superposition of eigenstates, there is  a weighted probability distribution over the individual eigenstates, with the weight given by the [[Born probabilities]]. This is because eigenstates corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.

The efficiency of this algorithm depends on our access to <math>U</math>. If we only have access via an oracle function, then we need exponentially many calls (in ''n'') to the oracle to compute (for example) <math>U^{2^{n-1}}</math>. If we have complete access to <math>U</math>, then we can use [[exponentiation by squaring]] to compute the necessary powers of <math>U</math> efficiently.
