<html> <head> <title>Wikijob</title></head><body>'''WikiJob''' is a wiki style [[website]] designed for and used by those involved in and applying for careers at city firms, including both students and graduates, and professionals involved in investment banking, consulting, accountancy and law. Its readership expands beyond this, however, and includes [[journalist]]s, recruiters, careers officers and others from outside of the city spectrum{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}.

The site aims to provide an insight into the working culture of city based employers in the [[United Kingdom]] as well as information about careers, interviews and assessment days at these firms. Almost every page of the site is open for users to edit, allowing both job seekers and employers to contribute real life information to company profiles.
