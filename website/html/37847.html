'''tnftp''' (formerly '''lukemftp''') is an [[FTP client]] for [[Unix]]-like operating systems. It is based on the original [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] FTP client, and is the default ftp client included with [[NetBSD]], [[FreeBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], and [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]. It is maintained by [[Luke Mewburn]].

It is notable in its support of server-side tab completion, a feature that the FTP client in GNU [[inetutils]] lacks.
