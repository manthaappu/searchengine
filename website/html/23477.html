'''Mario Szegedy''' (born  October 23, 1960) is a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[computer scientist]], [[professor]] of [[computer science]] at [[Rutgers University]]. He received his [[Ph.D.]] in computer science in 1989 from the [[University of Chicago]].<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=98045}}</ref>

Szegedy's research areas include [[computational complexity theory]] and [[quantum computing]].

He was awarded the [[Gödel Prize]] twice, in [[2001]] and [[2005]], for his work on [[probabilistically checkable proof]]s and on the space complexity of approximating the frequency moments in streamed data.<ref>[http://sigact.acm.org/prizes/godel/ Gödel Prize website with list of winners]</ref>
