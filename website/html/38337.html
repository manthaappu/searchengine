'''Trusted Operating System''' (TOS) generally refers to an [[operating system]] that provides sufficient support for [[multilevel security]] and evidence of correctness to meet a particular set of government requirements.

The most common set of criteria for trusted operating system design is the [[Common Criteria]] combined with the Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) for Labeled Security Protection Profile([[LSPP]]) and [[Mandatory Access Control]](MAC). The Common Criteria is the result of a multi-year effort by the governments of the U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the Netherlands to develop a harmonized security criteria for IT products.

Examples of certified trusted operating systems are:
* [[HP-UX|HP-UX 10.26]]
* PitBull for AIX 5L
* [[Trusted Solaris]]
* Trusted UNICOS 8.0 (Rated B1)
* [[XTS-400]]

Examples of operating systems that might be certifiable are:
* [[FreeBSD]]
* [[SELinux]] (see [http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/info/faq.cfm#I12 FAQ])
* [[Linux]]

Companies that have created trusted operating systems include:
* [[Addamax]] (BSD, SVR3, SVR4, HP/UX)
* Argus Systems Group (Solaris, AIX)
* [[AT&T]] (System V)
* Bull (AIX)
* Data General (DG/UX)
* [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (Ultrix)
* Gemini Computers (GEMSOS)
* Harris Corporation (SVR3, SVR4)
* [[Hewlett-Packard]](HP/UX)
* [[Honeywell]] (Multics)
* [[IBM]] (OS/390, AIX)
* [[SCO Group|SCO]] (SCO Unix)
* Secure Computing Corporation (LOCK, Mach, BSD)
* SecureWare (Apple A/UX, HP/UX, SCO)
* Sequent (Dynix/ptx)
* [[Silicon Graphics]] (IRIX)
* [[Sun Microsystems]] (SunOS, Solaris)
* [[Trusted Information Systems]] (Xenix, Mach)
* [[BAE Systems]] (XTS Unix)
