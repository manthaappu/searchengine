'''Bouncy Castle''' is a collection of [[Application Programming Interface|APIs]] used in [[cryptography]]. It includes APIs for both the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and the [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] programming languages.

Bouncy Castle is Australian in origin and thus American restrictions on the [[Export of cryptography in the United States|export of cryptographic software]] do not apply to it.

== History ==
Bouncy Castle started when two colleagues tired of having to re-invent a set of cryptography libraries each time they changed jobs. One of the very early design considerations of Bouncy Castle came from one of the developers being active in [[Java Platform, Micro Edition|JavaME]] development, and as a result{{huh?|date=October 2010}} there are two distinct library sets.

== Architecture ==
The low-level, or 'light-weight', API is a vendor-specific set of APIs that implement all the underlying cryptographic algorithms. The intent is to use the low-level API in memory constrained devices (JavaME) or when easy access to the [[Java Cryptography Extension|JCE]] libraries is not possible (such as distribution in an [[Java applet|applet]]).

The JCE-compatible provider is built upon the low-level API's.  As such, the source code for the JCE provider is an example of how to implement many of the "common" crypto problems using the low-level API.
