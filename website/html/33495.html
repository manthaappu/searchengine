The '''[[Seal (device)|seal]] of [[Northampton County, Virginia]]''' was developed to reflect the county's [[history]], its traditional way of life and its ties to the [[marine (ocean)|marine]] environment.

The [[gold]] rope which borders the seal represents the county's bond to the sea and its geographic location between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The four panels represent the county's economy (in [[agriculture]] and [[fish]]eries), life-style (coastal) and the community's relationship with the environment (depicted by the [[crab]]s, fish and [[geese]]).

The three dates in the inner circle represent:
*The first recorded [[England|English]] landing in 1603 by [[Bartholomew Gilbert]].
*The first permanent English settlement in 1620.
*Recognition as an original shire of the colony governed by England in 1634.

The black stems separating the gold band signifies points of the [[compass]] and the county's nautical history. The blue field surrounding the map represents clear skies and calm seas. The gold band depicts the county as a "unique area; precious and rare." Northampton County, shown in white, represents sunlight and a desire to do well.
