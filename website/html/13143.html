This process combines multiple changes to a single directory tree that occur within a short period of time, then notifies applications that have registered for changes to the affected directory.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/FSEvents_ProgGuide/|title=File System Events Programming Guide|date=2008-03-11|accessdate=2009-06-29}}</ref>

Unlike other methods for "watching" the filesystem, such as [[Linux]]'s [[inotify]], the <code>FSEvents</code> [[API]] provides no notifications for changes to individual files. An application may register to receive changes to a given directory, and must then determine for itself which file or files were changed.
