The name is a reference to an [[apocryphal]] story in which an unnamed expert programmer would keep a [[rubber duck]] by his desk at all times, and debug his code by forcing himself to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck.

The process is to meticulously explain code to an inanimate object, such as a rubber duck. It is expected that when the programmer comes across a piece of code that is incorrect, they will realize this<ref name="lorem" />. The method exploits [[cognitive dissonance]]; the programmer will be confronted with the fact that their code is not what they intended to write.
