'''Flaw hypothesis methodology''' is a [[systems analysis]] and [[penetration]] prediction technique where a list of hypothesized [[wiktionary:flaw|flaw]]s in a [[system]] are compiled through analysis of the [[specification]]s and documentation for the system. The list of hypothesized flaws is then prioritized on the basis of the estimated probability that a flaw actually exists, and on the ease of exploiting it to the extent of control or compromise. The prioritized list is used to direct the actual testing of the system.
