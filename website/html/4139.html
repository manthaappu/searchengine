'''Blocking''' occurs when a [[subroutine|function]] does not return until it either completes its task or results in an [[error]].

A process that is blocked is one that waits for the completion of some event,
such as an I/O operation <ref>{{harv|Stallings|2004}}</ref>

In a hypothetical two [[Process states|state]] model (running and not-running), processes would go onto
the (running) queue before being dispatched for execution. In the absence of a blocked state, if priority is measured by holdup time, blocked processes would erroneously get scheduled despite having nothing to operate on. This is undesirable from a processor utilization viewpoint. Hence the efficient use of resources makes a case for a blocked queue in which processes line up until the event dependency resolves.

Once the event fires, the process is advanced from blocked state to an imminent one, such as [[Process states#Ready|runnable]].
