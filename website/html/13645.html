'''Firestarter''' is a [[free software|free]] and [[open source]] [[personal firewall]] tool that uses the [[Netfilter]] (iptables/ipchains) system built into the [[Linux kernel]]. It has the ability to control both inbound and outbound connections. Firestarter provides a graphical interface for configuring firewall rules and settings. It also provides real-time monitoring of all network traffic for the system. Firestarter also provides facilities for [[port forwarding]], internet connection sharing and [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] service.
