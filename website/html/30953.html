'''RAM image''' is a term used to describe a sequence of [[machine code]] instructions and associated data kept permanently in the non-volatile [[Read-only memory|ROM]] memory of an [[embedded system]], which is copied into volatile [[RAM]] by a [[booting|bootstrap loader]].  Typically the RAM image is loaded into RAM when the system is switched on, and it contains a second-level bootstrap loader and basic hardware drivers, enabling the unit to function as desired, or else more sophisticated [[software]] to be loaded into the system.
