{{Sociology}}

The '''Sociology of knowledge''' is the study of the relationship between human thought and the social context within which it arises, and of the effects prevailing ideas have on societies. (See also: [[sociology of scientific knowledge]]) It is not a specialized area of sociology but instead deals with broad fundamental questions about the extent and limits of social influences on individual's lives and the social-cultural basics of our knowledge about the world.<ref>http://www.stthomasu.ca/academic/soci/weeks/3523.htm</ref>

The sociology of knowledge was pioneered primarily by the sociologists [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Marcel Mauss]] at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. Their works deal directly with how conceptual thought, language, and logic could be influenced by the sociological milieu out of which they arise. While neither author specifically coined nor used the term 'sociology of knowledge', their work is an important first contribution to the field.

The specific term 'sociology of knowledge' first came into widespread use in the 1920s, when a number of German-speaking [[sociology|sociologists]], most notably [[Max Scheler]], and [[Karl Mannheim]], wrote extensively on it.  With the dominance of [[functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]] through the middle years of the 20th century, the sociology of knowledge tended to remain on the periphery of mainstream sociological thought. It was largely reinvented and applied much more closely to everyday life in the 1960s, particularly by [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]] in ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]'' (1966) and is still central for methods dealing with qualitative understanding of human society  (compare ''[[socially constructed reality]]''). The 'genealogical' and 'archaeological' studies of [[Michel Foucault]] are of considerable contemporary influence.

==Schools==

===Émile Durkheim===

Émile Durkheim (1858-1917) is credited as having been the first professor to successfully establish the field of sociology, institutionalizing a department of sociology at the Université de Bordeaux in the 1890s. While his works deal with a number of subjects, including suicide, the family, social structures, and social institutions, a large part of his work deals with the sociology of knowledge. In 1902, he published, with Marcel Mauss, "De quelques formes primitives de classification", an essay that examines how the various ways in which a society is organized structurally impacts the formation of a society's categories and logical grouping systems. 

One of the most important elements of Durkheim's theory knowledge is his concept of [[représentation collectives]] ([[collective representations]]). 'Représentations collectives' are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that can serve as a symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, 'représentations collectives' are created through the intense interaction of religious rituals. They are products of collective activity and as such these 'représentations' have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole), and yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual's participation within society). Through 'représentations collectives' the group exerts pressure on the individual to conform to society's norms of morality and thought. As such, collective representations help to order and make sense of the world, but they also express, symbolize and interpret social relationships.

Durkheim's definitive statement concerning the sociology of knowledge comes in his magnum opus [[The Elementary Forms of Religious Life]]. This book has as its goal not only the elucidation of the social origins and function of religion, but also the social origins and impact of society on language and logical thought.

===Karl Mannheim===
{{main|Karl Mannheim}}
The German political philosophers [[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) and [[Friedrich Engels]] (1820–1895) argued in ''Die Deutsche Ideologie'' (1846, ''German Ideology'') and elsewhere that people's [[ideology|ideologies]], including their social and political beliefs and opinions, are rooted in their [[social class|class]] interests, and more broadly in the social and economic circumstances in which they live: "It is men, who in developing their material inter-course, change, along with this their real existence, their thinking and the products of their thinking. Life is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by life" (''Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe'' 1/5).
Under the influence of this doctrine, and of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]], the Hungarian-born German sociologist [[Karl Mannheim]] (1893–1947) gave impetus to the growth of the sociology of knowledge with his ''Ideologie und Utopie'' (1929, translated and extended in 1936 as ''Ideology and Utopia''), although the term had been introduced five years earlier by the co-founder of the movement, the German philosopher, phenomenologist and social theorist [[Max Scheler]] (1874–1928), in ''Versuche zu einer Soziologie des Wissens'' (1924, ''Attempts at a Sociology of Knowledge''). Mannheim feared that this interpretation could be seen to claim that all knowledge and beliefs are the products of socio-political forces since this form of [[relativism]] is self-defeating (if it is true, then it too is merely a product of socio-political forces and has no claim to truth and no persuasive force). Mannheim believed that [[relativism]] was a strange mixture of modern and ancient beliefs in that it contained within itself a belief in an absolute truth which was true for all times and places (the ancient view most often associated with [[Plato]]) and condemned other truth claims because they could not achieve this level of objectivity (an idea gleaned from [[Marx]]). Mannheim sought to escape this problem with the idea of '[[relationism]]'. This is the idea that certain things are true only in certain times and places (a view influenced by [[pragmatism]]) however, this does not make them less true. Mannheim felt that a stratum of free-floating intellectuals (who he claimed were only loosely anchored to the class structure of society) could most perfectly realize this form of truth by creating a "dynamic synthesis" of the ideologies of other groups. 

===Phenomenological Sociology===

[[Phenomenological Sociology]] is the study of the formal structures of concrete social existence as made available in and through the analytical description of acts of intentional consciousness. The "object" of such an analysis is the meaningful lived world of everyday life: the "Lebenswelt", or Life-world (Husserl:1989). The task, like that of every other phenomenological investigation, is to describe the formal structures of this object of investigation in subjective terms, as an object-constituted-in-and-for-consciousness (Gurwitsch:1964). That which makes such a description different from the "naive" subjective descriptions of the man in the street, or those of the traditional, positivist social scientist, is the utilization of phenomenological methods.   

The leading proponent of Phenomenological Sociology was [[Alfred Schutz]] [1899-1959]. Schutz sought to provide a critical philosophical foundation for [[Max Weber]]'s interpretive sociology through the use of phenomenological methods derived from the transcendental phenomenological investigations of [[Edmund Husserl]] [1859-1938]. Husserl's work was directed at establishing the formal structures of intentional [[consciousness]]. Schutz's work was directed at establishing the formal structures of the Life-world (Schutz:1980). Husserl's work was conducted as a transcendental phenomenology of consciousness. Schutz's work was conducted as a mundane phenomenology of the Life-world (Natanson:1974). The difference in their research projects lies at the level of analysis, the objects taken as topics of study, and the type of phenomenological reduction that is employed for the purposes of analysis. 

Ultimately, the two projects should be seen as complementary, with the structures of the latter dependent on the structures of the former. That is, valid phenomenological descriptions of the formal structures of the Life-world should be wholly consistent with the descriptions of the formal structures of intentional consciousness. It is from the latter that the former derives its validity and [[truth value]] (Sokolowski:2000).

The phenomenological tie-in with the sociology of knowledge stems from two key historical sources for [[Mannheim]]'s analysis: [1] Mannheim was dependent on insights derived from Husserl's phenomenological investigations, especially the theory of meaning as found in Husserl's Logical Investigations of 1900/1901 (Husserl:2000), in the formulation of his central methodological work: "On The Interpretation of Weltanschauung" (Mannheim:1993:see fn41 & fn43) - this essay forms the centerpiece for Mannheim's method of historical understanding and is central to his conception of the sociology of knowledge as a research program; and [2] The concept of "Weltanschauung" employed by Mannheim has its origins in the hermeneutic philosophy of Wilhelm Dilthey, who relied on Husserl's theory of meaning (above) for his methodological specification of the interpretive act (Mannheim: 1993: see fn38). 

It is also noteworthy that Husserl's analysis of the formal structures of consciousness, and Schuetz's analysis of the formal structures of the Life-world are specifically intended to establish the foundations, in consciousness, for the understanding and interpretation of a social world which is subject to cultural and historical change. The phenomenological position is that although the [[facticity]] of the social world may be culturally and historically relative, the formal structures of consciousness, and the processes by which we come to know and understand this [[facticity]], are not. That is, the understanding of any actual social world is unavoidably dependent on understanding the structures and processes of consciousness that found, and constitute, any possible social world. 

Alternately, if the [[facticity]] of the social world '''and''' the structures of consciousness prove to be culturally and historically relative, then we are at an impasse in regard to any meaningful scientific understanding of the social world which is not subjective (as opposed to being objective and grounded in nature [positivism], or inter subjective and grounded in the structures of consciousness [phenomenology]), and relative to the cultural and idealization formations of particular concrete individuals living in a particular socio-historical group.

===Michel Foucault===
{{main|Michel Foucault}}
A particularly important contemporary contribution to the sociology of knowledge is found in the work of Michel Foucault. ''Madness and Civilization'' (1961) postulated that conceptions of madness and what was considered "reason" or "knowledge" was itself subject to major [[culture bias]] - in this respect mirroring similar criticisms by [[Thomas Szasz]], at the time the foremost critic of [[psychiatry]], and himself now an eminent psychiatrist. A point where Foucault and Szasz agreed was that sociological processes played the major role in defining "madness" as an "illness" and prescribing "cures". In ''The Birth of the Clinic: An Archeology of Medical Perception'' (1963), Foucault extended his critique to institutional clinical medicine, arguing for the central [[conceptual metaphor]] of "[[Medical gaze|The Gaze]]", which had implications for [[medical education]], [[Prison#Prison_design_and_facilities|prison design]], and the [[carceral state]] as understood today. Concepts of [[criminal justice]] and its intersection with medicine were better developed in this work than in Szasz and others, who confined their critique to current psychiatric practice. ''The Order of Things'' (1966) and ''The Archeology of Knowledge'' (1969) introduced abstract notions of mathesis and taxonomia to explain the subjective 'ordering' of the [[human sciences]]. These, he claimed, had transformed 17th and 18th century studies of "general grammar" into modern "[[linguistics]]", "[[natural history]]" into modern "[[biology]]", and "[[analysis of wealth]]" into modern "[[economics]]"; though not, claimed Foucault, without loss of meaning. The 19th century transformed what knowledge was.

Perhaps Foucault's best-known claim was that "Man did not exist" before the 18th century. Foucault regarded notions of humanity and of [[humanism]] as inventions [[modernity]]. Accordingly, a [[cognitive bias]] had been introduced unwittingly into science, by over-trusting the individual doctor or scientist's ability to see and state things objectively. Foucault roots this argument in the rediscovery of Kant, though his thought is significantly influenced by [[Nietzsche]] - that philosopher declaring the "death of God" in the 19th century, and the [[anti-humanism|anti-humanists]] proposing the "death of Man" in the 20th.

=== Knowledge ecology ===
{{main|Knowledge ecology}}

'''Knowledge ecology''' is a concept originating from [[knowledge management]] and that aimed at "bridging the gap between the static data repositories of knowledge management and the dynamic, adaptive behavior of natural systems" <ref>
