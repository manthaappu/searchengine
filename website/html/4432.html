<html> <head> <title>Brain mapping</title></head><body>'''Brain mapping''' is a set of [[neuroscience]] techniques predicated on the mapping of (biological) quantities or properties onto spatial representations of the (human or non-human) brain resulting in [[map]]s. 

== Overview ==
All [[neuroimaging]] can be considered part of brain mapping. Brain mapping can be conceived as a higher form of [[neuroimaging]], producing brain images supplemented by the result of additional (imaging or non-imaging) data processing or analysis, such as maps projecting (measures of) behaviour onto brain regions (see [[fMRI]]). 

Brain Mapping techniques are constantly evolving, and rely on the development and refinement of image acquisition, representation, analysis, visualization and interpretation techniques. Functional and structural [[neuroimaging]] are at the core of the mapping aspect of Brain Mapping.

==History==
In the late 1980s in the United States, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Science was commissioned to establish a panel to investigate the value of integrating neuroscientific information across a variety of techniques.<ref>Constance M. Pechura, Joseph B. Martin (1991). ''Mapping the Brain and Its Functions: Integrating Enabling Technologies Into Neuroscience Research''. Institute of Medicine (U.S.). Committee on a National Neural Circuitry Database.</ref>

Of specific interest is using structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging ([[fMRI]]), electroencephalography ([[EEG]]), [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) and other non-invasive scanning techniques to map [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[perfusion]], function and [[phenotype]]s of the human brain. Both healthy and [[disease]]d brains may be mapped to study [[memory]], [[learning]], [[aging]], and [[drug]] effects in various populations such as people with [[schizophrenia]], [[autism]], and [[clinical depression]]. This led to the establishment of the [[Neuroinformatics|Human Brain Project]].<ref>Stephen H. Koslow and Michael F. Huerta (1997). ''Neuroinformatics: An Overview of the Human Brain Project''.</ref> 

Following a series of meetings, the International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) evolved.<ref>Mazziotta and Toga, 1995</ref> The ultimate goal is to develop flexible [[computational brain atlases]].'''

On 5.5.2010 the Supreme Court in India in its historical judgement on several PIL's{{Clarify|date=July 2010}} has declared brain mapping,lie detector test and narcoanalysis as unconstitutional as it violates Article 20 (3)of Fundamental Rights.It cannot be conducted forcefully on any individual and requires one's consent for the same.when it is conducted with one's consent the material so obtained will be regarded as evidence during trial of cases according to Section 27 of Evidence Act.
