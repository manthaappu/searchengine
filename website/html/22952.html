'''MIMIC Simulator''' is a product suite from [[Gambit Communications]] consisting of [[simulation]] software in the [[network management|network]]
and [[systems management]] space.

MIMIC solves a classical simulation problem: network management software typically manages large networks. Traditionally, in order to setup such networks for
the purposes of [[software development]], [[software testing]] or [[training]], physical equipment had to be separately purchased and assembled in
[[laboratories]]. To reduce the expense, most of the network can be simulated.

The principle behind [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]] simulation is that the SNMP protocol is an interface that can be simulated. SNMP requests carry data values
for [[Management information base|MIB]] objects, which can be shaped at will by the simulator, thus representing any device which has
an SNMP interface. In contrast to [[Network simulation]], where the entire network is modelled within a computer, this type of empirical 
simulation is visible on the network, and you can communicate with the simulator over the network.

The concept can be extended to other [[Protocol (computing)|protocols]] such as for [[cable modems]], [[command line interface|CLI]] such as [[Cisco IOS]] or [[TL1]],
or [[IPMI]].
