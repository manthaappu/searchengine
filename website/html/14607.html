'''GNU Pascal''' (GPC) is a [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]] [[compiler]] composed of a frontend to [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC), similar to the way [[Fortran]] and other languages were added to GCC. GNU Pascal is [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 7185 compatible, and it implements "most" of the ISO 10206 Extended Pascal standard (according to the manual).

The major advantage of piggybacking GNU Pascal on the GCC compiler is that it is instantly [[Porting|portable]] to any platform the GCC compiler supports.
