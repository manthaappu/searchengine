'''''MOOSE Crossing''''' was an educational [[MOO]] (a type of [[MUD]], a text-based [[virtual world]]) developed by [[Amy S. Bruckman]] in 1996 as her doctoral dissertation work.{{R|bruckman-phd}}  It employed a [[constructionist learning]] pedagogical approach and was designed for teaching children 9 to 13 years of age.{{R|netps}}  Bruckman's work on ''MOOSE Crossing'' and ''[[MediaMOO]]'' was called "the most notable MOO research in education".{{R|tornberg}}  The MOO closed in 2007 after 11 years online.{{R|mc-closed}}

''MOOSE Crossing'' used specialized client software, called ''MacMOOSE'' for the Macintosh version and ''WinMOOSE'' for the Windows version.{{R|netps}}
