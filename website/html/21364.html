</ref> It was developed at the Cognitive Computation Group of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign]]. Its implementation is distribution under the terms of a modified [[BSD license]].

LBJ is implemented as a compiler that translates LBJ programs to Java source code, which is then compiled to [[Java bytecode]]. It additionally trains any machine learning components of the program (based on a training set specified in the program). The resulting bytecode can be called as a library from any [[Java Virtual Machine|Java VM]] program.

Learning components included in the LBJ libraries include [[AdaBoost]], [[Naive Bayes classifier|na√Øve Bayesian]] classifiers, [[perceptron]]s and [[Sparse network of winnows|sparse networks of winnows]]. Via interfaces to external libraries, [[support vector machine]]s and the learners in the [[Weka (machine learning)|Weka]] toolkit are supported.

LBJ further includes the ability to add [[Constraint programming|constraint inference]] to the output of machine learners, following the [[Constrained Conditional Models]] paradigm. These constraints are expressed in a [[first-order logic]] language and can be used to, e.g., rule out certain results known to be impossible when using combinations of classifiers. Classification results and constraints are translated to [[Linear programming|linear]]/[[Linear programming#Integer unknowns|mixed integer programming]] problems, which are then solved using the [[GNU Linear Programming Kit|GLPK]] or [[Xpress MP]] toolkits.<ref>
