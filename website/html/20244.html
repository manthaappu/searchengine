===Brighton===
{{main|Clock Tower, Brighton}}
The ''Brighton Clock Tower'' or ''Jubilee Clock Tower'', located at the junction of West Street and Queens Road, [[Brighton]], [[England]], was built in 1888 to commemorate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. The clock carries portraits of the Queen, [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] and their son, the future Edward VII, and his wife. Above the clock is a gilt copper sphere, a [[time ball]] that once rose up a mast every hour and fell on the hour. The mechanism is no longer in use because of noise complaints from local residents.<ref name="mytravelguide">{{cite web|title=''Brighton Clock Tower''|work=MyTravelGuide.com|url=http://www.mytravelguide.com/attractions/profile-79497105-United_Kingdom_Brighton_Brighton_Clock_Tower.html|accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref>

===Maidenhead===
The ''Jubilee Clock Tower'', located in [[Maidenhead]], [[Berkshire]], [[England]] just outside the station in the town centre, was built as part of the nation's celebrations for Queen Victoria's [[Diamond Jubilee]] in 1897.

Building started in 1897 using money from public donations. The foundation stone was laid by then-mayor John Truscott on November 7, 1899. The tower was designed by local architect E. J. Shrewsbury, who designed many of the town's churches including St Peter's in Furze Platt plus the Technical Institute on Marlow Road. The clock tower was built by Charles Cox & Son; Charles Cox was the town mayor on several occasions. 

The tower is approximately 14 m (45 ft) tall and has four illuminated clock faces each facing the four compass points. A diamond pattern on the clock faces commemorates the clock's function. The clocks were donated by Mr G. A. Battcock; they were made and foxed by Smith of [[Derby]].

Red brick is used for most of the construction, typically of the local housing of that time. There is an elaborate pattern of stone work towards the top, just below the bell tower. All the clocks and bells still function. <ref name="clocktowerweb">{{cite web|title=''Why the name?''|work=ClockTowerWeb.com|url=http://www.clocktowerweb.co.uk/corporate/about/whyctw.php|accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref>

===Newmarket===
The ''Newmarket Clock Tower'' is located at the top of the High Street. Local builder Richard Arber built it to commemorate Queen Victoria’s [[Golden Jubilee]] of 1887. The tower was paid for by public subscription, but local trainer Charles Blanton donated the clock made by Smiths of [[Derby]]. The clock tower was officially opened in 1890. It takes 115 turns to fully wind the clock every week. <ref name="refname">{{cite web|title=''Newmarket Clock Tower''|work=UKattraction.com|url=http://www.ukattraction.com/east-of-england/newmarket-clock-tower.htm|accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref>

===Thornford===
In 1897 the village  of [[Thornford]] decided to commemorate Queen Victoria's [[Diamond Jubilee]] by erecting a ''Jubilee'' tower clock and incorporating a water tap at its base.<ref name="thornford">{{cite web|title=''Thornford’s Diamond Jubilee Clock''|work=Services.westdorset-dc.gov.uk|url=http://services.westdorset-dc.gov.uk/websites/ThornhackettPC/thornford.htm|accessdate=2007-04-02}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> 

The clock tower was completed by [[Christmas]] 1898 and a clock made by Richard Robert Purchase, jeweller and watchmaker of [[Yeovil]], was installed. A weather vane made by local blacksmith Albert Gabe was accepted by the Parish Council to complete the monument, and a Lime tree and privet hedge were planted behind the tower and iron railings with kissing gates erected at the front.<ref name="thornford"/>

===Weymouth===

Erected in 1887 to mark the 50th year of [[Queen Victoria]]'s reign the ''Jubilee Clock'' was originally positioned on a stone base on Weymouth sands, but in the 1920s the Esplanade was built around it to protect the sands from the encroachment of shingle from the eastern end of the beach. 

The clock is one of Weymouth's best-loved landmarks and has been a meeting place for generations of both locals and visitors. It is the focal point of Weymouth's New Year's Eve celebrations as midnight approaches and revelers gather beneath its four faces to welcome in the New Year. <ref name="sun_inn">{{cite web|title=''The Jubilee Clock''|url=http://www.suninnweymouth.co.uk/jubilee-clock.html|accessdate=2007-04-09}}</ref>

Manufactured by Walter Macfarlane & Co. at the [[Saracen Works]], [[Glasgow]]. There is one other known clock using the same castings, the [[Hastings Clock]] erected at [[Rotherham|Rotherham, England]] in 1912.<ref name="IOM-jclock"/>

As can be seen from this circa 1900 photo, it originally had a horse trough and, hidden by one of those standing at the base, a drinking fountain above which is a plaque of Queen Victoria.<ref name="IOM-jclock"/>

The 8-day clock mechanism used a weight descending in the column - originally the four clock faces were lit by small gas jets. Both mechanisms are now electrified.<ref name="IOM-jclock"/>
