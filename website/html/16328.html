'''Harry Carlton Comprehensive School''' is a [[comprehensive school]] located in a large village called [[East Leake]] in the [[Rushcliffe]] area of [[Nottinghamshire]]. The school describes itself as specialising in ICT (Information Communication Technology) and Mathematics. The current head master is Graham Legg. The school has a roll of 1150. In September 2003, the school moved into a £20m new building,<ref name=nep/> built with [[Private Finance Initiative]] funding, and rented from Alfred McAlpine Business Services. The school shares its location with a leisure centre and [[Lantern Lane Primary & Nursery School]].

==Results==
The school achieves higher GCSE results than both the national and Nottinghamshire averages although the highest recent result was in 2003 when 70% gained 5 A-C grades. 

==History==
The school was designed by Donald Gibson, the county architect, to accommodate 300 pupils. It was intended to reflect its rural location and allowed for the school to keep its own livestock. It was opened on the 27 July 1957 by Brigadier [[Martin Redmayne, Baron Redmayne|Martin Redmayne]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Territorial Decoration|TD]], [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]]. The school was then called the '''East Leake County Secondary School'''. The first head was Mr Tyler.<ref>Opening Programme for East Leake County, published by Nottingham Education committee, 1956, [http://www.brain-cells.co.uk/bcells7/HarryP/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20The%20Opening%20Ceremony%201956.pdf available at Brain Cells]</ref>

A team from the school won a national competition in 2001 to predict UK base interest rates organised by the [[Bank of England]]. The school received £10,000.<ref>[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/news/2001/040.htm Target 2 Point 5 - The Bank of England/Times Interest Rate Challenge, Harry Carlton Comprehensive School Wins National Final, 23 March 2001] accessed 18 December 2007</ref>

The school was rebuilt in 2002 as part of a private finance initiative. Before this the school had been flooded three times in one year. <ref name=nep>[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-11363442_ITM "Its the only way to build schools", Nottingham Evening Post, 20 December 2002] accessed 17 December 2007</ref>
