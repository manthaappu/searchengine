'''Xena''' is [[open-source software]] for use in [[digital preservation]]. Xena is short for XML Electronic Normalising for Archives. 

Xena is a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] application developed by the [[National Archives of Australia]]. It is available free of charge under the [[GNU General Public License]].

Version 5.0.0 was released Dec. 9, 2009. Source code and binaries for Linux, OS X and Windows are available from [[SourceForge]].

==Mode of operation==
Xena attempts to avoid [[digital obsolescence]] by converting files into an openly specified format, such as [[OpenDocument|ODF]] or [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]]. If the file format is not supported or the Binary Normalisation option is selected, Xena will perform [[ASCII]] [[Base64]] encoding on binary files and wrap the output in XML metadata. The resulting .xena file is plain text, although the content of the data itself is not directly human-readable. The exact original file can be retrieved by stripping the metadata and reversing the Base64 encoding, using an internal viewer. 

==Features==
Platforms supported by Xena are [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]].

Xena uses a series of plugins to identify file formats and convert them to an appropriate openly specified format.

Xena has an [[application programming interface]] which allows any reasonably skilled Java developer to develop a plugin to cover a new file type.

Xena can process individual files or whole directories. When processing a whole directory, it can preserve the original directory structure of the converted records.

Xena can create plain text versions of file formats such as [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]], [[Microsoft Word|Word]] and [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], with the use of [[Tesseract (software)]].

The Xena interface or Xena Viewer can be used to view or export a Xena file in its target file format.

The Xena Viewer supports bulk export of Xena files to target file formats. 

Xena can be used via its [[graphical user interface]] or the [[command line]].

For Xena to be fully functional, it requires a local installation of the following external software:
*[[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]] suite - to convert office documents to ODF format
*Tesseract - to create plain text versions of file formats
*[[ImageMagick]] - to convert a subset of image files to [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]]
*Readpst - to convert [[Microsoft Outlook]] PST files to XML. Readpst is part of the free and open source [http://www.five-ten-sg.com/libpst/ libpst software suite].
*[[Free Lossless Audio Codec|FLAC]] - to convert audio files to FLAC format. This is also required to playback audio files using Xena.

==Supported file types==
Xena will recognize and process the file types listed below, plus a few others of minor importance. Unsupported file types will automatically undergo binary normalization.

Office suites and applications:
*[[Microsoft Office]] files (including [[Microsoft Office XML formats|MS Office XML]], [[SYLK]] spreadsheets and [[Rich Text Format]]) are converted to the corresponding OpenOffice files
*[[Microsoft Outlook]] [[Personal Storage Table|PST]] files are parsed for their individual messages, which are converted to XML files and a Xena index file is created
*[[Microsoft Project]] MPP files are converted to XML
*[[Oracle Open Office|StarOffice]] files (SXC, SXI, SXW) are converted to the corresponding OpenOffice formats
*[[WordPerfect]] WPD files are converted to OpenOffice ODT
*OpenOffice documents (ODT, ODS, ODB, ODP) are preserved unchanged
*Acrobat PDF files are stored as binaries
*Mailbox files (MBX) are converted to individual XML files

Graphics:
*[[BMP file format|BMP]], [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]], [[Adobe Photoshop|PSD]], [[PCX]], [[.ras|RAS]], and the [[X-Window|X Window System]][[X BitMap|XBM]] and [[X PixMap|XPM]] bitmap files are converted to [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]]; [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]] files additionally get embedded metadata stored in Xena XML. If the [[Tesseract (software)|Tesseract]] [[Optical character recognition|OCR software]] is installed, text will be extracted from TIFF files.
*OpenOffice Document Drawings (ODG) and [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] files are wrapped in Xena XML
*JPG and PNG files are stored unchanged

Archive Files:
*Files are extracted from [[File archiver|archives]] ([[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]], [[gzip|GZIP]], [[tar (file format)|TAR/TAR.gz]], [[JAR (file format)|JAR]], [[WAR (Sun file format)|WAR]], Mac binary) and normalised into a separate Xena file. A Xena index file is created, which when opened in the internal Xena viewer will display the files in a table.

Audio files:
*[[MP3]], [[WAV]], [[AIFF]], and [[Vorbis|OGG]] formats are converted to [[Free Lossless Audio Codec|FLAC]] files.

Databases:
*[[SQL]] files are processed as plain text wrapped in XML

Other file types:
*HTML is converted to XHTML
*TXT text files are stored as plain text wrapped in XML; CSS files are stored as plain text wrapped in XML

==Reviews==
An April 22, 2010 review in Practical e-Records rated Xena at 82/100 points. At present Xena has no target preservation format for video files<ref>[http://e-records.chrisprom.com/?p=1081 Xena review in Practical e-Records]</ref>.
