<html> <head> <title>Pseudo bit error ratio</title></head><body>'''Pseudo bit error ratio''' (PBER) in adaptive [[high-frequency]] (HF) [[radio]], is a [[bit error ratio]] derived by a majority decoder that processes redundant transmissions. 

''Note:''  In adaptive HF radio [[automatic link establishment]], PBER is determined by the extent of error correction, such as by using the fraction of non-unanimous votes in the 2-of-3 majority decoder.
