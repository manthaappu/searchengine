'''MindVox''' was a famed early [[Internet Service Provider]] in [[New York City]]. A controversial sometime media darling — the service was referred to as "the [[Hells Angels]] of Cyberspace"<ref name="HellsAngels">[http://phantom.com/staticpage/Akashic/InternetSurf.html Hells Angels of Cyberspace, Vox Chapter]</ref> — it was founded in 1991 by [[Bruce Fancher]] ([[Dead Lord]]) and [[Patrick Kroupa]] ([[Lord Digital]]), two former members of the legendary [[Legion of Doom (hacking)|Legion of Doom]] hacker group<ref name="MindVoxWired">[http://phantom.com/staticpage/Akashic/Wired1.html MindVox: Urban Attitude Online, Wired Magazine]</ref>. The system was at least partially online by March 1992, and open to the public in November of that year.

MindVox was the second ISP in New York City<ref name="MindVoxRocksWired">[http://wired-vig.wired.com/news_drop/news_lycatalog/story/0,2149,3085,00.html MindVox on the Rocks, Wired Magazine]</ref>. Some controversy over this latter statement exists<ref name="SlashdotMindVox">[http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=136218&threshold=1&commentsort=0&tid=95&tid=172&tid=17&mode=thread&cid=11382332 MINDVOX was the oldest ISP in NYC, not Panix, Slashdot]</ref>; however, by the time the first MindVox test message was posted to [[Usenet]] in 1992<ref name="MVusenet">[http://groups.google.com/group/ny.test/msg/40852462c172b613?dmode=source MindVox usenet test message, 1992]</ref>, customers of the rival service, [[Panix (ISP)|Panix]], had made nearly 6,000 posts<ref name="MVusenet2">[http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22panix+com%22&start=0&scoring=d&num=10&hl=en&lr=&as_drrb=b&as_mind=1&as_minm=1&as_miny=1981&as_maxd=7&as_maxm=3&as_maxy=1992&safe=off& Panix usenet messages]</ref>. The test message was apparently posted by the infamous [[Phiber Optik]], who would have been waiting for a [[Manhattan]] [[grand jury]] [[indictment]] at the time for hacking activities.

Another potential "start date" for the service would be the registration of the service's ''phantom.com'' domain, on 14 February 1992.

The distinctive logo shown to the right was the system's original [[ASCII art]] banner, appearing on the text-only service's [[Dial-up access|dial-up]] login page. MindVox was originally accessible only through [[telnet]], [[ftp]] and direct dial-up. Its existence predates the invention of [[Secure Shell|SSH]] and widespread use of the [[World Wide Web]] by several years. In later years, MindVox was also accessible via the web<ref name="mindvoxWeb">[http://web.archive.org/web/19961111052514/http://phantom.com/ MindVox Web Page, 1996]</ref>.

The parent company, ''Phantom Access Technologies, Inc.'' took its name from a hacking program written by Kroupa during his early teens, called [[Phantom Access]]<ref name="phantomAccess">[http://www.textfiles.com/exhibits/paccess/ Phantom Access Exhibit, Textfiles.com]</ref>.

MindVox functioned both as a private [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] service, containing its own dedicated discussion groups, termed "conferences" — though usually referred to as "forums" by users — as well as a provider of internet and Usenet access. By 1994 the subscriber base was at around 3,000 <ref name="subscribers">[http://phantom.com/staticpage/Akashic/NYTimes3.html MindVox, Long a Haven for Hackers, Signs Off. NY Times]</ref>. In many ways MindVox was a harder, edgier, New York incarnation of the [[WELL (virtual community)|WELL]]<ref name="wellref1">[http://phantom.com/staticpage/Media/AssociatedPress1.html Wiring the Planet: MindVox! AP]</ref>,<ref name="well2">[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.06/flux.html Wired Flux: MindVox April Fools]</ref>,<ref name="well3">[http://www.fiu.edu/~mizrachs/matrix-measure.html A Fortean's Guide To Computer Resources]</ref> (a famous Northern [[California]]n online community.) While users were drawn from all over the world, the majority lived in the New York City area, and members who met through the conferences often became acquainted in person, either on their own, or through what were termed "VoxMeats" (a formal gathering of members whose ''[[double entendre]]'' name was rumored to be well-earned.)

Prominent MindVox "evangelists" included sci-fi author [[Charles Platt (science-fiction author)|Charles Platt]], who wrote about MindVox for [[Wired magazine|Wired]] Magazine<ref name="MindVoxWired" /> and featured it within his book ''Anarchy Online''<ref name="AnarchyOnline">[http://www.amazon.com/Anarchy-Online-Charles-Platt/dp/0061009903 Anarchy Online, Charles Platt]</ref>. MindVox also attracted (sometimes with the aid of free accounts<ref name="comped">[http://www.textfiles.com/bbs/MINDVOX/DOCUMENTS/complimentary Welcome Letter to VIP MindVox Members with comped accounts]</ref>) artists, writers, activists and luminaries such as [[Billy Idol]], [[Wil Wheaton]], [[Robert Altman]], [[Douglas Rushkoff]], [[John Perry Barlow]], and [[Kurt Cobain]]. The level of hysteria and hype surrounding MindVox was so great that in 1993 executives at [[MTV]] who were using the system wanted to buy it outright and turn MindVox into a subsidiary of [[Viacom]]<ref name="MTVMindVox">[http://new.ryze.com/view.php?who=RTercek Former Viacom exec discussing MTV's possible acquisition of MindVox]</ref>.

=="Voices in My Head"==
MindVox was deeply connected to the emerging non-academic [[Hacker (computing)|hacker]] culture and ideas about the potentials of [[cyberspace]], as can be seen in Patrick Kroupa's essay, ''Voices in my Head, MindVox: The Overture''<ref name="Overture">[http://wiretap.area.com/Gopher/Library/Cyber/mindvox.txt Voices in my Head, MindVox: The Overture]</ref>, which announced the upcoming opening of MindVox, and crossed the line into shaping an entire culture's mythology, seeing publication in magazines such as Wired<ref name="wired1">[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.05/cybernaut.html Memoirs of a Cybernaut, Wired]</ref>, and extensive coverage throughout the media<ref name="mondo">[http://www.phantom.com/staticpage/Media/Mondo1.html There's A Party in my Mind... MindVox! Mondo 2000]</ref>. ''Voices'' provided a compelling and sweeping first-person overview of the cultural forces that were at play in the hacker underground during the decade that pre-dated MindVox, considered by some the "[[Golden Age]]" of cyberspace.

More than a decade later, ''Voices'' remains one of the most read and widely-distributed pieces of writing to ever emerge about the origins and possible futures of cyberspace. It was the spark that propelled Kroupa out of obscurity <ref name="lozerz">[http://www.textfiles.com/100/lozers.hum OFFICIAL 1984 LOZERLIST]</ref>,<ref name="phrack">[http://www.phrack.com/issues.html?issue=42&id=3#article Lord Digital's Phrack Prophile]</ref>,<ref name="cud">[http://venus.soci.niu.edu/~cudigest/CUDS4/cud441.txt Computer Underground Digest's Jim Thomas, interviews Patrick Kroupa]</ref>,<ref name="phrack2">[http://www.phrack.com/issues.html?issue=36&id=5#article *ELITE ACCESS* as printed in Phrack]</ref>, and into the pages of books describing him as the [[Jim Morrison]] of cyberspace<ref name="HellsAngels" />. ''Voices'' also helped turn MindVox from being just another ISP into a counter-cultural media darling meriting full-length features in magazines and newspapers such as [[Rolling Stone]], [[Forbes]], [[The Wall Street Journal]], [[The New York Times]] and [[The New Yorker]].

=="Voice: Waffle ][+ the NeXTSTEP"==
As with many things MindVox-related, the name of the software MindVox ran on, was both a play on words and an elaborate inside-joke. ''Voice: Waffle ][+ the NeXTSTEP'' (usually referred to simply as ''Voice,'' although it frequently was referred to by the plural ''Voices'' as well), was the name given to MindVox's conferencing system<ref name="voxfaq1">[http://www.textfiles.com/bbs/MINDVOX/FAQ/faq-1.01 MindVox FAQ, circa 1992]</ref>. [[Waffle (bbs)|Waffle]] refers to the original software that MindVox was based on<ref name="wafflefaq">[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/waffle-faq/ Waffle FAQ]</ref>, the ][+ pays homage to Kroupa and Fancher's hacker past and the use of [[Apple II]] computers; [[NeXTSTEP]] was a reference to the [[NeXT]] platform and operating system, with which MindVox was developed and launched.
[[Image:Mv8ball.png|thumb|252px|left|MindVox promotional materials circa 1993. Phantom Access Technologies glyph on ray cast eightball.]]
As much as Patrick Kroupa's ''Voices'' focused the media and counter-culture spotlight on MindVox; Fancher's software was a source of tremendous attention in many MindVox-related stories and it's unlikely that MindVox would have enjoyed its success without ''Voice''<ref name="wellref1" />. At the time MindVox launched, it was one of the first public-access ISPs in the world. The major technical difference between MindVox and every other system at the time, was instead of expecting newcomers to understand [[Unix]] and meet a cryptic [[Command prompt|shell prompt]], the entire system was accessible through Fancher's highly-flexible interface<ref name="boardwatch">[http://www.phantom.com/staticpage/Media/Boredwatch.html Boardwatch Magazine, MindVox article, 1992]</ref>.

The original Waffle software was written by [[Tom Dell]]<ref name="tomdell">[http://bbsdocumentary.dreamhost.com/photos/057waffle/index.html Tom Dell in BBS the Documentary]</ref>,<ref name="wafflefaq" />, who was apparently part of MindVox from its inception<ref name="mcredits">[http://www.textfiles.com/bbs/MINDVOX/thecredits.txt the MindVox credits]</ref>. To this date there are Easter-eggs and cross-references on both MindVox<ref name="mvbios">[http://www.phantom.com/staticpage/About/VoxBios.html MindVox 2000 biographies page]</ref> and the system that Tom Dell became better known for in the late 90's and beyond: [[Rotten.com]]. Going to Rotten's search page<ref name="rttn">[http://www.rotten.com/search Rotten.com ibogaine secret message]</ref>, and triple-clicking on the whitespace located between the Contact section and the gray bar at the bottom, reveals an inscrutable ibogaine rant.

By the mid-90's the original Waffle software was nearly unrecognizable; Fancher had converted ''Voice'' to a client-server architecture<ref name="faq2.43">[http://www.textfiles.com/bbs/MINDVOX/FAQ/faq-2.43 MindVox FAQ, circa 1994]</ref>, included a web interface<ref name="mindvoxwww">[http://web.archive.org/web/19961111052514/http://phantom.com/ Archive.org snapshot of MindVox WWW page, circa 1996]</ref>, and added elaborate "power user" features which seem to have been added to address the evolving needs of the community; or due to a strange combination of drugs, nostalgia and pure whim. An example of the latter case is VoxChat<ref name="voxchat">[http://www.textfiles.com/bbs/MINDVOX/DOCUMENTS/bufu MindVox's VoxChat(TM) Welcome Screen]</ref>, a proprietary chat system written for MindVox by employee David Schenfeld, which spun off into the commercial product [[ENTchat]] after MindVox shut down<ref name="ddial">[http://ddial.com/highlight.html The History of Diversi-Dial]</ref>. [[Diversi-Dial]], and the Diversi-Dial spinoff ENTchat, allowed MindVox to connect via the Diversi-Dial chat protocol.<ref name="voxchat2">[http://www.textfiles.com/bbs/MINDVOX/MENUS/chat MindVox Chat System]</ref>), or in Kroupa's own words:

:As of this writing there are roughly a dozen remaining DDIAL's running on Apple computers, Novation has long since gone Chapter 11, Bill Basham (the author of DDIAL) has gone back to being a full-time doctor, and one slightly disturbed person in the Phantom Access Group has written the world's only version of DDIAL that will run on Unix based machines and allow T1 connected, distributed sites with gigabytes of disk and thousands of users, to hook into Pig's Knuckle Idaho's very own 7 line DDIAL running at a blazing fast 300 baud. Why this was done is a question best left to mental health professionals.<ref name="faq2.43" />

The last sentence in the paragraph quoted above could be applied to many features present in the MindVox shell<ref name="mindvoxshell">[http://www.textfiles.com/bbs/MINDVOX/DOCUMENTS/shell Introduction message for MindVox shell accounts]</ref>,<ref name="mindvoxwords">[http://www.textfiles.com/bbs/MINDVOX/mindvox.words.txt MindVox words collection]</ref>. It included advanced conferencing features interspersed with time-consuming, elaborate in-jokes with no commercial purpose whatsoever.

:The '''''Fling''''' Screen from MindVox. When inappropriate or extremely off-topic material was posted to a conference; moderators were unable to remove or destroy the message entirely, but they could move the message to the '''''r0mPEr-RuM''''', a conference that was the collective garbage-dump of MindVox.

To this day the phantom.com MindVox archive continues its relationship with NeXT/NeXTSTEP, now in the form of [[Apple Computer]]'s [[Mac OS X]]. Instead of using [[php]], [[perl]] or [[Active Server Pages]], the entire site runs Apple's [[WebObjects]].

MindVox was a fusion of many strange parts, pieces and times. While Kroupa might be said to have provided the imaginative backstory of the "thoughtscape", Fancher was largely responsible for the software that made it all work. The synergy of Kroupa, Fancher and the user-base MindVox attracted was a major aspect of MindVox's rise to fame.

==The MindVox shutdown==
MindVox began to fall apart around 1996, when it ceased operating as an ISP, and shut off dial-up access. While the exact date of the shutdown is disputed, the New York Times lists the closure as occurring in July of that year<ref name="subscribers" />. Ironically this happened a few months after [[New York Magazine]] voted MindVox as one of the three best ISP's in New York<ref name="bestisps">[http://www.phantom.com/staticpage/Media/NewYork2.html Three Best Internet Service Providers in NYC, New York Magazine]</ref>.

A public message<ref name="customerssold">[http://web.archive.org/web/19961111052536/phantom.com/announcement.html Archive.org copy of MindVox's announcement of the sale of their client-base]</ref> noted that free telnet access to the MindVox servers would still be available after the shutdown, but this did not last. While users were given the option to transfer their accounts to [[Interport Communications]], the unique MindVox community did not survive.

Many different reasons have been given for the downfall, including increased competition from the arrival of large-scale providers like AT&T, possible legal difficulties, and the apparent incestuousness of the company and its core users<ref name="MindVoxRocksWired" />. But none of the theories provided realistic answers as to why the final days of MindVox seem to be closer to [[The Great Gatsby]]<ref name="gatsbyquote">[http://web.archive.org/web/20031005231435/www.kenkappel.com/texthtml/Time-for-an-Accounting.html MindVox lawsuit paperwork with plaintiff quoting the Great Gatsby at MindVox principles]</ref>, and [[Altered States]]<ref name="kroupacb">[http://ibogaine.mindvox.com/Media/CoolBeans.htm Patrick Kroupa interview, Cool Beans Magazine]</ref>, than a successful or unsuccessful technology corporation. Much of the legal paperwork from the time reads like something out of [[The Bonfire of the Vanities]]<ref name="lawsuit2">[http://web.archive.org/web/20031116040706/www.kenkappel.com/pdf/Telephone-Conversation-September-28-1995.pdf Archive.org copy of MindVox legal melodrama and rambling accusations]</ref>.

A 1999 article by Tom Higgins (username "Tomwhore" on the system), a user and one time employee of MindVox, summarized the turbulent closing thus:

:So what happened to MindVox? In short its customers happened. Under the strain of pleasing a paying customer base, watching a hobby turn into an industry and simply getting caught up in its own hype, MindVox tumbled into a soap opera nose dive of sex, drugs and mismanagement.<ref name="mindvox9">[http://phantom.com/staticpage/Akashic/MindVoxFC.html MindVox FC (First Cataclysm), The Whole Entire Story in its Complete Totality]</ref>

By 1997 Patrick Kroupa had effectively disappeared from public view. The last days of MindVox are more the stuff of mythology than recorded fact, with different publications listing different dates for the shutdown. The New York Times and Wired were apparently unable to arrive at a consensus, with the Times listing the sale of MindVox's client-base and the closing of the system, in 1996<ref name="subscribers" />, while Wired was still covering an apparently open and at least partially operational MindVox circa 1997<ref name="MindVoxRocksWired" />.

Additional material suggests MindVox was never fully "closed" but simply closed to the public to become a private, invitation-only system. Rumors of a private, "inside" MindVox circulated, fueled by reprints of supposed internal MindVox messages from 1998 and 1999 that circulated on various mailing lists. The ''mindvox.com'' domain remained registered while, for a time, mail to ''phantom.com'' was redirected to Interport. The major discrepancy between the Times and Wired dates lends additional credence to the idea that MindVox continued, at least for a while, to support a community after its modem lines were turned off.

==MindVox in the 21st Century==
[[Image:MindVox2007.jpg|thumb|277px|right|MindVox logo, circa 2007.]]

During 2000 a variety of MindVox pieces went back online<ref name="mvhist9">[http://web.archive.org/web/20010309141332/http://mindvox.com/ Archive.org copy of MindVox website, circa 2000]</ref>, at ''phantom.com'' and additional material was released by MindVox to ''[[textfiles.com]]''. By 2001, Kroupa was back in the public eye and openly acknowledged being a lifelong [[heroin]] [[Substance dependence|addict]], who had finally kicked [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]] through the use of the [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic drug]] [[ibogaine]].

It is unclear whether mailing lists on MindVox continued in perpetuity from the 90s, or began reappearing in 2000, but in addition to the Vox list it was hosting, by 2001 MindVox was a hub of activity in the fields of [[harm reduction]], [[drug policy reform]], and [[psychedelic drug]]s (most notably [[Ibogaine]])<ref name="iboList">[http://ibogaine.mindvox.com/ The Ibogaine section of MindVox]</ref>.

While the drug-related community surrounding [http://ibogaine.mindvox.com MindVox : Ibogaine] has taken on  a completely new life; the interactive system itself, and the internal conferences and other services MindVox provided, have not returned (despite announcements and plans heralding the perpetually-delayed rebirth of MindVox)<ref name="mvoxreopen90s">[http://web.archive.org/web/19991129054703/www.mindvox.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MindVox Archive.org snapshot of MindVox beta test circa 1999]</ref>.

In 2005, MindVox was featured in two documentary films. Bruce Fancher is interviewed in ''[[BBS: The Documentary]]'',<ref name="bbsdoc">[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460402/ IMDB: BBS: The Documentary]</ref>, and Patrick Kroupa plays himself in ''[[Ibogaine: Rite of Passage]]'',<ref name="ibofilm">[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0431823/ IMDB: Ibogaine: Rite of Passage]</ref>.

On December 9, 2005, the [[Transcriptions Project]]<ref name="transcriptions">[http://transcriptions.english.ucsb.edu/ transcriptions project() Project at UC's Department of English]</ref>, placed [[Agrippa (A Book of the Dead)|The Agrippa Files]] online<ref name="agrippa1">[http://agrippa.english.ucsb.edu/ transcriptions project() Agrippa archive]</ref>, which included [[Matthew G. Kirschenbaum]]'s, "Hacking 'Agrippa': The Source of the Online Text," an excerpt from his book ''Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination''<ref name="agrippa4">[http://agrippa.english.ucsb.edu/kirschenbaum-matthew-g-hacking-agrippa-the-source-of-the-online-text/ transcriptions project() Hacking Agrippa]</ref>. The "Agrippa" discussed by Kirschenbaum was an unusual [[cyberpunk]]-influenced media project from 1992 by the science-fiction author [[William Gibson]]; its first public "leak" was to MindVox users in December of that year.

Within the chapter, Kirschenbaum references several personal letters to Patrick Kroupa, circa 2003, and reveals that Kroupa cooperated with him by placing all of MindVox back online "for an hour or 5"<ref name="kroupaagrippa">[http://agrippa.english.ucsb.edu/kirschenbaum-matthew-g-hacking-agrippa-the-source-of-the-online-text/#3 Patrick Kroupa places MindVox back online for a few hours in 2003]</ref> so that Kirschenbaum could view the context within which Agrippa was originally released. In discussing the service, Kirschenbaum referred to MindVox as "a kind of interface between what [[Alan Sondheim]] has aptly called the ''darknet'' and the clean, well lighted cyberspaces"<ref name="agrippa0">[http://agrippa.english.ucsb.edu/kirschenbaum-matthew-g-hacking-agrippa-the-source-of-the-online-text/ transcriptions project() Agrippa: Hacking the Online Text]</ref>.

==MindVox Reloaded==

In January 2009 the mindvox.com website changed for the first time in over 8 years and featured a new third generation MindVox logo along with the caption '''Hell Frozen Over''' and a counter ticking down to [[April Fools' Day]].

On April 1, 2009, MindVox appears to have relaunched for the first time in the 21st century<ref name="mvreloaded">[http://www.mindvox.com/request_access MindVox relaunch]</ref>.

While the labyrinth of conferences, files and user interactions providing a unique overview of the birth of the public internet that are buried within the depths of MindVox have never re-surfaced or been made publicly available, limited archives of some parts of the service remain online at:
* http://www.phantom.com/
* http://www.textfiles.com/bbs/MINDVOX/

An [[IRC]] channel, [[EFnet]] #mindvox, created in the 1990s, has survived as a gathering place for some members of the older community.
