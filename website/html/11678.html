<html> <head> <title>Edge cycle cover</title></head><body>In mathematics, an '''edge cycle cover''' (sometimes called simply '''cycle cover'''<ref>Cun-Quan Zhang, Integer flows and cycle covers of graphs, Marcel Dekker,1997.</ref>) of a [[graph (mathematics)|graph]] is a set of [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]]s which are [[subgraph]]s of ''G'' and contain all edges of ''G''. 

If the cycles of the cover have no vertices in common, the cover is called '''vertex-disjoint''' or sometimes simply '''disjoint cycle cover'''. In this case the set of the cycles constitutes a [[spanning subgraph]] of ''G''.

If the cycles of the cover have no edges in common, the cover is called '''edge-disjoint''' or simply '''disjoint cycle cover'''.

==Properties and applications==

===Minimum-Weight Cycle Cover===
For a [[weighted graph]], the Minimum-Weight Cycle Cover Problem (MWCCP) is the problem to find a cycle cover with minimal sum of weights of edges in all cycles of the cover.

For [[bridge (graph theory)|bridge]]less [[planar graph]]s the MWCCP can be solved in [[polynomial time]]. <ref>"Handbook in Graph Theory" (2004) ISBN 1584880902, [http://books.google.com/books?id=mKkIGIea_BkC&pg=PA225&lpg=PA225&dq=%22minimum+weight+cycle+cover%22&source=web&ots=VV2JRTVXzz&sig=RPtrYtXXqDFPfXv0OrX0gqLs8GE&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result#PPA225,M1 p. 225]</ref>

==Double cycle cover==
The [[cycle double cover conjecture]] is an open problem in graph theory stating that in every [[Bridge (graph theory)|bridgeless]] graph there exists a set of cycles that together cover every edge of the graph twice.<ref>[http://www.cems.uvm.edu/%7Earchdeac/problems/cyclecov.htm "The Cycle Double Cover Conjecture"]</ref>
