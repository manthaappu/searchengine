'''IBM Tivoli Directory Server''' (ITDS), formerly known as IBM Directory Server, is an [[IBM]] implementation of the [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol]], and is part of the IBM Tivoli Identity & Access Management portfolio.

IBM Tivoli Directory Server is a powerful, [[computer security|security-rich]] and standards-compliant enterprise directory for corporate [[intranet]]s and the [[Internet]]. Directory Server is built to serve as the identity data foundation for rapid development and deployment of [[Web application]]s and security and [[identity management]] initiatives by including strong management, replication and security features.

Several [[authentication]] methods are available with IBM Tivoli Directory Server, beyond basic usernames and passwords. ITDS supports [[public key certificate|digital certificate-based authentication]], the [[Simple Authentication and Security Layer]] (SASL), Challenge-Response Authentication Mechanism MD5 (CRAM-MD5), and [[Kerberos]] authentication.

IBM Tivoli Directory Server is a powerful LDAP infrastructure that provides a foundation for deploying comprehensive identity management applications and advanced software architectures.

== History ==
During the product's inception, IBM named its product the IBM SecureWay Directory. This name wasn't changed until the Release 5.1 of the product and was then known as IBM Directory Server. With the next version of the product, Release 5.2, the name was again changed to include the [[Tivoli Software|Tivoli]] in it, and is now known as IBM Tivoli Directory Server. The latest release offered as of July 2007 is IBM Tivoli Directory Server 6.1.

== Comments ==
IBM's directory server uses their DB2/UDB database as the underlying data store. In older versions, the impact of this was that it had comparatively poor performance, and required tuning of both the LDAP server and the UDB server to get any kind of respectable performance. As of the latest version (6.1), and possibly the one before (5.1), it is believed that the server's performance has been rectified.

One of the main advantages of Tivoli Directory Server is that it runs on IBM [[mainframe computer|mainframes]]. Supported platforms also include Linux, AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, and Microsoft Windows.

== Features ==
* Supports hundreds of millions of entries by leveraging advanced reliability and scalability of [[IBM DB2]] 9 technology and built-in proxy server
* Extends an on demand identity infrastructure to leading business solutions through compliance with LDAP
* Maintains high availability using robust master/subordinate and peer-to-peer replication capabilities, with up to dozens of master servers
* Seamlessly integrates with IBM middleware, identity management and security products, plus leverage open integration with non-IBM offerings
* Offers end users Web-based access to, and the ability to update, “white pages” information
* Flexibly supports leading platforms, including IBM AIX, Sun Solaris, Microsoft Windows Server, HP-UX, and SUSE and Red Hat Linux distributions
* Remote administration of the server through an extensive web-based interface
