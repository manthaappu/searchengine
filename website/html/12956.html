The term '''external''' is useful for describing certain algebraic structures. The term comes from the concept of an [[Binary_operation#External_binary_operations|external binary operation]] which is a binary operation that draws from some ''external set''. To be more specific, a '''left external binary operation''' on ''S'' over ''R'' is a function <math>f : R \times S \rightarrow S</math> and a '''right external binary operation''' on ''S'' over ''R'' is a function <math>f : S \times R \rightarrow S</math> where ''S'' is the set the operation is defined on, and ''R'' is the external set (the set the operation is defined ''over'').

== Generalizations ==

The ''external'' concept is a generalization rather than a specialization, and as such, it is different from many terms in mathematics. A similar but opposite concept is that of an ''internal binary function'' from ''R'' to ''S'', defined as a function <math>f : R \times R \rightarrow S</math>. Internal binary functions are like binary functions, but are a form of specialization, so they only accept a subset of the domains of binary functions. Here we list these terms with the [[Function_(mathematics)|function]] [[Method signature|signatures]] they imply, along with some examples:

* <math>f : Q \times R \rightarrow S</math> ([[binary function]])
** Example:  [[exponentiation]] (<math>z^q : \Bbb{Z} \times \Bbb{Q} \rightarrow \Bbb{C}</math> as in <math>{(-1)}^{1/2} = i</math>), 
** Example: [[element (mathematics)|set membership]] (<math>(\in) : S \times \mathbf{Set} \rightarrow \Bbb{B}</math> where <math> \mathbf{Set} </math> is the [[category of sets]])
** Examples: [[matrix multiplication]], the [[tensor product]], and the [[Cartesian product]]
* <math>f : R \times R \rightarrow S</math> (internal binary function)
** Example: internal [[binary relations]] (<math>(\le) : R \times R \rightarrow \Bbb{B}</math>)
** Examples: the [[dot product]], the [[inner product space|inner product]], and [[metric (mathematics)|metrics]].

* <math>f : R \times S \rightarrow S</math> ([[Binary_operation#External_binary_operations|external binary operation]])
** Examples: [[dynamical system]] [[flow (mathematics)|flows]], [[group action|group actions]], [[projection (set theory)|projection maps]], and [[scalar multiplication]].

* <math>f : S \times S \rightarrow S</math> ([[binary operation]]).
** Examples: [[addition]], [[multiplication]],  [[permutation|permutations]], and the [[cross product]].

== External monoids ==

Since [[monoid]]s are defined in terms of [[binary operations]], we can define an ''external monoid'' in terms of ''external binary operations''. For the sake of simplicity, unless otherwise specified, a ''left'' external binary operation is implied. Using the term ''external'', we can make the generalizations:

* An '''external [[magma (mathematics)|magma]]''' <math>(S, \times)</math> over ''R'' is a set ''S'' with an external binary operation. This satisfies <math>r \times s \in S</math> for all <math>s \in S, r \in R</math> (external [[closure (mathematics)|closure]]). 
* An '''external [[semigroup]]''' <math>(S, \times)</math> over <math>(R, \cdot)</math> is an external magma that satisfies <math>(r_1 \cdot r_2) \times s = r_1 \times (r_2 \times s)</math> for all <math>s \in S, r_1, r_2 \in R</math> (externally [[associative]]). 
* An '''external [[monoid]]''' <math>(S, \times)</math> over <math>(R, \cdot)</math> is an external semigroup in which there exists <math>1 \in R</math> such that <math>1 \times s = s</math> for all <math>s \in S</math> (has external [[identity element]]).

== Modules as external rings ==

Much of the machinery of [[module (mathematics)|modules]] and [[vector spaces]] are fairly straightforward, or discussed above. The only thing not covered yet is their distribution axioms. The external ring multiplication <math>\otimes</math> is externally [[distributive]] in <math>(S, \oplus, \otimes)</math> over the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] <math>(R, +, \cdot)</math> [[iff]]:
* <math>r \otimes (s_1 \oplus s_2) = (r \otimes s_1) \oplus (r \otimes s_2)</math> for all <math>s_1,s_2 \in S, r \in R</math> and: 
* <math>(r_1 + r_2) \otimes s = (r_1 \otimes s) \oplus (r_2 \otimes s)</math> for all <math>s \in S, r_1,r_2 \in R</math> 

Using these terminology we can make the following local generalizations:
* An '''external semiring''' <math>(S, \oplus, \otimes)</math> over the [[semiring]] <math>(R, +, \cdot)</math> is a [[commutative]] [[monoid]] <math>(S, \oplus)</math> and an external monoid <math>(S, \otimes)</math> where <math>\otimes</math> is externally [[distributive]] in <math>(S, \oplus, \otimes)</math> over the [[semiring]] <math>(R, +, \cdot)</math>. 
* An '''external ring''' <math>(S, \oplus, \otimes)</math> over the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] <math>(R, +, \cdot)</math> is an [[Abelian group]] <math>(S, \oplus)</math> and an external monoid <math>(S, \otimes)</math> where <math>\otimes</math> is externally [[distributive]] in <math>(S, \oplus, \otimes)</math> over the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] <math>(R, +, \cdot)</math>.

== Other examples ==

Now that we have all the terminology we need, we can make simple connections between various structures:
* Complex exponentiation forms an external [[monoid]] <math>(\Bbb{C}, \uparrow)</math> over the [[Abelian group]] <math>(\Bbb{C}, \cdot)</math>.
* Prime factorization forests form an external [[semiring]] <math>(\Bbb{N}, \cdot, \uparrow)</math> over the [[semiring]] <math>(\Bbb{N}, +, \cdot)</math>.
* A [[dynamical system (definition)|dynamical system]] <math>(T, S, \Phi)</math> is an '''external monoid''' <math>(S, \Phi)</math> over the [[monoid]] <math>(T, {+})</math>.
* A [[semimodule]] is an '''external semiring''' over a [[semiring]].
* A [[module (mathematics)|module]] is an '''external ring''' over a [[ring (mathematics)| ring]].
* A [[vector space]] is an '''external ring''' over a [[field (mathematics)| field]].

== Usefulness ==

It could be argued that we already have terms for the concepts described here, like [[dynamical systems]], [[group actions]], [[module (mathematics)|modules]], and [[vector spaces]]. However, there is still no other terminology available for an '''external monoid''' for which this terminology gives us a concise expression. Above all else, this is a reason this term should be of use in the mathematical community.
