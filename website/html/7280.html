<html> <head> <title>Complete numbering</title></head><body>In [[computability theory]] '''complete numberings''' are generalizations of [[Gödel numbering]] first introduced by [[A.I. Mal'tsev]] in 1963. They are studied because several important results like the [[Kleene's recursion theorem]] and [[Rice's theorem]], which were originally proven for the Gödel-numbered set of [[computable function]]s, still hold for arbitrary sets with complete numberings.  

== Definition ==

A [[numbering (computability theory)|numbering]] <math>\nu</math> of a set <math>A</math> is called '''complete''' (with respect to an element <math>a \in A</math>) if for every [[partial computable function]] <math>f</math> there exists a [[total computable function]] <math>h</math> so that
:<math> \nu \circ h(i) = 
\left\{
\begin{matrix} 
\nu \circ f(i) &\mbox{if}\ i \in \mathrm{dom}(f), \\
a &\mbox{otherwise}.
\end{matrix}
\right.
</math> 

The numbering <math>\nu</math> is called '''precomplete''' if

:<math> \nu \circ f(i) = \nu \circ h(i) \qquad i \in \mathrm{dom}(f).\,</math>

== Examples == 

* any numbering of a [[singleton set]] is complete
* the [[identity function]] on the natural numbers is ''not'' complete
* a [[gödel numbering]] is precomplete
