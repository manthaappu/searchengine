== Products ==
===Solar Power===
Since 2004, International Automated Systems has put most of its efforts into developing a [[solar power]]ed electricity generating system, based on solar heat collected by [[patent]]ed lenses and focused on a heat receiving system.  This heat is then used to generate steam, which turns patented 'blade-less' [[turbine]]s, and generates [[electricity]].  [[Prototype]]s of this system have been demonstrated at several locations.  A fully functional electricity generation system has been under construction since 2005 in [[Delta, Utah]].

===Automated Retail===
Some of the products or potential products of International Automated Systems include an automated [[retail]] self-service [[checkout]] system and management software for retail establishments. A demonstration project for this was a grocery store called U-Check that was built and run in Salem, Utah.  Portions of International Automated Systems' technology have been licensed to [[Optimal Robotics]] for an undisclosed amount of money.  However, Optimal Robotics Corporation previously had designed and implemented their own self-check out system, which they reported to have developed completely independently of International Automated Systems. A press release by Optimal Robotics on January 24, 2004 states: "Optimal Robotics Corp. (NASDAQ: OPMR), today announced that it has entered into a settlement agreement with International Automated Systems, Inc. (IAS), which brings to a close the patent lawsuit between the parties. In accordance with the agreement, IAS will receive a sum that is not considered to be material to Optimal."<ref>http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-112640449.html</ref>

===Biometrics and Fingerprint Identification===
International Automated Systems developed a [[biometric]] device consisting of an automated [[fingerprint]] reader (AFIM = Automated Fingerprint Identification Machine) that was able to read a person's fingerprint, then use that information to create a specific, personalized code number, which could be stored in a small amount of digital space, such as on the [[magnetic strip]] of a credit card.  People could then use other AFIM fingerprint scanners to identify themselves and purchase items or obtain access to controlled locations and devices in a secured way.  

===Other Products===
The company currently is developing or has developed or partially developed products  for airport [[security systems]]; automated restaurant systems; 'bladeless' turbines for electrical power generation; and solar technology systems for production of electricity and [[gasoline]].
