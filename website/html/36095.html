==Reception==
WiiWare World gave the game 6 out of 10, believing ''Sudoku Challenge'' to be an acceptable puzzler but with still room for improvement. Commenting that the presentation was functional and that most players will be satisfied with what was on offer, with the sudoku puzzles varying in difficulty to challenge players of all skill levels, they were also impressed with the number of puzzles included and claimed that, at 10 minutes a puzzle, it would take a player at least 1900 years to complete all the puzzles included on the game.<ref>[http://www.wiiware-world.com/reviews/2008/11/sudoku_challenge WiiWare World Sudoku Challenge!
