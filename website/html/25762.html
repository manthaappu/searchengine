==Communication Approaches==
Classical communication paradigms need to be revised for the nanoscale. The two main alternatives for communication in the nanoscale are based either on electromagnetic communication or on molecular communication.

===Electromagnetic Communication===
This is defined as the transmission and reception of [[electromagnetic radiation]] from components based on novel [[nanomaterials]].<ref>C. Rutherglen and P. J. Burke "Nano-Electromagnetics: Circuit and Electromagnetic Properties of Carbon Nanotubes," Small, 5(8), 884-906 (2009)</ref> Recent advancements in [[carbon]] and [[molecular electronics]] have opened the door to a new generation of electronic nanoscale components such as [[nanobatteries]],<ref>A. E. Curtright, P. J. Bouwman, R. C. Wartane and K. E. Swider-Lyons, "Power Sources for Nanotechnology," International Journal of Nanotechnology, Vol. 1, pp. 226-239, 2004.</ref> nanoscale [[energy harvesting]] systems,<ref>Z. L. Wang, "Towards Self-Powered Nanosystems: From Nanogenerators to Nanopiezotronics," Advanced Functional Materials, Vol. 18, pp. 3553-3567, 2008.</ref> nano-memories,<ref>Bennewitz, R.; Crain, J. N.; Kirakosian, A.; Lin, J.-L.; McChesney, J. L.; Petrovykh, D. Y. & Himpsel, F. J. Atomic scale memory at a silicon surface Nanotechnology, Vol. 13, pp. 499-502, 2002.</ref> logical circuitry in the nanoscale and even nano-antennas.<ref>Peter J. Burke, Shengdong Li, Zhen Yu "Quantitative theory of nanowire and nanotube antenna performance," IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology Vol. 5 n. 4, pp. 314-334, 2006.</ref><ref>Peter J. Burke, Chris Rutherglen, and Zhen Yu, "Carbon Nanotube Antennas," in Proc. of SPIE Int. Soc. Opt. Eng. 6328, 632806-1, 2006 .</ref> From a communication perspective, the unique properties observed in nanomaterials will decide on the specific [[bandwidths]] for emission of electromagnetic radiation, the time lag of the emission, or the magnitude of the emitted power for a given input energy, amongst others.

For the time being, two main alternatives for electromagnetic communication in the nanoscale have been envisioned. First, it has been experimentally demonstrated that is possible to receive and [[demodulate]] an electromagnetic wave by means of a [[nanoradio]], i.e., an electromechanically resonating [[carbon nanotube]] which is able to decode an amplitude or frequency modulated wave.<ref>B. Atakan and O. Akan, "Carbon nanotube-based nanoscale ad hoc networks," IEEE Communications Magazine, Vol. 48 , n. 6, pp. 129-135, June 2010.</ref> Second, graphene-based nano-antennas have been analyzed as potential electromagnetic radiators in the [[Terahertz band]] <ref>J. M. Jornet and [[Ian F. Akyildiz]], "Graphene-based Nano-antennas for Electromagnetic Nanocommunications in the Terahertz Band," in Proc. of EUCAP 2010, Fourth European Conference on Antennas and Propagation, Barcelona, Spain, April 2010.</ref>

===Molecular Communication===
Molecular communication is defined as the transmission and reception of information by means of molecules. The different molecular communication techniques can be classified according to the type of molecule propagation in walkaway-based, flow-based or diffusion-based communication.

In '''walkway-based''' molecular communication, the molecules propagate through pre-defined pathways by using carrier substances, such as [[molecular motors]].<ref>M. Moore, A. Enomoto, T. Nakano, R. Egashira, T. Suda, A. Kayasuga, H. Kojima, H. Sakakibara, and K. Oiwa, "A Design of a Molecular Communication System for Nanomachines Using Molecular Motors," in Proc. Fourth Annual IEEE Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications and Workshops, March 2006</ref> This type of molecular communication can also be achieved by using [[E. coli]] [[bacteria]] as [[chemotaxis]].<ref>M. Gregori and [[Ian F. Akyildiz]], "A New NanoNetwork Architecture using Flagellated Bacteria and Catalytic Nanomotors," IEEE JSAC (Journal of Selected Areas in Communications), Vol. 28, No. 4, pp. 612-619, May 2010.</ref>

In '''flow-based''' molecular communication, the molecules propagate through [[diffusion]] in a fluidic medium whose flow and [[turbulence]] are guided and predictable. The [[hormonal]] communication through blood streams inside the human body is an example of this type of propagation. The flow-based propagation can also be realized by using carrier entities whose motion can be constrained on the average along specific paths, despite showing a random component. A good example of this case is given by [[pheromone|pheromonal]] long range molecular communications.<ref>L. Parcerisa and [[Ian F. Akyildiz]], "Molecular Communication Options for Long Range Nanonetworks," Computer Networks Journal (Elsevier), Vol. 53, No. 16, pp. 2753-2766, November, 2009.</ref>

In '''diffusion-based''' molecular communication, the molecules propagate through spontaneous diffusion in a fluidic medium. In this case, the molecules can be subject solely to the laws of diffusion or can also be affected by non-predictable turbulence present in the fluidic medium. Pheromonal communication, when pheromones are released into a fluidic medium, such as air or water, is an example of diffusion-based architecture. Other examples of this kind of transport include [[calcium signaling]] among cells, as well as [[quorum sensing]] among bacteria.<ref name="TechReview">"The challenge of molecular communication", Technology Review (Physics arXiv blog), June 28, 2010.
