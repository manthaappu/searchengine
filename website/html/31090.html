In computing, '''RabbitMQ''' is an open source [[message broker]] software ([[message-oriented middleware]]), using the standard [[Advanced Message Queuing Protocol]] (AMQP). The RabbitMQ server is written in [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]] and is built on the [[Open Telecom Platform]] framework for clustering and failover. Rabbit Technologies Ltd., acquired in 2010 April by [[SpringSource]], develops and provides support for RabbitMQ.<ref>{{cite press release |date=2010-04-13 |title=Rabbit Technologies announce acquisition by SpringSource |url=http://www.rabbitmq.com/news.html }}</ref> The source code is released under the [[Mozilla Public License]].

The RabbitMQ project consists of several parts:
* The RabbitMQ exchange server itself
* Gateways for [[HTTP]], [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]] and [[Streaming Text Orientated Messaging Protocol|STOMP]] protocols
* AMQP client libraries for [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[.NET Framework]]. (AMQP clients for other languages are available from other vendors)
* The "Shovel" plug-in that takes care of copying (replicating) messages from one broker to another
