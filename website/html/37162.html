'''Texperts''' is a UK-based [[mobile search]] service. In December 2008, Texperts was bought by the [[Knowledge generation bureau]], operator of the [[118 118 (UK)|118 118]] services, a directory services company who had also entered the SMS Any question market<ref>[http://www.thetelecom.co.uk/20081217/118-118-expands-with-texperts-takeover/]</ref>.

==History==

Re5ult Ltd launched initially with a subscription-based service called 'Re5ult' on a normal mobile number. However, in August 2004 the service was launched on a premium text code and rebranded as 82ASK. In 2007, Re5ult switched phone numbers and brands again relaunching the service as Texperts on short code 66000.

==Performance==
A 'road test' on the question 'How many people were alive compared with all who had ever lived' resulted in the service answering the question in five minutes, with the closest rival answering it in twenty-two minutes. A similar question asked for 'a hotel in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] within half an hour of [[Rosslare]] en route to [[Westmeath]]', with similar results.<ref>
