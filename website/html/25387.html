<html> <head> <title>Multiport repeater</title></head><body>In [[packet network]]ing, a '''multiport repeater''' is the simplest multi-port active device in use.  It has multiple [[input/output]] (I/O) ports, in which a [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] introduced at the input of any [[Computer port (hardware)|port]] appears at the output of every port except (usually) the original incoming. With multiple computers, the network slows, due to packet collisions. Lower prices of [[network switch]]es in the late 20th century made multiport repeaters rare.

A multiport [[repeater]] usually performs regenerative functions, i.e., it reshapes the digital signals.
