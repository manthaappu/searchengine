<html> <head> <title>Peer-to-peer web hosting</title></head><body>'''Peer-to-peer web hosting''' refers to the concept of using [[peer-to-peer]] networking to distribute access to [[webpage]]s. This is differentiated from the [[clientâ€“server model]] which involves the distribution of Web data between dedicated [[web server]]s and user-end client computers. P2P web hosting may take the form of P2P [[web cache]]s and [[Content delivery network]]s like [[Dijjer]] and [[Coral Cache]] which allow users to hold copies of data from single web pages and distribute the caches with other users for faster access during peak traffic.
