===Prestel, Videotel, Videotex, Minitel===
In some European countries, and especially in France, [[Minitel]] data transmitting services were very popular before the rise of Internet. Minitel started the phenomenon of chatting, exchange mail, providing on-line services such as railways or TV broadcast timetables, travel and hotel booking, etcetera. Minitel used little terminals rented from telephone companies or computers with modems that accept Minitel transmission protocol speed. The speed was asynchronous at 1200/75 baud (1200 baud receiving, 75 baud transmitting). There were made Amiga Minitel communication programs in France, Germany and Italy. In Italy it was released [[Amiga Videotel]].

===Teletext, Televideo, Viewdata===
Teletext is an information retrieval service system based on transmitting data with normal TV broadcast signals and showing it separately, without interfering with normal TV programs. About this kind of service, on Amiga there are TV cards viewers that view Teletext pages and save them as standard image files. Standalone programs for Teletext included the [[Amiga Teletext]] program, and the datatype [http://www.unsatisfactorysoftware.co.uk/download.php?file=vtx_dt Videotex Datatype].

===FAX, Answering Machine and Voice Mail===

==ISDN==
[[ISDN]] digital telephone and circuit-switched telephone network system were supported via the expansion cards ISDN Master and ISDN Master II, their drivers and related software.

==Networking and Ethernet protocols==
Depending from the hardware cards and their drivers and software, Amiga supported [[SANA-II]] protocols, [[envoy (title)|Envoy]] protocols from IAM, [[AS225]], [[AS225r2]] TCP-IP from Commodore, [[DECnet]], [[Novell Netware]] through [[Amiga Client for Novell Netware]], [[Quicknet]] fast proprietary peer to peer procol, [[Appletalk]] through emulators. Other network protocols available were [[AmigaUUCP]], [[DNET]], [[Link-It]] and [[Enlan-DFS]]. Amiga currently supports also [[Samba (software)|Samba]], and [[SMBFS]].

==Communication Protocols==
[[Skypix]] is the name of a communication protocol born on Amiga. It could be considered one of the very first (or even the real first) modern interactive online graphics-and-sound protocol.<ref name=Skyline>{{Cite web| title = BBSDocumentary, An Overview of BBS Programs | url = http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/expanded.html | publisher=Jason Scott for [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] Magazine | author=Scott Lee | accessdate = 2005}}</ref>, as it was introduced in 1987 as part of the Skyline (Atredes) BBS System, running on the program Skyline BBS and Skyterm terminal for the Amiga system. Years before the World Wide Web, Skypix allowed rich interactive graphics and sound, as well as mouse control, to be a part of the online experience, which was until then limited to text and ANSI graphics. Skypix allowed users the ability to write graphical programs and link them into the system, as well as the first "authoring program", Skypaint. Skypix created a large worldwide group of enthusiastic game and online application writers years before the World Wide Web made such features a common part of the online experience. It was quickly abandoned as long as new, more advanced, markup languages for BBS were available and due to the emerging of Internet phenomenon that literally wiped out the BBS system of communication.
