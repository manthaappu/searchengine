The '''Policy Simulation Model (PSM)''' is a static [[microsimulation]] [[model (abstract)|model]] which encapsulates the tax and benefits system, and population, of Great Britain. It is based on survey data from the [[Family Resources Survey|FRS]], which is uprated to simulate the current year, together with a few years into the future.

The model is built using [[SAS System|SAS]] and is owned by the GB [[Department for Work and Pensions]]. It is used for poverty and scenario analysis and produces outputs including the financial impacts on different demographic groups from hypothetical policy changes to the tax and benefits system.
