The Visual 50 is a computer created by [[Visual Technology, Inc.]], which was located in [[Tewksbury, Massachusetts]]. Visual's slogan was "See for yourself".  It merged with [[White Pine Software]] in 1993, which became CU-SeeMe Networks, in turn absorbed into RadVision in 2001.

The computer consists of a [[Computer display|monitor]] which is the main computer and a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]].  The computer was used as a [[computer terminal]] so there are no internal drives or [[daughter card]]s.  The only computer component in the case is a [[motherboard]] with a modem port, keyboard port, and an aux. port.  [[Termcap]] provides support for the Visual 50 by way of the entries named v50, vi50, v50am, or visual50, depending on the system.  The computer uses on an SGS (now [[STMicroelectronics]]) Z8400AB1 [[CPU]], based on the [[Zilog]] [[Z80A]] CPU.  This CPU has an 8 bit data bus and a 16 bit address bus, and runs at 4 MHz.  The keyboard is a [[Keytronic]] A65-0248, attached by a 4 wire telephone cord.  The keyboard uses an [[Intel 8048|Intel P8048H]] MCU, a common [[MCU]] for keyboards.
