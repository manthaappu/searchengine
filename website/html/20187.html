<html> <head> <title>JournalServer</title></head><body>'''JournalServer''' is an [[Oxford]]-based international initiative to create a [[digital library]] of [[academic journal]]s freely available to the public.  It involves the collaboration of several leading [[university|universities]] across the world.

As of May, 2007, there were 8 journals listed, of which only 5 had any actual content available. 

==Background information==
JournalServer assists peer-reviewed [[academic journal]]s to be accessible free of cost, and to promote the use of these journals by the international community. The project objectives are:
*to promote access to peer-reviewed journals by means of a [[digital library]] of scholarly publications freely available through the Internet. 
*to assist scholars and publishers from low and middle income countries in making the transition to electronic modes of publication and dissemination. 
*to strive to reduce the impact of the [[digital divide]] and the scholarly communication crisis.

==History==
The initiative was formed in the summer of 2001 with the support of the [[University of Oxford]], [[BITS Pilani]] and the National Science Council of Taiwan, with seed-funding from the AIT Trust based in [[Imperial College London]].
JournalServer.org is registered as a non-profit corporation in the state of New York since August 2002.

==Technology==
The search engine is being developed by a project team at  Centre for Software Development, BITS Pilani, India.
