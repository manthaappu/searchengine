In general, the term '''credit''' in the artistic or intellectual sense refers to an acknowledgement of those who contributed to a work, whether through ideas or in a more direct sense.

==Credit in the arts==
In the creative [[arts]], credits are an acknowledgement of those who participated in the production. They are often shown at the end of movies and on CD jackets. In [[film]], [[video]], [[television]], [[theater]], etc., ''credits'' means the list of [[actor]]s and behind-the-scenes staff who contributed to the production.

==Credit in writing==
===Non-fiction===
In [[non-fiction]] writing, especially academic works, it is generally considered important to give credit to sources of information and ideas. Failure to do so often gives rise to charges of [[plagiarism]], and "piracy" of [[intellectual rights]] such as the right to receive a [[copyright|royalty]] for having written.  In this sense the financial and [[individual capital|individual]] meanings are linked.

Academic papers generally contain a lengthy section of footnotes or [[scientific citation|citations]].  Such detailed crediting of sources provides readers with an opportunity to discover more about the cited material. It also provides a check against misquotation, as it's easy for an attributed quote to be checked when the reference is available.  All of this is thought to improve [[integrity]] of the [[instructional capital]] conveyed, which may be quite fragile, and easy to misinterpret or to misapply.

===In fiction===
In [[fiction]] writing, authors are generally expected to give credit to those who contributed significantly to a work. Sometimes authors who do not want credit for their work directly may choose to use a [[pen name]]. A [[ghostwriter]] gives all or some of the credit for his or her writing to someone else.

==In computing==
In [[computer software]] [[software license|licenses]], attribution of credit is sometimes a condition of licensing. For example, original versions of the [[BSD license]] controversially required credit to be provided in the advertisement for software that used licensed code, but only if features or use of the licensed software was mentioned in the advertisement.

[[Software documentation]] is sometimes licensed under similar terms. For example, the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] (GFDL) used by [[Wikipedia]] requires that acknowledgments to authors be preserved.
