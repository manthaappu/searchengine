A '''Tamper-Resistant Security Module''' (TRSM) is a device that incorporates physical protections to prevent compromise of Cryptographic Security Parameters (CSP) therein contained.

There are varying levels of protection afforded by TRSMs:
#  '''Tamper-resistance:'''  make intrusion difficult, usually by employing hardened casing
#  '''Tamper-evident:'''  make intrusion attempts evident to subsequent viewers, often by employing seals which must be broken during intrusion
#  '''Tamper-responsive:''' detect the intrusion attempt and destroy the contents in the process

A TRSM is usually also a [[Hardware security module]] (HSM).
