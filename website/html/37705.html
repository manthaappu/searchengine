A '''Tiger team''' is a specialized group that tests an organization's ability to protect its assets by attempting to circumvent, defeat, or otherwise thwart that organization's internal and external [[security]]. The term is also used in other settings, including [[information technology]], [[aerospace|aerospace design]], and [[emergency management]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The term originated within the [[military]] to describe a team whose purpose is to penetrate security of "friendly" installations to test security measures.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  It now more generally refers to any team that attacks a problem aggressively.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Examples of Tiger Teams==
1. The NSA Cyber Defense Tiger Team (Red Cell) is a tiger team that was created by the [[National Security Agency]]<ref>[http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/speeches_testimonies/nsa_videos/cyber_defense_2008.shtml NSA.gov]</ref>

2. Many Tiger Teams are informally constituted through managerial edicts. One of these was set up in NASA circa 1966 to solve the "Apollo Navigation Problem" and it makes an interesting story. The motivation was the discovery that current technology was unable to navigate [[Apollo program|Apollo]] at the level of precision mandated by the mission planners. Tests using radio tracking data from unmanned Lunar Orbiter spacecraft to evaluate circumlunar Apollo navigation were revealing errors of 2000 meters instead of the 200 that the mission required to safely land Apollo when descending from its lunar orbit. For example, Apollo astronauts were practicing landings in safe areas using the simulators at Houston. A tenfold increase in this error-bound implied a hundredfold increase in the target area, which then included unacceptably dangerous terrain. The mission was seriously at risk. This was a navigation problem and so five Tiger Teams were set up to find and correct the problem, one at each NASA center, from CalTech [[JPL]] in the west to Goddard SFC ([[GSFC]]) in the east. The Russians via [[Luna 10]] were also well aware of this problem. There was an intentionally competitive aspect to this strategy, which was "won" by JPL in the spring of 1968 when it was shown that the problem was caused by the unexpectedly large local gravity anomalies on the moon arising from large ringed maria, mountain ranges and craters on the moon. This also led to the construction of the first detailed gravimetric map of a body other than the earth and the discovery of the lunar mass concentrations [[Mass concentration (astronomy)|(Mascons)]].<ref>Paul Muller and William Sjogren (1968). "Mascons: lunar mass concentrations". Science 161 (3842): 680â€“684. doi:10.1126/science.161.3842.680. PMID 17801458</ref>
