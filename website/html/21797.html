A '''link register''', in many [[instruction set architecture]]s such as the [[PowerPC]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]], and the [[PA-RISC]], is a special purpose [[processor register|register]] which holds the address to return to when a [[function (programming)|function]] call completes. Other architectures (such as [[SPARC]]) have a register with the same purpose but another name (in this case, "output register 7"). 
The usage of a link register allows for faster calls to [[leaf subroutine]]s. When the subroutine is non-leaf, passing the result address in a register still results in generation of more efficient code for [[thunk]]s, i.e. for a function whose sole purpose is to call another function with arguments rearranged in some way. Other subroutines can benefit from the use of link register because it can be saved in a batch with other callee-used registersâ€”e.g. an ARM subroutine pushes registers 4-7 along with the link register, LR, by the single instruction
<code>STMDB SP!, {R4-R7, LR}</code> pipelining all memory writes required.
