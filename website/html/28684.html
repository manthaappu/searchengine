Werbos''' (born 1947) is a scientist best known for his 1974 [[Harvard University]] [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] thesis, which first described the process of training [[artificial neural network]]s through [[backpropagation]] of errors.<ref>Paul J. Werbos. Beyond Regression: New Tools for Prediction and Analysis in the Behavioral Sciences. PhD thesis, Harvard University, 1974</ref> The thesis, and some supplementary information, can be found in his book, ''The Roots of Backpropagation'' (ISBN 0-471-59897-6). He also was a pioneer of [[recurrent neural networks]].<ref>Paul J. Werbos. Backpropagation through time: what it does and how to do it. Proceedings of the IEEE, Volume 78, Issue 10, 1550 - 1560, Oct 1990, doi10.1109/5.58337</ref>

Werbos was one of the original three two-year Presidents of the International [[Neural Network]] Society (INNS). He also has won the IEEE Neural Network Pioneer Award, for the discovery of  [[backpropagation]] and other basic neural network learning frameworks such as Adaptive [[Dynamic Programming]].

He currently works for the [[National Science Foundation]].
