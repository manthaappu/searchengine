The Grid Analysis and Display System (GrADS) is a software used in atmospheric sciences and climatology to display meteorological fields such as pressure, temperature, or wind speeds. It allows to read gridded meteorological data in different formats such as [[netCDF]] or [[GRIB]] and plot time series of displays from several identical datasets with differing times. It uses ''ctl'' mechanism to join differing time group datasets.
