'''Software/Configware Co-Compilation''' is used for [[Reconfigurable Computing]] to generate the code for both, an instruction-stream-based [[microprocessor]] and a reconfigurable accelerator interfaced to it. Such a co-compiler (see figure) has a partitioner which accepts input from a high level language source, such as, for instance a programming language, or the output from tools like [[MATLAB]], and automatically partitions it into parallelizable parts suitable for the reconfigurable accelerator and the rest for running on the microprocessor. By [[loop transformation]]s the partitioner converts the parallelizable parts into a [[configware]] source, which is compiled by a [[Configware Compiler]] generating [[configware]] code for the configuration of the reconfigurable accelerator like, for instance an FPGA, or a [[granularity|coarse-grained]] reconfigurable array, and [[flowware]] code for organizing the data streams going from and to the accelerator.
