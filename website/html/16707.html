In [[cryptography]], '''higher-order differential cryptanalysis''' is a generalization of [[differential cryptanalysis]], an attack against [[block cipher]]s. Developed in 1994 by [[Lars Knudsen]], the technique has been applied to a number of ciphers. Whereas ordinary differential cryptanalysis analyzes the differences between two texts, the higher-order variant considers differences between differences, etc. It has been shown to be more powerful than a first-order attack in some cases (see [[KN-Cipher]]).
