'''Ashlar''' is prepared (or "[[Wiktionary:dress|dressed]]") [[stone work]] of any type of [[Rock (geology)|stone]]. Stone masonry utilizing dressed stones is known as ashlar masonry, whereas masonry using irregularly shaped stones is known as rubble masonry.  Ashlar blocks are large rectangular [[cuboid]] blocks that are [[masonry]] [[sculpt]]ed to have square edges and smooth faces. The blocks are generally about {{convert|35|cm}} in height. When shorter than {{convert|30|cm}}, they are usually called “small ashlar”.

Ashlar blocks were used in the [[construction]] of many old buildings as an alternative to [[brick]]. Generally the external face is smooth or [[polished]]; occasionally it can be decorated by small grooves achieved by the application of a metal comb. (This process is usually used only on a softer stone ashlar block. The decoration is known as ''mason's drag''.)<ref name="Dundee">

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary}}
[[Middle English]]: from [[Old French]] ''aisselier'', from [[Latin]] ''axilla'', diminutive of ''axis'', ‘plank.’

==Scope==
In [[Classical architecture]], ''ashlar'' wall surfaces are contrasted with [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]].

The term is frequently used to describe the dressed stone work of [[Aegean civilization|prehistoric Greece and Crete]], although the dressed blocks are usually much larger than the {{convert|30|cm}} to {{convert|35|cm}} mentioned above. For example, the ''tholos'' tombs of [[Bronze Age]] [[Mycenae]] use ashlar masonry in the construction of the so-called “bee-hive” dome. This dome consists of finely cut ashlar blocks that decrease in size and terminate in a central “[[capstone]]”.<ref name="Preziosi">

These domes are not true domes, but are constructed using the [[corbel arch]].

Ashlar masonry is also heavily used in the construction of palace facades on [[Crete]], including [[Knossos]] and [[Phaistos]]. These constructions date to the [[MM III-LM Ib]] period, ca. 1700–1450 BC.

==Freemasonry==
In some [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] jurisdictions, ashlars are used as a symbolic metaphor for progress.  A rough ashlar is a stone as taken directly from the quarry, and allegorically represents the Freemason prior to his initiation; a smooth ashlar (or "perfect ashlar") is a stone that has been smoothed and dressed by the experienced stonemason, and  allegorically represents the Freemason who, through education and diligence, has learned the lessons of Freemasonry and who lives an upstanding life.
