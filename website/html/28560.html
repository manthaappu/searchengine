A '''passive attack''' on a [[cryptosystem]] is one in which the cryptanalyst cannot interact with any of the parties involved, attempting to break the system solely based upon observed data (i.e. the [[ciphertext]]). This can also include known plaintext attacks where both the [[plaintext]] and its corresponding ciphertext are known.

While most classical ciphers are vulnerable to this form of attack, most modern ciphers are designed to prevent this type of attack above all others.

== Attributes ==
*Traffic Analysis
*Non-evasive [[eavesdropping]] and monitoring of transmissions
*Because data unaffected, tricky to detect
*Emphasis on prevention ([[encryption]]) not detection
*Sometimes referred to as “tapping”

Types of Passive Attacks are 1) Traffic Analysis 2)Release of message contents.
Traffic Analysis: In it all incomming and out going traffic of network is analysed but not altered.
