'''Variable costs''' are expenses that change in proportion to the activity of a business.<ref name="GNB pp 48">Garrison, Noreen, Brewer. Ch 2 - Managerial Accounting and Costs Concepts, pp 48</ref> Variable cost is the sum of [[marginal cost]]s over all units produced. It can also be considered normal costs. [[Fixed cost]]s and variable costs make up the two components of [[total cost]]. '''Direct Costs''', however, are costs that can easily be associated with a particular [[cost object]].<ref name="GNB pp 51">Garrison, Noreen, Brewer. Ch 2 - Managerial Accounting and Costs Concepts, pp 51</ref> However, not all variable costs are direct costs. For example, variable manufacturing [[Overhead (business)|overhead]] costs are variable costs that are [[indirect costs]], not direct costs.  Variable costs are sometimes called unit-level costs as they vary with the number of units produced.

Direct labor and overhead are often called '''conversion cost''',<ref name="GNB pp 39">Garrison, Noreen, Brewer. Ch 2 - Managerial Accounting and Costs Concepts, pp 39</ref> while direct material and direct labor are often referred to as '''prime cost'''.<ref name="GNB pp 39" />

== Explanation ==

For example, a [[manufacturing]] firm pays for raw materials. When activity is decreased, less raw material is used, and so the spending for raw materials falls. When activity is increased, more raw material is used and spending therefore rises. Note that the changes in expenses happen with little or no need for managerial intervention.  These costs are variable costs.

A company will pay for line rental and maintenance fees each period regardless of how much power gets used. And some electrical equipment (air conditioning or lighting) may be kept running even in periods of low activity. These expenses can be regarded as fixed. But beyond this, the company will use electricity to run plant and machinery as required. The busier the company, the more the plant will be run, and so the more electricity gets used. This extra spending can therefore be regarded as variable.

In retail the cost of goods is almost entirely a variable cost; this is not true of manufacturing where many fixed costs, such as depreciation, are included in the cost of goods.

Although taxation usually varies with profit, which in turn varies with sales volume, it is not normally considered a variable cost.

For some employees, salary is paid on monthly rates, independent of how many hours the employees work. This is a fixed cost.  On the other hand, the hours of hourly employees can often be varied, so this type of labour cost is a variable cost.
