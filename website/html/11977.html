'''Elkonin boxes''' are an instructional method used in the early elementary grades to build [[phonological awareness]] by segmenting words into [[syllable]]s or sounds.  They are named after [[D.B. Elkonin]], the Russian psychologist who pioneered their use.  The "boxes" are squares drawn on a piece of paper or a chalkboard, with one box for each syllable or [[phoneme]], depending on what kind of segmentation is being done.  To use Elkonin boxes, a child listens to a [[word]] and moves a token into a box for each syllable or phoneme.  In some cases different colored tokens may be used for [[consonants]] and [[vowels]] or just for each phoneme in the word.
