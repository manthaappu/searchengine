'''LonTalk''' is a protocol optimized for control created by [[Echelon Corporation]] for networking devices over media such as [[twisted pair]], [[powerline]]s, [[fiber optics]], and [[radio frequency|RF]]. It is popular for the automation of various functions in industrial control, [[home automation]], transportation, and buildings systems such as [[lighting]] and [[HVAC]]; see [[Intelligent building]].

LonTalk is part of the technology platform called [[LonWorks]].

LonTalk is defined by [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] Standard ANSI/CEA 709.1.  The LonTalk protocol has been ratified by standards setting bodies in the following industries & regions:

<ul>
<li>ANSI 709.1 - Control networking (US)</li>
<li>EN 14908 - Building controls (EU)</li>
<li>GB/Z 20177.1-2006 - Control networking and building controls (China)</li>
<li>[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] 1473-L - Train controls (US)</li>
<li>SEMI E54 - Semiconductor manufacturing equipment sensors & actuators (US)</li>
<li>IFSF - International forecourt standard for EU petrol stations</li>
</ul>

Also recently, aspects of LonTalk have been recognized by international standardization bodies<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.echelon.com/company/press/2008/lonworksISO.htm |title=Echelon Announces ISO/IEC Standardization of LonWorks Control Networks}}</ref>:

*ISO/IEC 14908-1 - Communication protocol
*ISO/IEC 14908-2 - Twisted pair wire signaling technology
*ISO/IEC 14908-3 - Power line signaling technology
*ISO/IEC 14908-4 - [[Internet protocol|IP]] compatibility (tunneling) technology

The protocol is only available from the official distribution organizations of each regional standards body or in the form of microprocessors manufactured by companies that have ported the standard to their respective chip designs.
