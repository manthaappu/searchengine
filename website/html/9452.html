In [[computing]], a '''database source name''' ('''DSN''', often also known as a '''data source name''') specifies a [[data structure]] that contains the information about a specific [[data source]] ([[database]] or other [[data source]]) that an Open Database Connectivity ([[ODBC]]) driver needs in order to connect to it. A DSN may reside either in a [[Windows Registry|registry]] or in a separate text file. It stores information such as:

* name of the data source
* directory of the data source
* name of a driver which can access the data source
* user ID for database access (if required)
* user password for database access (if required)

The system administrator of a client machine creates a separate DSN for each relevant data source. To connect to a particular data source a developer can specify its DSN within a program or an environment. DSN-less connections, in contrast, require specifying all the necessary information within a program.

Three kinds of DSN exist:

# User DSN (sometimes called machine DSN)
# System DSN
# File DSN

User and system DSNs operate specifically on a particular computer, and store DSN information in the registry. A user DSN allows database access for a single user on a single computer, and a system DSN for any user of a particular computer. A file DSN contains the relevant information within a text file with a .DSN [[file extension]]. Users of different computers who have the same drivers installed can use the file.

Standardising DSNs offers the advantage that various different applications (for example: [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]]/[[PHP]], [[Internet Information Services|IIS]]/[[Active Server Pages|ASP]]) can take advantage of any database which supports that DSN.

==Misuse of Term==

The term DSN is sometimes mistakenly used in place of [[Connection string|Connection String]].  A connection string itself can fully describe a data source while the DSN describes only the name of a collection of settings for a data source found in ODBC.

== Example of use ==
Using a DSN to connect to [[MySQL]] database through the Web, Web users can submit form-based entries to the MySQL database by establishing a connection to the MySQL database's DSN. 

ASP ([[VBScript]]) code to open a DSN connection might look like the following:

<source lang="vb">
Dim DatabaseObject1
Set DatabaseObject1 = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Connection")
DatabaseObject1.Open("DSN=DSNname;")
</source>

In [[PHP]] using the PEAR::DB package to open a connection without an external DSN ("DSN-less connection"), the code might resemble the following:

<source lang="php">
require_once("DB.php");
//$dsn = "<driver>://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>";
$dsn = "mysql://john:pass@localhost:port/my_db";
$db = DB::connect($dsn);
</source>
