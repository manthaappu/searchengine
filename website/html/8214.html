'''Information Technology Governance''', IT Governance is a subset discipline of [[Corporate Governance]] focused on [[information technology]] (IT) systems and their [[Performance management|performance]] and [[risk management]]. The rising interest in IT governance is partly due to compliance initiatives, for instance [[Sarbanes-Oxley]] in the USA and [[Basel II]] in Europe, but more so because of the need for greater accountability for decision-making around the use of IT in the best interest of all stakeholders.

A characteristic theme of IT governance discussions is that the IT capability is directly related to the investment choices taken by top management that have long term consequences for various stakeholders. The traditional involvement of board-level executives in IT issues was to defer all key decisions to the company's IT professionals. IT governance implies a system in which all stakeholders, including the board, executive management, customers, and staff have clear accountability for their respective responsibilities in the decision making processes affecting IT. This prevents IT or business leaders from independently making decisions about IT without retaining responsibility for their actions and the impact they have on supporting the achievement of strategic objectives. 

==Definitions==
There are narrower and broader definitions of IT governance. Weill and Ross focus on "''Specifying the decision rights and accountability framework to encourage desirable behaviour in the use of IT."<ref>Weill, P. & Ross, J. W., 2004, ''IT Governance: How Top Performers Manage IT Decision Rights for Superior Results''", Harvard Business School Press, Boston.</ref>

In contrast, the IT Governance Institute expands the definition to include foundational mechanisms: "''… the leadership and organisational structures and processes that ensure that the organisation’s IT sustains and extends the organisation’s strategies and objectives.''" <ref>IT Governance Institute 2003, "Board Briefing on IT Governance, 2nd Edition". Retrieved January 18, 2006 from
http://www.isaca.org/Content/ContentGroups/ITGI3/Resources1/Board_Briefing_on_IT_Governance/26904_Board_Briefing_final.pdf</ref>

Van Grembergen and De Haes (2009) focus on enterprise governance of IT and define this as "an integral part of corporate governance and addresses the definition and implementation of processes, structures and relational mechanisms in the organization that enable both business and IT people to execute their responsibilities in support of business/IT alignment and the creation of business value from IT enabled investments".

While [[AS8015]], the Australian Standard for Corporate Governance of ICT, defines Corporate Governance of ICT as "''The system by which the current and future use of ICT is directed and controlled. It involves evaluating and directing the plans for the use of ICT to support the organisation and monitoring this use to achieve plans. It includes the strategy and policies for using ICT within an organisation.''"

==Background==
The discipline of information technology [[governance]] first emerged in 1993 as a derivitive of corporate governance and deals primarily with the connection between strategic objectives and [[IT management]] of an [[organization]]. It highlights the importance of IT related matters in contemporary organizations and states that strategic IT decisions should be owned by the corporate board, rather than by the [[chief information officer]] or other IT managers.
<!-- rejigged the para above, very slightly - concerned about confusion between governance and portfolio/programme management -->

The primary goals for information technology governance are to (1) assure that the [[investments]] in IT generate [[business value]], and (2) mitigate the risks that are associated with IT. This can be done by implementing an [[organizational structure]] with well-defined roles for the responsibility of [[information]], [[business process]]es, [[application software|applications]], [[infrastructure]], etc.

Accountability is the key concern of IT governance. 

After the widely reported collapse of [[Enron]] in 2000 and the alleged problems within [[Arthur Andersen]] and [[WorldCom]], the duties and responsibilities of auditors and the boards of directors for public and privately held corporations were questioned. As a response to this, and to attempt to prevent similar problems from happening again, the US [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] was written to stress the importance of business control and auditing. Although not directly related to IT governance, Sarbanes-Oxley and Basel-II in Europe have influenced the development of information technology governance since the early 2000s. 

Following Corporate collapses in Australia around the same time, working groups were established to develop standards for Corporate Governance. A series of Australian Standards for Corporate Governance were published in 2003, these were:
* Good Governance Principles (AS8000)
* Fraud and Corruption Control (AS8001)
* Organisational Codes of Conduct (AS8002)
* Corporate Social Responsibility (AS8003)
* Whistle Blower protection programs (AS8004)

AS8015 Corporate Governance of ICT was published in January 2005. It was fast-track adopted as ISO/IEC 38500 in May 2008.[http://www.itsmf.nl/imagesfile/PRESENTATIES%20JC%2008%20tbv%20publicatie/Christophe%20Feltus%20Introduction%20to%20ISO%2038500%20v1_0.pdf Introduction to ISO 38500]

==Problems with IT governance==
Is IT governance different from IT management and IT controls? The problem with IT governance is that often it is confused with good management practices and IT control frameworks. [[ISO 38500]] has helped clarify IT governance by describing it as the [[management system]] used by directors. In other words, IT governance is about the stewardship of IT resources on behalf of the [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] who expect a return from their investment. The directors responsible for this stewardship will look to the management to implement the necessary systems and IT controls. Whilst managing risk and ensuring compliance are essential components of [[good governance]], it is more important to be focused on delivering value and measuring performance.

==Frameworks==
There are quite a few supporting references that may be useful guides to the implementation of information technology governance. Some of them are:
* AS8015-2005 Australian Standard for Corporate Governance of Information and Communication Technology. AS8015 was adopted as ISO/IEC 38500 in May 2008
* [http://www.iso.org/iso/pressrelease.htm?refid=Ref1135 ISO/IEC 38500:2008 Corporate governance of information technology], (very closely based on AS8015-2005) provides a framework for effective governance of IT to assist those at the highest level of organizations to understand and fulfill their legal, regulatory, and ethical obligations in respect of their organizations’ use of IT. ISO/IEC 38500 is applicable to organizations from all sizes, including public and private companies, government entities, and not-for-profit organizations. This standard provides guiding principles for directors of organizations on the effective, efficient, and acceptable use of Information Technology (IT) within their organizations.
* Control Objectives for Information and related Technology ([[COBIT]]) is regarded as the world's leading IT governance and control framework. CobiT provides a reference model of 34 [[IT processes]] typically found in an organization. Each process is defined together with process inputs and outputs, key process activities, process objectives, performance measures and an elementary maturity model. Originally created by ISACA, COBIT is now the responsibility of the [http://www.itgi.org ITGI] ([[IT Governance Institute]]).
* The [http://www.itil.co.uk/ IT Infrastructure Library] ([[ITIL]]) is a high-level framework with information on how to achieve a successful operational Service management of IT, developed and maintained by the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Office of Government Commerce]], in partnership with the [[IT Service Management Forum]]. While not specifically focused on IT governance, the process related information is a useful reference source for tackling the improvement of the service management function.

Others include:
* [[ISO27001]] - focus on IT security
* [[Capability Maturity Model|CMM]] - The Capability Maturity Model - focus on software engineering
* [[TickIT]] is a quality-management certification program for software development


Non-IT specific frameworks of use include:
* The [[Balanced Scorecard]] (BSC) - method to assess an organization’s performance in many different areas.
* [[Six Sigma]] - focus on quality assurance
* [[TOGAF]] - The Open Group Architectural Framework - methodology to align business and IT, resulting in useful projects and effective governance.

==Professional certification==
Certified in the Governance of Enterprise Information Technology ([[CGEIT]]) is an advanced certification created in 2007 by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA). It is designed for experienced professionals, who can demonstrate 5 or more years experience, serving in a managing or advisory role focused on the governance and control of IT at an enterprise level. It also requires passing a 4-hour test, designed to evaluate an applicant's understanding of enterprise IT management. The first examination was held in December 2008.
