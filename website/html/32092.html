== History and contributions ==

Malvar earned his bachelor's degree at the [[Universidade de Brasília|University of Brasília]] and his master's degree at the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]]. He received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer science from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1986, where his thesis was on "Optimal pre- and post-filtering in noisy sampled-data systems,"<ref>H. S. Malvar. Optimal pre- and post-filtering in noisy sampled-data systems. Ph.D. thesis. Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass, USA. September 1986.</ref> and served as a visiting professor at MIT for the next year. From 1979 to 1993, Malvar was a faculty member at the University of Brasília, where he founded and headed the Digital Signal Processing Research Group<ref name="MSR Press Resources">{{cite web |url=http://research.microsoft.com/aboutmsr/presskit/malvar/ |title=Henrique Malvar |accessdate=5 December 2008 |work=Microsoft Research: Press Resources |publisher=Microsoft |date=2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ene.unb.br/gpds/v2/index.php?view=1 |title=Histórico do Grupo de Processamento Digital de Sinais - GPDS |accessdate=5 December 2008 |publisher=Universidade de Brasília| date=20 February 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080628142147/http://www.ene.unb.br/gpds/v2/index.php?view=1 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 28 June 2008}}</ref> (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''Grupo de Processamento Digital de Sinais'' or GPDS<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ene.unb.br/gpds/v2/ |title=GPDS - Grupo de Processamento Digital de Sinais |accessdate=5 December 2008 |publisher=Universidade de Brasília }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>).
