The '''JOSEKI''' [[algorithm]] is actually a pair of related algorithms for the [[encryption|encryption and decryption]] of secret algorithms stored in [[firmware]].  The [[booting|bootstrap]] [[computer software|code]] uses a [[key (cryptography)|key]] stored in [[non-volatile|non-volatile memory]] to decrypt the [[operating system]] code stored encrypted in [[Read-only memory|ROM]]. JOSEKI is unusual in that the encryption algorithm is not the same as, and cannot be deduced from, the decryption algorithm.

The concern is that if the physical device is [[compromise|compromised]], the firmware cannot be erased and is subject to inspection and [[reverse-engineering]].  However, if the firmware is encrypted, and the decryption key has been erased after the device's start-up / initialization, the code is secure since it is no longer possible to decrypt it.

JOSEKI is an [[National Security Agency|NSA]] [[Type 1 encryption|Type 1]] algorithm.
