The goal of the project, started in 1991, is to develop a highly portable, yet efficient, operating system for massively [[distributed computing|parallel-distributed]] memory systems.<ref>{{cite paper | url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/update/479476 | title=SUNMOS? | accessdate=2006-05-19 | author=Rolf Riesen, Lee Ann Fisk, ''et al.''}}&mdash;a paper that explains what SUNMOS is (CiteSeer cached copy)</ref>

SUNMOS uses a single-[[task (computers)|task]]ing [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]] and does not provide [[demand paging]]. It takes control of all [[node (networking)|node]]s in the distributed system. Once an [[application software|application]] is loaded and running, it can manage all the available memory on a node and use the full resources provided by the hardware. Applications are started and controlled from a process called ''yod'' that runs on the host node. Yod runs on a [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] frontend for the [[nCUBE|nCUBE 2]], and on a service node on the [[Intel Paragon]].

SUNMOS was developed as a reaction to the heavy weight version of [[OSF/1]] that ran as a [[single-system image]] on the Paragon and consumed 8-12 MB of the 16 MB available on each node, leaving little memory available for the compute applications.  In comparison, SUNMOS used 250 KB of memory per node.  Additionally, the overhead of OSF/1 limited the network bandwidth to 35 MB/s, while SUNMOS was able to use 170 MB/s of the peak 200 MB/s available.<ref>{{cite paper

The ideas in SUNMOS inspired PUMA, a multitasking variant that only ran on the [[i860]] Paragon.  Among the extensions in PUMA was the [[Portals network programming api|Portals API]], a scalable, high performance message passing API.  Intel ported PUMA and Portals to the [[Pentium Pro]] based [[ASCI Red]] system and named it Cougar.  [[Cray]] ported Cougar to the [[Opteron]] based [[Cray XT3]] and renamed it Catamount.  A version of Catamount was released to the public named OpenCatamount.

In 2009, the Catamount light-weight kernel was selected for an [[R&D 100 Award]].<ref>{{cite web
