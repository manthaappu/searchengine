<html> <head> <title>Datagram Transport Layer Security</title></head><body>In [[information technology]], the '''Datagram Transport Layer Security''' ('''DTLS''') protocol provides communications privacy for [[packet (information technology)|datagram]] protocols. DTLS allows datagram-based applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery. The DTLS protocol is based on the stream-oriented [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] protocol and is intended to provide similar security guarantees. The datagram semantics of the underlying transport are preserved by the DTLS protocol â€” the application will not suffer from the delays associated with stream protocols, but will have to deal with packet reordering, loss of datagram and data larger than a datagram packet size. 

DTLS is defined in RFC 4347 for use with [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] encapsulation and in RFC 5238 for use with [[DCCP]] encapsulation.
