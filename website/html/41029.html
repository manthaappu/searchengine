== Development ==
Zentyal uses an open source model, with all the source code available for its users.

=== Design ===
Zentyal is a [[web application]] using [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] webserver with [[mod perl]] as foundation and [[Mason (Perl)|Mason]] components as building blocks, mainly written in object oriented [[Perl]], with some [[Javascript]] for visual improvements.

Its design incorporates modern programming techniques as:
* Design patterns: an [[Observer pattern|Observer]] design pattern is used mainly to integrate different modules across Zentyal. E.g. each service reports about which ports it needs to be open. Besides this, a [[Singleton pattern|Singleton]] holds global configuration and behavior details.
* Presentation and logic decoupling: user interface uses [[CSS]] and [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]], and include several Mason components, as a generic table used to configure services. Program logic is held inside [[library (computing)|library]] packages and [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]]-like code.
* Fault tolerance: errors and warnings are managed through software exceptions, flowing from core to its handling routine.

It also offers debugging facilities, integrating the layout of the execution stack of the Perl 5 interpreter.

Service are monitored and automatically respawned if they die.

=== Open Source Components ===
Zentyal is an open source software mostly written in Perl that merges the following open source components:
* [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]]
** [[Web server|Webserver]]
* [[Mod perl|mod_perl]]
** [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]] engine
* [[OpenLDAP]]
** Shared users and groups

* [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]]
** [[Instant Messaging]]
* [[Ntpd]]
** Clock and date synchronization
* [[OpenVPN]]
** [[Virtual Private Network]]
* [[Samba (software)|Samba]]
** Shared storage
** [[Primary Domain Controller]] for Windows clients
* [[Common Unix Printing System]] (CUPS)
** Shared printers
