'''CryptoGraf''' is a secure messaging application for [[smartphones]] running [[Symbian OS]] and [[Windows Mobile]]. It allows the user to compose and send [[SMS]] and [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] messages that are [[encrypted]] and [[Digital signature|digitally signed]] using methods that are based on the [[S/MIME]] standard. Secure e-mail messaging is not supported.

The [[cipher|cryptographic algorithms]] supported by CryptoGraf include [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]], [[RSA]] and [[SHA-256]].

RSA [[public key]]s of other users are stored in a "Crypto Contacts" list [http://cryptograf.com/cryptomanual.php]. The user sends an encrypted SMS or MMS to a recipient listed in Crypto Contacts. Keys must be exchanged before messages can be sent. The way a Crypto Contact is received determines the [http://cryptograf.com/cryptomanual.php#heading14 trust level] assigned to the key:

* High trust for Crypto Contacts received by [[Bluetooth]].
* Medium trust for Crypto Contacts received via High trust contacts.
* Low trust for Crypto Contacts received by [[SMS]] or [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]].

The Crypto Contacts list is based on a trust model similar to the [[Web of trust]] known from [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]]. Crypto Contacts are compatible with [[X.509]] [[digital certificate]]s and contain RSA (1024/2048 bit) public keys. Messages are [[encrypted]] using [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES-256 bit]] and [[Digital signature|digitally signed]] using [[RSA]] (1024/2048 bit) with [[SHA-256]]. CryptoGraf is integrated with standard messaging application in both Symbian and Windows Mobile and stores messages in the default Inbox, Sent and other folders.
