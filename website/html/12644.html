<html> <head> <title>Event (UML)</title></head><body>An '''event''' in the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) is a notable occurrence at a particular point in time. 

Events can, but do not necessarily, cause state transitions from one [[State (computer science)|state]] to another in [[state machine]]s represented by [[state diagram|state machine diagram]]s. 

A transition between states occurs only when any [[guard condition]] for that transition are satisfied.
