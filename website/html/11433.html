'''[[Electromagnetic compatibility]] (EMC) Aware Programming''' involves writing [[software]] which is resilient to errors induced by [[electromagnetic fields]].

==Motivation==

[[Image:Cost per Product using HW SW protection.png||thumbnail|right|250px|Cost per product using hardware or software EMC protection.]]

[[Microcontrollers]] have low immunity [[Engineering tolerance|tolerance]] resulting in a very high rate of [[Transient (electricity)|transient]] errors and a potential for processor failure. To improve the immunity towards electromagnetic fields, extra [[hardware]] devices are often used. Hardware protection requires additional circuitry which adds cost, weight and size to a device. Many hardware techniques focus only on the prevention of failures and have no means of recovering from these errors once they occur.{{Verify source|date=September 2007}}

The [[Software engineering|software approach]] consists in investigating the possibilities of using defensive software techniques as protection against [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] disturbances as it is an economically interesting solution. The same software mechanisms could be used for a wide range of applications and different [[Platform (computing)|platforms]]. The figure to the right shows why a software approach is economically attractive. Adding hardware will add extra costs to each device while appropriate software is developed only once and then replicated.
