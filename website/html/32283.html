'''''RobotWar''''' was a [[programming game]] written by [[Silas Warner]].  This game, along with the companion program '''''RobotWrite''''', was originally developed in the [[TUTOR (programming language)|TUTOR programming language]] language on the [[PLATO system]] in the 1970s. Later the game was commercialized and adapted for the [[Apple II family]] of computers and published by [[Muse Software]] in 1981.  The premise was that in the distant future of 2002, war was declared hazardous to human health, and now countries settled their differences in a battle arena full of combat [[robot]]s.  As the manual stated, "The task set before you is: to program a robot, that no other robot can destroy!"

The main activity of the game was to write a [[computer program]] that would operate a (simulated) robot. The player could then select multiple robots who would do battle in an arena until only one was left standing.  The robots did not have direct knowledge of the location or velocity of any of the other robots; they could only use radar pulses to deduce distance, and perhaps use clever [[computer programming|programming]] techniques to deduce velocity.  No physical dexterity was required or even relevant in ''RobotWar''; there was no way for the player to actually take part in the battle.

==Robot programming==
The robots' language was similar to [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]].  There were 34 [[processor register|registers]] that could be used as variables or for the robots' [[I/O]] functions.  An example program from the game manual follows:

 SCAN
   AIM + 5 TO AIM                    ; MOVE GUN
   AIM TO RADAR                      ; SEND RADAR PULSE
 LOOP
   IF RADAR < 0 GOSUB FIRE           ; TEST RADAR
   GOTO SCAN
 FIRE
   0 - RADAR TO SHOT                 ; FIRE THE GUN
   ENDSUB

The robot with this program would sweep its radar in a circle, firing off radar pulses, and when it detected another robot in this way, would fire a projectile, set to explode at the correct distance as estimated by the radar pulse. This particular robot would stand still throughout the entire battle, as it never assigned any number to its movement registers.

In a way, ''RobotWar'' was a [[multiplayer]] game, in that different people could program their robots, then copy all the robots' [[source code]] to the same floppy disk and load all the robots to fight in the arena.

The game was sold in [[cassette tape]] and [[floppy disk]] versions.

==Related works==
''[[RoboWar]]'' is a similar game that was released later on the [[Macintosh]], and is now available for both [[Mac OS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].

''[[Crobots]]'' is a related game that uses a simplified version of the 'C' programming language to program the robots.  In Crobots the game arena is displayed as simple ASCII graphics.

''[[MindRover]]'' is a recent implementation of concepts taken from ''RobotWar'' and ''[[Robot Odyssey]]'', which allows users to design more customized and advanced robots.

''[[RoboCode]]'' the idea of RobotWar implemented in Java (opensource) and still supported since 2001.

==Reception==
In its first issue, [[Computer Gaming World]] praised the game's easy-to-learn language, comparable to [[BASIC]], and for its first few years hosted yearly contests in which contestants sent in their robot programs.<ref>{{Citation
