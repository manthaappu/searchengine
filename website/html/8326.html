'''CozyCot''' is a [[Social network service|social networking]] website for women from [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]] (especially [[Singapore]]). It was founded by Nicole Yee in 2001, as a hobby website dedicated to Asian women. Subsequently, the concept of sharing product and service information and opinions gathered a steady community, turning it into a venture business. ''CozyCot'' users interact in the forum and by reviewing beauty products (the review system produced reviews for over 35,000 products), also in the live events organized by the staff. The importance of its review database is increased by an [[iPhone]] scanner software developed by ''CozyCot'', which allows users to pull up product reviews from the website by capturing the barcodes with cameras in their iPhones. In April 2010, ''CozyCot'' launched the newspaper with the same name.

== History ==
''CozyCot'' started in November 2001 as an Internet portal based in [[Singapore]], where members could post reviews and share shopping and fashion tips and opinions.<ref name="The Straits Times">{{cite web | title = Net winners | author= Tham Yuen-C and Phebe Bay | publisher = [[The Straits Times]] | date = May 26, 2010 | url = http://www.straitstimes.com/DigitalLife/Work/Story/STIStory_531313.html | accessdate = May 27, 2010}}</ref> As the online community grew, the founder Nicole Yee began organizing live events for members, in order to get together. Several fragrance brands took notice of the growing community and offered to support her in terms of providing event venues.<ref name="BusinessTimes"/><ref>{{cite web | title = 下班大沙发 之cozycot 创办人余诗音Nicole Yee  | author=  | publisher = [[Capital 95.8FM]] | date = May 24, 2010 | url = http://www.capital958.sg/podcast/MDC100420-0000004/%E4%B8%8B%E7%8F%AD%E5%A4%A7%E6%B2%99%E5%8F%91 | accessdate = June 15, 2010}}([http://www.capital958.sg/download/MDC100602-0000009/web/MDC100602-0000009.mp3 part 1], [http://www.capital958.sg/download/MDC100602-0000010/web/MDC100602-0000010.mp3 part 2] ([http://entertainment.xin.msn.com/en/radio/podcast/capital958.aspx?cp-documentid=4067156 also on Singapore MSN])</ref> There followed other commercial projects (workshops, product launches, online shopping etc.), which (together with a presence of the website in the top 100,000 [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] ranking) mooted the decision to turn it into a venture business. In 2002, Nicole Yee founded CozyCot Pte. Ltd., as the managing company of the portal, in 2007 she hired the first employee,<ref name="StraitsTimesJune2010"/> then, in 2008, she invested $100,000 in the website.<ref name="Today's Manager">{{cite web | title = Women-centric Marketing Web Site attracts Members | author= N Ravindran | publisher = Today's Manager ([[Singapore Institute of Management]]) | date = April--May 2009 edition | url = http://www.sim.edu.sg/mbs/pub/mag/mbs_pub_mag_list.cfm?ID=2642&mnuid=92 | accessdate = May 12, 2010}} ([http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/198473955.html republished] in [[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]])</ref>  Its revenue exceeded {{US$|1 million}} in 2009, with a 115% growth.<ref name="BusinessTimes">{{cite web | title = Cozying up to female readers reaps dividents | author= Chen Huifen | publisher = [[Business Times (Singapore)|The Business Times]] | date = April 27, 2010 | url =  | accessdate = May 10, 2010}}</ref>

In October 2009, [[MindShare]] announced the launching of an online [[reality show]] on CozyCot.

===2010 funding===

In 2010, CozyCot Pte. Ltd. attracted an undisclosed investment from [[Hong Kong]]'s JDB Holdings, thus making the company majority-owned by JDB, one of the largest digital media networks in Asia (with investments in other regional digital platforms like [[JobsDB|JobsDB.com]], [[Streetdirectory.com]], [[88DB.com]] sgCarMart.com). The funding would permit a technology transfer, an increase of the number of employees and it would help the company expand in the region (with 2011 plans to expand to Malaysia and the Philippines).<ref name="BusinessTimes2">{{cite web | title =Jason Parquet, CozyCot get funding for next level of growth | author= Chen Huifen | publisher = [[Business Times (Singapore)|The Business Times]] | date = December 21, 2010 | url = http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/sub/specialfocus/story/0,4574,418399,00.html? | accessdate = December 28, 2010}}</ref>
