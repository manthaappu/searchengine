'''IEEE Control Systems Society''' ('''CSS''') is an organizational unit of the [[IEEE]]. It was founded in 1954 and is dedicated to the advancement of the theory and practice of [[control theory|systems and control]] in engineering.

==History==
The history of the ''IEEE Control Systems Society'' goes back to one of the merged societies forming the IEEE: the [[Institute of Radio Engineers]] (IRE) organised the first meeting of the '''IRE Professional Group on Automatic Control''' on October 19, 1954.<ref name=CSS_history>{{cite web|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/IEEE_Control_Systems_Society_History |title=IEEE Global History Network - IEEE Control Systems Society History |publisher=IEEE |accessdate={{Start date|2010|12|28}}}}</ref>
