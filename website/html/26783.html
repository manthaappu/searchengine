In [[programming]], '''nullable types''' are a feature of some [[Type system|statically-typed]] [[programming languages]] which allows a [[data type]] to be set to the special value '''NULL''' instead of their common range of possible values.
For value types or built-in data types like [[integer]]s and [[boolean datatype|boolean]]s however, such behavior is mostly not possible. Nullable type support allows for the programmer to make also these value types NULL. This can be useful in general and also when working with databases. A field in a [[Relational database]] like [[SQL]] may have an entry that is [[Null (SQL)|NULL]] (or empty) instead of containing a value. A language with nullable type support can then return a NULL value and correctly represent the behavior of the database.

==Example==
An integer variable may contain a positive or negative [[natural number]] ( ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...). The value 0 (zero) however is not the correct representation for this variable to contain nothing (it contains the value 0 and only the conception in the given context might suggest that 0 represents "nothing" instead of the actual representation: "nothing" of "something"). In many circumstances it is required to represent also the fact, that a variable has not been given any value at all. This can be achieved by a Nullable Type. In programming languages like [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] 2.0 a Nullable integer for example can be declared by a question mark (int? x)<ref name="msdn">[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1t3y8s4s(VS.80).aspx Nullable Types (C# Programming Guide)]</ref>.  In programming languages like [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] 1.0 Nullable Types can be defined by an external library<ref name ="sourceforge">[http://nullabletypes.sourceforge.net/ Nullable Types for .NET 1.0]</ref> as new types (e.g. NullableInteger, NullableBoolean)<ref name="onlinedoc">[http://nullabletypes.sourceforge.net/onlinedoc-v1.2/ Nullable Types for .NET 1.0 Programming Guide]</ref>.

A boolean variable makes the effect even more clear. Their values can be either "true" or "false", while a nullable boolean may also contain a representation for "undecided". However, the interpretation of logical operation containing boolean nullable variables is up to the language that is being used.

==Compared with null pointers==
In contrast, object [[Pointer (computing)|pointers]] can be set to [[Pointer (computing)#Null pointer|NULL]] by default in most common languages, meaning that the pointer or reference points to nowhere, that no object is assigned (the variable does not point to any object).
Nullable references were invented by [[C.A.R. Hoare]] in 1965 as part of the [[Algol W]] language.  Hoare later described their invention as a "billion dollar mistake".<ref>{{cite web

In some languages, like [[Objective-C]], however, NULL object pointers can be used without problems{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}.

==Compared with option types==
Nullable type implementations usually adhere to the [[null object pattern]].

There is a more general and formal concept that extend the nullable type concept, it comes from [[option type]]s, which enforce explicit handling of the exceptional case.
Option type implementations usually adhere to the Special Case pattern<ref>[http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/specialCase.html Martin Fowlers' description of the Special Case pattern]</ref>

==Language support==
The following programming languages support nullable types:
* [[Oxygene (programming language)|Oxygene]]
* [[.NET Framework]] version 1.0 languages with the external NullableTypes library<ref name="sourceforge"/><br />This implementation adheres to the [[Null Object pattern]], adheres to the [[NULL (SQL)]] Three-valued logic (3VL), includes all the .NET built-in types, requires programmers to implement the ''nullable'' behavior for a custom value-type.
* [[.NET Framework]] version 2.0 languages<br />This implementation violates the [[Null Object pattern]], violates the [[NULL (SQL)]] Three-valued logic (3VL), makes use of the [[Generic_programming#Generic_programming_in_.NET|.NET 2.0 Generics]] so it includes all the .NET built-in types and can easily extends a custom value-type
