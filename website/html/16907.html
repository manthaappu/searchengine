<html> <head> <title>Homogeneous space</title></head><body>In [[mathematics]], particularly in the theories of [[Lie group]]s, [[algebraic group]]s and [[topological group]]s, a '''homogeneous space''' for a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' is a non-empty [[manifold]] or [[topological space]] ''X'' on which ''G'' acts [[continuous function|continuously]] by symmetry in a [[transitivity (mathematics)|transitive]] way.  A special case of this is when the topological group, ''G'', in question is the [[homeomorphism group]] of the space, ''X''. In this case ''X'' is homogeneous if intuitively ''X'' looks locally the same everywhere. Some authors insist that the action of ''G'' be [[effective group action|effective]] (i.e. faithful), although the present article does not. Thus there is a [[group action]] of ''G'' on ''X'' which can be thought of as preserving some "geometric structure" on ''X'', and making ''X'' into a single [[orbit (group theory)|''G''-orbit]].

==Formal definition==
Let ''X'' be a non-empty set and ''G'' a group. Then ''X'' is called a ''G''-space if it is equipped with an action of ''G'' on ''X''.<ref>We assume that the action is on the ''left''.  The distinction is only important in the description of ''X'' as a coset space.</ref>  Note that automatically ''G'' acts by automorphisms (bijections) on the set. If ''X'' in addition belongs to some [[category (mathematics)|category]], then the elements of ''G'' are assumed to act as [[automorphism]]s in the same category.  Thus the maps on ''X'' effected by ''G'' are structure preserving. A homogeneous space is a ''G''-space on which ''G'' acts transitively.

Succinctly, if ''X'' is an object of the category '''C''', then the structure of a ''G''-space is a [[homomorphism]]:

<math>\rho : G \to \mathrm{Aut}_{\mathbf{C}}(X)</math>

into the group of [[automorphism]]s of the object ''X'' in the category '''C'''.  The pair (''X'',ρ) defines a homogeneous space provided ρ(''G'') is a transitive group of symmetries of the underlying set of ''X''.

===Examples===
For example, if ''X'' is a [[topological space]], then group elements are assumed to act as [[homeomorphism]]s on ''X''.  The structure of a ''G''-space is a group homomorphism ρ : ''G'' → Homeo(''X'') into the [[homeomorphism group]] of ''X''.

Similarly, if ''X'' is a [[differentiable manifold]], then the group elements are [[diffeomorphism]]s.  The structure of a ''G''-space is a group homomorphism ρ : ''G'' → Diffeo(''X'') into the diffeomorphism group of ''X''.

==Geometry==

From the point of view of the [[Erlangen programme]], one may understand that "all points are the same", in the [[geometry]] of ''X''. This was true of essentially all geometries proposed before [[Riemannian geometry]], in the middle of the nineteenth century. 

Thus, for example, [[Euclidean space]], [[affine space]] and [[projective space]] are all in natural ways homogeneous spaces for their respective [[symmetry group]]s. The same is true of the models found of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], of constant [[curvature]], such as [[hyperbolic space]]. 

A further classical example is the space of lines in projective space of three dimensions (equivalently, the space of two-dimensional subspaces of a four-dimensional [[vector space]]). It is simple linear algebra to show that GL<sub>4</sub> acts transitively on those. We can parameterize them by ''line co-ordinates'': these are the 2×2 [[minor (linear algebra)|minors]] of the 2×4 matrix with columns two basis vectors for the subspace. The geometry of the resulting homogeneous space is the [[line geometry]] of [[Julius Plücker]].

==Homogeneous spaces as coset spaces==

In general, if ''X'' is a homogeneous space, and ''H''<sub>''o''</sub> is the [[stabilizer (group theory)|stabilizer]] of some marked point ''o'' in ''X'' (a choice of [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]), the points of ''X'' correspond to the left [[coset]]s ''G''/''H''<sub>''o''</sub>.

In general, a different choice of origin ''o'' will lead to a quotient of ''G'' by a different subgroup ''H''<sub>o&prime;</sub> which is related to ''H''<sub>o</sub> by an [[inner automorphism]] of ''G''.  Specifically,

:<math>H_{o'} = gH_og^{-1}</math>    (1)

where ''g'' is any element of ''G'' for which ''go'' = ''o''&prime;.  Note that the inner automorphism (1) does not depend on which such ''g'' is selected; it depends only on ''g'' modulo ''H''<sub>''o''</sub>.

If the action of ''G'' on ''X'' is continuous, then ''H'' is a [[closed subgroup]] of ''G''.  In particular, if ''G'' is a [[Lie group]], then ''H'' is a closed [[Lie subgroup]] by [[Cartan's theorem]].  Hence ''G''/''H'' is a [[smooth manifold]] and so ''X'' carries a unique [[smooth structure]] compatible with the group action.

If ''H'' is the identity subgroup {''e''}, then ''X'' is a [[principal homogeneous space]].

One can go further to [[double coset|''double'' coset]] spaces, notably [[Clifford–Klein form]]s ''Γ''\''G''/''H'', where ''Γ'' is a discrete subgroup (of ''G'') acting [[properly discontinuously]].

==Example==

For example in the line geometry case, we can identify H as a 12-dimensional subgroup of the 16-dimensional [[general linear group]]

:''GL''<sub>4</sub>, 

defined by conditions on the matrix entries 

:h<sub>13</sub> = h<sub>14</sub> = h<sub>23</sub> = h<sub>24</sub> = 0, 

by looking for the stabilizer of the subspace spanned by the first two standard basis vectors. That shows that X has dimension 4. 

Since the [[homogeneous coordinates]] given by the minors are 6 in number, this means that the latter are not independent of each other. In fact a single quadratic relation holds between the six minors, as was known to nineteenth-century geometers. 

This example was the first known example of a [[Grassmannian]], other than a projective space. There are many further homogeneous spaces of the classical linear groups in common use in mathematics.

==Prehomogeneous vector spaces==

The idea of a [[prehomogeneous vector space]] was introduced by [[Mikio Sato]]. 

It is a finite-dimensional [[vector space]] ''V'' with a [[group action]] of an [[algebraic group]] ''G'', such that there is an orbit of ''G'' that is open for the [[Zariski topology]] (and so, dense). An example is GL<sub>1</sub> acting on a one-dimensional space. 

The definition is more restrictive than it initially appears: such spaces have remarkable properties, and there is a classification of irreducible prehomogeneous vector spaces, up to a transformation known as "castling".

==Homogeneous spaces in physics==
[[Cosmology]] using the [[general theory of relativity]] makes use of the [[Bianchi classification]] system. Homogeneous spaces in relativity represent the [[space (physics)|space part]] of background [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] for some [[Physical cosmology|cosmological model]]s; for example, the three cases of the [[Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric]] may be represented by subsets of the Bianchi I (flat), V (open), VII (flat or open) and IX (closed) types, while the [[Mixmaster universe]] represents an [[isotropy|anisotropic]] example of a Bianchi IX cosmology.<ref>{{cite |title=Course of Theoretical Physics vol. 2: The Classical Theory of Fields |author=[[Lev Landau]] and [[Evgeny Lifshitz]] |isbn=978-0750627689 |date=1980 |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann}}</ref>

A homogeneous space of ''N'' dimensions admits a set of <math>N(N-1)/2</math> [[Killing vectors]].<ref>{{cite |title=Gravitation and Cosmology |author=[[Steven Weinberg]] |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |date=1972}}</ref> For three dimensions, this gives a total of six linearly independent Killing vector fields; homogeneous 3-spaces have the property that one may use linear combinations of these to find three everywhere non-vanishing Killing vector fields <math>\xi^{(a)}_{i}</math>, 

:<math>\xi^{(a)}_{[i;k]}=C^{a}_{\ bc}\xi^{(b)}_i \xi^{(c)}_k</math>

where the object <math>C^{a}_{\ bc}</math>, the "structure constants", form a [[constant]] [[tensor|order-three tensor]] [[antisymmetric tensor|antisymmetric]] in its lower two indices (on the left-hand side, the brackets denote antisymmetrisation and ";" represents the [[covariant derivative|covariant differential operator]]). In the case of a [[Lambda-CDM|flat isotropic universe]], one possibility is <math>C^{a}_{\ bc}=0</math> (type I), but in the case of a closed FLRW universe, <math>C^{a}_{\ bc}=\varepsilon^{a}_{\ bc}</math> where <math>\varepsilon^{a}_{\ bc}</math> is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]].
