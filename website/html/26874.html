<html> <head> <title>ODRL</title></head><body>'''ODRL''' (''Open Digital Rights Language'') is an [[XML]]-based standard [[Rights Expression Language]] (REL) used in [[Digital Rights Management]] systems and open [[content management system]]s. ODRL is managed by an open organization that's open to public participation. It has created a profile that supports [[Creative Commons]] licenses and is working on a profile for geospatial data and a profile for [[Dublin Core Metadata Initiative]] (DCMI) metadata. The ODRL Version 2.0 is currently working on major revisions of the new version of ODRL. There is at least one open source implementation of ODRL available.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The [[Open Mobile Alliance]] has adopted ODRL as the REL used in their DRM specifications and new mobile phone handsets support this ODRL Profile.
