A '''notary public''' (or '''notary''' or '''public notary''') is a public officer constituted by law to serve the public in non-contentious matters usually concerned with estates, deeds, powers-of-attorney, and foreign and international business. A notary's main functions are to administer [[oath]]s and affirmations, take [[affidavit]]s and [[statutory declaration]]s, [[witness]] and authenticate the execution of certain classes of documents, take acknowledgments of deeds and other conveyances, protest notes and bills of exchange, provide notice of foreign drafts, prepare marine protests in cases of damage, provide exemplifications and notarial copies, and perform certain other official acts depending on the [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]].<ref>"Notaries Public", ''Montgomery County, Alabama Probate Judge'': [http://www.mc-ala.org/Home/Elected%20Officials/Probate%20Judge/probate_notaries.html], retrieved on 20 January 2009.</ref>  Any such act is known as a '''notarization'''. The term ''notary public'' only refers to [[common law|common-law]] notaries and should not be confused with [[Civil law notary|civil-law notaries]].

With the exceptions of [[Louisiana]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Quebec]], whose private law is based on [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and [[British Columbia]], whose notarial tradition stems from [[scrivener]] notary practice, a notary public in the rest of the [[United States]] and most of [[Canada]] has powers that are far more limited than those of civil-law or other common-law notaries, both of whom are qualified lawyers admitted to the bar:  such notaries may be referred to as '''notaries-at-law''' or lawyer notaries.  Therefore, at common law, notarial service is distinct from the [[practice of law]], and giving legal advice and preparing legal instruments is forbidden to '''lay notaries'''.

==Overview==
Notaries are appointed by a government authority, such as a court or lieutenant governor, or by a regulating body often known as a Society or Faculty of Notaries Public. For a notary-at-law, an appointment is usually for life, but lay notaries are commissioned for a briefer term with the possibility of renewal. In most common-law countries, appointments and their number for a given notarial district are highly regulated. However, since the majority of American notaries are lay persons who provide officially required services, commission numbers are not regulated in America, which is part of the reason why there are far more notaries in the United States than in other countries (4.5 million<ref>

vs. approx. 740 in [[England and Wales]]). Furthermore, all U.S. and some Canadian notarial functions are applied to domestic affairs and documents, and fully systematized attestations of signatures and acknowledgment of deeds are a universal requirement for document authentication. By contrast, outside North American common-law [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s,  notarial practice is restricted to international legal matters or where a foreign jurisdiction is involved,<ref>[http://www.warners-solicitors.co.uk/business-notary.html ''Notary'']. (2008). Kent, England: Warners Law LLP. Retrieved on 22 January 2009.</ref> and almost all notaries are also qualified lawyers.

For the purposes of authentication, most countries require commercial or personal documents which originate from or are signed in another country to be notarized before they can be used or officially recorded or before they can have any legal effect. To these documents a notary affixes a '''notarial certificate''' which attests to the execution of the document, usually by the person who appears before the notary, known as an '''appearer''' or '''constituent''' (U.S.).  In places where notaries-at-law are the norm, a notary may also draft legal instruments known as '''notarial [[Act (document)|acts]]''' which have probative value and executory force as would any lawyer's writing. Originals or duplicate originals are then filed and stored in the notary's archives, or '''protocol'''.

Notaries are generally required to undergo special training in the performance of their duties. Some must also first serve as an apprentice before being commissioned or licensed to practice their profession. In many countries, even licensed lawyers, e.g., [[barrister]]s or [[solicitor]]s, must follow a prescribed specialized course of study and be mentored for two years before being allowed to practice as a notary (e.g., British Columbia, England). However, notaries public in the U.S., of which the vast majority are lay people, require only a brief training seminar and are expressly forbidden to engage in any activities that could be construed as the [[practice of law]] unless they are also qualified attorneys. Yet, despite these apparent differences, notarial practice is universally considered to be distinct and separate from that of attorney (solicitor/barrister).

In bijuridical jurisdictions, such as [[South Africa]] or [[Louisiana]], the Office of notary public is a legal profession with educational requirements similar to those for attorneys. Many even have institutes of higher learning that offer degrees in notarial law. Therefore, despite their name, "notaries public" in these jurisdictions are in fact civil-law notaries.

==History==
''For a more detailed account, see [[Civil law notary|Civil-law Notary]].''

Notaries Public (also called "notaries", "notarial officers", or "public notaries") hold an office which can trace its origins back to [[ancient Rome]], when they were called ''scribae'' ("scribe"), ''tabellius'' ("writer"), or ''notarius'' ("notary"). Their work would later be transcribed correctly in its entirety by a [[calligraphus]]. They are easily the oldest continuing branch of the [[legal]] profession worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

The history of Notaries is set out in detail in Chapter 1 of ''Brooke's Notary'' (12th edition):<ref name="brookes">Chapter 1 of ''Brooke's Notary'' (12th edition)</ref><!--Wiki style requires sources to be cited either (a) after the quotation or (b) after the introductory sentence.

{{cquote|
:The office of a public notary is a public office. It has a long and distinguished history. The office has its origin in the civil institutions of ancient Rome. Public officials, called ''scribae'', that is to say, scribes, rose in rank from being mere copiers and transcribers to a learned profession prominent in private and public affairs. Some were permanent officials attached to the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] and [[court]]s of law whose duties were to record public proceedings, transcribe state papers, supply magistrates with legal forms, and register the decrees and judgments of magistrates.

:In the last century of the [[Republic of Rome|Republic]], probably in the time of [[Cicero]], a new form of shorthand was invented and certain arbitrary marks and signs, called ''notae'', were substituted for words in common use. A writer who adopted the new method was called a ''notarius''. Originally, a notary was one who took down statements in shorthand and wrote them out in the form of memoranda or minutes. Later, the title ''notarius'' was applied almost exclusively to registrars attached to high government officials, including provincial governors and secretaries to the Emperor.

:Notwithstanding the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|collapse of the Western Empire]] in the 5th century AD, the notary remained a figure of some importance in many parts of continental Europe throughout the [[Dark Ages]]. When the civil law experienced its renaissance in [[Italy in the Middle Ages|mediæval Italy]] from the 12th century onwards, the notary was established as a central institution of that law, a position which still obtains in countries whose legal systems are derived from the civil law.

:The separate development of the [[common law]] in [[England]], free from most of the influences of Roman law, meant that notaries were not introduced into England until later in the 13th and 14th centuries. At first, notaries in England were appointed by the [[Papal Legate]]. In 1279 the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] was authorized by the [[Pope]] to appoint notaries. Not surprisingly, in those early days, many of the notaries were members of the [[clergy]]. In the course of time, members of the clergy ceased to take part in [[secular]] business and laymen, especially in towns and trading centres, began to assume the official character and functions of a modern notary.

:The [[English Reformation|Reformation]] produced no material change in the position and functions of notaries in England. However, in 1533 the enactment of "the Act Concerning Peter's Pence and Dispensations" ([[The Ecclesiastical Licences Act]], 1533) terminated the power of the Pope to appoint notaries and vested that power in the King who then devolved it to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] who in turn devolved it to the [[Master of the Faculties]].

:Traditionally, notaries recorded matters of judicial importance as well as private transactions or events where an officially authenticated record or a document drawn up with professional skill or knowledge was required.}}

==Common law jurisdictions==
The duties and functions of notaries public are described in ''Brooke's Notary'' on page 19 in these terms: 

:Generally speaking, a notary public [...] may be described as an officer of the law [...] whose public office and duty it is to draw, attest or certify under his official seal deeds and other documents, including [[Will (law)|wills]] or other testamentary documents, conveyances of [[Real property|real]] and [[personal property]] and [[Power of attorney|powers of attorney]]; to authenticate such documents under his signature and official seal in such a manner as to render them acceptable, as proof of the matters attested by him, to the judicial or other public authorities in the country where they are to be used, whether by means of issuing a notarial certificate as to the due execution of such documents or by drawing them in the form of public instruments; to keep a protocol containing originals of all instruments which he makes in the public form and to issue authentic copies of such instruments; to administer oaths and declarations for use in proceedings [...] to note or certify transactions relating to negotiable instruments, and to draw up protests or other formal papers relating to occurrences on the voyages of ships and their navigation as well as the carriage of cargo in ships." [Footnotes omitted.]

A notary, in almost all [[common law]] jurisdictions other than most of North America, is a practitioner trained in the drafting and execution of legal documents.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}  Notaries traditionally recorded matters of judicial importance as well as private transactions or events where an officially authenticated record or a document drawn up with professional skill or knowledge was required. The functions of notaries specifically include the preparation of certain types of documents (including international contracts, deeds, wills, and powers of attorney) and certification of their due execution, administering of oaths, [[witness]]ing [[affidavit]]s and statutory declarations, certification of copy documents, noting and protesting of [[bill of exchange|bills of exchange]], and the preparation of [[ship]]s' protests.
[[Image:Pakistan Notary example.jpg|thumb|left|An example of a notarized acknowledgment.]]
Documents certified by notaries are sealed with the notary's [[Seal (device)|seal]] or stamp and are recorded by the notary in a register (also called a "protocol") maintained and permanently kept by him or her. These are known as "notarial acts". In countries subscribing to the Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement for Legalization for Foreign Public Documents only one further act of certification is required, known as an [[apostille]], and is issued by a government department (usually the Foreign Affairs Department or similar). For other countries an "authentication" or "legalization" must be issued by the Foreign Affairs Ministry of the country from which the document is being sent or the Embassy, Consulate-General, or High Commission of the country to which it is being sent.

==Information on individual countries==
===Australia===
In all Australian States and Territories (except Queensland) notaries public are appointed by the [[Australian court hierarchy#State and territory courts|Supreme Court of the relevant State or Territory]]. Very few have been appointed as a notary for more than one State or Territory.

Queensland, like [[New Zealand]], continues the practice of appointment by the Archbishop of Canterbury acting through the [[Master of the Faculties]].

Many Australian notaries are lawyers but the overall number of lawyers who choose to become a notary is relatively low. For example, in [[South Australia]] (a State with a population of 1.5 million), of the over 2,500 lawyers in that state only about 100 are also notaries and most of those do not actively practice as such. In [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], in 2002 there were only 66 notaries for a city with a population of 3.5 million and only 90 for the entire state. Compare this with the United States where it has been estimated that there are over 3 million notaries for a nation with a population of 296 million.

As Justice Debelle of the [[Supreme Court of South Australia]] said in the case of ''In The Matter of an Application by Marilyn Reys Bos to be a Public Notary'' [2003] SASC 320, delivered 12 September 2003,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/sa/SASC/2003/320.htm | title=  AN APPLICATION BY MARILYN REYES BOS TO BE A PUBLIC NOTARY No. SCCIV-02-1688 <nowiki>[</nowiki>2003<nowiki>]</nowiki> SASC 320 (12 September 2003) | accessdate = 22 March 2008 | publisher = [http://www.austlii.edu.au/ Australasian Legal Information Institute, A joint facility of UTS and UNSW Faculties of Law]
}}</ref>  in refusing the application:

{{quote|As a general rule, an applicant [for appointment as a notary] should be a legal practitioner of several years standing at least. Even a cursory perusal of texts on the duties and functions of a public notary demonstrates that a number of those functions and duties require at the very least a sound working knowledge of Australian law and commercial practice. In other words, the preparation of a notarial act plainly requires a sound knowledge of law and practice in Australia especially of the due preparation and execution of commercial and contractual instruments. It is essential that notaries in this State have a sufficient level of training, qualification and status to enable them efficiently and effectively to discharge the functions of the office.}}

Historically there have been some very rare examples of patent attorneys or accountants being appointed, but that now seems to have ceased.

However, there are three significant differences between notaries and other lawyers.

*the duty of a notary is to the transaction as a whole, and not just to one of the parties. In certain circumstances a notary may act for both parties to a transaction as long as there is no conflict between them, and in such cases it his or her duty is to ensure that the transaction that they conclude is fair to both sides. 
*a notary will often need to place and complete a special clause or attach a special page (known as an [[eschatocol]]) on or to a document in order to make it valid for use overseas. 
:In the case of some documents which are to be used in some foreign countries it may also be necessary to obtain another certificate known either as an "authentication" or an "[[apostille]]" (depending on the relevant foreign country) from the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]]. 
*a notary identifies himself or herself on documents by the use of his or her individual seal. Such seals have historical origins and are regarded by most other countries as of great importance for establishing the genuineness of a document. 

Their principal duties include: 

# attestation of documents and certification of their due execution for use in Australia and internationally
# preparation and certification of powers of attorney, wills, deeds, contracts and other legal documents for use in Australia and internationally
# administering of oaths for use in Australia and internationally
# witnessing affidavits, statutory declarations and other documents for use in Australia and internationally
# certification of copy documents for use Australia and internationally
# exemplification of official documents for use internationally
# noting and protesting of bills of exchange
# preparation of ships' protests

Although it was once usual for Australian notaries to use a red embossed seal, it is now common for them to use a red inked stamp that contains the notary's full name and the words "notary public". It is also common for the seal or stamp to include the notary's chosen logo or symbol.

In South Australia and [[Scotland]], it is acceptable for a notary to use the letters "NP" after their name. Thus a South Australian notary may have "John Smith LLB NP" or similar on his business card or letterhead.

Australian notaries do not hold "commissions" which can expire. Generally, once appointed they are authorized to act as a notary for life and can only be "struck off" the Roll of Notaries for proven misconduct.  In certain States, for example, New South Wales, they cease to be qualified to continue as a Notary once they cease to hold a practising certificate as a legal practitioner.

All Australian jurisdictions also have [[Justice of the Peace|Justices of the Peace]] (JP) or Commissioners for Affidavits who can witness affidavits or statutory declarations and certify documents. However they can only do so if the relevant affidavit, statutory declaration or copy document is to be used only in Australia rather than in a foreign country, with the possible exception of a few Commonwealth countries not including the [[United Kingdom]] or New Zealand except for very limited purposes. Justices of the Peace (JPs) are (usually) laypersons who have  minimal, if any, training (depending on the jurisdiction) but are of proven good character. Therefore a US notary resembles an Australian JP rather than an Australian notary.

===Canada===
Canadian notaries public are very much like their American counterparts, generally restricted to administering oaths, witnessing signatures on affidavits and statutory declarations, providing acknowledgements, certifying true copies, and so forth. 

====Nova Scotia====
In [[Nova Scotia]] the position is known as a Commissioner of Oaths, and is regulated by provincial Notaries and Commissioners Act. Individuals hold a commission granted to them by the Minister of Justice. 

"A Commissioner of Oaths is deemed to be an officer of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. Commissioners take declarations concerning any matter to come before a court in the Province." <ref>http://www.gov.ns.ca/just/legal_services/commissioner_oaths.asp</ref>. Additionally, individuals with other specific qualifications, such as being a current [[Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly|MLA]], commissioned officer of the [[RCMP]] or [[Canadian Forces]] make act as if explicitly being a Commissioner of Oaths.

====British Columbia====
In [[British Columbia]], a notary public is more like a British or Australian notary (see supra). Appointments are for life and made through the Society of Notaries Public of British Columbia.<ref>The Society of Notaries Public of BC, "Education", ''BC Notaries:  A Trusted Tradition'' (2009): [http://www.notaries.bc.ca/images/stories/PDF/Education/Becoming%20a%Notary%20Brochure.pdf].</ref> Furthermore, BC notaries exercise far greater power, able to dispense legal advice and draft public instruments including:
* '''Notarization'''
** notarizations/attestations of signatures, affidavits, statutory declarations, certified true copies, letters of invitation for foreign travel, authorization of minor child travel, execution/authentications of international documents, passport application documentation, proof of identity for travel purposes
* '''Real estate law'''
** home purchase/sale; business purchase/sale; [[mortgages]] and [[refinancing]]; residential, commercial, & manufactures home transfer of title; restrictive covenants & builder's liens
* '''Wills & estate planning'''
** preparation and searches of last wills and [[testaments]], living wills, health care directives, representation agreements, [[power of attorney]]
* '''[[Contract law]]'''
** preparation of contracts and agreements, commercial lease and assignments
* [[easements]] and [[right of way]]
* insurance loss declarations
* marine bills of sale & mortgages
* marine protestations
* personal property security agreements
* purchaser's side for foreclosures
* subdivisions & statutory building schemes
* zoning applications

====Quebec====
In [[Quebec]], there are no notaries public, only ''notaires'', or civil-law notaries. As full lawyers, they perform functions similar to those of British Columbian notaries, though in Quebec, the notarial profession encompasses even more areas of practice.<ref>[http://www.cdnq.org/en/notariesInQuebec/essence.html] A general overview of the notarial profession in Quebec: taken from the website of the Chambre des Notaires du Quebec.</ref> To become a notary in Quebec, a candidate must hold a Bachelor's degree in civil law, after which would follow a one-year Master's in notarial law,<ref>[http://www.cdnq.org/] The main page for the Chambre des Notaires du Quebec.</ref> and a traineeship (called a "stage") before being written on the Rolls and able to practice.

===Iran===
Notary Public is a trained lawyer that should pass some special exams to be able to open his office and start his work. Persian meaning of this word is "سردفتر" means head of the office and his assistant called "دفتریار". Both these persons should have Bachelor
degree in law or Master degree in civil-law.

===Republic of Ireland===

The office of notary public is one of great antiquity and historical significance. It is unclear, however, when or where the first public notary was formally appointed. One of the earliest references to a notary dates back to the time of Cicero (106 – 43BC), the famed Roman orator and statesmen, who, it is claimed, employed persons skilled in the art of writing to record or ‘note’ his speeches. 

After the abdication in 476 AD of Romulus Augustus, the last emperor of Rome, the papacy became the de facto ruler of Rome. When Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne emperor of the Holy Roman Empire in 800AD the empire encompassed the entire heartland of Western Europe, stretching from the Danube to the Pyrenees and from Rome to the North Sea. Ecclesiastical notaries were by then part of the papal household and were known to deal with both ecclesiastical and civil matters. At this time it had become the practice of kings, princes and rulers in communion with the Holy See to seek various dispensations, privileges and faculties which were at the gift of the papacy. One such faculty concerned the appointment of notaries.The Pope, for administrative convenience, frequently delegated the power to appoint public notaries to religious (usually Archbishops) and temporal leaders throughout the Holy Roman Empire. In England, the power to create notaries was vested in and exercised by the Archbishop of Canterbury under papal and imperial authority. In Ireland, public notaries were at various times appointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of Armagh. The position remained so until the Reformation. 

There is archival evidence showing that public notaries, acting pursuant to papal and imperial authority, practised in England and in Ireland in the 13th century and it is reasonable to assume that notaries functioned here before that time. 

After the Reformation, persons appointed to the office of public notary either in Great Britain or Ireland received the faculty by royal authority and appointments under faculty from the Pope and the emperor ceased. 

In 1871, under the Matrimonial Causes and Marriage Law (Ireland) Amendment 1870, the jurisdiction previously exercised by the Archbishop of Armagh in the appointment of notaries was vested in and became exercisable by the Lord Chancellor of Ireland. In 1920, the power to appoint notaries public was transferred to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The position in Ireland changed once again in 1924 following the establishment of the Irish Free State. Under the Courts of Justice Act, 1924 the jurisdiction over notaries public was transferred to the Chief Justice of the Irish Free State. In 1961, under the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act of that year, and the power to appoint notaries public became exercisable by the Chief Justice. This remains the position in the Republic of Ireland, where notaries are appointed on Petition to the Supreme Court, after passing prescribed examinations.  The governing body is the Faculty of Notaries Public in Ireland.  In Northern Ireland, notaries public are appointed by the Lord Chief Justice. The vast majoirty of notaries in Ireland are also solicitors. A non-solicitor, who was successful in the examinations as set by the governing body, applied to the Chief Justice to be appointed a notary public.  The Chief Justice heard the adjourned application on 3 March 2009 and reserved his judgement on that date.  As at 6 April 2010 this judgement has not been delivered.

===New Zealand===
Unless excluded under dominion or colonial law, the [[Master of the Faculties]] formerly had authority to appoint notaries public in a [[dominion]] or colony. The admission of notaries in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] was governed specifically by the Public Notaries Act 1833 (UK). The provisions of the Public Notaries Act 1801-43 requiring a notary to be a [[solicitor]] did not apply overseas, nor need a notary have a practicing certificate as a solicitor, or from the [[Court of Faculties]].

The usual procedure followed is that the applicant lodges with the Court of Faculties a [[memorial]] counter-signed by local merchants, shipping companies, bankers and other persons of substance, which show the local need of a notary and the fitness of the applicant. They also lodge their certificate of admission as a solicitor. A fee accompanies the application. The applicant, with the support of two other notaries public, who vouch that the applicant is well skilled in the affairs of notarial concern, petitions the Master of the Faculties.

The chief consideration for the approval of an application is whether there is sufficient need in the district, regarding the convenience of bankers, ship-owners and merchants. The local society of notaries must be satisfied that a need exists for an additional notary in the area served by the applicant. Priority is given, as a matter of practice, to an applicant within the same firm, as a replacement in the case of the death of a notary, or where a practicing notary is reducing his or her workload because of age or infirmity. 

The Master of the Faculties continues to appoint notaries overseas in the exercise of the general authorities granted by s 3 of the [[Ecclesiastical Licenses Act 1533]] (Eng). In these cases he is guided by local considerations of public convenience.

===Sri Lanka===
Until 1973 a separate group of lawyers existed to carry out litigation known as [[Proctor]]s. A proctor was not a  practitioner in a [[court| court of law]]. These were also known as Notaries. However since 1973 the legal practitioners were classed solely as [[Attorney at law (Sri Lanka)|Attorneys at law]] combining the former [[advocate]]s and proctors. This new position of [[Lawyer|attorney at law]] brought with it automatic appointment as a notary public when the practitioner took oaths as an attorney at law, thus becoming legally qualified for litigation.

===United Kingdom===
====England and Wales====

After the passage of the 1533 Act, which was a direct result of the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] in [[England]], all notary appointments were issued directly through the [[Court of Faculties]]. The Court of Faculties is attached to the office of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].

In [[England]] and [[Wales]] there are several classes of notaries. English notaries who, like solicitors, barristers, legal executives and licensed conveyancers, are also '''commissioners for oaths''', also acquire the same powers as [[solicitor]]s and other law practitioners, with the exception of the right to represent others before the courts (unless also members of the bar or admitted as a solicitor) once they are licensed or commissioned notaries.  In practice almost all English notaries, and all Scottish ones, are also solicitors, but typically do not perform such services.<ref>[http://www.thenotariessociety.org.uk/public_statement.asp The Notaries Society] (England & Wales)</ref> 

Commissioners of oaths are able to undertake the bulk of routine domestic attestation work within the UK, and many documents, including signatures for normal property transactions, do not need professional attestation of signature at all, a lay witness being sufficient.

In practice the need for notaries in purely English legal matters is very small; for example they are not involved in normal property transactions.  Since a great many [[solicitor]]s also  perform the function of commissioners for oaths and can witness routine declarations etc. (all are qualified to do so, but not all offer the service), most work performed by notaries relates to international matters in some way, and documents needing to be used abroad, and many of the small number of English notaries have strong foreign language skills and often a foreign legal qualification.  [http://www.thenotariessociety.org.uk/ The Notaries Society] gives the number of notaries in England and Wales as "about 1000," all but 70 of whom are solicitors.

There are also Scrivener notaries, who get their name from the [[Worshipful Company of Scriveners|Scriveners' Company]]; until 1999, when they lost this monopoly, they were the only notaries permitted to practise in the [[City of London]]. They used not to have to first qualify as solicitors, but they had knowledge of foreign laws and languages.

Currently to qualify as a Notary Public in England and Wales it is necessary to have earned a law degree or qualified as a solicitor or barrister in the past five years, and then to take a two-year distance-learning course styled the Postgraduate Diploma in Notarial Practice from the University of Cambridge. At the same time, any applicant must also gain practical experience, which would usually be with a solicitor notary. The few who go on to become Scrivener Notaries require further study of a foreign language and foreign law and a two-year mentorship under an active Scrivener notary.

The other notaries in England are either ecclesiastical notaries whose functions are limited to the affairs of the [[Church of England]] or other qualified persons who are not trained as solicitors or [[barrister]]s but satisfy the [[Master of the Faculties]] of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] that they possess an adequate understanding of the law. Both the latter two categories are required to pass examinations set by the Master of Faculties. 

The regulation of notaries was modernized in the 1990s as a result of section 57 of the [[Courts and Legal Services Act 1990]].

Notarial services generally include: 
* attesting the signature and execution of documents 
* authenticating the execution of documents 
* authenticating the contents of documents 
* administration of oaths and declarations 
* drawing up or noting (and extending) protests of happenings to ships, crews and cargoes 
* presenting bills of exchange for acceptance and payment, noting and protesting bills in cases of dishonour and preparing acts of honour 
* attending upon the drawing up of bonds 
* drawing mercantile documents, deeds, sales or purchases of property, and wills in English and (via translation), in foreign languages for use in Britain, the Commonwealth and other foreign countries
* providing documents to deal with the administration of the estate of people who are abroad, or owning property abroad 
* authenticating personal documents and information for immigration or emigration purposes, or to apply to marry, divorce, adopt children<ref>http://www.lancashirenotary.co.uk/work.html</ref> or to work abroad
* verification of translations from foreign languages to English and vice versa 
* taking evidence in England and Wales as a Commissioner for Oaths for foreign courts 
* provision of Notarial copies 
* preparing and witnessing powers of attorney, corporate records, contracts for use in Britain or overseas
* authenticating company and business documents and transactions
* international domain name transfers

====Scotland====
Notaries public have existed in Scotland since the 13th century and developed as a distinct element of the Scottish legal profession.  Those who wish to practice as a notary must petition the [[Court of Session]].  This petition is usually presented at the same time as a petition to practice as a solicitor, but can sometimes be earlier or later.  However, to qualify, a notary must hold a current Practising Certificate from the [[Law Society of Scotland]], a new requirement from 2007, before which all Scottish solicitors were automatically notaries.

Whilst notaries in Scotland are always solicitors, the profession remains separate in that there are additional rules and regulations governing notaries and it is possible to be a solicitor, but not a notary.  Since 2007 an additional Practising Certificate is required, so now most, but not all, solicitors in Scotland are notaries - a significant difference from the English profession.  They are also separate from notaries in other [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s of the United Kingdom.<ref>[http://www.lawscot.org.uk/Members_Information/rules_and_guidance/guides/Rules/notarypublic/notary_public.aspx Law Society of Scotland]</ref> 

The profession is administered by the Council of the Law Society of Scotland under the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1990.

In Scotland, the duties and services provided by the Notary are similar to England and Wales, although they are needed for some declarations in divorce matters for which they are not in England.  Their role declined following the Law Agents (Scotland) Amendment Act 1896 which stipulated only enrolled law agents could become notaries and the Conveyancing (Scotland) Act 1924 which extended notarial execution to law agents.  The primary functions<ref>David A. Brand, "The Modern Notary Public in Scotland:  Guidance for Intrant Notaries", 5th edn. (2005), ''The Law Society of Scotland'',  [http://www.lawscot.org.uk/Members_Information/rules_and_guidance/guides/Rules/notarypublic/notary_public.aspx], retrieved on 19 January 2009.</ref> of a Scottish notary are:
* oaths, affidavits, and affirmations
* affidavits in undefended divorces and for matrimonial homes
* maritime protests
* execution or certification for foreign jurisdictions, e.g., estates, court actions, powers of attorney, etc.
* notarial execution for the blind or illiterate
* entry of a person to overseas territories
* completion of the documentation required for the registration of a company in certain foreign jurisdictions; and

In the United States, a '''notary public''' is a person appointed by a state [[government]], e.g., the governor or state secretary, or in some cases the state legislature, and whose primary role is to serve the public as an impartial [[witness]] when important documents are signed.  Since the notary is a state officer, a notary's duties may vary widely from state to state and in most cases bars a notary from acting outside his or her home state unless they also have a commission there as well.

In 32 states the main requirements are to fill out a form and pay a fee; many states have restrictions concerning notaries with criminal histories, but the requirements vary from state to state. Notaries in 18 states and the District of Columbia are required to take a course, pass an exam, or both; the education or exam requirements in Delaware and Kansas only apply to notaries who will perform electronic notarizations.<ref>[http://www.nass.org/ ''Issues and Trends in State Notary Regulation'']. (2011). National Association of Secretaries of State. pp. 6, 17&ndash;18.</ref>

A notary is almost always permitted to notarize a document anywhere in the state where their commission is issued.  Some states simply issue a commission "at large" meaning no indication is made as to from what county the person's commission was issued, but some states do require the notary include the county of issue of their commission as part of the jurat, or where seals are required, to indicate the county of issue of their commission on the seal.  Merely because a state requires indicating the county where the commission was issued does not necessarily mean that the notary is restricted to notarizing documents in that county, although some states may impose this as a requirement.

Some states (Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, among others) allow a notary who is commissioned in a state bordering that state to also act as a notary in the state if the other allows the same.  Thus someone who was commissioned in Montana could notarize documents in Wyoming and North Dakota, and a notary commissioned in Wyoming could notarize documents in Montana, a notary from Wyoming could not notarize documents from North Dakota (or the inverse) unless they had a commission from North Dakota or a state bordering North Dakota that also allowed North Dakota notaries to practice in that state as well.

Notaries in the United States are much less closely regulated than notaries in most other [[common law|common-law]] countries, typically because U.S. notaries have no legal authority. In the United States, a lay notary may not offer [[law|legal]] advice or prepare documents - except in Louisiana and Puerto Rico - and cannot recommend how a person should sign a document or even what type of notarization is necessary, as these things would constitute unauthorized practice of law. In some states, a notary cannot even certify or attest a copy or facsimile.

The most common notarial acts in the United States are the taking of '''acknowledgements''' and '''oaths'''. Many professions may require a person to double as a notary public, which is why US [[court reporters]] are often notaries as this enables them to swear in witnesses ([[deponent]]s) when they are taking [[deposition (law)|depositions]], and secretaries, bankers, and some lawyers are commonly notaries public. Despite their limited role, some American notaries may also perform a number of far-ranging acts not generally found anywhere else.  Depending on the jurisdiction, they may:  take depositions, certify any and all petitions (ME), witness third-party absentee ballots (ME), provide no-impediment marriage licenses, solemnize civil marriages (ME, FL, SC), witness the opening of a safe deposit box or safe and take an official inventory of its contents, take a renunciation of dower or inheritance (SC), and so on.

====Acknowledgment====
"An '''acknowledgment''' is a formal [oral] declaration before an authorized public officer. It is made by a person executing [signing] an instrument who states that it was his [or her] free act and deed." That is, the person signed it without undue influence and for the purposes detailed in it.<ref>Piombino, Alfred E. (1996). ''Notary Public Handbook: A Guide for Vermont''. n.p.: East Coast Press. 91.</ref> A '''certificate of acknowledgment''' is a written statement signed (and in some jurisdictions, sealed) by the notary or other authorized official that serves to prove that the acknowledgment occurred. The form of the certificate varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but will be similar to the following:
<blockquote>
Before me, the undersigned authority, on this ....... day of .........., personally appeared ................., to me well known to be the person who executed the foregoing instrument, and he/she acknowledged before me that he/she executed the same as his/her voluntary act and deed.
</blockquote>

====Oath, affirmation, and jurat====
A '''jurat''' is the official written statement by a notary public that he or she has administered and witnessed an '''oath''' or '''affirmation''' for an [[oath of office]], or on an '''affidavit''' - that is, that a person has sworn to or affirmed the truth of information contained in a document, under penalty of perjury, whether that document is a lengthy deposition or a simple statement on an application form. The simplest form of jurat and the oath or affirmation administered by a notary are:
<blockquote>
*'''Jurat''': "Sworn (or affirmed) to before me this ........ day of ........, 20 ......"

*'''Oath:''' "Do you solemnly swear that the contents of this affidavit subscribed by you is correct and true?" 

*'''Affirmation''' (for those opposed to swearing oaths): "Do you solemnly, sincerely, and truly declare and affirm that the statements made by you are true and correct?"
</blockquote>

====Venue====
In the U.S., notarial acts normally include what is called a venue or caption, that is, an official listing of the place where a notarization occurred, usually in the form of the state and county and with the abbreviation "ss." (for Latin ''scilicet'', "to wit") normally referred to as a "subscript", often in these forms:

{|
|-
|<pre>
State of .......)
                )ss:
County of.......)
</pre>
||
<pre>
State of ________
County of _______, to-wit:
</pre>
|-
|}

The venue is usually set forth at the beginning of the instrument or at the top of the notary’s certificate. If at the head of the document, it is usually referred to as a caption. In times gone by, the notary would indicate the street address at which the ceremony was performed, and this practice, though unusual today, is occasionally encountered.

====California====
The California Secretary of State, Notary Public & Special Filings Section, is responsible for appointing and commissioning qualified persons as notaries public for four-year terms.<ref>California Government Code [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&group=08001-09000&file=8200-8230 ''§8200''.]</ref>

Prior to sitting for the notary [http://notaryeducation.sos.ca.gov/ exam], one must complete a mandatory six-hour [http://www.sos.ca.gov/business/notary/notary_cklist_complete_mandatory_education.htm course of study]. This required course of study is conducted either in an online, home study, or in-person format via an [http://notaryeducation.sos.ca.gov/ approved notary education vendor].<ref>California Secretary of State. (n.d.). [http://www.sos.ca.gov/business/notary/notary_checklist.htm ''Notary Public Check List''.] Viewed 9 January 2008.</ref> Both prospective notaries as well as current notaries seeking reappointment must undergo an "expanded" F.B.I. and California Department of Justice background check.<ref>California Government Code [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&group=08001-09000&file=8200-8230 ''§8201.1''.]</ref>

Various statutes, rules, and regulations govern notaries public. California law sets maximum, but not minimum, fees for services related to notarial acts (e.g., per signature: acknowledgment $10, jurat $10, certified power of attorney $10, et cetera).<ref>California Government Code [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&group=08001-09000&file=8200-8230 ''§8211''.]</ref> A finger print (typically the right thumb) may be required in the notary journal based on the transaction in question (e.g., deed, quitclaim deed, deed of trust affecting real property, power of attorney document, et cetera). Documents with blank spaces cannot be notarized (a further anti-fraud measure). California explicitly prohibits notaries public from using literal foreign language translation of their title.<ref>[http://www.sos.ca.gov/business/notary/forms/notary-guidelines-2001.pdf Notary Public Disciplinary Guidelines.] (2001). California Secretary of State. p. 25.</ref>

In other words, the bond protects a notary's client (not the notary). Applicants are submitted and paid through a state approved bonding agent. Florida is one of three states (Maine and South Carolina are the others) where a notary public can solemnize the rites of matrimony (perform a marriage ceremony).<ref>Florida Department of State.

An applicant for the notary public commission must also post a $5,000 bond, usually with an insurance company and pay an application fee of $10. The application is usually accompanied with an oath of office. If the Secretary of State's office approves the application, the Secretary of State then sends the commission to the clerk of the county where the applicant resides. If the applicant records the commission with the county clerk, he or she then receives the commission. Illinois law prohibits notaries from using the literal Spanish translation in their title and requires them to use a rubber stamp seal for their notarizations. The notary public can then perform his or her duties anywhere in the state, as long as the notary resides (or works or does business) in the county where he or she was appointed.<ref>Illinois Secretary of State.

====Wyoming====
[[Wyoming]] notaries public are appointed by the Secretary of State and serve a four year term.  A Wyoming notary public has jurisdiction throughout the states of Wyoming and Montana.  These states permit notaries from neighboring states to act in the state in the same manner as one from that state under reciprocity, e.g. as long as that state grants notaries from neighboring states to act in their state.

====Controversies====
A Maryland requirement that to obtain a commission, a notary declare his belief in God, as required by the Maryland Constitution, was found by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Torcaso v. Watkins]]'', {{ussc|367|488|1961}} to be unconstitutional.  Historically, some states required that a notary be a [[citizen]] of the United States. However, the U.S. Supreme Court, in the case of ''[[Bernal v. Fainter]]'' {{ussc|467|216|1984}} (the ''Fainter'' case), declared that to be impermissible.

In the U.S., there are reports of notaries (or people claiming to be notaries) having taken advantage of the differing roles of notaries in common law and civil law jurisdictions to engage in the unauthorized practice of law. [http://www.sos.state.tx.us/statdoc/ntpublico.shtml] The victims of such scams are typically illegal immigrants from civil law countries who need assistance with, for example, their immigration papers and want to avoid hiring an attorney.  Confusion often results from the mistaken premise that a notary public in the United States serves the same function as a ''Notario Publico'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries (which are [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries, ''see below'').  Prosecutions in such cases are difficult, as the victims are often deported and thus unavailable to testify.

====Military====
Certain members of the United States Armed Forces are given the powers of a notary under federal law (10 U.S.C. section 1044). Some military members have authority to certify documents or administer oaths, without being given all notarial powers.  In addition to the powers granted by the federal government, some states have enacted laws granting notarial powers to commissioned officers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA403141&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf |title=Notarial Services |accessdate=4 June 2009 |date=10 April 1997 |publisher=U.S. Army }}</ref>

==Civil Law jurisdictions==
{{Main|Civil law notary}}
The role undertaken by notaries in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries is much greater than in [[common law]] countries. Notaries in the former countries frequently undertake work done in common law countries by the Titles Office and other Government agencies. The qualifications imposed by some countries is much greater. In [[Greece]], for example, a practitioner must choose to be either a solicitor or a notary.

This should be contrasted with the [[Latin America]]n ''notario'' who may be similar to an [[Lawyer|attorney at law]] or [[lawyer]]. In Mexico, notaries are specialized lawyers acting as public officers with jurisdiction over voluntary, non-contentious private law such as real estate transactions, incorporation of corporations and legal entities, wills and successions among other acts. They are appointed after a competition between various candidates for the same position.<ref>{{Citation|'''Ley del Notariado del Distrito Federal, Articulos 42 y 54'''|date=August 2009}}</ref> A French ''[[notaire]]'', a German ''[[:de:Notar|Notar]]'' and an Italian ''[[:it:Notaio|Notaio]]'' register [[will (law)|will]]s and other documents, and authenticates transactions of [[real estate]].

In the few United States jurisdictions where trained notaries are allowed (such as [[Puerto Rico]]), the practice of these jurists is limited to non-judicial legal advice, property conveyencing and legal drafting.

==Notable Notaries==
In addition to many well-known notaries public from the world of the law, there are several well-known notaries from other arenas of achievement. Klaus Hergescheimer of Massapequa, NY has the distinction of becoming the first notary to be commissioned in all fifty states (a feat since duplicated several times by others), as well as numerous territories and trust possessions. [[Richard Nixon]] confidant [[Robert Abplanalp]] was a notary for many years, as were [[Fawn Hall]], teacher and astronaut [[Christa McAuliffe]], and former major league baseball pitcher [[Joe Moeller]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

From the world of entertainment, actor [[Stanley Tucci]], actresses [[Mindy Cohn]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]], television host [[David Horowitz (consumer advocate)|David Horowitz]],   and radio producer [[Gary Dell'Abate]] all hold or have held notary certificates.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Upon the death of President [[Warren G. Harding]] in 1923, [[Calvin Coolidge]] was sworn in as President by his father, [[John Calvin Coolidge, Sr.]], a [[Vermont]] notary public.  However, as there was some controversy as to whether a state notary public had the authority to administer the presidential [[oath of office]], President Coolidge took the oath, again, upon returning to Washington.<ref>[http://vermont-archives.org/notary/guide/pdf/NOTARY%20GUIDE%202006.pdf ''Short Guide for Vermont Notaries Public.''] (2007).
