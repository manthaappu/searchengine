'''Teletext''' (or "broadcast teletext") is a [[television]] information retrieval service developed in the [[United Kingdom]] in the early 1970s. It offers a range of text-based information, typically including national, international and sporting news, weather and TV schedules. [[Subtitle (captioning)|Subtitle]] (or [[closed captioning]]) information is also transmitted in the teletext signal, typically on page 888<ref>{{citebook|title=Digital Journalism: Emerging Media and the Changing Horizons of Journalism|first=Kevin |last=Kawamoto|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year= 2003|id=ISBN 074252681X|page=32}}</ref> or 777.

A number of similar teletext services were developed in other countries, some of which attempted to address the limitations of the British-developed system, with its simple graphics and fixed page sizes.

==France: Antiope==
{{Main|Antiope (teletext)}}
In France, where the [[SECAM]] standard is used in television broadcasting, a teletext system was developed in the late 1970s under the name ''Antiope''. It had a higher data rate and was capable of dynamic page sizes, allowing more sophisticated graphics. It was phased out in favour of standard teletext in 1991.

==Canada: Telidon==
{{Main|Telidon}}
The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] ran a teletext service, IRIS, accessible only in [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]], [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]] and [[Montreal, Quebec|Montreal]]. It ran from 1983 until about 1986, and used the Canadian-developed [[Telidon]] system, which was developed in 1980. Like Antiope, Telidon allowed significantly higher graphic resolution than standard teletext.

==Russian Federation==
In the Russian Federation teletext service operates on Channel One, Channel "TV Centre", and many regional cable channels.

==United States==
Adoption in the United States was hampered due to a lack of a single teletext standard and consumer resistance to the high initial price of teletext decoders. Throughout the period of analogue broadcasting, teletext or other similar technologies in the USA were practically non-existent, with the only technologies resembling such existing in the country being [[closed captioning]], [[TV Guide On Screen]], and [[Extended Data Services]] (XDS).

===Early tests===
A version of the European teletext standard designed to work with the [[NTSC]] television standard used in [[North America]] was first demonstrated in the USA in 1978 by station [[KSL-TV|KSL]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], premiered a teletext service using Ceefax.  They were followed by [[United States|American]] television network [[CBS]], which decided to try both the British [[Ceefax]] and French [[Antiope (teletext)|Antiope]] software for preliminary tryouts for a teletext service, using station KMOX (now [[KMOV]]) in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] as a testing ground.<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&dat=19790516&id=DwEMAAAAIBAJ&sjid=21gDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6334,14832 Teletext: Soon You'll Be Punching Buttons And Talking Back To Your TV], ''[[Associated Press]]'' (syndicated), 16 May 1979</ref><ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aj4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT17 KSL-TV's Teletext Testing Shows No Reception Problems], ''[[Infoworld]]'', 18 February 1980.  Also includes a prescient analysis of the likely economics of teletext and videotex</ref>

CBS decided on Antiope and mounted a large market trial in Los Angeles in partnership with NBC and PBS. Services premiered simultaneously on station KNXT (now [[KCBS-TV]]), [[KNBC]] and [[KCET]] in [[Los Angeles]].<ref>David Crook, [http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&dat=19810918&id=R2sjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ae4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4530,1499401 Teletext information systems are taking over television sets], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (syndicated), September 18, 1981</ref><ref>[http://www.richardgingras.com/background/products/teletext/ Pictures from KCET's 1980 teletext trial using Antiope]</ref> All three services included an array of local news and information services. KCET's service also included service components for use in schools.

===NABTS===
{{Main|NABTS}}
Later, an official North American standard of teletext, called [[NABTS]] (North American Broadcast Teletext Specification) was developed in the early 1980s by [[Norpak]], a Canadian company. NABTS provided improved graphic and text capability over WST, but was quite short-lived. This was mainly due to the expensive cost of NABTS decoders, costing in the thousands of dollars upon their release to the public. NABTS, however, was adopted for a short while by American TV networks [[NBC]] & [[CBS]] throughout the early-to-mid 80s, CBS using it for their short-lived [[ExtraVision]] teletext service, which premiered after the early Antiope & Ceefax trials by CBS & KNXT, and NBC, who had a NABTS-based service called [[NBC Teletext]] for a very short time in the mid-1980s. NBC discontinued their service in 1985 due to the cost of NABTS decoders not dropping to an affordable level for the consumer public.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7S4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA21 NBC discontinues teletext], ''[[InfoWorld]]'', 11 February 1985, p. 21</ref>

The NABTS protocol received a revival of sorts in the late 90s, when it was used for the [[datacasting]] features of [[WebTV for Windows]] under [[Windows 98]], and for [[Intel]]'s now-defunct [[InterCast]] service (also for Windows as well), using a proper [[TV tuner card]] (such as the [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] All-In-Wonder or [[Hauppauge Computer Works|Hauppauge]]'s Win-TV).

===World System Teletext===
{{Main|World System Teletext}}
WST was also used for a short time in the USA, with services provided throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s by several regional American TV networks (such as the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]'s ''Infotext'' service in the mid-1980s, which was carried on several TV stations across [[Wisconsin]], and Agtext, provided by [[Kentucky Educational Television]] and carried on KET's stations, both services providing agriculturally oriented information) and major-market U.S. TV stations (such as ''Metrotext'', which was formerly carried on station [[KTTV]] in [[Los Angeles]], and ''KeyFax'', formerly on [[WFLD]] in [[Chicago]]).

<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[image:Zenith-electra.jpg|left|thumb|Electra teletext]] -->
Perhaps the most prominent of American teletext providers was the ''[[Electra (teletext)|Electra]]'' teletext service, using WST, which was broadcast starting in the early 1980s on the vertical blanking interval ([[VBI]]) of the American cable channel [[TBS Superstation|WTBS]]. Electra was owned and operated by [[Taft Broadcasting]] and [[Satellite Syndicated Systems]] (SSS). Electra ran up until 1993, when it was shut down due to [[Zenith Electronics|Zenith]], the prominent (and only) American TV manufacturer at the time offering teletext features in their sets decided to discontinue such features, as well as a lack of funding and lagging interest in teletext by the American consumer.

[[Zenith Electronics Corporation|Zenith]] manufactured models of television sets in the USA in the 1980s, most notably their ''Digital System 3'' line, that had built-in WST teletext decoders as a feature, much like most British/European TV sets. Teletext services in the USA like [[Electra (teletext)|Electra]] could be received with one of these sets, but these were mostly more expensive higher-end sets offered by Zenith, possibly causing Electra (and American teletext in general) to never catch on with the public.

Australian company [[Dick Smith Electronics]] (DSE) also offered through their USA distributors a set-top WST teletext decoder kit. The kit used as its core the same teletext [[decoding]] module (manufactured by UK electronics company [[Mullard]]) installed in most British TV sets, with additional circuitry to adapt it for American [[NTSC]] video, and to utilize it in a separate set-top box.

A significant reason for the demise of American teletext was when [[Zenith Electronics|Zenith]] introduced built-in [[closed captioning]] decoders in TVs in the early '90s, as mandated by the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]. It was not practical for Zenith to re-design their TV chassis models that previously had teletext decoder support to have both teletext and closed captioning support. So Zenith decided to drop the teletext features, therefore ending teletext service in the US in the early 1990s, considering Zenith was the only major manufacturer of teletext-equipped sets in America.

=== 1990s: InterCast ===
{{Main|Intercast}}
InterCast was a modern teletext-like system created by [[Intel]] in 1996, using a TV tuner card installed in a desktop [[Personal computer|PC]] running Windows with the InterCast Viewer software. The software would receive data representing [[HTML]] pages via the [[VBI]] (Vertical Blanking Interval) of a television channel's video, while displaying in a window in the InterCast software the TV channel itself. The [[HTML]] data received would then be displayed in another window in the Intercast software. It usually was extra supplemental information relevant to the TV program being viewed, such as extra clues for the viewer during a murder mystery show, or extra news headlines or extended weather forecasts during a newscast.

[[NBC]], as well as [[The Weather Channel (United States)|The Weather Channel]], [[CNN]] and [[MTV2|M2]] (now MTV2), utilized InterCast technology to complement their programming. InterCast, however, fell into disuse, and Intel discontinued support of InterCast a few years later.

===WaveTop===
{{Main|WaveTop}}
Another service in the USA similar in delivery and content to teletext was the ''WaveTop'' service, provided and operated by the [[Wavephore]] Corporation. It used the same types of InterCast-compatible TV tuner cards, and used an application that ran under Windows, like InterCast. In fact, WaveTop software was also bundled with TV tuner cards that had InterCast software bundled with them as well.

However, Wavetop was an independent service from InterCast, and wasn't a complementary service to a television program or channel like the latter. In fact, viewing television with a TV card was not possible while the WaveTop software was running, since the software utilized the TV tuner card as a full-time data receiver.

WaveTop provided content from several different providers in the form of HTML pages displayed in the WaveTop software, such as news articles from the [[New York Times]], weather information provided by [[The Weather Channel (United States)|The Weather Channel]], and sports from [[ESPN]]. It also delivered short video clips, usually commercials, that could be viewed in the software as well.

When it was in operation, WaveTop's data was delivered on the [[VBI]] of local public TV stations affiliated with the [[PBS]] network through their [[PBS National Datacast]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbsnationaldatacast.com |title=非公開求人・転職支援会社 |publisher=Pbsnationaldatacast.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-30}}</ref> division, that the TV card and WaveTop software tuned into to receive the service.

===Guide+===
{{Main|Guide Plus}}
Yet another service in the U.S. that relied on data delivery via the [[VBI]] like teletext, was the ''Guide+'' (''Guide Plus'', also referred to as ''GuidePlus+'' as well) service provided and developed by [[Gemstar]]. There were several models of television sets made throughout the 90s by [[Thomson SA|Thomson Consumer Electronics]] under the [[RCA]] and [[General Electric]] brands that had built-in Guide+ decoders. Guide+ was an on-screen interactive program guide that provided current TV schedule listings, as well as other information like news headlines. Some Guide+ equipped sets from RCA even had an [[IR]]-emitting sensor that could be plugged in to the back of the TV, to control a VCR to record programs which could be selected from the on-screen Guide+ listings. In some ways, this was very similar to the [[Video Programming by Teletext|Video Programming by Teletext (VPT)]], [[Video Program System]] (VPS), and [[Programme Delivery Control]] (PDC) features of British/European teletext.

Guide+ was a free service, supported by advertisements displayed on-screen in the Guide+ menu and listing screens, not unlike [[banner ads]] displayed on web pages. Guide+ was delivered over the [[VBI]] of select local American TV stations.

Guide+ was discontinued by Gemstar in June 2004, and soon afterwards, [[Thomson SA|Thomson]] dropped the Guide+ features from all RCA and GE television sets made afterward.

However, Guide+ in America has now been replaced by Gemstar with a similar service (delivered in the same fashion via VBI like Guide+), called ''[[TV Guide On Screen]]''.<ref>[http://www.gemstartvguide.com/whatwedo/tvgonscreen.asp ]{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}</ref> A small number of televisions, [[DVD recorder]]s, and [[digital video recorder]]s are now being released with ''TV Guide On Screen'' capabilities. The Guide+ name & service is still used in Europe by Gemstar. (The same service is known in Japan as G-Guide).

===Star Sight===
{{Main|Star Sight}}
Similar to Guide+ was ''Star Sight'',<ref>http://www.starsight.com</ref> with its decoders built in to TVs manufactured by Zenith, Samsung, Sony, Toshiba, Magnavox, and others. This was an electronic program guide service similar to Guide+, but was a service that relied on monthly subscription fees paid by the user, not from revenue gathered from on-screen advertisements like Guide+. Star Sight discontinued operations on July 21, 2003, due to a lack of subscribers to the service. Star Sight's data was also delivered on the [[VBI]] of local PBS stations through the PBS National Datacast division, much like how WaveTop was delivered as mentioned previously in this article.

==The Netherlands==
[[File:Tekst-tv.png|thumb|left|200px|A screenshot of the Dutch ''Tekst-tv'' in 2005.]] [[Image:Tekst-tv2000.png|thumb|right|300px|A screenshot of the Dutch ''Tekst-tv'' in 2000.]]
The Netherlands runs a regular Prestel service since the end of 1977 on [[Nederland 1]] and [[Nederland 2|2]] and the commercial channels. But they also have ''Tekst-tv'', which broadcasts a selection of news, sports and the weather forecasting as a text service, but as a regular TV broadcast, with improved background graphics.
