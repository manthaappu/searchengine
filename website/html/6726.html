In [[mathematics]], a '''coefficient''' is a multiplicative factor in some [[term (mathematics)|term]] of an [[expression (mathematics)|expression]] (or of a [[series]]); it is usually a number, but in any case does not involve any [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s of the expression. For instance in
:<math>7x^2-3xy+1.5+y</math>
the first three terms respectively have the coefficients 7, −3, and 1.5 (in the third term there are no variables, so the coefficient is the term itself; it is called the [[constant term]] or constant coefficient of this expression). The final term does not have any explicitly written coefficient, but is usually considered to have coefficient 1, since multiplying by that factor would not change the term. Often coefficients are numbers as in this example, although they could be parameters of the problem, as ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' in
:<math>ax^2+bx+c</math>
when it is understood that these are not considered as variables.

Thus a [[polynomial]] in one variable ''x'' can be written as
:<math>a_k x^k + \cdots + a_1 x^1 + a_0,</math>
for some integer ''k'', where ''a''<sub>''k''</sub>, ... ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>0</sub> are coefficients; to allow this kind of expression in all cases one must allow introducing terms with 0 as coefficient.
For the largest ''i'' with {{nowrap|''a''<sub>''i''</sub> ≠ 0}} (if any), ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> is called the '''leading coefficient''' of the polynomial. So for example the leading coefficient of the polynomial

:<math>\, 4x^5 + x^3 + 2x^2</math>

is 4.

Specific coefficients arise in mathematical identities, such as the [[binomial theorem]] which involves [[binomial coefficient]]s; these particular coefficients are tabulated in [[Pascal's triangle]].

==Linear algebra==
In [[linear algebra]], the '''leading coefficient''' of a row in a matrix is the first nonzero entry in that row. So, for example, given

:<math>
M = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 0 & 6 \\
0 & 2 & 9 & 4 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
</math>

The leading coefficient of the first row is 1; 2 is the leading coefficient of the second row; 4 is the leading coefficient of the third row, and the last row does not have a leading coefficient.

Though coefficients are frequently viewed as [[constant (mathematics)|constants]] in elementary algebra, they can be variables more generally. For example, the [[coordinates]] <math>(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)</math> of a [[vector (geometric)|vector]] ''v'' in a [[vector space]] with [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] <math>\lbrace e_1, e_2, ..., e_n \rbrace </math>, are the coefficients of the basis vectors in the expression 
:<math> v = x_1 e_1 + x_2 e_2 + ... + x_n e_n .</math>

==Examples of physical coefficients==
# ''[[coefficient of thermal expansion|Coefficient of Thermal Expansion]]'' ([[thermodynamics]]) (dimensionless) - Relates the change in temperature to the change in a material's dimensions.  
# ''[[Partition Coefficient]]'' (''K<sub>D</sub>'') ([[chemistry]]) - The ratio of concentrations of a compound in two phases of a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.
# ''[[Hall Effect|Hall coefficient]]'' (electrical physics) - Relates a magnetic field applied to an element to the voltage created, the amount of current and the element thickness. It is a characteristic of the material from which the conductor is made.
# ''[[Lift coefficient]]'' (''C<sub>L</sub>'' or ''C<sub>Z</sub>'') ([[Aerodynamics]]) (dimensionless) -  Relates the lift generated by an airfoil with the dynamic pressure of the fluid flow around the airfoil, and the planform area of the airfoil. 
# ''[[Ballistic coefficient]]'' (BC) ([[Aerodynamics]]) (units of kg/m<sup>2</sup>) - A measure of a body's ability to overcome air resistance in flight. BC is a function of mass, diameter, and drag coefficient. 
# ''[[Transmission coefficient (physics)|Transmission Coefficient]]'' ([[quantum mechanics]]) (dimensionless) - Represents the probability flux of a transmitted wave relative to that of an incident wave.  It is often used to describe the probability of a particle [[Quantum tunnelling|tunnelling]] through a barrier.  
# ''[[Damping|Damping Factor]]'' a.k.a. ''viscous damping coefficient'' (Physical Engineering) (units of newton-seconds per meter) - relates a damping force with the velocity of the object whose motion is being

==Chemistry==
A  coefficient is a number placed in front of a term in a [[chemical equation]] to indicate how many [[molecule|molecules]] (or atoms)  take part in the reaction.  For example, in the formula <math>2H_2 + O_2 \rarr 2H_2O</math>, the number 2's in front of <math>H_2</math> and <math>H_2O</math> are [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric coefficients]].
