The IBM [[System/360]], announced in 1964, was a popular computer system with 24-bit addressing and [[32-bit]] general registers and arithmetic.  The early 1980s saw the first popular personal computers, including the IBM [[PC/AT]] with an Intel [[80286]] processor using 24-bit addressing and 16-bit general registers and arithmetic, and the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Macintosh 128k]] with a Motorola [[68000]] processor featuring 24-bit addressing and 32-bit registers. The [[eZ80]] is a microprocessor and microcontroller with 24-bit registers and addressing that is binary compatible with the 8/16-bit [[Z80]].
