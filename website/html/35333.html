The '''speed of light''', usually denoted by '''''c''''', is a [[physical constant]] important in many areas of physics. [[Light]] and all other forms of [[electromagnetic radiation]] always travel at this [[speed]] in empty space ([[vacuum]]), regardless of the motion of the source or the [[inertial frame of reference]] of the observer. Its value is exactly 299,792,458 [[metre per second|metres per second]]<ref name="penrose">{{Cite book|  last=Penrose |first=R |  year=2004 |  title=[[The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe]] |  pages=410–1 |  publisher=[[Vintage Books]] |  isbn=9780679776314 |  quote=... the most accurate standard for the metre is conveniently ''defined'' so that there are exactly 299,792,458 of them to the distance travelled by light in a standard second, giving a value for the metre that very accurately matches the now inadequately precise standard metre rule in Paris. }}</ref> (approximately 186,282 miles per second).

The speed at which light propagates through [[transparent material]]s, such as glass or air, is less than ''c''. The ratio between ''c'' and the speed ''v'' at which light travels in a material is called the [[refractive index]] ''n'' of the material (''n'' = ''c'' / ''v''). For example, for [[visible light]] the refractive index of glass is typically around 1.5, meaning that light in glass travels at {{nowrap|''c'' / 1.5 ≈ {{val|200000|u=km/s}}}}; the [[refractive index of air]] for visible light is about 1.0003, so the speed of light in air is very close to ''c''.

In most practical cases, light can be thought of as moving instantaneously, but for long distances and very sensitive measurements the finite speed of light has noticeable effects.  In communicating with distant [[space probes]], it can take minutes to hours for the message to get from Earth to the satellite and back. The light we see from stars left them many years ago, allowing us to study the history of the universe by looking at distant objects.  The finite speed of light also limits the theoretical maximum speed of computers, since information must be sent within the computer chips and from chip to chip.  Finally, the speed of light can be used with [[time of flight]] measurements to measure large distances to high precision.

[[Ole Rømer]] first demonstrated in 1676 that light travelled at a finite speed (as opposed to instantaneously) by studying the apparent motion of [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Io (moon)|Io]]. In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] postulated that the speed of light in vacuum was independent of the source or inertial frame of reference, and explored the consequences of that postulate by deriving the theory of [[special relativity]] and showing that the parameter ''c'' had relevance outside of the context of light and electromagnetism. After centuries of increasingly precise measurements, in 1975 the speed of light was known to be {{val|299792458|u=m/s}} with a relative [[measurement uncertainty]] of 4 parts per billion. In 1983, the [[metre]] was redefined in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) as the distance travelled by light in vacuum in {{frac|1|{{val|299792458}}}} of a [[second]]. As a result, the numerical value of ''c'' in metres per second is now fixed exactly by the definition of the metre.<ref name=BIPM_SI_units>{{SIbrochure|page=112}}</ref>

==Numerical value, notation, and units==

The speed of light in vacuum is usually denoted by ''c'', for "constant" or the Latin {{lang|la|''[[celeritas]]''}} (meaning "swiftness"). Originally, the symbol ''V'' was used, introduced by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1865. In 1856, [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]] and [[Rudolf Kohlrausch]] used ''c'' for a constant later shown to equal {{radic|2}} times the speed of light in vacuum. In 1894, [[Paul Drude]] redefined ''c'' with its modern meaning. [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] used ''V'' in his [[Annus Mirabilis papers|original German-language papers]] on special relativity in 1905<!--, the 1923 English translation of them by Perrett and Jeffery using ''c''-->, but in 1907 he switched to ''c'', which by then had become the standard symbol.<ref name=Yc>

===Upper limit on speeds===
According to special relativity, the energy of an object with [[rest mass]] ''m'' and speed ''v'' is given by {{nowrap|''γmc''<sup>2</sup>}}, where ''γ'' is the Lorentz factor defined above. When ''v'' is zero, ''γ'' is equal to one, giving rise to the famous {{nowrap|''E'' {{=}} ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}} formula for [[mass-energy equivalence]]. Since the ''γ'' factor approaches infinity as ''v'' approaches ''c'', it would take an infinite amount of energy to accelerate an object with mass to the speed of light. The speed of light is the upper limit for the speeds of objects with positive rest mass.<ref>

More generally, it is normally impossible for information or energy to travel faster than ''c''. One argument for this follows from the counter-intuitive implication of special relativity known as the [[relativity of simultaneity]]. If the spatial distance between two events A and B is greater than the time interval between them multiplied by ''c'' then there are frames of reference in which A precedes B, others in which B precedes A, and others in which they are simultaneous. As a result, if something were travelling faster than ''c'' relative to an inertial frame of reference, it would be travelling backwards in time relative to another frame, and [[causality (physics)|causality]] would be violated.{{#tag:ref|It is thought that the [[Scharnhorst effect]] does allow signals to travel slightly faster than ''c'', but the special conditions in which this effect can occur prevent one from using this effect to violate causality.<ref>

====Faster-than-light observations and experiments====
{{Main|Faster-than-light}}

There are situations in which it may seem that matter, energy, or information travels at speeds greater than ''c'', but they do not. For example, as is discussed in the [[#In a medium|propagation of light in a medium]] section below, many wave velocities can exceed ''c''. For example, the [[phase velocity]] of [[X-ray]]s through most glasses can routinely exceed ''c'',<ref>

If a laser beam is swept quickly across a distant object, the spot of light can move faster than ''c'', although the initial movement of the spot is delayed because of the time it takes light to get to the distant object at the speed ''c''. However, the only physical entities that are moving are the laser and its emitted light, which travels at the speed ''c'' from the laser to the various positions of the spot.  Similarly, a shadow projected onto a distant object can be made to move faster than ''c'', after a delay in time.<ref>

===In a medium===
{{See also|Refractive index}}
In a medium, light usually does not propagate at a speed equal to ''c''; further, different types of light wave will travel at different speeds. The speed at which the individual crests and troughs of a [[plane wave]] (a wave filling the whole space, with only one [[frequency]]) propagates is called the [[phase velocity]] ''v''<sub>p</sub>. An actual physical signal with a finite extent (a pulse of light) travels at a different speed. The largest part of the pulse travels at the [[group velocity]] ''v''<sub>g</sub>, and its earliest part travels at the [[front velocity]] ''v''<sub>f</sub>.

[[File:frontgroupphase.gif|thumb|left|The blue dot moves at the speed of the ripples, the phase velocity; the green dot moves with the speed of the envelope, the group velocity; and the red dot moves with the speed of the foremost part of the pulse, the front velocity|alt=A modulated wave moves from left to right. There are three points marked with a dot: A blue dot at a node of the carrier wave, a green dot at the maximum of the envelope, and a red dot at the front of the envelope.]]
The phase velocity is important in determining how a light wave travels through a material or from one material to another.  It is often represented in terms of a ''refractive index''. The refractive index of a material is defined as the ratio of ''c'' to the phase velocity ''v''<sub>p</sub> in the material: larger indices of refraction indicate lower speeds. The refractive index of a material may depend on the light's frequency, intensity, [[polarization (waves)|polarization]], or direction of propagation; in many cases, though, it can be treated as a material-dependent constant. The [[refractive index of air]] is approximately 1.0003.<ref name=Podesta>{{Cite book

The finiteness of the speed of light has implications for various sciences and technologies.

The speed of light is of relevance to [[telecommunication|communications]].

Another consequence of the finite speed of light is that communications between the Earth and spacecraft are not instantaneous. There is a brief delay from the source to the receiver, which becomes more noticeable as distances increase. This delay was significant for communications between [[Mission Control Center|ground control]] and [[Apollo 8]] when it became the first manned spacecraft to orbit the Moon: for every question, the ground control station had to wait at least three seconds for the answer to arrive.<ref>{{cite web

As a consequence of this, if a robot on the surface of Mars were to encounter a problem, its human controllers would not be aware of it until at least five minutes, and possibly up to twenty minutes, later; it would then take a further five to twenty minutes for instructions to travel from Earth to Mars.

The speed of light can also be of concern over very short distances. In [[supercomputer]]s, the speed of light imposes a limit on how quickly data can be sent between [[central processing unit|processor]]s. If a processor operates at 1 [[gigahertz]], a signal can only travel a maximum of about {{convert|30|cm|ft|0}} in a single cycle. Processors must therefore be placed close to each other to minimize communication latencies; this can cause difficulty with cooling. If clock frequencies continue to increase, the speed of light will eventually become a limiting factor for the internal design of single [[integrated circuit|chips]].<ref name="processorlimit"/>

===Distance measurement===
[[Radar]] systems measure the distance to a target by the time it takes a radio-wave pulse to return to the radar antenna after being reflected by the target: the distance to the target is half the round-trip [[Radar#Transit time|transit time]] multiplied by the speed of light. A [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) receiver measures its distance to GPS satellites based on how long it takes for a radio signal to arrive from each satellite, and from these distances calculates the receiver's position. Because light travels about 300,000 kilometres (186,000 miles) in one second, these measurements of small fractions of a second must be very precise.

===Astronomy===

The finite speed of light is important in astronomy. Due to the vast distances involved, it can take a very long time for light to travel from its source to Earth. For example, it has taken 13 billion (13{{e|9}}) years for light to travel to Earth from the faraway galaxies viewed in the [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]] images.<ref name=Hubble>{{cite press

==Measurement==
<!--- The article Galileo Galileo links to this section. Please do not change the title of the section without amending the articles which link to it. --->
There are different ways to determine the value of ''c''. One way is to measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which can be done in various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, it is also possible to determine ''c'' from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants ''ε''<sub>0</sub> and ''μ''<sub>0</sub> and using their relation to ''c''. Historically, the most precise results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a lightwave, with their product equaling ''c''.

In 1983 the metre was defined as "the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1⁄299,792,458 of a second",<ref name=Resolution_1/> fixing the value of the speed of light at {{val|299792458|u=m/s}} by definition, as [[#Increased accuracy and redefinition of the metre|described below]]. Consequently, precision measurements of the speed of light yield a precise realization of the metre rather than a precise value of ''c''.

===Astronomical measurements===
[[Outer space]] is a natural setting for measuring the speed of light because of its large scale and nearly perfect [[vacuum]]. Typically, one measures the time needed for light to traverse some reference distance in the [[solar system]], such as the [[radius]] of the Earth's orbit. Historically, such measurements could be made fairly accurately, compared to how accurately the length of the reference distance is known in Earth-based units. It is customary to express the results in [[astronomical unit]]s (AU) per day. An astronomical unit is approximately the average distance between the Earth and  Sun;  it is not based on the [[International System of Units]].{{#tag:ref|The astronomical unit is defined the radius of an unperturbed circular Newtonian orbit about the Sun of a particle having infinitesimal mass, moving with an [[angular frequency]] of {{gaps|0.017|202|098|95}} [[radian]]s (approximately {{frac|{{val|365.256898}}}} of a revolution) per day.<ref>{{SIbrochure8th|page=126}}.

The account published in ''Journal des sçavans'' was based on a report that Rømer read to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in November 1676 [[#cohen-1940|(Cohen, 1940, p. 346)]].</ref> When measured from Earth, the periods of moons orbiting a distant planet are shorter when the Earth is approaching the planet than when the Earth is receding from it. The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being the [[diameter]] of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon's orbital period is actually the difference in the time it takes light to traverse the shorter or longer distance. Rømer observed this effect for [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]'s innermost moon [[Io (moon)|Io]] and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the Earth's orbit.

In 1729, Bradley used this method to derive that light travelled 10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8 minutes 12 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.<ref name="Bradley1729"/>

Nowadays, the "light time for unit distance"—the inverse of ''c'', expressed in seconds per astronomical unit—is measured by comparing the time for radio signals to reach different spacecraft in the Solar System, with their position calculated from the gravitational effects of the Sun and various planets. By combining many such measurements, a [[best fit]] value for the light time per unit distance is obtained. {{As of|2009}}, the best estimate, as approved by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU), is:<ref name="Pitjeva09">

===Time of flight techniques===
A method of measuring the speed of light is to measure the time needed for light to travel to a mirror at a known distance and back. This is the working principle behind the [[Fizeau–Foucault apparatus]] developed by [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] and [[Léon Foucault]].

[[File:Fizeau.JPG|thumb|right|Diagram of the [[Fizeau–Foucault apparatus|Fizeau apparatus]]|alt=A light ray passes horizontally through a half-mirror and a rotating cog wheel, is reflected back by a mirror, passes through the cog wheel, and is reflected by the half-mirror into a monocular.]]
The setup as used by Fizeau consists of a beam of light directed at a mirror {{convert|8|km|mi|0}} away. On the way from the source to the mirror, the beam passes through a rotating cogwheel. At a certain rate of rotation, the beam passes through one gap on the way out and another on the way back, but at slightly higher or lower rates, the beam strikes a tooth and does not pass through the wheel. Knowing the distance between the wheel and the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, the speed of light can be calculated.<ref name=How>{{cite web

 |accessdate=2010-01-13
}}</ref>

The method of Foucault replaces the cogwheel by a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light travels to the distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle on its way out than it is on its way back. From this difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and the distance to the distant mirror the speed of light may be calculated.<ref>{{cite web

Nowadays, using [[oscilloscopes]] with time resolutions of less than one nanosecond, the speed of light can be directly measured by timing the delay of a light pulse from a laser or an LED reflected from a mirror. This method is less precise (with errors of the order of 1%) than other modern techniques, but it is sometimes used as a laboratory experiment in college physics classes.<ref>

===Electromagnetic constants===
An option for measuring ''c'' that does not directly depend on the propagation of electromagnetic waves is to use relation between ''c'' and the [[vacuum permittivity]] ''ε''<sub>0</sub> [[vacuum permeability]] ''μ''<sub>0</sub> established by Maxwell theory: ''c''<sup>2</sup> = 1/(''ε''<sub>0</sub>''μ''<sub>0</sub>). The vacuum permittivity may be determined by measuring the [[capacitance]] and dimensions of a [[capacitor]], whereas the value of the [[vacuum permeability]] is fixed at exactly {{val|4|end=π|e=-7|u=H*m-1}} through the definition of the [[ampere (unit)|ampere]]. Rosa and Dorsey used this method in 1907 to find a value of {{val|299710|22|u=km/s}}.<ref name="Essen1948"/><ref name="RosaDorsey">{{cite journal

[[File:Waves in Box.svg|thumb|right|Electromagnetic [[standing waves]] in a cavity.|alt=A box with three waves in it; there are one and a half wavelength of the top wave, one of the middle one, and a half of the bottom one.]]

Another way to measure the speed of light is to independently measure the frequency ''f'' and wavelength ''λ'' of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of ''c'' can then be found by using the relation ''c'' = ''fλ''. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a [[cavity resonator]]. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946, [[Louis Essen]] and A.C. Gordon-Smith establish the frequency for a variety of [[normal mode]]s of microwaves of a [[microwave cavity]] of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8 μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry.<ref name="Essen1948"/> As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from [[electromagnetic theory]], knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.<ref name="Essen1948">{{cite journal

A household demonstration of this technique is possible, using a [[microwave oven]] and food such as marshmallows or margarine: if the turntable is removed so that the food does not move, it will cook the fastest at the [[antinode]]s (the points at which the wave amplitude is the greatest), where it will begin to melt. The distance between two such spots is half the wavelength of the microwaves; by measuring this distance and multiplying the wavelength by the microwave frequency (usually displayed on the back of the oven, typically 2450 MHz), the value of ''c'' can be calculated, "often with less than 5% error".<ref>

The precision can be improved by using light with a shorter wavelength, but then it becomes difficult to directly measure the frequency of the light. One way around this problem is to start with a low frequency signal of which the frequency can be precisely measured, and from this signal progressively synthesize higher frequency signals whose frequency can then be linked to the original signal. A laser can then be locked to the frequency, and its wavelength can be determined using interferometry.<ref name="NIST_pub">

Until the [[early modern period]], it was not known whether light travelled instantaneously or at a very fast finite speed. The first extant recorded examination of this subject was in [[ancient Greece]]. [[Empedocles]] was the first to claim that the light has a finite speed.<ref>

In the early 17th century, [[Johannes Kepler]] believed that the speed of light was infinite, since empty space presents no obstacle to it. [[René Descartes]] argued that if the speed of light were finite, the Sun, Earth, and Moon would be noticeably out of alignment during a [[lunar eclipse]]. Since such misalignment had not been observed, Descartes concluded the speed of light was infinite. Descartes speculated that if the speed of light were found to be finite, his whole system of philosophy might be demolished.<ref name=Statistics />

===First measurement attempts===

In 1629, [[Isaac Beeckman]] proposed an experiment in which a person observes the flash of a cannon reflecting off a mirror about one mile (1.6 km) away. In 1638, [[Galileo Galilei]] proposed an experiment, with an apparent claim to having performed it some years earlier, to measure the speed of light by observing the delay between uncovering a lantern and its perception some distance away. He was unable to distinguish whether light travel was instantaneous or not, but concluded that if it weren't, it must nevertheless be extraordinarily rapid.<ref name=boyer>

[[Christiaan Huygens]] combined this estimate with an estimate for the diameter of the Earth's orbit to obtain an estimate of speed of light of {{val|220000|u=km/s}}, 26% lower than the actual value.<ref name="Huygens 1690 8–9">{{Cite book

In his 1704 book ''[[Opticks]]'', [[Isaac Newton]] reported Rømer's calculations of the finite speed of light and gave a value of "seven or eight minutes" for the time taken for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth (the modern value is 8 minutes 19 seconds).<ref>

In 1729, [[James Bradley]] discovered the [[aberration of light]].<ref name="Bradley1729"/> From this effect he determined that light must travel 10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8 minutes 12 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.<ref name="Bradley1729"/>

===19th and early 20th century===
In the 19th century [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] developed a method to determine the speed of light based on time-of-flight measurements on Earth and reported a value of {{val|315000|u=km/s}}. His method was improved upon by [[Léon Foucault]] who obtained a value of {{val|298000|u=km/s}} in 1862.<ref name="How"/> In the year 1856, [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]] and [[Rudolf Kohlrausch]] measured the ratio of the electromagnetic and electrostatic units of charge, 1/√''ε''<sub>0</sub>''μ''<sub>0</sub>, by discharging a [[Leyden jar]], and found that its numerical value was very close to the speed of light as measured directly by Fizeau. The following year [[Gustav Kirchoff]] calculated that an electric signal in a [[electrical resistance|resistanceless]] wire travels along the wire at this speed.<ref>{{cite journal

It was thought at the time that empty space was filled with a background medium called the [[luminiferous aether]] in which the electromagnetic field existed. Some physicists thought that this aether acted as an absolute reference frame for all physics and therefore it should be possible to measure the motion of the Earth with respect to this medium. Beginning in the 1880s several experiments were performed to try to detect this motion, the most famous of which is [[Michelson–Morley experiment|the experiment]] performed by [[Albert Michelson]] and [[Edward Morley]] in 1887.<ref>

Because of this experiment [[Hendrik Lorentz]] proposed that the motion of the apparatus through the aether may cause the apparatus to [[Lorentz contraction|contract]] along its length in the direction of motion, by a factor such as to ensure that there is no interference fringes detected by the interferometer. Based on Lorentz's theory, Poincare concluded in 1904 that the speed of light is a limiting factor in dynamics.<ref>

In 1905 Einstein proposed that the speed of light in vacuum, measured by a non-accelerating observer, is independent of the motion of the source or observer. Using this and the principle of relativity as a basis he derived the [[special theory of relativity]], in which the speed of light in vacuum ''c'' featured as a fundamental parameter, also appearing in contexts unrelated to light.<ref>

===Increased accuracy of ''c'' and redefinition of the metre===
{{See also|History of the metre}}
In the second half of the 20th century much progress was made in increasing the accuracy of measurements of the speed of light, first by cavity resonance techniques and later by laser interferometer techniques. In 1972, using the latter method, a group at [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NBS]]   in [[Boulder, Colorado]] determined the speed of light in vacuum to be ''c'' = {{val|299792456.2|1.1|u=m/s}}.  This was 100 times less [[Measurement uncertainty|uncertain]] than the previously accepted value. The remaining uncertainty was mainly related to the definition of the metre.{{#tag:ref|Since 1960 the metre was defined as: "The metre is the length equal to {{val|1650763.73}} wavelengths in vacuum of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the levels 2p<sub>10</sub> and 5d<sub><sub>5</sub></sub> of the krypton 86 atom."<ref name="11thCGPM">
