<html> <head> <title>Intension</title></head><body>: ''Not to be confused with the homophone [[intention]]; or the related concept of [[intentionality]]. For the song "Intension" by Tool, see ''[[10,000 Days|10,000 Days]]''.''

In [[linguistics]], [[logic]], [[philosophy]], and other fields, an '''intension''' is any [[property (philosophy)|property]] or [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] connoted by a [[word]], [[phrase]] or other symbol. In the case of a word, it is often implied by the word's [[definition]].  The term may also refer to all such intensions collectively, although the term ''[[comprehension (logic)|comprehension]]'' is technically more correct for this.

The meaning of a word can be thought of as the bond between ''the idea or thing the word refers to'' and ''the word itself''.  Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] contrasts three concepts:
*the ''signifier'' — the "sound image" or string of [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] on a page that one recognizes as a [[Sign (linguistics)|sign]].
*the ''signified'' — the [[concept]] or [[idea]] that a sign evokes.
*the ''referent'' — the actual [[Object (philosophy)|thing]] or set of things a sign refers to. See ''[[Sign (semiotics)#Dyadic signs|Dyadic signs]]'' and ''[[Reference#Semantics|Reference (semantics)]]''.

Intension is analogous to the signified, extension to the referent. The intension thus links the signifier to the sign's [[Extension (semantics)|extension]]. Without intension of some sort, words can have no meaning.

In philosophical arguments about [[dualism]] versus [[monism]], it is noted that thoughts have intensionality and physical objects do not (S.E. Palmer, 1999), but rather have extension in space.

''Intension'' and ''intensionality'' (the state of having intension) should not be confused with ''intention'' and ''[[intentionality]]'', which are pronounced the same and occasionally arise in the same philosophical context. Where this happens, the letter ''s'' or ''t'' is sometimes italicized to emphasize the distinction.
