<html> <head> <title>WIN.INI</title></head><body>'''WIN.INI''' is a basic [[INI file]] that was used in versions of the [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating environment]] up to [[Windows 3.11]] to store basic settings at boot time. By default, all font, communications drivers, wallpaper, screen saver, and language settings were stored in WIN.INI by [[Windows 3.1x|Windows 3.x]]. Many of these settings were honored in Windows 9x, although the files had begun to be phased out in favor of the [[Windows registry]]. [[Windows XP]] still acknowledges some entries in the WIN.INI file, to provide backwards compatibility with older 16-bit applications. However, when a fresh install of XP is performed, the WIN.INI file created is initially blank. Also there is a WIN.INI file in [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]].

Prior to Windows 3.0, it was not uncommon for applications to store their configuration settings inside WIN.INI.  With the release of [[Windows 3.0]] in 1990, Microsoft introduced the concept of "private" INI files, and some new [[application programming interface]] calls so that applications could store their settings in their own files.<ref>{{cite web

Today Microsoft recommends using the registry for settings.

==Editing==
Microsoft bundles two specialized editors for core [[configuration file]]s (such as WIN.INI, [[SYSTEM.INI]], [[CONFIG.SYS]], and [[AUTOEXEC.BAT]]) with its operating systems. [[Sysedit]] is an [[Multiple document interface|MDI]] [[text editor]] that opens all of those files simultaneously, available in all versions of Windows since Windows 3.x. [[MSConfig]] is a simpler application that allows a user to enable and disable drivers and applications from being loaded at startup by the aforementioned files and the Run, RunEx, and RunOnce registry keys.
