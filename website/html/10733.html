<html> <head> <title>Dissipation factor</title></head><body>In [[physics]], the '''dissipation factor''' (DF) is a measure of loss-rate of [[Power (physics)|power]] of a mode of [[oscillation]] (mechanical, electrical, or electromechanical) in a [[dissipative system]].  It is the reciprocal of [[Quality factor]], which represents the quality of oscillation.

For example, [[electric power]] is dissipated in all [[dielectric]] materials, usually in the form of [[heat]].  In a [[capacitor]] made of a dielectric placed between conductors, the typical [[lumped element model]] includes a lossless ideal capacitor in series with a resistor termed the [[equivalent series resistance]] (ESR) as shown below.<ref>http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/sciences/physics/electromagnetism/electrostatics/Capacitors/Applications/BasicConsiderations/BasicConsiderations.htm</ref>  The ESR represents losses in the capacitor.  In a good capacitor the ESR is very small, and in a poor capacitor the ESR is large.  Note that the ESR is ''not'' simply the resistance that would be measured across a capacitor by an [[ohmmeter]].  The ESR is a derived quantity with physical origins in both the dielectric's conduction electrons and dipole relaxation phenomena.  In a dielectric only one of either the conduction electrons or the dipole relaxation typically dominates loss.<ref>S. Ramo, J.R. Whinnery, and T. Van Duzer, ''Fields and Waves in Communication Electronics'', 3rd ed., (John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1994).  ISBN 0-471-58551-3</ref>  For the case of the conduction electrons being the dominant loss, then

<math> ESR = \frac {\sigma} {\varepsilon \omega^2 C} </math> , where

: <math> \sigma </math> is the dielectric's bulk [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]],

: <math> \omega </math> is the [[angular frequency]] of the AC current ''i'',

: <math> \varepsilon </math> is the lossless [[permittivity]] of the dielectric, and

: <math> C </math> is the lossless capacitance.

[[Image:Loss tangent phasors 1.svg|frame|A real capacitor has a lumped element model of a lossless ideal capacitor in series with an equivalent series resistance (ESR). The loss tangent is defined by the angle between the capacitor's impedance vector and the negative reactive axis.]]

If the capacitor is used in an [[alternating current|AC]] circuit, the dissipation factor due to the non-ideal capacitor is expressed as the ratio of the [[Electrical resistance|resistive]] power loss in the ESR to the [[Reactance (electronics)|reactive]] power oscillating in the capacitor, or

<math> DF = \frac {i^2 ESR} {i^2 |X_{c}|} = \omega C \cdot ESR = \frac {\sigma} {\varepsilon \omega} = 1 / Q </math> .

When representing the electrical circuit parameters as vectors in a [[Complex number|complex]] plane, known as [[Phasor (sine waves)|phasors]], a capacitor's dissipation factor is equal to the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] of the angle between the capacitor's impedance vector and the negative reactive axis, as shown in the diagram to the right.  This gives rise to the parameter known as the [[loss tangent]] ''δ'' where

<math>\tan \delta  =  \frac {ESR} {|X_{c}|} = DF </math> .

Since the ''DF'' in a good capacitor is usually small, ''δ'' ~ ''DF'', and ''DF'' is often expressed as a percentage.

''DF'' approximates to the [[power factor]] when <math>ESR</math> is far less than <math>Xc</math>, which is usually the case. 

''DF'' will vary depending on the dielectric material and the frequency of the electrical signals.  In low [[dielectric constant]] ([[low-k]]), temperature compensating ceramics, ''DF'' of 0.1% to 0.2% is typical.  In high dielectric constant ceramics, ''DF'' can be 1% to 2%.  However, lower ''DF'' is usually an indication of quality capacitors when comparing similar dielectric material.
