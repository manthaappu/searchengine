A '''Beanie Baby''' is a [[Stuffed toy|stuffed animal]], made by [[Ty Warner|Ty Warner Inc.]], which was later renamed as [[Ty Inc.]] in late 1993. Each toy has an inner "posable lining" and is stuffed with plastic pellets (or "beans") rather than conventional stuffing (see [[polyvinylchloride|PVC]] and [[polyethylene|PE]]), giving Beanie Babies a flexible feel.

The original nine Beanie Babies launched in 1993 were Legs the Frog, Squealer the Pig, Spot the Dog, Flash the Dolphin, Splash the Whale, Chocolate the Moose, Patti the Platypus, Brownie the Bear (later renamed "Cubbie"), and Punchers the Lobster (later renamed "Pinchers").<ref>{{Cite news | title = Those Beanies are still hot, and there's no sign of the craze slowing down | author = Amy Carr | date = August 14, 1997 | publisher = [[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]] | quote = Punchers the red lobster.

The line became a phenomenon in the late 1990s when Beanie Babies became both a [[fad]] and a collectible. Ty, Inc. stopped producing the product in 1999; but consumer demand led them to reconsider. In 2000, a Beanie Baby named "The Beginning" was introduced to remind people of Beanie Babies' comeback.

[[Teenie Beanies]], an offshoot of the Beanie Babies line, were made by additional manufacturers for a few [[McDonalds]] [[Happy Meal]] promotions. They are not new Beanie Babies, but Beanie Babies in a smaller size.

==Sociology of Beanie Babies==
The phenomenon of Beanie Babies is an example of a product of [[popular culture]]. Based on the sales and revenue of this toy, Ty Warner Inc. created an empire worth over $6 billion. In 1995, there was fear that the public was losing interest in this hot commodity. In fact, demand was increasing significantly, resulting in a profit of $250 million in the following year, with substantial re-sale value in the secondary market. In 2008 Ty, Inc. released a follow-up line, [[Beanie Babies 2.0]], for use on online games on the Ty website.

===Marketing strategies===
Much of the success of Beanie Babies can be attributed to the marketing strategies of the company.<ref>Becker, H. S. (1982). Art Worlds and Collective Activity. Art Worlds. 1-39.</ref> The ten strategies employed by Ty Warner included:
# Reasonable Price: [[Ty Warner]] wanted to keep Beanie Babies selling at a reasonable price, but did not want to mass produce them. In doing so, he followed steps 4 and 5 by limiting production and distribution by only selling to smaller retailers.
# Keep it Secretive: [[Ty Warner]] was able to keep people interested because they weren’t jaded by the constant advertisements that most large toy companies use; when people don’t know what to expect, it becomes more appealing.
# Surprise People: Unpredictability became entertaining to the mass public and made people even more eager to engage in the collection process of Beanie Babies.
# Limit Production: Limiting production ensured that keeping some Beanie Babies rare would keep people excited.
# Avoid Large Chain Retailers: Unlike most toys that are mass produced and retailed to major toy stores, Beanie Babies were sold at smaller, more refined specialty shops. This helped sustain the authentic image of Beanie Babies.
# Simplicity: Because only a few different colors of fabric were used for each Beanie Baby, costs were kept low. At the same time, this simplicity appealed to everyone because what they saw is what they got.
# Personification: Personification made Beanie Babies easier to relate to; every Beanie Baby had a Ty tag with a unique name, birthday, and poem. This only increased the excitement of the buyers because it was no longer just a [[stuffed animal]].
# Variety: Producing a variety of Beanie Babies attracted everyone because this tactic aims to please everyone’s taste. This ploy also made serious collectors more eager to collect every Beanie Baby out there.
# Retirements: Retirement created frenzy among Beanie Baby consumers. When Ty would retire a certain Beanie Baby, demand would increase, while supply came to a halt.
# Risk: Every previous strategy that Warner developed was a risk, and he succeeded in going against the norm.<ref>Ty Warner's Marketing Strategy. (2008).

Competition against Beanie Babies was limited; substitutes were rare and unsuccessful in the marketplace.

==Collectibility==
Beanie Babies began to emerge as popular collectibles in late 1995, and became a [[fad|hot toy]].<ref>[http://aboutbeanies.com/news/1996/article.cgi?article=1996_05_31_Beanie_Babies_Take_Their_Place_In_Must_Have_Spotlight.txt Ty Beanie Baby Beanies News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Ty systematically [[Retirement (Beanie Babies)|retired]] various designs, and many people assumed that all "retired" designs would rise in value the way that early retirees had. The craze lasted through 1999 and slowly declined after the Ty company's announcement that they would no longer be making Beanie Babies and made a bear called "The End".<ref>[http://aboutbeanies.com/news/1999/article.cgi?article=1999_09_01_Beanie_Babies_is_the_Party_Over.txt Ty Beanie Baby Beanies News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The line was brought back with completely new styles in early 2000 as a result of an online vote<ref>[http://aboutbeanies.com/news/1999/article.cgi?article=1999_12_28_Beanie_Resurrection.txt Ty Beanie Baby Beanies News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> over whether more Beanies should be released. Many believe that the mass retirement and subsequent revival were a publicity stunt,<ref>[http://aboutbeanies.com/news/2000/article.cgi?article=2000_01_03_Fans_vote_to_keep_Beanie_Babies.txt Ty Beanie Baby Beanies News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but Beanie Babies had fallen out of favor with many children by the time the line was relaunched. In recent years, the popularity of Beanie Babies has continued to fade. Some of the more common styles can be found fairly cheaply. New Beanie Baby designs continue to be released, and increasingly include bears and limited edition items. On December 27, 2007, Ty made a massive retirement of its Beanie Baby line, retiring over 240 styles of Beanie Babies, leaving only licensed characters, key-clip versions of popular Beanie Baby styles, popular store exclusives and country exclusives as current. On January 2, 2008, Ty introduced a "replacement" line called [[Beanie Babies 2.0]], the next generation of the beanbag toys. While the aforementioned current styles will continue to be produced and special Beanie Babies will be released, the remainder of future retail styles will be produced under the new line, in which collectors can purchase their Beanies and use a scratch-off code to go online and play with their new pet in a virtual world, much akin to other collectibles like [[Neopets]] and [[Webkinz]].

===Tags===
The tags on Beanie Babies are considered a very important part when assessing their orverall value. It is widely believed by collectors that a Beanie without a tag or a damaged tag loses up to half of its value. Every Beanie Baby has least two factory made tags: a [[swing tag]] (also known as a "hang tag", "ear tag" or "name tag") which includes the beanies name, date of birth and a small story. There is also the [[tush tag]] (usually attached to the Beanie's rear end). Both tags have gone through many changes over time; these changes have become known as "generations". There are currently 15 generations of swing tags and 13 generations of tush tags. Additionally, there are also extra tags for certain regions that include things like safety information to comply with the Canadian [[Stuffed Articles Act]] or the [[CE Mark]] requirements in [[Europe]].


A few tag "generations" have become particularly noteworthy. Most Beanie Babies with first, second, or third generation hang tags have held their value (or in the case of some harder to find styles, increased in value), while fourth and fifth generation hang tags indicate Beanies that were available during the Beanie fad.

===Beanie Babies 2.0===
In an attempt to beat out the Webkinz craze,{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} in early 2008, Ty decided it was time for Beanie Babies to go online. This new version of Beanie Babies was called [[Beanie Babies 2.0]]. The purchase of a Beanie Baby 2.0 provided its owner with a code to access a Beanie Babies interactive website.

===Rarity===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}
During the Beanie Baby craze, the rarest general issue beanie, according to the Winter 2000 edition of ''Ty Beanie Babies'', published by Collectors Value Guide, was considered to be the dark blue variation of "Peanut" the elephant. [[List of Beanie Babies#P|Peanut]] was available well into 1998 in a lighter hue, but the dark blue version that was only made accidentally in 1995 rose in value because of its scarcity. "Nana the monkey" was considered the second rarest Beanie Baby; because only a few early 3rd gen tags use that name instead of Bongo. The early wingless version of "Quackers" the [[duck]], "Chilly" the [[polar bear]], the earlier versions of "Nip" and "Zip" the cats, "Peking" the [[panda bear]];  "Teddy" the bear (Especially the cranberry coloured one)  and "Humphrey" the [[camel]] also command high prices.
Some special edition Beanies, such as the #1 Bear or the Billionaire bears (which are only available as gifts to Ty employees), are hard to come across and highly valued.
Earlier editions of common Beanie Babies (particularly with first or second generation hang tags) are often sought-after by collectors. Particular hang tag variations in mint condition continue to make record prices on [[eBay]].

In the hysteria of the late 90s, the bears were perceived to be the most sought-after beanies, and often carried inflated price tags - however, many of the popular bears have since turned out to be fairly common.<ref>{{cite news|title= Beanie Move Giving Rise To Skepticism|work= New York Times|date=1999-09-02|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/02/business/beanie-move-giving-rise-to-skepticism.html?scp=5&sq=beanie%20bears&st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-12 | first=Dana | last=Canedy}}</ref> As of 2010,  the overwhelming majority of Beanie Babies end up in large lots that sell for $2 or less per plush beanbag.<ref>{{cite news|title=8 nearly worthless collectibles|work=MSN|url=http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/SavingandDebt/SaveMoney/8-completely-worthless-collectibles.aspx?cp-documentid=26131547}}</ref>

==Notable Beanie Babies==
===Garcia the bear===
'''Garcia''' the bear was released in January 1996 and retired in May 1997. He is a [[tie-dye]]d bear that seems to be a tribute to [[Jerry Garcia]] of [[The Grateful Dead]]. A group of differently colored dancing bears, originally artwork from the back of an album cover, was one of the band's many iconic images. The guitarist and the bear share a birthday, but the bear was supposedly "born" the year that Jerry died (Aug 9, 1995). The fast retirement for this Beanie Baby was due to an alleged lawsuit that the Garcia family filed against the Ty company, claiming that the name "Garcia" was used without permission from the family. In cooperation with the lawsuit, Garcia was retired and a similar bear named '''Peace''' was released.

The bright colors on Garcia the bear made him one of the most popular Beanie Baby styles. Many people enjoy trying to find different colors on Garcia and community of tie-dye collectors <ref>[http://magazine.peacebears.com/ Peace Mania Magazine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> continue to make the bear's value unpredictable.

===Princess the bear===
[[Diana, Princess of Wales]] died on August 31, 1997. Warner announced the Beanie Baby Princess on October 29, 1997 in honor of Princess Diana.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/05/magazine/sunday-july-5-1998-crime-a-world-gone-beanie-mad.html?scp=2&sq=beanie%20bears&st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=SUNDAY, JULY 5, 1998: CRIME; A World Gone Beanie Mad! | date=1998-07-05}}</ref> Warner said that all proceeds would be donated to the Diana, [[Princess of Wales Memorial Fund]]. The Princess Diana Beanie Baby was sent to vendors to distribute in the second week of December 1997. Some vendors had to wait until February 1998. Only 12 Beanie Baby Princesses were released to each vendor initially, but this changed due to strong demand.

On the other hand, '''Princess''' bears are dark purple. She has a symbol on the right side of her chest which is a rose with white petals on it. '''Princess'''' rear end tag which says her name is special, because it is in a cursive-like font. Some '''Princess''' bears have a heart on their tag protector, if any.

===Decade the bear===
[[File:Decadethebear.JPG|thumb|right|180px|'''Decade''' the bear]]

'''Decade''' the bear was made in honor of Beanie Babies' tenth anniversary. Decade bears were made in white, royal blue, red, purple, orange, hot pink, green, gold, brown, and light blue. Most '''Decade''' bears have silver sparkles on their bodies.

==Counterfeit Beanie Babies==
Counterfeit Beanie Babies began to surface in 1997. Early on, cheap knock-offs and fakes of commons were widely available at discount prices,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&p_theme=cstb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB42371A5477CDA&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM | title=Chicago Sun-Times:: Search | first=SUSAN DODGE | last=Date | date=1998-01-09}}</ref> but when the Beanie craze began to fade, counterfeiters started focusing on rarer releases and country exclusives. Although it is unlikely that people are still manufacturing fakes,{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} older fakes continue to surface on [[eBay]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

===Cases===
The [[FBI]] strictly cracked down on counterfeit beanies in the late 1990s, and some people were prosecuted for direct known involvement in their commerce. For example, a St. Louis Park, MN couple was sentenced to prison, probation, and fines for their involvement in smuggling counterfeit beanies.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62458632.html Couple sentenced for selling counterfeit Beanie Babies.(NEWS) - Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN) - HighBeam Research<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[York]], [[North Yorkshire]], [[England]] authorities seized more than 6000 [[Princess (Beanie Baby)|Princesses]] and Britanniae from a [[Organized crime|ring]].<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19416915.html British authorities seize 6,000 counterfeit Beanie Babies - AP Online - HighBeam Research<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Media==
During the wake of Beanie Babies' success, many Beanie Baby-centric publications were issued. One of the largest was ''[[Mary Beth's Bean Bag World]]'', a monthly magazine dedicated to Beanie Babies and competing plush toys. This magazine ran from 1997 to 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-58151402.html|title=Want The 'Scoop' On The Beanie Industry For The Millennium? |date=1999-12-10|work=PR Newswire|accessdate=2009-05-18}}</ref>

==Licensed Beanies==
In the late 2000s, Beanie Babies modeled after characters from popular children's franchises by [[Nickelodeon (TV network)|Nickelodeon]], [[DreamWorks]] and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] began appearing. These included characters from [[cartoons]] on the Nickelodeon television channel such as ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' and ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'', as well as characters from [[DreamWorks Animation]] movies such as ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' and most recently, 20th Century Fox's [[Ice Age 3|Ice Age: Dawn Of The Dinosaurs]]. They also made beanie babies for the promotion of the Legend of the Guardians movie based on the beloved owl fantasy books by Kathryn Lasky. The owl beanies are Soren, Gylfie, Digger and Eglantine.

==Competitors==
{{Expand section|Other notable competitors|date=June 2009}}
In wake of the toy line's success in the late 1990s, many competing plush toy lines were started. These included [[Puffkins]],<ref name="mbbw1998">{{cite journal|last=Bossmin|first=Lydia|coauthors=Ofelia de los Santos|date=June 1998|title=The New Puffkins Collectibles|journal=Mary Beth's Beanie World|volume=1|issue=5|pages=36–38}}</ref> [[Meanies]],<ref name="meanies1">{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BX&s_site=sunherald&p_multi=BX&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB6252A76E6E20E&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=New Meanies could give Beanie Babies competition|first=1998-03-01|work=The Sun-Herald|pages=F6|accessdate=2009-06-12}}</ref> and various others.<ref>{{cite news|title= NEW YORKERS & CO.; Stuffed Animals With a Bite of Satire|work= New York Times|date=1999-10-24|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/24/nyregion/new-yorkers-co-stuffed-animals-with-a-bite-of-satire.html?scp=6&sq=beanie%20bears&st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-12 | first=Bernard | last=Stamler}}</ref>
