'''The ''Matrix'' series''' consists of 3 films produced by [[Joel Silver]]. ''[[The Matrix]]'' was released in March 1999; after its success, two sequels, ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', were released in 2003. The characters and settings of the Matrix [[fictional universe]] are further explored in other media, including [[animation]], [[comic book]]s, and [[video game]]s.

The series depicts a [[cyberpunk]] story incorporating numerous references to [[philosophy|philosophical]] and religious ideas. Other influences include [[mythology]], [[anime]], and [[Hong Kong action cinema|Hong Kong action films]] (particularly "[[heroic bloodshed]]" and [[martial arts film|martial arts]] movies). The fight choreographer for the trilogy was [[Yuen Wo-ping]].

<!-- On January 24, 2011, it was revealed by Keanu Reeves that the [[Wachowski brothers|Wachowskis]] told him that they completed script treatments for two more "Matrix" installments. They are planning to make the films in 3D and have already met with [[James Cameron]] to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the technology.<ref>http://www.worstpreviews.com/headline.php?id=20424</ref> This, however, turned out to be a hoax.<ref>http://screenrant.com/matrix-4-5-bill-and-ted-3-keanu-reeves-rob-97796</ref>

==Overview==
In the [[dystopia]] the series depicts, Earth is dominated by [[artificial intelligence|sentient machines]]. Humans are grown in pods and are connected by cybernetic implants to an [[Virtual reality|artificial reality]] called the Matrix, which keeps their minds under control while the machines use the [[bioelectricity]] and [[thermal energy]] of their bodies as an energy source.

The virtual reality world simulated by the Matrix resembles human civilization around the turn of the 21st century (this time period was chosen because it is supposedly the pinnacle of human civilization). The majority of the films and games of the ''Matrix'' franchise take place in a vast [[Mega City (The Matrix)|unnamed megacity]], although it is not the only city within the Matrix, as other familiar locations are mentioned and visited by the characters during the trilogy and [[the Animatrix]]. As this environment is practically indistinguishable from reality, except when a slight green tinge appears (becoming more prominent as the series continues), the majority of humans connected to the Matrix are unaware of its true nature. Most of the central characters in the series know that it is not 'real' and as a result can partially bend the simulation's physical laws in order to perform [[superhuman]] feats within the simulation.

The virtual world is first introduced in ''[[The Matrix]]''. The ''[[The Animatrix|Animatrix]]'' short film "[[The Second Renaissance]]", and the short comic [http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/rl_middles1_wachdarrtframe.html "Bits and Pieces of Information"] show how the initial conflict between humans and machines came about, and how and why the Matrix was first developed. Its history and purpose are further explained in ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''.

The films include numerous and varied references to literary, philosophical and religious works.  Notable examples include references to the "White Rabbit" and the "Rabbit Hole", referencing Lewis Carroll's "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" along with the use of a mirror as a portal to another world as explored in Carroll's "Through the Looking Glass".

Biblical and historical references are found in the names of places and vehicles in the Trilogy, such as the "hovercraft" named "Nebuchadnezzar".  Though it is not clear whether this name refers to either of the Babylonian Kings of the same name, or merely shares the literal meaning "Nabu (god of wisdom), preserve/defend my firstborn son", which could refer to the ships role in the protection of "The One".  Another notable name is the City of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]], often used as a [[synecdoche]] for the City of Jerusalem or the land of Israel in Abrahamic religious texts, or to refer to a "[[promised land]]" or [[utopia]].

==Films==
{{Main|The Matrix|The Matrix Reloaded|The Matrix Revolutions}}
The series began with 1999's '''''[[The Matrix]]'''''. The film, directed by the [[Wachowski brothers]] and produced by [[Joel Silver]], was highly successful, earning $460 million worldwide. In addition, by 2000, the DVD release of the film reached three million sales, the first DVD release in [[North America]] to do so.<ref name="dvdsales">''[http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/rl_press_August_01_00.html "Press release - August 1, 2000 - The Matrix DVD: The first to sell 3 million"]. URL retrieved July 26, 2006.</ref>

The film's mainstream success led to the making of two sequels, '''''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''''' and '''''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'''''. These were filmed simultaneously during one [[filmmaking#Production|shoot]], and released in two parts in 2003. The sequels were produced under the project codename "The Burly Man"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/matrix2_pr.html |title=Matrix<sup>2</sup> |author=Steve Silberman |date = May 2003|work=Wired |publisher=Wired Digital/[[Condé Nast Publications]] |accessdate=2010-01-16}}</ref> (which later led to the name of the Wachowski brothers' comic book production company, [[Burlyman Entertainment]]). The first film's introductory tale is succeeded by the story of the impending attack of the human enclave of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]] by a vast machine army. Neo also learns more about the history of the Matrix, his role as the One and the prophecy that he will end the war. The sequels also incorporate longer and more ambitious action scenes, as well as improvements in bullet time and other visual effects.

==Additional media==
===Anime===
{{Main|The Animatrix}}
In acknowledgment of the strong influence of [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] on the ''Matrix'' series, '''''[[The Animatrix]]''''' was produced in 2003. This is a collection of nine [[animation|animated]] short films intended to further flesh out the concepts, history, characters and setting of the series. The objective of ''The Animatrix'' project was to give other writers and directors the opportunity to lend their voices and interpretation to the ''Matrix'' universe; the Wachowski brothers conceived of and oversaw the process, and they wrote four of the segments themselves, although they were given to other directors to execute. Many of the segments were produced by notable figures from the world of Japanese animation. Four of the films were originally released on the series' official website, one was shown in cinemas with ''[[Dreamcatcher (film)|Dreamcatcher]]'', one was shown on MTV, MTV2, MTV3, and MTV4, and the others first appeared with the DVD release of all nine shorts shortly after the release of ''The Matrix Reloaded''.

===Video games===
On May 15, 2003, the game '''''[[Enter the Matrix]]''''' was released in [[North America]] concurrently with ''The Matrix Reloaded''. The first of three video games related to the films, it told a story running parallel to ''The Matrix Reloaded'' and featured scenes shot during the filming of ''The Matrix Reloaded'' and ''The Matrix Revolutions''.

Two more ''Matrix'' video games were released in 2005. The [[MMORPG]] '''''[[The Matrix Online]]''''' continued the story beyond ''The Matrix Revolutions'', while '''''[[The Matrix: Path of Neo]]''''' allowed players to control the series' protagonist Neo in scenes from the film trilogy.

===Comic books===
In addition, several [[comic book]]s and [[short story|short stories]] based on the series &ndash; one written by the Wachowskis, the others by guest writers &ndash; were released on the official website. Many of these have since been collected in two printed volumes of '''''[[The Matrix Comics]]'''''.

==DVD releases==
Over a year after the cinematic release of the final film, ''Revolutions'', Warner Home Video released ''[[The Ultimate Matrix Collection]]'', a 10-Disc DVD set of the films. It included the three films, ''[[The Animatrix]]'', and six discs of additional material. A Limited Edition of the collection encases the ten discs, as well as a resin bust of Neo, inside a Lucite box.

===Critical reaction===
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
While the first film was extremely successful, both critically and popularly, the quality of the sequels is still a matter of debate.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/matrix_revolutions/ Review of Matrix Revolutions]</ref>
''The Matrix Reloaded'' was well received by critics, though the reaction of some viewers has been mixed.

''The Matrix Revolutions'' was received mixed by critics. One major complaint was that it did not give any answers to the questions raised in ''Reloaded''.<ref>[http://www.newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/movies/reviews/n_9482/index1.html New York Metro review of Matrix Revolutions]</ref>

'''''[[The Matrix]]'''''  makes numerous references to recent films and literature, and to historical myths and [[philosophy]] including [[Christianity]], [[Messianism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Existentialism]], [[Nihilism]], [[Vedanta]], [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] [[Hinduism]], [[Yoga Vasishtha|Yoga Vashishta]] and [[Hinduism]]. The film's premise resembles [[Plato|Plato's]] [[Allegory of the cave]], [[René Descartes]]'s [[evil daemon]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s reflections on the [[Phenomenon]] versus the [[Noumenon|Ding an sich]], [[Zhuangzi]]'s "[[Zhuangzi#The butterfly dream|Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly]]", and the [[brain in a vat]] thought experiment, while [[Jean Baudrillard|Jean Baudrillard's]] ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'' is featured in the film.<ref>http://www.ubishops.ca/BaudrillardStudies/vol2_2/rovira.htm</ref> There are similarities to [[cyberpunk]] works such as ''[[Neuromancer]]'' by [[William Gibson]].<ref name="williamgibson">[http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2003_01_01_archive.asp#90244012 "The Matrix: Fair Cop"].

Japanese director [[Mamoru Oshii|Mamoru Oshii's]] ''[[Ghost in the Shell (film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' was a strong influence. Producer [[Joel Silver]] has stated that the Wachowski brothers first described their intentions for ''The Matrix'' by showing him that anime and saying, "We wanna do that for real".<ref name="silver-anime-1">[[Joel Silver]], interviewed in "Scrolls to Screen: A Brief History of Anime" featurette on ''[[The Animatrix]]'' DVD.</ref><ref name="silver-anime-2">[[Joel Silver]], interviewed in "Making ''The Matrix''" featurette on ''The Matrix'' DVD.</ref> [[Mitsuhisa Ishikawa]] of [[Production I.G]], which produced ''Ghost in the Shell'', noted that the anime's high-quality visuals were a strong source of inspiration for the Wachowski brothers. He also commented, "... cyberpunk films are very difficult to describe to a third person. I'd imagine that ''The Matrix'' is the kind of film that was very difficult to draw up a written proposal for to take to film studios." He stated that since ''Ghost in the Shell'' had gained recognition in America, the Wachowski brothers used it as a "promotional tool".<ref name="south bank show">[[Mitsuhisa Ishikawa]], interviewed in ''[[The South Bank Show]]'', episode broadcast 19 February 2006 [http://www.itv.com/page.asp?partid=2701]</ref> Besides ''Ghost in the Shell'', another Japanese [[anime]] which influenced ''The Matrix'' was the 1985 film ''[[Megazone 23]]'', directed by [[Noboru Ishiguro]] and [[Shinji Aramaki]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Megazone 23|publisher=[[A.D. Vision]]|url=http://www25.advfilms.com/titles/megazone|accessdate=2008-05-05}}</ref> An American adaptation of ''Megazone 23'' was released in 1986 as ''[[Robotech: The Movie]]''. There are also several more Japanese [[anime]] and [[manga]] that can be found as sources of influence.<ref>Influenced pictures for Matrix from anime and manga: [http://beyondsilence.uw.hu/manimgyok.html], [http://beyondsilence.uw.hu/matrixgyok2.html]</ref>

Reviewers have commented on similarities between ''The Matrix'' and other late-1990s films such as ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]'', ''[[Dark City (1998 film)|Dark City]]'', and ''[[The Truman Show]]''.<ref name="rogerebert">[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990331/REVIEWS/903310303/1023 Roger Ebert's review of ''The Matrix''].

URL retrieved 21 August 2006.</ref><ref name="cinephobia review">[http://www.cinephobia.com/matrix.htm "Cinephobia reviews: The Matrix"]. URL retrieved 27 December 2006.</ref> Comparisons have also been made to [[Grant Morrison]]'s comic series ''[[The Invisibles]]''; Morrison believes that the Wachowski brothers essentially plagiarized his work to create the film.<ref name="grantmorrison">[http://www.poormojo.org/pmjadaily/archives/002657.html "Poor Mojo Newswire: Suicide Girls Interview with Grant Morrison]". URL retrieved 31 July 2006.</ref> In addition, the similarity of the film's central concept to a device in the long running series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' has also been noted. As in the film, the [[Matrix (Doctor Who)|Matrix]] of that series (introduced in the 1976 serial ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'') is a massive computer system which one enters using a device connecting to the head, allowing users to see representations of the real world and change its laws of physics; but if killed there, they will die in reality.<ref>Condon, Paul. ''The Matrix Unlocked''. 2003. Contender. p.141-3. ISBN 1-84357-093-9</ref>  There is also a similar "Matrix" used by the Travellers in [[Paul Cornell]]'s 1992 ''Doctor Who'' spin-off novel [[Love and War (Doctor Who)|Love and War]], in which a socket at the top of the spine is used to plug into the Matrix.

The film also shares many ideas with [[Grant Morrison]]'s [[Counterculture|counter-culture]] comic book ''[[The Invisibles]]'' and Morrison states that the comic book could be found in the film's settings. However, most of the similarities between the two works can be, probably, explained by the common influence received from the works of [[Carlos Castaneda]]<ref>http://www.consciencia.org/castaneda/castaneda-matrix.html</ref><ref>http://www.barbelith.com/topic/7699</ref><ref>http://www.barbelith.com/bomb/1_2.htm</ref><ref>http://www.manwithoutfear.com/messageboard/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=2223&view=previous&sid=78ca2f9aa26ea99f11b8c37ded719933</ref> that is fairly obvious and extensive in the first film and in the volume I of the comic book.<ref>http://groups.google.com.br/group/rec.arts.comics.dc.vertigo/browse_thread/thread/dbb72191f2048789/50f9a3c7ac5a473d?hl=pt-BR&q=morrison+carlos+castaneda+invisibles</ref> Morrison acknowledged the influence though he, indeed, believes in the debt of the Wachowski's brothers to his work. The "inheritance chain" here is a problem of difficult solution since the borrowings were, in both cases, quite literal and similar.

There are still numerous other influences from diverse sources such as [[Harlan Ellison]] ([[I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream]]),<ref name="livejournal1">http://community.livejournal.com/theinferior4/466611.html</ref> [[Thomas Pynchon]] ([[The Crying of Lot 49]]),<ref name="livejournal1"/> and [[William Gibson]] ([[Neuromancer]]).<ref name="gibson">http://www.cla.purdue.edu/English/theory/postmodernism/plans/postmodplansmatrix.html</ref>

===Matrixism===
Matrixism or The Path Of The One is a new  religious movement inspired by the motion picture trilogy The Matrix. The [[Sociologist of religion|Sociologist of Religion]] [[Adam Possamai]] describes these types of religions/spiritualities as [[Hyper-Real Religion|hyper-real religions]] due to their eclectic mix of religion/spirituality with elements of [[popular culture]] and their connection to the fluid [[social structures]] of [[late capitalism]].<ref>{{Cite web| author=[[Adam Possamai|Possamai, Adam]] | year=2005 | title= Religion and Popular Culture: A Hyper-Real Testament | publisher= ''[[Peter Lang (publishing company)|Peter Lang]]'' | url=http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.cst.ebooks.datasheet&id=14609 | accessdate=2011-01-03}}</ref> Conceived by an anonymous group in the summer of 2004 it claims to have attracted 300 members by May 2005, and the religion's Geocities website currently claims "over sixteen hundred members". There is some debate about whether followers of Matrixism are indeed serious about their practice; however, the religion (real or otherwise) has received attention in the media.<ref name="gm">{{Cite web| author= Morris, Linda | date=May 19, 2005 | title= They're all God Movies| publisher= NPR|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Theyre-all-god-movies/2005/05/18/1116361618786.html| accessdate=2010-09-06}}</ref><ref name="sun">{{Cite web| author=Kasriel, Alex | year=2006 | title= The joy of sects| publisher= ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' | url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,5-2005590116,00.html | accessdate=2010-09-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/080615/Mirror/mirror006.html|title= Behind Matrixism|author=Kotelawala, Himal|publisher= The Sunday Times Sri Lanka|date=14 June 2008|accessdate=2010-09-06}}</ref>

Matrixism is described by its founders as a syncretic or ecumenical religion. Though Matrixists cite references to "the matrix" from a text of the Bahá'í Faith, called "The Promulgation of Universal Peace", to make a connection with broader world religious history, the commercial Matrix trilogy, along with related mass media products such as video games, is generally considered to be the "sacred text" of the movement.

Matrixism carries with it four main beliefs that are described as "The Four Tenets of Matrixism".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newmatrixism.com/tenets |title=The Tenets of Matrixism |publisher=NewMatrixism.com |accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref> Briefly these are: belief in a messianic prophecy, use of psychedelics as sacrament, a perception of reality as multi-layered and semi-subjective, and adherence to the principles of at least one of the world's major religions. The Matrixism website singles out April 19 as a holiday - known as Bicycle Day, April 19 marks the anniversary of [[Albert Hofmann]]'s 1943 experiment with LSD.<ref>{{Cite web|author=by Erowid |url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd_dose.shtml |title=Erowid LSD Vault : Dosage |publisher=Erowid.org |date=2009-03-18 |accessdate=2009-11-16}}</ref>

The adopted symbol for Matrixism is the Japanese Kanji symbol for "red".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://japanese.about.com/library/blkod48.htm |title=How to write red in japanese |publisher=About.com |accessdate=October 9, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kanjisymbol.net/mean/red.html |title=kanji Symbol-red |publisher=KanjiSymbol.net |accessdate=October 9, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newmatrixism.com/faq |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=NewMatrixism.com |accessdate=October 9, 2010}}</ref> This symbol was used in the video game Enter the Matrix.
