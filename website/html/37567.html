<html> <head> <title>Theory of two-level planning</title></head><body>The '''Theory of two-level planning''', better known in the West as the '''Kornai-Liptak decomposition''', is a method for the decomposition of large [[Linear programming|linear programs]] into sub-problems so as to make the solution of the overall problem easier.  It provides a model of how economic decisions might be decentralized and yet coordinated so as to achieve a global optimum.  It was introduced by the Hungarian economist [[János Kornai]] and the mathematician Tamás Lipták in 1965.  It is an alternative to [[Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition]].
