<html> <head> <title>Frame (artificial intelligence)</title></head><body>'''Frames''' were proposed by [[Marvin Minsky]] in his 1974 article "A Framework for Representing Knowledge." A frame is an [[artificial intelligence]] [[data structure]] used to divide [[knowledge]] into substructures by representing "[[stereotype]]d situations." Frames are connected together to form a complete [[idea]].

== Frame structure ==

The frame contains information on how to use the frame, what to expect next, and what to do when these expectations are not met. Some information in the frame is generally unchanged while other information, stored in "terminals,"{{clarify|date=January 2010|reason=Which type of 'terminal' is meant?}} usually change. Different frames may share the same terminals.

A frame's terminals are already filled with default values, which is based on how the human mind works. For example, when a person is told "a boy kicks a ball," most people will be able to visualize a particular ball (such as a familiar [[soccer ball]]) rather than imagining some abstract ball with no attributes.
