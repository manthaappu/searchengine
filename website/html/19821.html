'''Jean-Raymond Abrial''' (born 1938) is a [[France|French]] computer scientist and inventor of the [[Z notation|Z]] and [[B-Method|B]] [[formal methods]].

J.-R. Abrial is the father of the [[Z notation]] (typically used for [[formal specification]] of software), during his time at the [[Programming Research Group]] within the [[Oxford University Computing Laboratory]], and later the [[B-Method]] (normally used for software development), two leading [[formal methods]] for [[software engineering]]. He is the author of ''The B-Book: Assigning Programs to Meanings'' (ISBN 0-521-49619-5). For much of his career he has been an independent consultant, as much at home working with industry as academia. Currently he is a [[Professor]] at [[ETH Zurich]] in [[Switzerland]].
