In some [[computer security]] systems, a '''Ticket Granting Ticket''' ('''TGT''') is a small, [[encryption|encrypted]] identification file with a limited validity period. After [[authentication]], this file is granted to a user for data traffic protection by the [[key distribution center]] (KDC) subsystem of authentication services like [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]]. The TGT file contains the [[session key]], its expiration date, and the user's [[IP address]], which protects the user from [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s.
