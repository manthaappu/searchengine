{{nihongo|'''Go'''|[[Japanese language|Japanese]]:碁}}, known in Chinese as <strong>weiqi</strong> ([[simplified Chinese]]: [[wikt:围|围]][[wikt:棋|棋]]; [[traditional Chinese]]: [[wikt:圍|圍]][[wikt:棋|棋]]; [[pinyin]]: wéiqí; [[Wade-Giles]]: wei ch'i) and in Korean as '''baduk''' ([[hangul]]: {{lang|ko|바둑}}), is an ancient [[board game]] for two players that is noted for being rich in strategy despite its relatively simple [[Rules of Go|rules]].

The game is played by two players who alternately place black and white stones on the vacant intersections of a [[grid graph|grid]] of 19×19 lines. Once placed on the board, stones cannot be moved elsewhere, unless they are surrounded and captured by the opponent's stones. The object of the game is to secure (surround) a larger portion of the board than the opponent.  When a game concludes, the controlled spaces are counted by their respective players to determine which portion is the largest, as territory size is not easily apparent during play.

Placing stones close together helps them support each other and avoid capture; groups of stones must have two liberties (open points) to be "alive." On the other hand, placing stones far apart creates influence across more of the board. Part of the strategic difficulty of the game stems from finding a balance between such conflicting interests. Players strive to serve both defensive and offensive purposes and choose between tactical urgency and strategic plans. At its basis, the game is one of simple logic, while in advanced play the game involves complex heuristics and tactical analysis. 

Go originated in [[ancient China]] well before the 3rd century BC (exactly when is unknown), by which time it was already a popular pastime, as indicated by a reference to the game in the [[Analects of Confucius]]. Archaeological evidence shows that the early game was played on a board with a 17×17 grid, but by the time that the game spread to Korea and Japan in about the 7th century, boards with a 19×19 grid had become standard.

The game is most popular in East Asia. A conservative estimate places the number of Go players worldwide at approximately 27 million.<ref>[http://osdir.com/ml/games.devel.go/2003-01/msg00040.html Osdir.com]</ref>  Go reached the West through Japan, which is why it is commonly known internationally by its Japanese name.<ref group="nb">The full Japanese name ''igo'' is derived from its Chinese name ''weiqi'', which roughly translates as "board game of surrounding", see [http://senseis.xmp.net/?EtymologyOfGo Etymology Of Go] at Sensei's Library for more information. To differentiate it from the common English verb ''[[go (verb)|to go]]'', it is sometimes capitalized or, in events sponsored by the [[Ing Chang-ki|Ing]] Foundation, spelled '''goe'''.</ref>

==Rules==
{{main|Rules of Go}}

Although there are some minor differences between rule sets used in different countries,<ref name=RulesComparison>{{Citation | url = http://www.britgo.org/rules/compare.html | title = Comparison of some go rules | author = British Go Association | accessdate = 2007-12-20 }}</ref> most notably in Chinese and Japanese scoring rules,<ref>{{Citation | url=http://nrich.maths.org/public/viewer.php?obj_id=1470 | publisher = University of Cambridge | author = NRICH Team | title = Going First | accessdate = 2007-06-16 }}</ref> these differences do not seriously affect the tactics and strategy of the game. Except where noted otherwise, the basic rules presented here are valid independent of the scoring rules used. The scoring rules are explained separately. [[Go terms|Go concepts]] for which there is no ready English equivalent are commonly called by their Japanese names.

===Basic rules===
[[Image:Go adjacent stones.png|thumb|right|One black chain and two white chains, their liberties shown with dots. Note that liberties are shared among all stones of a chain.]]

Two players, ''Black'' and ''White'', take turns placing a ''stone'' (game piece) of their own color on a vacant ''point'' (intersection) of the grid on a Go board. Black moves first. If there is a large difference in skill between the players, Black is sometimes allowed to place two or more stones on the board for their first move - see [[Go handicaps]] for details. The official grid comprises 19×19 lines, though the rules can be applied to any grid size; 13×13<!-- Measurement unit(s) needed--> and 9×9 are popular choices to teach beginners.<ref>Kim 1994 pp. 3–4</ref> Once placed, a stone may not be moved to a different point.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = [[Nihon Kiin]] | url = http://www.nihonkiin.or.jp/lesson/school-e/okikata-e.htm | title = How to place Go stones | accessdate = 2007-03-04}}</ref>

Vertically and horizontally adjacent stones of the same color form a ''chain'' (also called a ''string'') that shares its [[Go terms#Liberty .28.E6.B0.94.29|liberties]] (see below) in common, cannot subsequently be subdivided, and in effect becomes a single larger stone.<ref>{{citation | url = http://nrich.maths.org/public/viewer.php?obj_id=1433 | title = Behind the Rules of Go | last = Matthews  | first = Charles | publisher = University of Cambridge | accessdate = 2008-06-09}}</ref> Only stones connected to one another by the lines on the board create a chain; stones that are diagonally adjacent are not connected. Chains may be expanded by placing additional stones on adjacent intersections, and can be connected together by placing a stone on an intersection that is adjacent to two or more chains of the same color.
[[Image:Go capturing.png|thumb|left|If white plays at A, the black chain loses its last liberty. It is captured and removed from the board.]]

A vacant point adjacent to a stone is called a ''liberty'' for that stone.<ref>Kim 1994 p. 12</ref><ref group="nb">Compare "[[liberty (division)|liberty]]", a small local government unit in medieval England – the "local area under control".</ref> Stones in a chain share their liberties. A chain of stones must have at least one liberty to remain on the board. When a chain is surrounded by opposing stones so that it has no liberties, it is ''captured'' and removed from the board.

Most rule sets do not allow a player to place a stone in such a way that one of their own chains is left without liberties, subject to the following important exception.<ref>Kim 1994 p. 28</ref> The rule does not apply if playing the new stone results in the capture of one or more of the opponent's stones. In this case, the opponent's stones are captured first, leaving the newly played stone at least one liberty.<ref>Kim 1994 p. 30</ref> The rule just stated is said to prohibit ''suicide''. (Since suicide is very rarely useful, making it legal does not significantly alter the nature of the game.)

<div class="thumbcaption" style="font-size: 88%;">
An example of a situation in which the ko rule applies
</div>
</div>
</div>

Players are not allowed to make a move that returns the game to a previous position. This rule, called the ''[[Rules of Go#Ko|ko rule]]'' (from the Japanese 劫 ''kō'' "eon"), prevents unending repetition.<ref name=ko>Kim 1994 pp 48–49</ref> See the example to the right: Black has just played the stone marked '''1''', capturing a white stone at the intersection marked with a circle. If White were now allowed to play on the marked intersection, that move would capture the black stone marked '''1''' and recreate the situation before Black made the move marked '''1'''. Allowing this could result in an unending cycle of captures by both players. The ko rule therefore prohibits White from playing at the marked intersection immediately. Instead White must play elsewhere; Black can then end the ko by filling at the marked intersection, creating a five-stone Black chain. If White wants to continue the ko, White will try to find a play that Black must answer; if Black answers, then White can retake the ko. A repetition of such exchanges is called a ''ko fight''.<ref name="Ko">Kim 1994 pp. 144–147</ref>

While the various rule sets agree on the ko rule prohibiting returning the board to an ''immediately'' previous position, they deal in different ways with the relatively uncommon situation in which a player might recreate a past position that is further removed. See [[Rules of Go#Repetition|Rules of Go: Repetition]] for further information.

Instead of placing a stone, a player may ''pass''. This usually occurs when they believe no useful moves remain. When both players pass consecutively, the game ends and is then [[Rules of Go#End|scored]].

===Scoring rules===

There are two basic scoring systems used to determine the winner at the end of a game; they almost always give the same result. ''Territory scoring'' counts the number of empty points your stones surround, together with the number of stones you captured. While it originated in China, today it is commonly associated with Japan and Korea. ''Area scoring'' counts the number of points your stones occupy and surround. It is associated with contemporary Chinese play and was probably established there during the [[Ming Dynasty]] in the 15th or 16th century.<ref>{{citation | title = New in Go | chapter = The Rules Debate | last = Fairbairn | first = John | url = http://www.gogod.co.uk/NewInGo/NewInGo.htm | chapterurl = http://www.gogod.co.uk/NewInGo/C&IP.htm | publisher = Games of Go on Disc | accessdate = 2007-11-27}}</ref>

====Detailed description====
After both players have passed consecutively, the stones that are still on the board but  unable to avoid capture, called ''dead'' stones, are removed. (When both sides have passed, skilled players will nearly always agree which stones are dead and which are alive.)

'''Area scoring (including Chinese):''' A player's score is the number of stones they have on the board, plus the number of empty intersections surrounded by that player's stones.

'''Territory scoring (including Japanese and Korean):''' In the course of the game, each player retains the stones they capture, termed ''prisoners''. Any dead stones removed at the end of the game become prisoners. The score is the number of empty points enclosed by a player's stones, plus the number of prisoners captured by that player.<ref group="nb">Exceptionally, in Japanese and Korean rules, empty points, even those surrounded by stones of a single colour, may count as neutral territory if some of them are alive by ''seki''. See the section on "Life and Death" for seki.</ref>

If there is disagreement about which stones are dead, then under area scoring rules, the players simply resume play to resolve the matter. The score is computed using the position after the next time the players pass consecutively. Under territory scoring, the rules are considerably more complex; however, in practice, players will generally play on, and, once the status of each stone has been determined, return to the position at the time the first two consecutive passes occurred and remove the dead stones. For further information, see [[Rules of Go]].

Given that the number of stones a player has on the board is related to the number of prisoners the opponent has taken, the resulting ''net'' score (the difference between Black and White's respective scores) under both rulesets is often identical and rarely differs by more than a point.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wjh/go/rules/AGA.commentary.html | title = Demonstration of the Relationship of Area and Territory Scoring | first = Fred | last = Hansen | publisher = American Go Association | accessdate = 2008-06-16}}</ref>

===Life and death===
{{see also|Life and death}}
While not actually mentioned in the rules of Go (at least in simpler rule sets, such as those of New Zealand and the US), the concept of a ''living'' group of stones is necessary for a practical understanding of the game.<ref name=EyesSeki>Matthews 2002</ref>

When a group of stones is mostly surrounded and has no options to connect with friendly stones elsewhere, the status of the group is either ''alive'', ''dead'' or ''unsettled''. A group of stones is said to be alive if it cannot be captured, even if the opponent is allowed to move first. Conversely, a group of stones is said to be dead if it cannot avoid capture, even if the owner of the group is allowed the first move. If the status of a group depends on whether the owner or his opponent moves first, the group is said to be unsettled. In such a situation, the player that moves first may either make it alive if he is the owner, or ''kill'' it if he is the group owner's opponent.<ref name=EyesSeki/>

For a group to be alive, it needs to be able to create at least two "[[Go terms#Eyes|eyes]]" if threatened. An eye is an empty point that is surrounded by friendly stones and where the opponent can never play due to the suicide rule. If two such eyes exist, the opponent can never capture a group of stones, because it will always have at least two liberties. One eye is not enough for life, because a point that would normally be suicide may be played upon if doing so fills the last liberty of opposing stones, thereby capturing those stones. In the "Examples of eyes" diagram, all the circled points are eyes. The two black groups in the upper corners are alive, as both have at least two eyes. The groups in the lower corners are dead, as both have only one eye. The group in the lower left may seem to have two eyes, but the surrounded empty point without a circle is not actually an eye. White can play there and take a black stone. Such a point is often called a ''false'' eye.<ref name=EyesSeki/>

There is a rare exception to the requirement that a group must have two eyes to be alive, a situation called ''seki'' (or ''mutual life''). Where different coloured groups are adjacent and share liberties, the situation may reach a position when neither player wants to move first, because doing so would allow the opponent to capture; such situations therefore remain on the board.<ref group="nb">In game theoretical terms, seki positions are an example of a [[Nash equilibrium]].</ref> Sekis can occur in many ways. The simplest are: (1) each player has a group without eyes and they share two liberties, and (2) each player has a group with one eye and they share one more liberty. In the "Example of seki (mutual life)" diagram, the circled points are liberties shared by both a black and a white group. Neither player wants to play on a circled point, because doing so would allow the opponent to capture. All the other groups in this example, both black and white, are alive with at least two eyes. Sekis are unusual, but can result from an attempt by one player to invade and kill a nearly settled group of the other player.<ref name=EyesSeki/>

==History==
{{main|History of Go}}

===Origin in China===
[[Image:Anonymous-Astana Graves Wei Qi Player.jpg|thumb|right|Woman Playing Go (Tang Dynasty ca. 744) Discovered at the [[Astana Graves]].]]

The earliest written reference to the game is generally recognized as the historical annal ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]''<ref name=ZhuoZhuan>Potter 1985; Fairbairn 1995</ref> (c. 4th century BC),<ref name=chronology2>Brooks 2007</ref> referring to a historical event of 548 BC. It is also mentioned in Book XVII of the ''[[Analects of Confucius]]'' (c. 3rd century BC)<ref name=chronology2/> and in two books written by [[Mencius]]<ref name=Confucius>Potter 1984; Fairbairn 1995</ref> (c. 3rd century BC).<ref name=chronology2/> In all of these works, the game is referred to as {{transl|zh|ISO|''yì''}} ({{lang|zh-Hant|弈}}). Today, in China, it is known as '''''weiqi''''' ({{zh|t=圍棋|s=围棋|p=wéiqí|w=wei ch'i}}), literally the "encirclement board game".

Go was originally played on a 17×17 line grid, but a 19×19 grid became standard by the time of the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907).<ref>Fairbairn 1995</ref> Legends trace the origin of the game to [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperor]] [[Emperor Yao|Yao]] (2337–2258 BC), said to have had his counselor [[Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun]] design it for his unruly son, Danzhu to favorably influence him.<ref>{{cite book|last=Yang|first=Lihui|title=Handbook of Chinese mythology|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO Ltd|isbn=978-1576078068|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wf40ofEMGzIC&pg=PA228&dq=Yao+is+said+to+have+invented+the+game+of+Weiqi&hl=en&ei=lAfVTIruBdO3hAfCuIjVBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&sqi=2&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false|coauthors=Deming An, Jessica Anderson Turner|page=228}}</ref> Other theories suggest that the game was derived from Chinese tribal warlords and generals, who used pieces of stone to map out attacking positions.<ref name=Origin>Masayoshi 2005; Lasker 1934</ref>

In China, Go was perceived as the popular game of the [[aristocracy]], while [[Xiangqi]] (Chinese chess) was the game of the masses. Go was considered one of the [[Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar|four cultivated arts]] of the [[Junzi|Chinese scholar gentleman]], along with [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[Chinese painting|painting]] and playing the musical instrument [[guqin]].<ref name=FourAccomp>Pickard 1989</ref>

===Spread to Japan and Korea===
Go was introduced to both Japan and Korea sometime between the 5th and 7th centuries AD, and was popular among the higher classes. In Korea, the game is called '''''baduk''''' ([[hangul]]: {{lang|ko|바둑}}), and a variant of the game called [[Sunjang baduk]] was developed by the 16th century. Sunjang baduk became the main variant played in Korea until the end of the 19th century.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://english.baduk.or.kr/sub01_01.htm?menu=f11 | publisher = Korean Baduk Association | title = History of Korean baduk | accessdate = 2008-11-13}}</ref><ref name=histKorea>Fairbairn 2000</ref>

[[Image:Korean Game from the Carpenter Collection, ca. 1910-1920.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Korean players, in traditional dress, play in a photograph dated between 1910 and 1920.]]

In Japan—where it is called {{nihongo|'''''go'''''|碁|}} or {{nihongo|'''''igo'''''|囲碁|}}—the game became popular at the Japanese imperial court in the 8th century,<ref name=HistJapan2>{{Citation | url = http://www.nihonkiin.or.jp/lesson/knowledge-e/history02.htm | publisher = [[Nihon Kiin]] | title = History of Go in Japan: part 2 | accessdate = 2007-11-02}}</ref> and among the general public by the 13th century.<ref name=HistJapan3>{{Citation | url = http://www.nihonkiin.or.jp/lesson/knowledge-e/history03.htm | publisher = [[Nihon Kiin]] |title = History of Go in Japan: part 3 | accessdate = 2007-11-02}}</ref> In 1603, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] re-established Japan's unified national government.

===Go in the West===
Despite its widespread popularity in East Asia, Go has been slow to spread to the rest of the world. Although there are some mentions of the game in western literature from the 16th century forward, Go did not start to become popular in the West until the end of the 19th century, when German scientist [[Oskar Korschelt]] wrote a treatise on the game.<ref name=GoHistEU>{{citation | last = Pinckard | first = William | title = History and Philosophy of Go | year = 1992}} in Bozulich, 2001 pp. 23–25</ref> By the early 20th century, Go had spread throughout the [[German Empire|German]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] empires. In 1905, [[Edward Lasker]] learned the game while in Berlin. When he moved to New York, Lasker founded the New York Go Club together with (amongst others) Arthur Smith, who had learned of the game while touring the East and had published the book ''The Game of Go'' in 1908.<ref name=agahbk95>{{Citation | url = http://www.usgo.org/archive/agahbk95.html | title = AGA 1995 Historical Book | publisher = American Go Association | accessdate = 2008-06-11 }}</ref> Lasker's book ''Go and Go-moku'' (1934) helped spread the game throughout the US,<ref name=agahbk95/> and in 1935, the American Go Association was formed. Two years later, in 1937, the German Go Association was founded.

[[World War II]] put a stop to most Go activity, but after the war, Go continued to spread.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://web.archive.org/web/20041011000303/www.yomiuri.co.jp/igo_e/040.htm | title = The Magic of Go - 40.

==Equipment==
{{main|Go equipment}}
[[Image:Go-tisch.png|thumb|A traditional Japanese set, with floor board (碁盤 ''goban''), bowls (碁笥 ''goke'') and stones (碁石 ''goishi'')]]
It is possible to play Go with a simple paper board and coins or plastic tokens for the stones. More popular midrange equipment includes cardstock, a [[laminate]]d [[particle board]], or wood boards with stones of plastic or glass. More expensive traditional materials are still used by many players.  The most expensive Go sets have black stones carved from slate and white stones carved from translucent white shells.

===Traditional equipment===
====Boards====
The [[Go equipment#Board|Go board]] (generally referred to by its Japanese name ''goban'') typically measures between {{convert|45|and|48|cm|abbr=on}} in length (from one player's side to the other) and {{convert|42|to|44|cm|abbr=on}} in width. Chinese boards are slightly larger, as a traditional Chinese Go stone is slightly larger to match. The board is not square; there is a 15:14 ratio in length to width, because with a perfectly square board, from the player's viewing angle the perspective creates a foreshortening of the board. The added length compensates for this.<ref name="EquipSize">Fairbairn 1992 pp. 142–143</ref> There are two main types of boards: a table board similar in most respects to other game boards like that used for chess, and a floor board, which is its own free-standing table and at which the players sit.

The traditional Japanese ''goban'' is between {{convert|10|and|18|cm|abbr=on}} thick and has legs; it sits on the floor (see picture to right).<ref name="EquipSize"/> It is preferably made from the rare golden-tinged [[Torreya nucifera|Kaya]] tree (''Torreya nucifera''), with the very best made from Kaya trees up to 700 years old. More recently, the related [[Torreya californica|California Torreya]] (''Torreya californica'') has been prized for its light color and pale rings, as well as its less expensive and more readily available stock. The natural resources of Japan have been unable to keep up with the enormous demand for the slow-growing Kaya trees; both ''T. nucifera'' and ''T. californica'' take many hundreds of years to grow to the necessary size, and they are now extremely rare, raising the price of such equipment tremendously.<ref name="EquipWood"/> As Kaya trees are a protected species in Japan, they cannot be harvested until they have died. Thus, an old-growth, floor-standing Kaya ''goban'' can easily cost in excess of US$10,000 with the highest-quality examples costing more than $60,000.<ref name=kayaprice>{{citation | url=http://www.kiseido.com/clearance.htm | title = Kiseido clearance sale}} lists the regular price for a Shihomasa Kaya Go Board with legs ({{convert|20.4|cm|abbr=on|disp=or}} thick) as $60,000+</ref>

Other, less expensive woods often used to make quality table boards in both Chinese and Japanese dimensions include [[Thujopsis|Hiba]] (''Thujopsis dolabrata''), [[Katsura tree|Katsura]] (''Cercidiphyllum japonicum''), [[Agathis|Kauri]] (''Agathis''), and Shin Kaya (various varieties of [[spruce]], commonly from Alaska, Siberia and China's [[Yunnan Province]]).<ref name="EquipWood">Fairbairn 1992 pp. 143–149</ref> So-called ''Shin Kaya'' is a potentially confusing merchant's term: ''shin'' means "new", and thus ''shin kaya'' is best translated "faux kaya", because the woods so described are biologically unrelated to Kaya.<ref name="EquipWood"/>

====Stones====
A full set of Go stones (''goishi'') usually contains 181 black stones and 180 white ones; a 19×19 grid has 361 points, so there are enough stones to cover the board, and Black gets the extra odd stone because that player goes first. 

Traditional Japanese stones are double-convex, and made of [[clam]]shell (white) and [[slate]] (black).<ref name="EquipStones">Fairbairn 1992 pp. 150–153</ref> The classic slate is nachiguro stone mined in [[Wakayama Prefecture]] and the clamshell from the Hamaguri clam; however, due to a scarcity in the Japanese supply of this clam, the stones are most often made of shells harvested from [[Mexico]].<ref name="EquipStones"/> Historically, the most prized stones were made of [[jade]], often given to the reigning emperor as a gift.<ref name="EquipStones"/>  

In China, the game is traditionally played with single-convex stones<ref name="EquipStones"/> made of a composite called [[Yunzi]]. The material comes from Yunnan Province and is made by [[sintering]] a proprietary and trade-secret mixture of mineral compounds. This process dates to the Tang Dynasty and, after the knowledge was lost in the 1920s during the [[Chinese Civil War]], was rediscovered in the 1960s by the now state-run Yunzi company. The material is praised for its colors, its pleasing sound as compared to glass or to synthetics such as [[melamine]], and its lower cost as opposed to other materials such as slate/shell. The term "yunzi" can also refer to a single-convex stone made of any material; however, most English-language Go suppliers will specify Yunzi as a material and single-convex as a shape to avoid confusion, as stones made of Yunzi are also available in double-convex while synthetic stones can be either shape.

Traditional stones are made so that black stones are slightly larger in diameter than white; this is to compensate for the optical illusion created by contrasting colors that would make equal-sized white stones appear larger on the board than black stones.<ref name="EquipStones"/><ref group="nb">See [[Overshoot (typography)|Overshoot]] in Western typography for similar subtle adjustment to create a uniform appearance.</ref>

[[Image:Bowls dwindsor.jpg|thumb|left|An example of single-convex stones and ''Go Seigen'' bowls. These particular stones are made of [[Yunzi]] material, and the bowls of jujube wood.]]

====Bowls====

The bowls for the stones are shaped like a flattened sphere with a level underside.<ref name="EquipBowls">Fairbairn 1992 pp. 153–155</ref> The lid is loose fitting and upturned before play to receive stones captured during the game. Chinese bowls are slightly larger, and a little more rounded, a style known generally as ''Go Seigen''; Japanese ''Kitani'' bowls tend to have a shape closer to that of the bowl of a [[snifter]] glass, such as for [[brandy]]. The bowls are usually made of turned wood. [[Rosewood]] is the traditional material for Japanese bowls, but is very expensive; wood from the Chinese [[jujube]] date tree, which has a lighter color (it is often stained) and slightly more visible grain pattern, is a common substitute for rosewood, and traditional for Go Seigen-style bowls. Other traditional materials used for making Chinese bowls include [[lacquer]]ed wood, [[ceramics]], stone and woven straw or [[rattan]]. The names of the bowl shapes, Go Seigen and Kitani, pay homage to two 20th-century professional Go players by the same names, of Chinese and Japanese nationality, respectively, who are referred to as the "Fathers of modern Go".<ref name="msoworld.com">{{Citation | first = John | last = Fairbairn | url = http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/history/jowa.html | title = Jowa - Sage or Scoundrel | accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref>

====Modern and low-cost alternatives====
In clubs and at tournaments, where large numbers of sets must be purchased and maintained by one organization, expensive traditional sets are not usually used. For these situations, table boards are usually used instead of floor boards, and are either made of a lower-cost wood such as spruce or bamboo, or are flexible mats made of [[vinyl]] that can be rolled up. In such cases, the stones are usually made of glass, plastic or resin (such as melamine or [[Bakelite]]) rather than slate and shell. Bowls are often made of plastic, sometimes of inexpensive wood.

Common "novice" Go sets are all-inclusive kits made of particle board or [[plywood]], with plastic or glass stones, that either fold up to enclose the stone containers or have pull-out drawers to keep stones. In relative terms, these sets are inexpensive, costing  US$20–$40 depending on component quality, and thus are popular with casual Go players. Magnetic sets are also available, either as portable travel sets or in larger sizes for educational purposes.

===Playing technique and etiquette===
[[Image:Playing weiqi in Shanghai.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A pair of [[Shanghainese people|Shanghainese]] men demonstrate the traditional technique of holding a stone.]]

The traditional way to place a Go stone is to first take one from the bowl, gripping it between the index and middle fingers, with the middle finger on top, and then placing it directly on the desired intersection.<ref name="style">{{Citation | publisher = [[Nihon Ki-in]] | url = http://www.nihonkiin.or.jp/lesson/knowledge-e/uchikata-e.htm | title = A stylish way to play your stones | accessdate = 2007-02-24}}</ref> It is considered respectful towards one's opponent to place one's first stone  in the upper right-hand corner.<ref>[http://senseis.xmp.net/?PlayingTheFirstMoveInTheUpperRightCorner Sensei's Library: Playing the first move in the upper right corner]</ref> It is permissible to emphasize select moves by striking the board more firmly than normal, thus producing a sharp clack.

===Time control===
{{see also|Time control|Byoyomi}}

A game of Go may be timed using a [[game clock]]. Formal time controls were introduced into the professional game during the 1920s and were controversial.<ref>Bozulich 2001 pp. 92–93</ref> Adjournments and [[sealed move]]s began to be regulated in the 1930s. Go tournaments use a number of different time control systems. All common systems envisage a single main period of time for each player for the game, but they vary on the protocols for continuation (in ''overtime'') after a player has finished that time allowance.<ref group="nb">Roughly, one has the time to play the game and then a little time to finish it off. Time-wasting tactics are possible in Go, so that ''sudden death'' systems, in which time runs out at a predetermined point however many plays are in the game, are relatively unpopular (in the West).</ref> The most widely used time control system is the so called ''[[byoyomi]]''<ref group="nb">Literally in Japanese ''byōyomi'' means 'reading of seconds'.</ref> system. The top professional Go matches have timekeepers so that the players do not have to press their own clocks.

Two widely used variants of the byoyomi system are:<ref name="Byoyomi">{{Citation | publisher = European Go Federation | url = http://www.eurogofed.org/egf/tourrules.htm | title = EGF General Tournament Rules | accessdate = 2008-06-11}}</ref>
*''Standard byoyomi'': After the main time is depleted, a player has a certain number of time periods (typically around thirty seconds). After each move, the number of full time periods that the player took (possibly zero) is subtracted. For example, if a player has three thirty-second time periods and takes thirty or more (but less than sixty) seconds to make a move, they lose one time period. With 60–89 seconds, they lose two time periods, and so on. If, however, they take less than thirty seconds, the timer simply resets without subtracting any periods. Using up the last period means that the player has lost on time.
*''Canadian byoyomi'': After using all of their main time, a player must make a certain number of moves within a certain period of time, such as twenty moves within five minutes.<ref name="Byoyomi"/><ref group="nb">Typically, players stop the clock, and the player in overtime sets his/her clock for the desired interval, counts out the required number of stones and sets the remaining stones out of reach, so as not to become confused. If twenty moves are made in time, the timer is reset to five minutes again.</ref> If the time period expires without the required number of stones having been played, then the player has lost on time.<ref group="nb">In other words, Canadian byoyomi is essentially a standard chess-style time control, based on ''N'' moves in a time period ''T'', imposed after a main period is used up. It is possible to decrease ''T'', or increase ''N'', as each overtime period expires; but systems with constant ''T'' and ''N'', for example 20 plays in 5 minutes, are widely used.</ref>

===Notation and recording games===
{{see also|Kifu}}
Go games are recorded with a simple coordinate system.  This is comparable to [[algebraic chess notation]], except that Go stones do not move and thus require only one coordinate per turn.  Coordinate systems include purely numerical (4-4 point), hybrid (K3), and purely alphabetical.<ref>[http://stason.org/TULARC/games/go/5-3-Recording-Go-games.html Go FAQ]</ref>  The [[Smart Game Format]] uses alphabetical coordinates internally, but most editors represent the board with hybrid coordinates as this reduces confusion.  The Japanese word [[kifu]] is sometimes used to refer to a game record.

==Competitive play==
===Ranks and ratings===
{{main|Go ranks and ratings}}
[[File:Go pros and amateurs.jpg.jpeg|thumb|Three Japanese professional Go players observe some younger amateurs as they dissect a [[life and death]] problem in the corner of the board, at the [[US Go Congress]] in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]], 2003.]]

In Go, rank indicates a player's skill in the game. Traditionally, ranks are measured using ''kyu'' and ''dan'' grades,<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Nihon Kiin |title = Go. The World's Most Fascinating Game | page = 188 | year = 1973 | location=Tokyo, Japan }}</ref> a system which also has been adopted by many [[martial arts]]. More recently, mathematical rating systems similar to the [[Elo rating system]] have been introduced.<ref name=EGFRating>{{Citation | url = http://europeangodatabase.eu/EGD/EGF_rating_system.php#System | title = EGF Official Ratings | first=Ales | last = Cieply | publisher = European Go Federation (EGF)| accessdate=2009-11-06}}</ref> Such rating systems often provide a mechanism for converting a rating to a kyu or dan grade.<ref name=EGFRating/> Kyu grades (abbreviated ''k'') are considered student grades and decrease as playing level increases, meaning 1st kyu is the strongest available kyu grade. Dan grades (abbreviated ''d'') are considered master grades, and increase from 1st dan to 7th dan. [[Shodan|First dan]] equals a [[black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in eastern martial arts using this system. Top players can attain a ''professional dan grade'' (abbreviated ''p''), with the very best reaching 9th dan professional. The difference among each amateur rank is one handicap stone. For the professional ranks, the difference is roughly one handicap stone for every three ranks. For example, if a 5k plays a game with a 1k, the 5k would need a handicap of four stones to even the odds. Top-level amateur players sometimes defeat professionals in tournament play.<ref name=EGFDatabase>{{Citation | url = http://www.europeangodatabase.eu/Player_Card.php?&key=12633346
 | title = EGF Tournament Database | publisher = Association for Go in Italy (AGI) | accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref>

The rank system comprises, from the lowest to highest ranks:
{| class="wikitable"
!|Rank Type

|-
|Double-digit ''kyu''

===Tournament and match rules===
{{see also|Go competitions}}
Tournament and match rules deal with factors that may influence the game but are not part of the actual rules of play. Such rules may differ between events. Rules that influence the game include: the setting of compensation points (''[[komidashi|komi]]''), handicap strategies, and time control parameters. Rules that do not generally influence the game are: the tournament system, pairing strategies, and placement criteria.

Common tournament systems used in Go include the [[Swiss system tournament#McMahon system|McMahon system]],<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.britgo.org/organisers/mcmahon.html | publisher = British Go Association | title = The McMahon system in a nutshell | accessdate = 2008-06-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080518202147/http://www.britgo.org/organisers/mcmahon.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-05-18}}</ref> [[Swiss system tournament|Swiss system]], [[league system]]s and the [[Single-elimination tournament|knockout system]]. Tournaments may combine multiple systems; many [[List of professional Go tournaments|professional Go tournaments]] use a combination of the league and knockout systems.<ref>{{Citation | author = GoGoD (Fairbairn & Hall) | title = A quick guide to pro tournaments | year = 2007 }}</ref>

Tournament rules may also set the following:
* compensation points, called komi, which compensate the second player for the first move advantage of his opponent; tournaments commonly use a compensation in the range of 5–8 points,<ref name=histKomi>{{Citation | author = GoGoD (Fairbairn & Hall) | title = History and Timelines | chapter = History of Komi | year = 2007 }}</ref> generally including a half-point to prevent draws;
* compensation stones placed on the board before alternate play, allowing players of different strengths to play competitively (see [[Go handicap]] for more information); and
* ''superko'': Although the basic ko rule described above covers more than 95% of all cycles occurring in games,<ref name="KoRules">{{Citation | title = Ko Rules | url = http://home.snafu.de/jasiek/korules.html | first = Robert | last = Jasiek | year = 2001 | accessdate = 2007-11-30 }}</ref> there are some complex situations—''[[Ko fight#Complex situations involving ko|triple ko]]'', ''eternal life'',<ref group="nb">A full explanation of the eternal life position can be found on [http://senseis.xmp.net/?EternalLife Sensei's Library], it also appears in the official text for Japanese Rules, see [http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~wjh/go/rules/Japanese.html translation].</ref> etc.—that are not covered by it but would allow the game to cycle indefinitely. To prevent this, the ko rule is sometimes extended to disallow the repetition of ''any'' previous position. This extension is called superko.<ref name="KoRules"/>

Although the game was developed in China, the establishment of the [[Four go houses|Four Go houses]] by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] at the start of the 17th century shifted the focus of the Go world to Japan. State sponsorship, allowing players to dedicate themselves full time to study of the game, and fierce competition between individual houses resulted in a significant increase in the level of play. During this period, the best player of his generation was given the prestigious title [[Meijin]] (master) and the post of [[Godokoro]] (minister of Go). Of special note are the players who were dubbed [[Kisei]] (Go Sage). The only three players to receive this honor were [[Dosaku]], [[Jowa]] and [[Honinbo Shusaku|Shusaku]], all of the house [[Honinbo]].<ref name="msoworld.com"/>
[[Image:GovsShusai.jpg|thumb|left| [[Honinbo Shusai]] (left), last head of house Honinbo, plays against then-up-and-coming [[Go Seigen]] in the [[The game of the century (Go)|game of the century]].]]

After the end of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] and the [[Meiji Restoration]] period, the Go houses slowly disappeared, and in 1924, the [[Nihon Ki-in]] (Japanese Go Association) was formed. Top players from this period often played newspaper-sponsored matches of 2–10 games.<ref name=newspaper>{{Citation | url = http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/history/newspaper.html | title = History of Newspaper Go | last = Fairbairn | first = John | accessdate = 2007-06-14}}</ref> Of special note are [[Go Seigen]] (Chinese: Wu Qingyuan), who scored an impressive 80% in these matches,<ref>{{Citation | publisher = GoBase.org | url = http://gobase.org/games/china/misc/disks/matches.html | title = Go Seigen: Match Player | accessdate = June 14, 2007}}</ref> and [[Minoru Kitani]], who dominated matches in the early 1930s.<ref>{{Citation | last = Fairbairn | first = John | url = http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/history/newspaper.html#kitani | title = Kitani's Streak | accessdate = 2007-06-14}}</ref> These two players are also recognized for their groundbreaking work on new [[Go opening theory|opening theory]] ([[Shinfuseki]]).<ref name=ShinFuseki>{{Citation | url = http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/history/kubomatsu.html | first = John | last = Fairbairn | title = Kubomatsu's central thesis | accessdate = 2008-01-17 }}</ref>

For much of the 20th century, Go continued to be dominated by players trained in Japan. Notable names included [[Eio Sakata]], [[Rin Kaiho]] (born in China), [[Masao Kato]], [[Koichi Kobayashi]] and [[Cho Chikun]] (born Cho Ch'i-hun, South Korea).<ref>{{Citation | publisher = GoBase.org | url = http://gobase.org/games/jp/ | title = List of Japanese titles, prizemoney and winners | accessdate = 2008-06-11}}</ref> Top Chinese and Korean talents often moved to Japan, because the level of play there was high and funding was more lavish. One of the first Korean players to do so was [[Cho Namchul]], who studied in the [[Kitani Dojo]] 1937–1944. After his return to Korea, the [[Hanguk Kiwon]] (Korea Baduk Association) was formed and caused the level of play in South Korea to rise significantly in the second half of the 20th century.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.usgo.org/news/index.php?%23_id=102 | title = KBA Founder Cho Nam Chul passes | first = Janice | last = Kim | publisher = American Go Association | accessdate = 2008-06-11}}</ref> In China, the game declined during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–1976) but quickly recovered in the last quarter of the 20th century, bringing Chinese players, such as [[Nie Weiping]] and [[Ma Xiaochun]], on par with their Japanese and Korean counterparts.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.societies.cam.ac.uk/cugos/tesuji/weiqi_chinese_culture.html | title = Weiqi in Chinese Culture | last = Matthews | first = Charles | accessdate = 2007-06-04}}</ref>
[[Image:Changho-Dinerchtein.jpg|thumb|right|Korean player [[Lee Chang-ho]], considered by many to be the best player of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, plays against Russian player [[Alexandre Dinerchtein]], seven-time European Champion and one of the few Western players to reach [[Go professional|professional]] status.]]

With the advent of major international titles from 1989 onward, it became possible to compare the level of players from different countries more accurately. Korean players such as [[Lee Chang-ho]], [[Cho Hunhyun]], [[Lee Sedol]] and [[Yoo Changhyuk]] dominated international Go and won an impressive number of titles.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = GoBase.org | url = http://gobase.org/games/nn/ | title = List of International titles, prizemoney and winners | accessdate = 2008-06-11}}</ref> Several Chinese players also rose to the top in international Go, most notably [[Ma Xiaochun]], [[Chang Hao]] and [[Gu Li]]. {{As of|2008}}, Japan lags behind in the international Go scene.

Historically, as with most sports and games, more men than women have played Go. Special tournaments for women exist, but until recently, men and women did not compete together at the highest levels; however, the creation of new, open tournaments and the rise of strong female players, most notably [[Rui Naiwei]], have in recent years highlighted the strength and competitiveness of emerging female players.<ref>{{citation | first = Peter | last = Shotwell | title = Go! More Than a Game | publisher = Tuttle Publishing | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-8048-3475-X}}</ref>

The level in other countries has traditionally been much lower, except for some players who had preparatory professional training in Asia.<ref group="nb">[[Kaku Takagawa]] toured Europe around 1970, and reported (''Go Review'') a general standard of amateur 4 ''dan''. This is a good amateur level but no more than might be found in ordinary Asian clubs. Published current European ratings would suggest around 100 players stronger than that, with very few European 7 ''dans''.</ref> Knowledge of the game has been scant elsewhere up until the 20th century. A famous player of the 1920s was [[Edward Lasker]].<ref group="nb">European Go has been documented by Franco Pratesi, ''Eurogo'' (Florence 2003) in three volumes, up to 1920, 1920–1950, and 1950 and later.</ref>  It was not until the 1950s that more than a few Western players took up the game as other than a passing interest. In 1978, [[Manfred Wimmer]] became the first Westerner to receive a professional player's certificate from an Asian professional Go association.<ref name=wimmer>{{Citation | url = http://www.britgo.org/bgj/04112.html | title =  Wimmer, Kerwin, Make Professional Shodan | publisher = British Go Association | accessdate = 2008-06-11}}</ref> In 2000, a Westerner, [[Michael Redmond (Go player)|Michael Redmond]], finally achieved the top rank awarded by an Asian Go association, 9 dan. In total, {{As of|2008|lc=on}}, only nine non-Asian Go players have ever achieved professional status in Asian associations.

==Tactics==
{{main|Go strategy and tactics}}

In Go, tactics deal with immediate fighting between stones, capturing and saving stones, life, death and other issues localized to a specific part of the board. Larger issues, not limited to only part of the board, are referred to as ''strategy'', and are covered in their own section.

===Capturing tactics===
There are several tactical constructs aimed at capturing stones.<ref>Kim 1994 pp. 80–98</ref> These are among the first things a player learns after understanding the rules. Recognizing the possibility that stones can be captured using these techniques is an important step forward.

<div class="thumbcaption" style="font-size: 88%;">
A ladder. Black cannot escape unless the ladder connects to friendly stones further down the board.
</div>
</div>
</div>

The most basic technique is the ''ladder''.<ref name=Ladder>Kim 1994 pp. 88–90</ref> To capture stones in a ladder, a player uses a constant series of capture threats—called ''atari''—to force the opponent into a zigzag pattern as shown in the diagram to the right. Unless the pattern runs into friendly stones along the way, the stones in the ladder cannot avoid capture. Experienced players will recognize the futility of continuing the pattern and will play elsewhere. The presence of a ladder on the board does give a player the option to play a stone in the path of the ladder, thereby threatening to rescue their stones, forcing a response. Such a move is called a ''ladder breaker'' and may be a powerful strategic move. In the diagram, Black has the option of playing a ladder breaker.

<div class="thumbcaption" style="font-size: 88%;">
A net. The chain of three black stones cannot escape in any direction.

</div>
Another technique to capture stones is the so-called ''net'',<ref name=Net>Kim 1994 pp. 91–92</ref> also known by its Japanese name, ''geta''. This refers to a move that loosely surrounds some stones, preventing their escape in all directions. An example is given in the diagram to the left. It is generally better to capture stones in a net than in a ladder, because a net does not depend on the condition that there are no opposing stones in the way, nor does it allow the opponent to play a strategic ladder breaker.

A third technique to capture stones is the ''snapback''.<ref name=SnapBack>Kim 1994 pp. 93–94</ref> In a snapback, one player allows a single stone to be captured, then immediately plays on the point formerly occupied by that stone; by so doing, the player captures a larger group of their opponent's stones, in effect ''snapping back'' at those stones. An example can be seen on the right. As with the ladder, an experienced player will not play out such a sequence, recognizing the futility of capturing only to be captured back immediately.

===Reading ahead===
One of the most important skills required for strong tactical play is the ability to read ahead. Reading ahead includes considering available moves to play, the possible responses to each move, and the subsequent possibilities after each of those responses. Some of the strongest players of the game can read up to 40 moves ahead even in complicated positions.<ref name=TreasureChest>{{citation | chapter = Memories of Kitani | title = The Treasure Chest Enigma | last = Nakayama | first = Noriyuki | publisher = Slate & Shell | year = 1984 | isbn = 1-932001-27-1 | pages =16–19}}</ref>

As explained in the scoring rules, some stone formations can never be captured and are said to be alive, while other stones may be in the position where they cannot avoid being captured and are said to be dead.  Much of the practice material available to students of the game comes in the form of life and death problems, also known as ''[[tsumego]]''.<ref name=Tsumego>{{Citation | url = http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/columns/0001/305.htm | last = van Zeijst | first = Rob | publisher = [[Yomiuri Shimbun]] | title = Whenever a player asks a top professional… | accessdate = 2008-06-09}}</ref> In such problems, players are challenged to find the vital move sequence that will kill a group of the opponent or save a group of their own. Tsumego are considered an excellent way to train a player's ability at reading ahead,<ref name=Tsumego/> and are available for all skill levels, some posing a challenge even to top players.

===Ko fighting===
In situations when the [[Ko rule]] applies, a ko fight may occur.<ref name="Ko"/> If the player who is prohibited from capture is of the opinion that the capture is important, because it prevents a large group of stones from being captured for instance, the player may play a ''ko threat''.<ref name="Ko"/> This is a move elsewhere on the board that threatens to make a large profit if the opponent does not respond. If the opponent does respond to the ko threat, the situation on the board has changed, and the prohibition on capturing the ko no longer applies. Thus the player who made the ko threat may now recapture the ko. Their opponent is then in the same situation and can either play a ko threat as well, or concede the ko by simply playing elsewhere. If a player concedes the ko, either because they do not think it important or because there are no moves left that could function as a ko threat, they have ''lost'' the ko, and their opponent may connect the ko.

Instead of responding to a ko threat, a player may also choose to ''ignore'' the threat and connect the ko.<ref name="Ko"/> They thereby win the ko, but at a cost. The choice of when to respond to a threat and when to ignore it is a subtle one, which requires a player to consider many factors, including how much is gained by connecting, how much is lost by not responding, how many possible ko threats both players have remaining, what the optimal order of playing them is, and what the ''size''—points lost or gained—of each of the remaining threats is.

Frequently, the winner of the ko fight does not connect the ko but instead captures one of the chains that constituted their opponent's side of the ko.<ref name="Ko"/> In some cases, this leads to another ko fight at a neighboring location.

Strategy deals with global influence, interaction between distant stones, keeping the whole board in mind during local fights, and other issues that involve the overall game. It is therefore possible to allow a tactical loss when it confers a strategic advantage.

Go is not easy to play well. With each new level (rank) comes a deeper appreciation for the subtlety and nuances involved and for the insight of stronger players. The acquisition of major concepts of the game comes slowly. Novices often start by randomly placing stones on the board, as if it were a game of chance; they inevitably lose to experienced players who know how to create effective formations. An understanding of how stones connect for greater power develops, and then a few basic [[go opening theory|common opening sequences]] may be understood. Learning the ways of life and death helps in a fundamental way to develop one's strategic understanding of ''weak groups''.
<ref name=LifeDeath group="nb">Whether or not a group is weak or strong refers to the ease with which it can be killed or made to live. See this [http://senseis.xmp.net/?BenjaminTeuber%2FGuideToBecomeStrong:v52 article] by Benjamin Teuber, amateur 6 dan, for some views on how important this is felt to be.</ref> It is necessary to play thousands of games before one can get close to one's ultimate potential skill level in Go. A player who both plays aggressively and can handle adversity is said to display ''[[kiai]]'', or fighting spirit, in the game.

Familiarity with the board shows first the tactical importance of the edges, and then the efficiency of developing in the corners first, then sides, then center. The more advanced beginner understands that territory and influence are somewhat interchangeable—but there needs to be a balance. This intricate struggle of power and control makes the game highly dynamic.

===Basic concepts===
{{main|Go terms}}
Basic strategic aspects include the following:
* Connection: Keeping one's own stones connected means that fewer groups need defense.
* Cut: Keeping opposing stones disconnected means that the opponent needs to defend more groups.
* Life: This is the ability of stones to permanently avoid capture. The simplest and usual way is for the group to surround two eyes (separate empty areas), so that filling one eye will not kill the group; as a result, any such move is suicidal and the group cannot be captured. The fundamental strategy of Go is to create groups with life while preventing one's opponent from doing the same.
* Mutual life (seki): A situation in which neither player can play to a particular point without then allowing the other player to play at another point to capture. The most common example is that of adjacent groups that share their last few liberties. If either player plays in the shared liberties, they reduce their own group to a single liberty (putting themselves in ''atari''), allowing their opponent to capture it on the next move.
* Death: The absence of life coupled with the inability to create it, resulting in the eventual removal of a group.
* Invasion: Setting up a new living position inside an area where the opponent has greater influence, as a means of balancing territory.
* Reduction: Placing a stone far enough into the opponent's area of influence to reduce the amount of territory they will eventually get, but not so far in that it can be cut off from friendly stones outside.
* Sente: A play that forces one's opponent to respond (''[[Go terms|gote]]''), such as placing an opponent's group in ''atari'' (immediate danger of capture). A player who can regularly play ''sente'' has the initiative, as in chess, and can control the flow of the game.
* Sacrifice: Allowing a group to die in order to carry out a play, or plan, in a more important area.

The strategy involved can become very abstract and complex. High-level players spend years improving their understanding of strategy, and a novice may play many hundreds of games against opponents before being able to win regularly.

===Opening strategy===
In the opening of the game, players will usually play in the corners of the board first, as the presence of two edges make it easier for them to surround territory and establish their stones.<ref name=Opening>{{citation | last = Otake | first = Hideo | title = Opening Theory Made Easy | publisher = Kiseido Publishing Company | isbn = 490657436X | year = 2002 }}</ref> After the corners, focus moves to the sides, where there is still one edge to support a player's stones. Opening moves are generally on the third and fourth line from the edge, with occasional moves on the second and fifth lines. In general, stones on the third line offer stability and are good defensive moves, whereas stones on the fourth line influence more of the board and are good attacking moves.

In the opening, players often play established sequences called [[joseki]], which are locally balanced exchanges;<ref name=Joseki>{{citation | last = Ishida | first = Yoshio | title = Dictionary of Basic Joseki  | year = 1977 | publisher = Kiseido Publishing Company}}</ref> however, the joseki chosen should also produce a satisfactory result on a global scale. It is generally advisable to keep a balance between territory and influence. Which of these gets precedence is often a matter of individual taste.

===Phases of the game===
While the opening moves in a game have a distinct set of aims, they usually make up only 10% to at most 20% of the game. In other words, in a game of 250 moves, there may be around 30 or so opening moves, with limited "fighting". At the end of such a game, there will also be perhaps 100 moves that are counted as "endgame", in which territories are finished off definitively and all issues on capturing stones become clear. The middle phase of the game is the most combative, and usually lasts for more than 100 moves. During the ''middlegame'', or just "the fighting", the players invade each others' frameworks, and attack weak groups, formations that lack the necessary ''two eyes'' for viability. Such groups must ''run away'', i.e. expand to avoid enclosure, giving a dynamic feeling to the struggle. It is quite possible that one player will succeed in capturing a large weak group of the opponent's, which will often prove decisive and end the game by a resignation. But matters may be more complex yet, with major trade-offs, apparently dead groups reviving, and skillful play to attack in such a way as to construct territories rather than to kill.

The end of the middlegame and transition to the endgame is marked by a few features. The game breaks up into areas that do not affect each other (with a caveat about ''ko'' fights), where before the central area of the board related to all parts of it. No large weak groups are still in serious danger. Moves can reasonably be attributed some definite value, such as 20 points or fewer, rather than simply being necessary to compete. Both players set limited objectives in their plans, in making or destroying territory, capturing or saving stones. These changing aspects of the game usually occur at much the same time, for strong players. In brief, the middlegame switches into the endgame when the concepts of strategy and influence need reassessment in terms of concrete final results on the board.

==Computers and Go==
===Nature of the game===
{{seealso|Go and mathematics}}
[[Image:AB pruning.svg|thumb|right|300px|Computers generally model the game as a tree of moves with values assigned to them.]]
In [[combinatorial game theory]] terms, Go is a [[Zero-sum (game theory)|zero sum]], [[perfect information|perfect-information]], [[partisan game|partisan]], [[Deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]] [[strategy game]], putting it in the same class as chess, [[checkers]] (draughts) and [[Reversi]] (Othello); however it differs from these in its game play. Although the  rules are simple, the practical strategy is extremely complex.

The game emphasizes the importance of balance on multiple levels and has internal tensions. To secure an area of the board, it is good to play moves close together; however, to cover the largest area, one needs to spread out, perhaps leaving weaknesses that can be exploited. Playing too ''low'' (close to the edge) secures insufficient territory and influence, yet playing too ''high'' (far from the edge) allows the opponent to invade.

It has been claimed that Go is the most complex game in the world due to its vast number of variations in individual games.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = American Go Association | url = http://www.usgo.org/resources/topten.html | title = Top Ten Reasons to Play Go | accessdate = 2008-06-11}}</ref> Its large board and lack of restrictions allow great scope in strategy and expression of players' individuality. Decisions in one part of the board may be influenced by an apparently unrelated situation in a distant part of the board. Plays made early in the game can shape the nature of conflict a hundred moves later.

The [[game complexity]] of Go is such that describing even elementary strategy fills many introductory books. In fact, numerical estimates show that the number of possible games of Go far exceeds [[Observable universe#Matter content|the number of atoms in the known universe]].<ref group="nb">The number of board positions is at most 3<sup>361</sup> (about 10<sup>172</sup>) since each position can be white, black, or vacant. There are at least 361! games (about 10<sup>768</sup>) since every permutation of the board positions corresponds to a game. See [[Go and mathematics]] for more details, which includes much larger estimates.</ref>

===Software players===
{{main|Computer Go}}

Go poses a daunting challenge to [[computer programmer]]s.<ref name="research.microsoft.com">{{Citation | url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/65658/sterngraepelmackay04.pdf | title=Modelling Uncertainty in the Game of Go | last=Stern | first=David | work=[[University of Cambridge]]| date=2008-02-01 | accessdate = 2008-12-04 }}</ref>  While the strongest computer chess programs can defeat the best human players (for example, the [[Deep Fritz]] program, running on a laptop, beat reigning world champion [[Vladimir Kramnik]] without losing a single game in 2006), the best Go programs only manage to reach an intermediate amateur level. On the small 9×9 board, the computer fares better, and some programs now win a fraction of their 9x9 games against professional players . Human players generally achieve an intermediate amateur level by studying and playing regularly for a few years. Many in the field of [[artificial intelligence]] consider Go to require more elements that mimic human thought than [[chess]].<ref>

[[Image:13 by 13 game finished.jpg|thumb|right|A finished beginner's game on a 13×13 board. Go software can reach stronger levels on a smaller board size.]]

The reasons why computer programs do not play Go well are attributed to many qualities of the game,<ref>{{Citation | url =  http://www.intelligentgo.org/en/computer-go/overview.html | publisher = Intelligent Go Foundation | title = Overview of Computer Go | accessdate = 2008-06-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080531072850/http://www.intelligentgo.org/en/computer-go/overview.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-05-31}}</ref> including:
* The number of spaces on the board is much larger (over five times the spaces on a chess board—361 vs. 64). On most turns there are many more possible moves in Go than in chess. Throughout most of the game, the number of legal moves stays at around 150–250 per turn, and rarely goes below 50 (in chess, the average number of moves is 37).<ref>{{citation | title = How to beat your chess computer | first1 = Raymond | last1 = Keene | first2 = David | last2 = Levy | publisher = Batsford Books | year = 1991 | page = 85}}</ref> Because an exhaustive computer program for Go must calculate and compare every possible legal move in each [[Ply (game theory)|ply]] (player turn), its ability to calculate the best plays is sharply reduced when there are a large number of possible moves. Most computer game algorithms, such as those for chess, compute several moves in advance. Given an average of 200 available moves through most of the game, for a computer to calculate its next move by exhaustively anticipating the next four moves of each possible play (two of its own and two of its opponent's), it would have to consider more than 320 billion (3.2{{e|11}}) possible combinations. To exhaustively calculate the next eight moves, would require computing 512 quintillion (5.12{{e|20}}) possible combinations. {{As of|2008|6}}, the most powerful supercomputer in the world, IBM's "Roadrunner" distributed cluster, can sustain 1.02 [[FLOPS|petaflops]].<ref>{{cite web

* Unlike chess and [[Reversi]], the placement of a single stone in the initial phase can affect the play of the game hundreds of moves later. For a computer to have a real advantage over a human, it would have to predict this influence, and from the example above, it would be completely unworkable to attempt to exhaustively analyze the next hundred moves to predict what a stone's placement will do.
* In capture-based games (such as chess), a position can often be evaluated relatively easily, such as by calculating who has a material advantage or more active pieces.<ref group="nb">While chess position evaluation is simpler than Go position evaluation,  it is still more complicated than simply calculating material advantage or piece activity; pawn structure and king safety matter, as do the possibilities in further play. The complexity of the algorithm differs per engine.</ref> In Go, there is often no easy way to evaluate a position.<ref name="research.microsoft.com"/><ref>{{Citation| url=http://www.cs.brown.edu/~ynm/Papers/AAAI06-312.pdf|format=PDF| title=Exploring GnuGo's Evaluation Function with SVM | last=Fellows | first=Christopher | work=[[Cornell University]]| date=2006-00-00 | accessdate = 2008-12-19}}</ref> The number of stones on the board (material advantage) is only a weak indicator of the strength of a position, and a territorial advantage (more empty points surrounded) for one player might be compensated by the opponent's strong positions and influence all over the board.

As an illustration, the greatest handicap normally given to a weaker opponent is 9 stones. It was not until August 2008 that a computer was able to win a game against a professional level player at this handicap. It was the Mogo program which scored said first victory in an exhibition game played during the US Go Congress.<ref>{{Cite web | title= Supercomputer with innovative software beats Go Professional  | url=http://www.cs.unimaas.nl/g.chaslot/muyungwan-mogo/ | accessdate = 2008-12-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | title= AGA News: Kim Prevails Again In Man Vs Machine Rematch | url=http://www.usgo.org/news/ | accessdate = 2009-08-08}}</ref>

===Software assistance===
{{main|Go software}}

Beyond programs that play Go, there is an abundance of software available to support players of the game. This includes programs that can be used to view or edit game records and diagrams, programs that allow the user to search for patterns in the games of strong players, and programs that allow users to play against each other over the Internet.

There are several file formats used to store game records, the most popular of which is SGF, short for [[Smart Game Format]]. Programs used for editing game records allow the user to record not only the moves, but also variations, commentary and further information on the game.<ref group="nb">Lists of such programs may be found at [http://senseis.xmp.net/?GoEditingPrograms Sensei's Library] or [http://gobase.org/software/editors/ GoBase].</ref>

Electronic databases can be used to study life and death situations, [[joseki]], ''[[fuseki]]'' and games by a particular player. Programs are available that give players pattern searching options, which allow players to research positions by searching for high-level games in which similar situations occur. Such software generally lists common follow-up moves that have been played by professionals and gives statistics on win/loss ratio in opening situations.

Internet-based [[Internet Go server|Go servers]] allow access to competition with players all over the world.<ref group="nb">Lists of Go servers are kept at [http://senseis.xmp.net/?GoServers Sensei's Library] and [http://www.usgo.org/resources/servers.html the AGA website]</ref> Such servers also allow easy access to professional teaching, with both teaching games and interactive game review being possible.<ref group="nb">The British Go Association provides a [http://www.britgo.org/teaching/teaching.html list of teaching services]</ref>

==In culture and science==
===Literature, television, and film===
Apart from technical literature and study material, Go and its strategies have been the subject of several works of fiction, such as ''[[The Master of Go]]'' by [[Nobel prize]]-winning author [[Yasunari Kawabata]]<ref group="nb">A list of books can be found at [http://senseis.xmp.net/?Literature Sensei's Library]</ref> and ''[[The Girl Who Played Go]]'' by Shan Sa. Other books have used Go as a [[Theme (literature)|theme]] or minor plot device. For example, the 1979 novel ''[[Shibumi (novel)|Shibumi]]'' by [[Trevanian]] centers around the game and uses Go metaphors.<ref name=GoLit>{{Citation | title = Go in Western Literature | chapter = Shibumi | last = McDonald | first = Brian | origyear = 1995 | year = 2002 | url = http://www.usgo.org/resources/downloads/go_in_literature.pdf |format=PDF| publisher = American Go Association | pages = 5–6 | editor = Shotwell, Peter | accessdate = 2008-06-16}}</ref> Go, referred to as Weiqi, features prominently in the 1986 [[Eric Van Lustbader]] novel Jian.

Similarly, Go has been used as a subject or plot device in film, such as ''[[Pi (film)|π]]'', ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]'' and ''[[Tron Legacy]]''. Also in ''[[The Go Master]]'', a [[biopic]] of Go professional [[Go Seigen]].<ref>{{Citation | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03EFDC1131F937A25750C0A9619C8B63&scp=1&sq=%22The+Go+Master%22&st=nyt | title=A Prodigy's Life Is Played Out In a Japanese Game of Skill |work=[[The New York Times]] |last=Scott |first=A.O. |date=March 14, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-06-16}}</ref><ref group="nb">A list of films can de found at the [http://www.eurogofed.org/history/filmography.htm EGF Internet Go Filmography]</ref> In [[King Hu]]'s [[wuxia]] film ''The Valiant Ones'', the characters are color-coded as go pieces (black or other dark shades for the Chinese, white for the Japanese invaders), go boards and stones are used by the characters to keep track of soldiers prior to battle, and the battles themselves are structured like a game of go.<ref>{{cite book |author= Ng Ho |editor-first=Stephen |editor-last=Teo |series=Hong Kong International Film Festival |title=Transcending the Times:King Hu & Eileen Chan |publisher=Provisional Urban Council of Hong Kong |year=1998 |location=Hong Kong |page=45 |chapter=King Hu and the Aesthetics of Space}}</ref> Go is used as a device for criminal profiling in the pilot episode of ''[[Criminal Minds]]'', "Extreme Aggressor".

Of particular note is  the [[manga]] (Japanese comic book) and [[anime]] series ''[[Hikaru no Go]]'', released in Japan in 1998, which had a large impact in popularizing Go among young players, both in Japan and—as translations were released—abroad.<ref>{{Citation | first=Yoko | last=Shimatsuka | title=Do Not Pass Go | url = http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/magazine/nations/0,8782,132162,00.html  | publisher =Asiaweek | accessdate = 2007-03-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070610073841/http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/magazine/nations/0,8782,132162,00.html |archivedate = 2007-06-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Charles | last=Scanlon | coauthors= | title=Young Japanese go for Go | date=Thursday, 1 August 2002, 03:35 GMT 04:35 UK | publisher=BBC | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2164532.stm | work =World News | pages = | accessdate = 2009-05-21 | language = }}</ref>
<!-- Please do not add material to this section unless you feel it is at least as significant as Hikaru no Go. There are literally hundreds of books, films and series that feature go somewhere, there is simply no room to list them all -->

Also note that video game company Atari was named after Go.  As Atari's founder Nolan Bushnell was quoted as saying: "In Go, when you are about to capture an opponent's piece, you politely warn them 'Atari'. I felt that was a good aggressive name for a company."

===Psychology===
A 2004 review of literature by Gobet, de Voogt & Retschitzki<ref name="Moves in mind">{{citation | last1= Gobet | first1 = F | last2 = de Voogt | first2 = A.

According to the review of Gobet and colleagues, the pattern of brain activity observed with techniques such as [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] does not show large differences between Go and chess.
