But we had... uh... one-kilobit lines connecting the direction centers and I thought, "Good God! 1,000 bits a second. Well, we’ll surely be able to figure out something to do with that." — Saverah Warenstein

:**p29, “The names and symbols for the prefixes corresponding to 2 <sup>10</sup> , 2 <sup>20</sup> , 2 <sup>30</sup> , 2 <sup>40</sup> , 2 <sup>50</sup> , and 2 <sup>60</sup> are, respectively: kibi, Ki; mebi, Mi; gibi, Gi; tebi, Ti; pebi, Pi; and exbi, Ei. Thus, for example, one kibibyte is also written as 1 KiB = 2 <sup>10</sup>  B = 1024 B, where B denotes the unit ''byte''. Although these prefixes are not part of the SI, they should be used in the field of information technology to avoid the non-standard usage of the SI prefixes.”
