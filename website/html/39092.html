The '''VAXBI bus''' (VAX Bus Interconnect bus) was a [[computer]] bus designed and sold by the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) of [[Maynard, Massachusetts]].

The bus was an advanced, configuration-free synchronous bus used on DEC's later [[VAX]] computers. Like the [[Unibus]] and [[Q-Bus]] before it, it used [[memory-mapped I/O]] but had 32-bit address and data paths. The VAXBI was a multiplexed bus with fully-distributed arbitration and geographic addressing.

All of the logic required to implement a VAXBI interface was contained within a single custom integrated circuit (the "BIIC") and the physical layout and [[printed wiring board]] layup for compliant cards was tightly specified, right down to the location of the dual amber status [[LED]]s that were required. The portion of the card that was reserved for the bus interface was referred to as "the VAXBI corner". VAXBI licensees <!-- were there ever any? --> were given the appropriate engineering drawings to allow them to exactly replicate a compliant card. 

VAXBI cards mounted into backplanes using a [[Zero insertion force|ZIF]] connector; depending on the backplane design, cards could be loaded from the top or the front side of the backplane. No cable connections were permitted on the cards; all connections were made via three uncommitted rows of backplane connectors. Similarly, no configuration jumpers were permitted on the cards; all setup was done by jumpers inserted on the backplane connectors or via software configuration.

Originally conceived by its engineers to be an [[Open standards|open]] bus, it was forced to be a tightly-licensed bus by Digital's marketing and management, and was not nearly as successful as had originally been hoped-for.

It was used in the [[VAX 6000]], [[VAX 8000]] (82xx, 83xx, 85xx, 87xx, 88xx models) and the [[VAX 9000]] systems.

A [[PDP-11]] implementation (the PDP-11/27) was also envisioned but never advanced beyond the concept stage.
