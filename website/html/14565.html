'''GNAT''' is a [[free software|free-software]] [[compiler]] for the [[Ada (programming language)|Ada programming language]] which forms part of the [[GNU Compiler Collection]]. It supports all versions of the language, i.e. Ada 2005, Ada 95 and Ada 83; it allows already some constructs of Ada 2012 (i.e. pre/postconditions or conditional expressions). Originally its name was an [[acronym]] that stood for '''''G'''NU '''N'''YU '''A'''da '''T'''ranslator'', but that name no longer applies. The front-end and run-time are written in Ada.

'''JGNAT''' is a GNAT version that compiles from the Ada programming language to [[Java bytecode]].
'''GNAT for dotNET''' is a GNAT version that compiles from the Ada programming language to [[Common Language Infrastructure]] for the .NET Framework and the free and open source implementations Mono and Portable.NET.

== History ==

The project started in 1992 when the [[United States Air Force]] awarded [[New York University]] (NYU) a contract to build an open source compiler for Ada to help with the Ada 9X standardization process. The 3-million-dollar contract required the use of the [[GNU General Public License|GNU GPL]] for all development, and assigned the copyright to the [[Free Software Foundation]]. The first official validation of GNAT happened in 1995.

In 1994 and 1996, the original authors of GNAT founded two sister companies, Ada Core Technologies in New York City and ACT-Europe in Paris, to provide continuing development and commercial support of GNAT. Both companies were integrated and renamed to [[AdaCore]] in 2004.

GNAT was initially released separately from the main GCC sources.  On October 2, 2001 the GNAT sources were contributed to the GCC [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] repository.  The last version to be released separately was GNAT 3.15p, based on GCC 2.8.1, on October 2, 2002. Starting with GCC 3.4, on major platforms the official GCC release is able to pass 100% of the [[ACATS]] Ada tests included in the GCC testsuite. In GCC 4.0, more exotic platforms are also able to pass 100% of ACATS.

== License ==

As of July 2010, the latest version of the compiler is licensed under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]]. The "GNAT GPL Edition" of the runtime is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] while the "GNAT Pro Edition" is under the [[GNAT Modified General Public License]]. All versions leading up to and including 3.15p are licensed under the MGPL.

It is part of most major GNU/Linux or BSD distributions.
