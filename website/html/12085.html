'''''En''ABLE''' is a history matching and [[uncertainty]] software designed to be used in the [[Petroleum industry|oil and gas]] industry. It optimizes plans and reduces costs by accelerating history matching process and improving [[reservoir]] understanding. '''''En''ABLE''' is also used to quantify production estimates under reservoir [[uncertainty]]. As [[Petroleum|oil and gas]] resources are increasingly recovered from reservoirs whose behavior has considerable [[uncertainty]] the need to measure the [[uncertainty]] is increasing<ref>J.G.

Caldwell, "A Case Study of a Fine Scale Integrated Geological, Geophysical, Petrophysical, and Reservoir Simulation Reservoir Characterization With Uncertainty Estimation", http://www.spe.org/elibrary/servlet/spepreview?id=00084274&speCommonAppContext=ELIBRARY</ref>

Existing [[reservoir simulation]] projects accelerate significantly and ''En''ABLE provides assisted history matching and [[uncertainty]] [[forecasts]].

==History==

'''''En''ABLE''' was developed by [[Energy Scitech Limited]], a UK-based independent consultancy and software development company founded in 1999.  Energy Scitech was acquired by [[Roxar ASA]] in 2006.
