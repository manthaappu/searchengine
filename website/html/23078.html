<html> <head> <title>MST Workshop</title></head><body>The '''MST Workshop''' (short for ''Math Science and Technology Workshop''') is an [[interactive]] computer [[programming language]]. It has hundreds of objects that can be [[Drag-and-drop|dragged]] on to the [[Workspace#Technology and Software|workspace]] and connected by wires or snapping them together. The workspace immediately solves the equations created and displays the results. MST Workshop is useful for creating animation in [[2D computer graphics|2D]] and [[3D computer graphics|3D]] (using [[OpenGL]]).

MST Workshop uses components to process data. These components are connected when their terminals touch or when a virtual wire is connected between them. The interactive nature becomes apparent when components are connected. The color of the connected components changes from gray to a color specific to the value of the data passed through the connection. Components calculate in real time. Certain components that require a time frame can be started and stopped by buttons in the [[toolbar]]. Examples of time dependent components are the timer, oneshot, and the integration-over-time component.
