<html> <head> <title>Hexspeak</title></head><body>'''Hexspeak''', like [[leet]]speak, is a novelty form of variant [[English language|English]] spelling.

Hexspeak was created by programmers who wanted a [[magic number (programming)|magic number]], a clear and unique identifier with which to mark memory or data. Using [[hexadecimal|hexadecimal notation]], which includes the digits 0123456789ABCDEF, it is possible to create small words with the digit "0" representing the letter "O", "1" representing the letters "I" or "L", "5" representing "S", "7" representing "T", and "6" or "9" representing "G" or "g" respectively. Numbers such as 2 or 8 can be used in a manner similar to [[leet]] or [[rebus]]es; e.g. the word "defecate" can be expressed either as DEFECA7E or DEFEC8. (2 bears a resemblance to Z, but because that letter is the [[letter frequency|least used in the English language]], such a usage is very rare.)

== Notable magic numbers ==
{{details|Magic number (programming)}}

Many [[computer processor]]s, [[operating system]]s, and [[debugger]]s make use of magic numbers, especially as a [[Magic number (programming)#Magic debug values|magic debug value]].

* 0x8BADF00D ("ate bad food") is used by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] in [[IOS_(Apple)|iOS]] crash reports, when an application takes too long to launch, terminate, or respond to system events.<ref name="DAC1">{{cite web|url=http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/technotes/tn2008/tn2151.html |title= Technical Note TN2151: Understanding and Analyzing iPhone OS Application Crash Reports }}</ref>

* 0xCAFED00D ("Cafe Dude") is used by [[Java (software platform)|Java]] as a magic number for their pack200 compression.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/pack200/pack-spec.html#tocArcHea|title=Pack200: A Packed Class Deployment Format For Java Applications|accessdate=2010-11-03}}</ref>
* 0xD15EA5E ("disease") is a flag that indicates regular boot on the [[Nintendo GameCube]] and [[Wii]] consoles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hitmen.c02.at/files/yagcd/yagcd/chap4.html#sec4.2.1.1.2|title=Yet Another Gamecube Documentation: Dolphin-OS Globals}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Memory_Map|title=Wiibrew: Memory Map}}</ref>
* 0xDEADBABE ("Dead Babe") is used by IBM [[Jikes RVM]] as a sanity check of the stack of the primary thread <ref>{{cite web|url=http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jikesrvm/rvmroot/trunk/tools/bootImageRunner/ia32/libvm.c?revision=15664&view=markup: |title=DEADBABE sanity check |date= |accessdate=2009-10-01}}</ref>
* 0xDEADBEEF ("dead beef") is frequently used to indicate a software crash or deadlock in embedded systems. It is used by IBM [[RS/6000]] systems, [[Mac OS]] on 32-bit [[PowerPC]] processors and the [[Commodore International|Commodore]] [[Amiga]] as a magic debug value. On [[Sun Microsystems]]' [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], it marks freed kernel memory. On [[OpenVMS]] running on Alpha processors, DEAD_BEEF can be seen by pressing CTRL-T. The DEC Alpha SRM console has a background process that traps memory errors, identified by PS as "BeefEater waiting on 0xdeadbeef".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/D/DEADBEEF.html |title=Jargon File entry for DEADBEEF |publisher=Catb.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-01}}</ref>.
* 0xDEADDEAD ("dead dead") is the bug check (STOP) code displayed when invoking a [[blue_screen_of_death|Blue Screen of Death]] either by telling the kernel via the attached debugger, or by using a special keystroke combination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms797162.aspx |title=Bug Check 0xDEADDEAD: MANUALLY_INITIATED_CRASH, MSDN |publisher=msdn.microsoft.com |date=2009-10-01 |accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref> This is usually seen by driver developers, as it is used to get a memory dump on Windows NT based systems. An alternative to 0xDEADDEAD is the bug check code 0x000000E2,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms797144.aspx |title=Bug Check 0xE2: MANUALLY_INITIATED_CRASH, MSDN |publisher=msdn.microsoft.com |date=2009-10-01 |accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref> as they are both called MANUALLY_INITIATED_CRASH as seen on the Microsoft Developer Network.
* 0xDEADFA11 ("dead fall") is used by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] in [[IOS_(Apple)|iOS]] crash reports, when user force quit the application.<ref name="DAC1"/>
* 0xDEFEC8ED ("defecated") is the magic number for [[OpenSolaris]] [[core dump]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cvs.opensolaris.org/source/xref/onnv/onnv-gate/usr/src/uts/common/sys/dumphdr.h |title=Opensolaris header line 48 for 0xDEFEC8ED |publisher=Cvs.opensolaris.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-01}}</ref>
* 0xFACEFEED ("face feed") is used by Alpha servers running Windows NT. The Alpha [[Hardware Abstraction Layer]] (HAL) generates this error when it encounters a hardware failure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/132349 |title=Technet article for 0xFACEFEED |publisher=Support.microsoft.com |date=2006-11-01 |accessdate=2009-10-01}}</ref>
* 0xFEE1DEAD ("feel dead") is used as a magic number in the [[Linux]] reboot system call.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git;a=blob_plain;f=include/linux/reboot.h;hb=HEAD |title=include/linux/reboot.h }}</ref>
* 0xE011CFD0 is used as [[magic number (programming)|magic number]] for Microsoft Office files. In [[little endian]] this reads D0CF11E0, "docfile0".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/318326 |title=Documents That Are Supported by the Office Filter}}</ref>

== Alternative letters ==
* In the [[Ada (programming language)|Ada programming language]], hexadecimal numbers are enclosed by "16#" and "#". For example, "16#Ada_Ada_Ada_Ada#".
* The [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] notation uses the "0x" prefix to indicate a hexadecimal number; the "0x" is usually ignored when reading the letters or numbers.
* In the [[x86-assembly|Intel assembly language]], hexadecimal numbers are denoted by a "h" suffix.  For example: FEEDADEADF15h ("feed a dead fish"). Note that numbers in this notation that begin with a letter have to start with a zero to distinguish them from variable names. "FEEDADEADF15h" would then be "0FEEDADEADF15h".
* In [[6502]] [[assembly language]] , hexadecimal numbers are denoted by a "$" prefix.  This allows for words starting with the letter "S", for example $EED ("seed").
