The '''KSD-64[A] Crypto Ignition Key (CIK)''' is an [[National Security Agency|NSA]]-developed [[EEPROM]] chip packed in a plastic case that looks like a toy [[key (lock)|key]].  The model number is due to its storage capacity &mdash; 64 kB (65,536 bits), enough to store multiple [[key (cryptography)|encryption keys]].  Most frequently it is used in [[key splitting|key-splitting]] applications: either the encryption device or the KSD-64 alone is worthless, but together they can be used to make encrypted connections.  Less often, it is used alone as a [[fill device]] for transfer of key material, as for the initial seed key loading of an [[STU-III]] secure phone.

Newer systems, such as the [[Secure Terminal Equipment]], use the [[Fortezza]] PC card as a [[security token]] instead of the KSD-64.
