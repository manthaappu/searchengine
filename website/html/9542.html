'''David Cannon Evans''' (1924â€“1998) was the founder of the [[computer science]] department at the [[University of Utah]] and co-founder (with [[Ivan Sutherland]]) of [[Evans & Sutherland]], a computer firm which is known as a pioneer in the domain of [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref>[http://db3-sql.staff.library.utah.edu/lucene/Photo/P0400/P0452.xml David C. Evans Biography and Photograph Collection at the University of Utah]</ref>

Evans attended the University of Utah and studied electrical engineering; he earned his doctorate degree in physics. Evans first worked at the [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]] aviation electronics company, where he acted as project manager in 1955 to develop what some describe as an early [[personal computer]] that ran on an interpretive operating system.  The [[Bendix G-15]] was a bulky unit about the size of a two door refrigerator.  He stayed with the company just long enough to manage the G-16 project.<ref name="obit">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E6D91F3BF931A25753C1A96E958260&scp=27 David Evans, Pioneer in Computer Graphics, Dies at 74]</ref>

Evans subsequently worked on the GENIE multi-user timesharing system while at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  Evans was appointed a member of UC Berkeley's faculty.  In addition, through his work at the Pentagon's [[Defense Advanced Research Project Agency|Advanced Research Project Agency]], he made key developments in the field of [[virtual memory]].<ref name="obit" />  His first important works with graphics also dates from that period, when he did several experiments on an [[IDIOM]] display hooked up to a [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]]-5.

When he was building up the University of Utah department in 1968 he managed to convince [[Ivan Sutherland]] to come to [[Utah]], accepting the condition that they start a computer graphics company together.  Evans retired from the company in 1994.

Evans was a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church).  He served as a [[branch president]], a counselor in [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishoprics]] and [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stake presidencies]], and as a [[Scouting|scout master]] for a total of 27 years.<ref name = cn>''[[Church News]]'', October 26, 1996.</ref>  Evans was award the [[Silver Beaver]] for his role in scouting.<ref>[http://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/98/10/biztech/articles/12obit-evans.html ''New York Times'', obituary for Evans, Oct. 12, 1998]</ref>

Evans married [[Joy F. Evans|Joy Frewin]]. They had ten children, only seven of which lived to adulthood.  One of these is [[David F. Evans]], who became a [[general authority]] in the LDS Church.  From 1984 to 1990, Joy Evans was a counselor in the general presidency of the [[Relief Society]] to [[Barbara W. Winder]].  At the time of his death in 1998 Evans had 39 living grandchildren and great grandchildren.  

In 1996, [[Brigham Young University]] established the David C. Evans Chair of Computer Engineering and Graphics.  Evans was at the ceremony where the founding of a chair in his honor was announced, but due to his suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]], did not make any remarks at the ceremony.<ref name = cn/>
