'''Vision Crew Unlimited''' (VCU) was a [[motion picture]] and [[television advertisement|TV commercial]] [[visual effects]] company founded in 1994 by visual effects artists [[Evan Jacobs]], Jon Warren and Douglas Miller.<ref>{{Cite news| last=Goldrich| first=Robert| title=Visual Effects House Wraps Its First Spot: Coke For CAA| newspaper=Shoot magazine| pages=1| year=1995| date=August 1995| url=http://www.visioncrew.com/Press/shootformation.htm| postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> The company later expanded into a full service visual effects firm.

In 1996, VCU contributed [[miniature effect]]s to [[James Cameron]]'s film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''.  While they were initially hired as a subcontractor to lead effects house [[Digital Domain]], VCU was ultimately hired directly by [[20th Century Fox]] to build miniatures for the engine room sequence as well.<ref>{{cite web| title =VIFX jumps aboard project to add convincing details.| work =ASC.com| publisher =[[American Society of Cinematographers]]| url =http://www.theasc.com/magazine/dec97/titanic/sb/pg1.htm| accessdate =2007-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last =Speier| first =Michael| title =Coming to the Aid of a Sinking Ship| work =DigitalContentProducer.com| publisher =[[Penton Media]]| date =1997-07-01| url =http://digitalcontentproducer.com/mag/video_coming_aid_sinking| accessdate =2007-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Vision Crew Unlimited artisans help Digital Domain lay scale-model keels for TITANIC| work =DigitalContentProducer.com| publisher =[[Penton Media]]| url =http://www.theasc.com/magazine/dec97/titanic/sb/pg1.htm| accessdate =2007-06-11}}</ref> In an interesting coincidence later that same year, the company was contracted to work on a [[Titanic (tv miniseries)|CBS TV miniseries]] with the same name.<ref>{{Cite web| last= Yanover| first=Neal| title=That Sinking Feeling| work=Variety On Production| format=reprint| date=1997-07-01| url=http://www.visioncrew.com/Press/variety.htm}}</ref>

While the company worked on many feature films, they were much more prolific in the television commercial market, and worked on over forty spots in eight years.<ref>{{Cite news| last=Nightingale| first=Margot| title=New Effects Studio| work=Screen: The Chicago Production Weekly| page=46| date=1995-08-01}}</ref> Their work was featured in ads for the majority of car brands<ref name="Simon">{{cite news| last= Martel| first=William| title=Simon says - visual effects artist Simon Brewster| work=Shoot Magazine| format=reprint| date=1998-12-04| url=http://www.visioncrew.com/Press/lexus-excerpt.htm| accessdate=2007-06-11}}</ref> as well as [[Coca-Cola]], [[Pizza Hut]], and [[Geico]].

In 1998, Jacobs and John Hoffman were nominated for an [[Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects]] for a Miniseries representing VCU's work on HBO's "[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]". 

Vision Crew closed in April 2002. The company attributed its shutdown to a difficult business climate and the founders' interest in pursuing other projects and opportunities.<ref>{{cite press release| title =Vision Crew Unlimited Closes Its Doors| publisher =VFXPro| date =2002-05-07| url =http://www.visioncrew.com/Press/Closure.html| accessdate =2007-06-11}}</ref>
