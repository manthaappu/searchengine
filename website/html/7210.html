Using Apache it should be possible to do mutual authentication in several ways; however the documentation at [http://www.lcfg.org/doc/guide.pdf The Complete Guide to LCFG], Section 9.4: Authorization and Security, shows access control based on IP address ranges, implying that the client does not authenticate itself to the server via an SSL certificate; it also does not mention if the LCFG client checks the validity of the server's SSL certificate (such as via a per-site fingerprint distributed with the client, or a chain of trust to an accredited CA). It mentions that there can be a per-client password in the profile, but also states that ''"The contents of the LCFG profile should be considered public"''.</ref>

== Platform support ==
Note: This means platforms on which a recent version of the tool has actually been used successfully, not platforms where it should theoretically work since it's written in good portable C/C++ or an interpreted language. It should also be listed as a supported platform on the project's web site.

== Short descriptions ==

Not all tools have the same goal and the same feature set. To help distinguish between all of these software packages, here is a short description of each one.

;[[Arusha Project]] (ARK)
:Manage package and configuration specification of hosts via a custom XML description language. Can be used as a front end for [[Cfengine]] or [http://pikt.org/ PIKT]. Provides some collaboration features between administration 'teams'. The last commit dates from [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=ark-commits April 2007].

;[[Bcfg2]]
:Software to manage the configuration of a large number of computers using a central configuration model and the [[client–server model|client–server paradigm]]. The system enables reconciliation between clients' state and the central configuration specification. Detailed reports provide a way to identify unmanaged configuration on hosts. Generators enable code or template based generation of configuration files from a central data repository.

;[[Cfengine]]
:Lightweight agent system. Manages configuration of a large number of computers using the client–server paradigm or stand-alone. Any client state which is different from the policy description is reverted to the desired state. Configuration state is specified via a declarative language. Cfengine's paradigm is convergent [http://www.usenix.org/event/lisa98/full_papers/burgess/burgess.pdf "computer immunology"]

;[[Chef (software)|Chef]]
:Chef is a configuration management tool written in Ruby, and uses a pure Ruby DSL for writing configuration "recipes". Chef can be used as a client–server tool, or used in "solo" mode.

:It is similar to other CCM (computer configuration management) tools such as bcfg2, lcfg, puppet and the well known cfengine. However, it has some unique features that makes it more than just a program which pushes files to other hosts. It integrates: a host database; a version control system; an optional file generation system; a file distribution and remote command execution mechanism.

;[http://etch.sourceforge.net/ Etch]
:Etch uses a client-server or client-only model.  Configuration is defined in XML, Ruby, and embedded Ruby (ERB) templates.  A copy of the original file is provided to the user's configuration scripts, allowing easy idempotent edits to stock files.  In client-server mode clients can submit requests to the server for special configuration, allowing clients to have limited control of their configuration while still ensuring centralized management.

;[http://www.fusioninventory.org/ FusionInventory] with [http://www.glpi-project.org GLPI]
:FusionInventory is a solution for hardware & software inventory with agent or agentless using SNMP (like for computer inventory or switch inventory), Wake On Lan (WOL), Software deployment using OCS Inventory NG protocol and peer to peer download, Network connected devices (using Netbios, nmap and SNMP). It can be used with GLPI directly and other Asset solution (with lib server php intergation).

;[[ISconf]]
:Tool to execute commands and replicate files on all nodes. The nodes do not need to be up; the commands will be executed when they boot. The system has no central server so commands can be launched from any node and they will replicate to all nodes. It implements many of the ideas in "[http://www.infrastructures.org/papers/turing/turing.html Why Order Matters: Turing Equivalence in Automated Systems Administration]".

;[[LCFG]]
:LCFG manages the configuration with a central description language in XML, specifying resources, aspects and profiles. Configuration is deployed using the client–server paradigm. Appropriate scripts on clients (called "components") transcribe the resources into configuration files and restart services as needed.

;[http://www.ocsinventory-ng.org/index.php?page=French OCS Inventory NG] with [http://www.glpi-project.org GLPI]
:OCS Inventory NG, when integrated with GLPI, provides inventory and asset management scans/database, package deployment, distributed script execution, and via plugins permissions management and other configuration management functions. Here is a [http://ocsinventory.sourceforge.net/uploads/images/poster-eng.png good diagram] of its architecture.

;[http://opensymbolic.org/ OpenSymbolic]
:OpenSymbolic is an OpenSource Enterprise Platform designed to build, configure and manage your huge and global distributed data centers. Based on the best open source frameworks for these purposes, represents the state-of-the-art solution for a centralized datacenter management platforms.

;[[opsi (open pc server integration)]]
:opsi (open pc server integration) is a [[desktop management]] software for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] clients based on [[Linux]] servers. It provides automatic [[software deployment]] (distribution), [[unattended installation|unattended OS-Installation]], [[patch]] management, hard- and software inventory, License Management / [[Software Asset Management]] as well as administrative tasks for the [[configuration management]]<ref>http://www.opsi.org/features/</ref>.

;[http://code.google.com/p/pacha Pacha]
:Pacha was designed to be a simple way to backup and manage software configuration files from single or multiple server instances across the network.Written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]], the initial approach is to easily deploy an instance and capture any changes via a version control ([[mercurial]]), giving the System Administrator the ability to rollback and safe guard valid, working configurations.

;[[Pallet (software)|Pallet]]
:Pallet is a provisioning, configuration and management tool written in [[Clojure]]. It uses configuration "crates", that can be functionally composed to configure machines. It requires neither a server, nor an agent on the managed machine.

;[http://info.enstb.org/projets/pcfengine/en/index.html PCfengine]
:This tool aim to be a better [[Cfengine]] written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]. It uses Python directly as a language to describe configuration files. In contrast to Cfengine, it determines automatically the order in which actions are applied in the client. You can read about its [http://enstb.org/~cguychard/pcfengine/pdf/concepts.pdf concepts] and [http://enstb.org/~cguychard/pcfengine/pdf/api.pdf api].

;[[PIKT]]
:PIKT is foremost a monitoring system that also does configuration management. "''PIKT consists of a sophisticated, [[feature-rich]] file preprocessor; an innovative scripting language with unique labor-saving features; a flexible, centrally directed process scheduler; a customizing file installer; a collection of powerful command-line extensions; and other useful tools.''" [http://pikt.org/]

;[[Puppet (software)|Puppet]]
:Puppet consists of a custom declarative language to describe system configuration, distributed using the client–server paradigm (using [[XML-RPC]] protocol in older versions, with a recent switch to [[Representational State Transfer|REST]]), and a library to realize the configuration. The resource abstraction layer enables administrators to describe the configuration in high-level terms, such as users, services and packages. There is support in Puppet for using a pure Ruby DSL as an alternative configuration language in version 2.6.0 and later.

;[[Quattor]]
:"''The quattor information model is based on the distinction between the desired state and the actual state. The desired state is registered in a fabric-wide Configuration Database (CDB), using a specially designed configuration language for expressing and validating configurations, composed out of reusable hierarchical building blocks called templates. Configurations are propagated to and cached on the managed nodes.''" [http://quattor.web.cern.ch/quattor/]

;[[Radmind]]
:Radmind manages hosts configuration at the file system level. In a similar way to [[Tripwire (software)|Tripwire]] (and other configuration management tools), it can detect external changes to managed configuration, and can optionally reverse the changes. Radmind does not have higher-level configuration element (services, packages) abstraction. A graphical interface is available (only) for [[Mac OS X]].

;[[SmartFrog]]
:Java-based tool to deploy and configure applications distributed across multiple machines. There is no central server; you can deploy a .SF configuration file to any node and have it distributed to peer nodes according to the distribution information contained inside the deployment descriptor itself.

;[[Spacewalk (software)|Spacewalk]]
:Spacewalk is an open source Linux and Solaris systems management solution and is the upstream project for the source of Red Hat Network Satellite. Spacewalk works with RHEL, Fedora, and other RHEL derivative distributions like CentOS, Scientific Linux, etc. We are working on getting it packaged for inclusion in Fedora. It allows you to inventory your systems (hardware and software information, install and update software on your systems, collect and distribute your custom software packages into manageable groups, provision your systems (from bare metal via KOAN and cobbler), manage and deploy configuration files to your systems, monitor your systems, provision virtual guests, start/stop/configure virtual guests and delegate all of these actions to organisations with fine grain local or LDAP user controls and system entitlements.

;[http://staf.sourceforge.net STAF]
:"''The Software Testing Automation Framework (STAF) is an open source, multi-platform, multi-language framework designed around the idea of reusable components, called services (such as process invocation, resource management, logging, and monitoring).''" [http://staf.sourceforge.net] There are STAF plugins to perform a variety of common configuration management functions, such as distributed scheduling, execution, and file copying.

;[http://www.heiho.net/synctool/ Synctool]
:Python based command line tool that uses SSH with host-based authentication and rsync to copy an overlay tree to a machine or group of machines. Synctool is designed to be easy to learn and easy to use. Default behaviour is to show a preview of what files would be updated on which machine; then the admin can either view the changes in more detail or deploy them. Synctool was created by [[Stichting Academisch Rekencentrum Amsterdam|SARA]] system expert Walter de Jong.
