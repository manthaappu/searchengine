An '''automated teller machine''' ('''ATM'''), also known as a '''automated banking machine''' ('''ABM''') or '''Cash Machine''' and by several other names (see below), is a computerised telecommunications device that provides the [[customer|clients]] of a [[financial institution]] with access to [[financial transaction]]s in a public space without the need for a cashier, human clerk or [[bank teller]].

On most modern ATMs, the customer is identified by inserting a plastic [[ATM card]] with a [[magnetic stripe]] or a plastic [[smart card]] with a [[Integrated circuit|chip]], that contains a unique card number and some security information such as an expiration date or [[Card Security Code|CVVC]] (CVV). Authentication is provided by the customer entering a [[personal identification number]] (PIN).

Using an ATM, customers can access their bank [[Deposit account|account]]s in order to make [[cash]] withdrawals, [[credit card]] cash advances, and check their account balances as well as purchase prepaid cellphone credit. If the currency being withdrawn from the ATM is different from that which the bank account is denominated in (e.g.: Withdrawing Japanese Yen from a bank account containing US Dollars), the money will be converted at a wholesale [[exchange rate]].  Thus, ATMs often provide the best possible exchange rate for foreign travelers<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16994358/ MSN.com]</ref> and are heavily used for this purpose as well.

ATMs are known by various other names including '''automatic banking machine''' (or ''automated banking machine'' particularly in the [[United States]]) ('''ABM'''), ''automated transaction machine'',<ref>Automated Transaction Machine, US patent 6,945,457</ref> ''cashpoint'' (particularly in the [[United Kingdom]], where it is a trademark of [[Lloyds TSB]]), ''money machine'', ''bank machine'', ''cash machine'', ''hole-in-the-wall'', ''autoteller'' (after the [[Bank of Scotland]]'s usage), ''cashline machine'' (after the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]]'s usage), ''MAC Machine'' (in the [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Philadelphia]] areas), ''Pass Machine'' in [[Ireland]], ''Bankomat'' (in various countries particularly in [[Europe]] and including [[Russia]]), ''[[Multibanco]]'' (after a registered trade mark, in [[Portugal]]), ''Minibank'' in [[Norway]], ''Geld Automaat'' in [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], and ''All Time Money'' in [[India]].

==History==
[[Image:Früher Bankautomat von Nixdorf.jpg|thumb|left|An old [[Nixdorf Computer AG|Nixdorf]] ATM]]

The idea of self-service in retail banking developed through independent and simultaneous efforts in Japan, Sweden, the United States and the United Kingdom. In the USA, [[Luther George Simjian]] has been credited with developing and building the first cash dispenser machine.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/simjian.html Inventor of the Week: Luther George Simjian] [[MIT]]</ref> There is strong evidence to suggest that Simjian worked on this device before 1959 while his 132nd patent (US3079603) was first filed on 30 June 1960 (and granted 26 February 1963). The rollout of this machine, called Bankograph, was delayed a couple of years. This was due in part to Simjian's Reflectone Electronics Inc. being acquired by Universal Match Corporation.<ref>'Universal Match Maps Acquisition’, The New York Times, 22 March 1961</ref> An experimental Bankograph was installed in [[New York City]] in 1961 by the [[Citibank|City Bank of New York]], but removed after 6 months due to the lack of customer acceptance. The Bankograph was an automated envelope deposit machine (accepting coins, cash and cheques) and it did not have cash dispensing features.<ref>‘Machine Accepts Cash Deposits’, The New York Times, 12 April 1961</ref> The Bankograph, however, embodied the preoccupation by US banks in finding alternative means to capture core deposits, while the concern of European and Asian banks was cash distribution.

A first cash dispensing device was used in Tokyo in 1966.<ref>'Fast Machine with a Buck', Pacific Stars and Stripes, p. 7, 14 July 1966</ref><ref>‘Instant Cash via Credit Cards’, ABA Banking Journal, p. 99, January 1967</ref> Although little is known of this first device, it seems to have been activated with a credit card rather than accessing current account balances. This technology had no immediate consequence in the international market.

[[File:atmplaque.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Plaque commemorating installation of world's first bank cash machine]]
In simultaneous and independent efforts, engineers in Sweden and Britain developed their own cash machines during the early 1960s. The first of these that was put into use was by [[Barclays Bank]] in [[Enfield Town]] in [[North London]], [[United Kingdom]],<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2007/06/26/cash_machine_feature.shtml | title = Enfield's cash gift to the world | publisher = [[BBC London]] | date = 27 June 2007 }}</ref> on 27 June 1967. This machine was the first in the UK and was used by English comedy actor [[Reg Varney]], at the time so as to ensure maximum publicity for the machines that were to become mainstream in the UK. This instance of the [[invention]] has been credited to [[John Shepherd-Barron]],<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6230194.stm | title = The man who invented the cash machine | publisher = BBC News | date=25 June 2007 | accessdate=26 April 2010 | first=Brian | last=Milligan}}</ref> while disregarding other engineers at [[De La Rue|De La Rue Instruments]], since 2008 [http://www.talaris.com Talaris], who contributed to the design and development of that machine. Nevertheless, Shepherd-Barron was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in the 2005 [[New Year's Honours List]].<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4135269.stm | title = ATM inventor honoured | publisher = BBC News | date=31 December 2004 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref> His design used special checks that were matched with a personal identification number, as plastic bank cards had not yet been invented.<ref name="latimes1">{{Cite news

The Barclays-De La Rue machine (called De La Rue Automatic Cash System or DACS) beat the [[List of banks in Sweden|Swedish saving banks’]] and a company called Metior's (a device called Bankomat) by nine days and [[National Westminster Bank|Westminster Bank’s]]-[[Smiths Group|Smith Industries]]-[[Chubb Locks|Chubb]] system (called Chubb MD2) by a month. The collaboration of a small start-up called Speytec and [[Midland Bank]] developed a third machine which was marketed after 1969 in Europe and the USA by the [[Burroughs Corporation]]. The patent for this device (GB1329964) was filed on September 1969 (and granted in 1973) by John David Edwards, Leonard Perkins, John Henry Donald, Peter Lee Chappell, Sean Benjamin Newcombe & Malcom David Roe.

Both the DACS and MD2 accepted only a single-use token or voucher which was retained by the machine while the Speytec worked with a card with a magnetic stripe at the back. Hence all this these worked on various principles including [[radiation|Carbon-14]] and
low-coercivity [[magnetism]] in order to make fraud more difficult. The idea of a PIN stored on the card was developed by a British
engineer working in the MD2 named [[James Goodfellow]] in 1965 (patent GB1197183 filed on 2 May 1966 with Anthony Davies). The essence of this system was that is it enabled the verification of the customer with the debited account without human intervention. This patent is also the earliest instance of a complete “currency dispenser system” in the patent record. This patent was filled on 5 March 1968 in the USA (US 3543904) and granted on 1 December 1970. It had a profound influence on the industry as a whole. Not only did future entrants into the cash dispenser market such as [[NCR Corporation]] and [[IBM]] licence Goodfellow’s PIN system, but a number of later patents references this patent as “Prior Art Device”.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4668724 | title = Evidence from the patent record on the development of cash dispensing technology | by B. Batiz-Lazo and R. J. K. Reid | publisher = History of Telecommunications Conference, 2008. Histelcon 2008. IEEE}}</ref>

After looking first hand at the experiences in Europe, in 1968 the networked ATM was pioneered in the US, in [[Dallas]], Texas, by [[Donald Wetzel]], who was a department head at an automated baggage-handling company called Docutel.  On September 2, 1969, [[Chemical Bank]] installed the first ATM in the U.S. at its branch in [[Rockville Centre, New York]].  The first ATMs were designed to dispense a fixed amount of cash when a user inserted a specially coded card.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=XZMrIchANY4C&pg=PA266 1969: the year everything changed].  Skyhorse Publishing Inc., 2009</ref>  A Chemical Bank advertisement boasted "On Sept. 2 our bank will open at 9:00 and never close again."<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=BtEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA84 50 Inventions].  Popular Mechanics, December 2005</ref>  Chemicals' ATM, initially known as a Docuteller was designed by [[Donald Wetzel]] and his company [[Docutel]].  Chemical executives were initially hesitant about the electronic banking transition given the high cost of the early machines.  Additionally, executives were concerned that customers would resist having machines handling their money.<ref>[http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/comphist/wetzel.htm Smithsonian : Interview with Don Wetzel]</ref>  In 1995, the [[Smithsonian National Museum of American History]] recognised Docutel and Wetzel as the inventors of the networked ATM.<ref>[http://www.thocp.net/hardware/atm.htm Wetzel recognized by Docutel and Smithsonian]</ref>

ATMs first came into use in December 1972 in the UK; the IBM 2984 was designed at the request of [[Lloyds Bank]]. The 2984 CIT (Cash Issuing Terminal) was the first true Cashpoint, similar in function to today's machines; Cashpoint is still a [[registered trademark]] of Lloyds TSB in the UK. All were online and issued a variable amount which was immediately deducted from the account. A small number of 2984s were supplied to a US bank. Notable historical models of ATMs include the [[IBM 3624]] and [[IBM 473x|473x]] series, [[Diebold 10xx]] and [[TABS 9000]] series, and [[NCR 50xx]] series.

==Location==
[[Image:ATM pinpad in german.jpg|thumb|left|An ATM Encrypting PIN Pad (EPP) with [[German language|German]] markings]]

ATMs are placed not only near or inside the premises of banks, but also in locations such as shopping centers/malls, airports, grocery stores, petrol/gas stations, restaurants, or any place large numbers of people may gather. These represent two types of ATM installations: on and off premise. On premise ATMs are typically more advanced, multi-function machines that complement an actual bank branch's capabilities and thus more expensive. Off premise machines are deployed by financial institutions and also ISOs (or Independent Sales Organizations) where there is usually just a straight need for cash, so they typically are the cheaper mono-function devices. In Canada, when an ATM is not operated by a financial institution it is known as a [[White Label ATMs in Canada|"White Label ATM"]].

In North America, banks often have [[drive-thru]] lanes providing access to ATMs.

Many ATMs have a sign above them indicating the name of the bank or organization owning the ATM, and possibly including the list of ATM networks to which that machine is connected. This type of sign is called a ''topper''.
{{Clear}}

==Financial networks==
[[Image:Geldautomaat.jpg|thumb|right|An ATM in the [[Netherlands]]. The [[logo]]s of a number of [[interbank network]]s this ATM is connected to are shown.]]
Most ATMs are connected to [[interbank network]]s, enabling people to withdraw and deposit money from machines not belonging to the bank where they have their account or in the country where their accounts are held (enabling cash withdrawals in local currency). Some examples of interbank networks include [[Pulse (interbank network)|PULSE]], [[PLUS]], [[Cirrus (interbank network)|Cirrus]], [[Interac]], Interswitch, [[STAR (interbank network)|STAR]], and [[LINK (UK)|LINK]].

ATMs rely on [[authorization]] of a [[financial transaction]] by the card issuer or other authorizing institution via the communications network. This is often performed through an [[ISO 8583]] messaging system.

Many banks charge [[ATM usage fees]]. In some cases, these fees are charged solely to users who are not customers of the bank where the ATM is installed; in other cases, they apply to all users.

In order to allow a more diverse range of devices to attach to their networks, some interbank networks have passed rules expanding the definition of an ATM to be a terminal that either has the vault within its footprint or utilizes the vault or cash drawer within the merchant establishment, which allows for the use of a [[scrip cash dispenser]].

[[Image:Diebold 1063 ATM with modem.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Diebold 1063]]ix with a dial-up modem visible at the base]]
[[File:Cash Machine in Trogir.JPG|thumb|ATM in Trogir, Croatia]]
ATMs typically connect directly to their host or [[ATMC|ATM Controller]] via either [[ADSL]] or dial-up [[modem]] over a [[telephone]] line or directly via a leased line. Leased lines are preferable to [[plain old telephone service|POTS]] lines because they require less time to establish a connection. Leased lines may be comparatively expensive to operate versus a POTS line, meaning less-trafficked machines will usually rely on a dial-up modem. That dilemma may be solved as high-speed Internet [[VPN]] connections become more ubiquitous. Common lower-level layer communication protocols used by ATMs to communicate back to the bank include [[Systems Network Architecture|SNA]] over [[Synchronous Data Link Control|SDLC]], [[TC500]] over [[Asynchronous communication|Async]], [[X.25]], and [[TCP/IP]] over [[Ethernet]].

In addition to methods employed for transaction security and secrecy, all communications traffic between the ATM and the Transaction Processor may also be encrypted via methods such as [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]].<ref>[http://www.ebcvg.com/press.php?id=794 Eicon Networks Develops SSL-VPN For Secure Remote Working] IT Observer</ref>

==Global use==
There are no hard international or government-compiled numbers totaling the complete number of ATMs in use worldwide. Estimates developed by [[ATMIA]] place the number of ATMs in use currently at over 1.8 million.<ref>[http://www.atmia.com/mig/globalatmclock/ ATM Industry Association Global ATM Clock]</ref>

For the purpose of analyzing ATM usage around the world, financial institutions generally divide the world into seven regions, due to the penetration rates, usage statistics, and features deployed. Four regions (USA, Canada, Europe, and Japan) have high numbers of ATMs per million people.<ref>[http://www.interac.org/en_n3_31_abmstats.html Statistics - ABM Stats] [[Interac]] website</ref> and generally slowing growth rates.<ref>[http://www.bis.org/publ/cpss74.htm Statistics on payment and settlement systems in selected countries - Figures for 2004] [[Bank for International Settlements]]</ref> Despite the large number of ATMs, there is additional demand for machines in the Asia/Pacific area as well as in Latin America.<ref>[http://www.bis.org/cpss/paysysinfo.htm Central bank payment system information] [[Bank for International Settlements]]</ref><ref>[http://www.eiu.com/site_info.asp?info_name=eiu_Visa_accessing_payments_systems_Latin_America Assessing payments systems in Latin America] [[The Economist]] Intelligence Unit Limited</ref> ATMs have yet to reach high numbers in the Near East/Africa.<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.bis.org/events/cbcd06e.pdf Financial access and financial stability]|69.5 KB}} [[Bank for International Settlements]], Penelope Hawkins</ref>

While ATMs are ubiquitous on modern [[cruise ships]], ATMs can also be found on some [[US Navy]] ships.<ref>[http://www.fms.treas.gov/news/press/navycash.html Navy/Marine Cash - Next Generation ATMs-at-Sea Rolls Out] [[United States Department of the Treasury]] website</ref>

In the [[United Kingdom]], an ATM may be colloquially referred to as a "Cashpoint",<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/radio/specials/1728_uptodate/page27.shtml BBC World Service] - Learning English</ref> named after the Lloyds Bank ATM brand, or "hole-in-the-wall", after which the equivalent [[Barclays]] brand was later named. In [[Scotland]] the term [[Cashline]] has become a generic term for an ATM, based on the branding from the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]].

In the [[Republic of Ireland]], ATMs are also commonly referred to as a "[[Banklink]]", named after the [[Allied Irish Bank]] brand of [[machine]]s.

In [[Israel]], ATMs are commonly referred to as "[[Kaspomat]]" ([[Hebrew]]: כספומט), which is a compound word meaning "automatic money" in [[Hebrew]], named after the [[Bank Leumi]] & [[Israel Discount Bank]] brand of [[machine]]s.

==Hardware==
[[Image:Atm blockdiagram.png|thumb|right|A block diagram of an ATM]]

An ATM is typically made up of the following devices:
* [[CPU]] (to control the user interface and transaction devices)
* [[Magnetic stripe card|Magnetic]] and/or [[Chip card]] reader (to identify the customer)
* [[Personal identification number|PIN]] Pad (similar in layout to a [[Touch tone]] or [[Calculator]] keypad), often manufactured as part of a secure enclosure.
* [[Secure cryptoprocessor]], generally within a secure enclosure.
* Display (used by the customer for performing the transaction)
* [[Function key]] buttons (usually close to the display) or a [[Touchscreen]] (used to select the various aspects of the transaction)

* Record Printer (to provide the customer with a record of their transaction)
* [[Bank vault|Vault]] (to store the parts of the machinery requiring restricted access)
* Housing (for aesthetics and to attach signage to)

Recently, due to heavier computing demands and the falling price of computer-like architectures, ATMs have moved away from custom hardware architectures using [[microcontroller]]s and/or [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s to adopting the hardware architecture of a [[personal computer]], such as, USB connections for peripherals, ethernet and IP communications, and use personal computer operating systems. Although it is undoubtedly cheaper to use [[commercial off-the-shelf]] hardware, it does make ATMs potentially vulnerable to the same sort of problems exhibited by conventional computers.

Business owners often lease ATM terminals from ATM service providers.

[[Image:Two Loomis Employees Refilling an ATM at the Downtown Seattle REI.jpg|thumb|right|Two [[Securitas AB|Loomis]] employees refilling an ATM at the Downtown [[Seattle]] [[REI]].]]

The vault of an ATM is within the footprint of the device itself and is where items of value are kept. [[Scrip cash dispenser]]s do not incorporate a vault.

Mechanisms found inside the vault may include:
* Dispensing mechanism (to provide [[cash]] or other items of value)
* Deposit mechanism including a Check Processing Module and Bulk Note Acceptor (to allow the customer to make deposits)
* Security sensors (Magnetic, Thermal, Seismic, gas)
* Locks: (to ensure controlled access to the contents of the vault)
* Journaling systems; many are electronic (a sealed flash memory device based on proprietary standards) or a solid-state device (an actual printer) which accrues all records of activity including access timestamps, number of bills dispensed, etc. - This is considered sensitive data and is secured in similar fashion to the cash as it is a similar liability.

ATM vaults are supplied by manufacturers in several grades. Factors influencing vault grade selection include cost, weight, regulatory requirements, ATM type, operator risk avoidance practices, and internal volume requirements.<ref>[http://www.atmdepot.com/help.aspx#f4 ATMDepot.com questions and answers] www.atmdepot.com</ref>  Industry standard vault configurations include [[Underwriters Laboratories]] [[UL-291]] "Business Hours" and Level 1 Safes,<ref>[http://ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com/scopes/scopes.asp?fn=0291.html "Automated Teller Systems - UL 291"] [[Underwriters Laboratories]] website</ref> [[RAL (standards institute)|RAL]] TL-30 derivatives,<ref>[http://www.ncr.com/en/products/hardware/hw_atm_p75_ts_product.htm "NCR Personas 75 Technical Specification"] [[NCR Corporation|NCR]] website</ref> and CEN EN 1143-1:2005 - CEN III/VdS and CEN IV/LGAI/VdS.<ref>[http://www.cenorm.be/catweb/13.310.htm "CEN On-line catalogue - ICS: 13.310 Protection against crime"] [[Comité Européen de Normalisation]]</ref><ref>[http://www.bsonline.bsi-global.com/search/item/1928003 Item Summary] [[British Standards Institution]]</ref>

ATM manufacturers recommend that vaults be attached to the floor to prevent theft.<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.tritonatm.com/en/service/manuals/07100-00008F%20(9100UsrMan(5.0)).pdf ''Model 9100 ATM User / Installation Manual'']}}</ref>

==Software==
[[Image:Atm os2warp.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Suncorp Metway]] ATM running [[OS/2]]]]
With the migration to commodity PC hardware, standard commercial "off-the-shelf" operating systems and programming environments can be used inside of ATMs. Typical platforms previously used in ATM development include [[RMX (operating system)|RMX]] or [[OS/2]]. Today the vast majority of ATMs worldwide use a [[Microsoft]] OS, primarily [[Windows XP Professional]] or [[Windows XP Embedded]].

A small number of deployments may still be running older versions such as [[Windows NT]], [[Windows CE]] or [[Windows 2000]]. Notably, [[Windows Vista|Vista]] was not widely adopted in ATMs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} There is a computer industry security view or consensus that desktop operating systems have greater risks as operating systems for cash dispensing machines than other types of operating systems like (Secure) Real Time Operating Systems ([[RTOS]]s). [[RISKS Digest]] has many articles about cash machine operating system vulnerabilities [http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/php/risks/search.php?query=cash+machine].

[[Image:Postomat-Windows-p1020441.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Wincor Nixdorf]] ATM running [[Windows 2000]]]]
[[Linux]] is also finding some reception in the ATM marketplace. An example of this is [[Banrisul]], the largest bank in the south of [[Brazil]], which has replaced the [[MS-DOS]] operating systems in its ATMs with Linux. [[Banco do Brasil]] is also migrating ATMs to Linux.

Common application layer transaction protocols, such as [[Diebold]] 91x (911 or 912) and [[NCR Corporation|NCR]] [[NCR Corporation|NDC or NDC+]] provide [[Hardware emulation|emulation]] of older generations of hardware on newer platforms with incremental extensions made over time to address new capabilities, although companies like NCR continuously improve these protocols issuing newer versions (e.g. NCR's AANDC v3.x.y, where x.y are subversions). Most major ATM manufacturers provide software packages that implement these protocols. Newer protocols such as [[Interactive Financial Exchange|IFX]] have yet to find wide acceptance by transaction processors.<ref>[http://www.selfserviceworld.com/article.php?id=1252 "Messaging standard to give multiple channels a common language"]</ref>

With the move to a more standardized software base, financial institutions have been increasingly interested in the ability to pick and choose the application programs that drive their equipment. [[WOSA/XFS]], now known as [[CEN/XFS|CEN XFS (or simply XFS)]], provides a common [[API]] for accessing and manipulating the various devices of an ATM.  [[J/XFS]] is a Java implementation of the CEN XFS API.<ref>[http://jxfs.net/ J/XFS homepage]</ref>

While the perceived benefit of XFS is similar to the Java's [[Write once run anywhere|"Write once, run anywhere"]] mantra, often different ATM hardware vendors have different interpretations of the XFS standard. The result of these differences in interpretation means that ATM applications typically use a [[middleware]] to even out the differences between various platforms.

With the onset of Windows operating systems and XFS on ATM's, the software applications have the ability to become more intelligent.  This has created a new breed of ATM applications commonly referred to as programmable applications.  These types of applications allows for an entirely new host of applications in which the ATM terminal can do more than only communicate with the ATM switch.  It is now empowered to connected to other content servers and [[video banking]] systems.

Notable ATM software that operates on XFS platforms include Triton PRISM, [[Diebold]] Agilis EmPower, [[NCR Corporation|NCR]] [[NCR Corporation|APTRA Edge]], CR2 BankWorld, KAL Kalignite, Phoenix Interactive VISTAatm, and [[Wincor Nixdorf]] [[Wincor Nixdorf|ProTopas]].

With the move of ATMs to industry-standard computing environments, concern has risen about the integrity of the ATM's software stack.<ref>[http://www.technewsworld.com/story/32350.html "Windows Cash-Machine Worm Generates Concern"] www.technewsworld.com, Jay Lyman, 12/09/03</ref>

==Security==
[[Image:49024-SOS-ATM.JPG|thumb|right|A Triton brand ATM with a dip style card reader and a triple DES keypad]]
[[Security]], as it relates to ATMs, has several dimensions. ATMs also provide a practical demonstration of a number of security systems and concepts operating together and how various security concerns are dealt with.

===Physical===
[[Image:Procash stolen 1.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Wincor Nixdorf]] Procash 2100xe Frontload that was opened with an [[angle grinder]]]]
Early ATM security focused on making the ATMs invulnerable to physical attack; they were effectively safes with dispenser mechanisms. A number of attacks on ATMs resulted, with thieves attempting to steal entire ATMs by [[ram-raiding]].<ref>[http://www.atmmarketplace.com/article.php?id=6736 "An end to ram raids?"]</ref> Since late 1990s, criminal groups operating in Japan improved ram-raiding by stealing and using a truck loaded with a heavy construction machinery to effectively demolish or uproot an entire ATM and any housing to steal its cash.<ref>[http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inimr-ri.nsf/en/gr114141e.html "STAT-USA Market Research Reports - ATM Thefts"] US [[Economics and Statistics Administration]] report summary via [[Industry Canada]]</ref>

Another attack method, [[plofkraak]], is to seal all openings of the ATM with [[silicone]] and fill the vault with a combustible gas or to place an explosive inside, attached, or near the ATM.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_2356341,00.html |title=ATM bombings up 3000% |accessdate=2008-07-29 |date=2008-07-12 |publisher=News24}}</ref> This gas or explosive is ignited and the vault is opened or distorted by the force of the resulting explosion and the criminals can break in.

Modern ATM physical security, per other modern money-handling security, concentrates on denying the use of the money inside the machine to a thief, by means of techniques such as [[dye marker]]s and [[smoke canister]]s.

A common method is to simply rob the staff filling the machine with money. To avoid this, the schedule for filling them is kept secret, varying and random. The money is often kept in cassettes, which will dye the money if incorrectly opened.

===Transactional secrecy and integrity===
The security of ATM transactions relies mostly on the integrity of the secure [[cryptoprocessor]]: the ATM often uses commodity components that are not considered to be "[[trusted system]]s".

Encryption of personal information, required by law in many jurisdictions, is used to prevent fraud. Sensitive data in ATM transactions are usually [[encryption|encrypted]] with [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]], but transaction processors now usually require the use of [[Triple DES]].<ref>[http://www.atmmarketplace.com/research.htm?article_id=25059&pavilion=126&step=story "Getting Triple DES compliant"] www.atmmarketplace.com</ref> Remote Key Loading techniques may be used to ensure the secrecy of the initialization of the encryption keys in the ATM. [[Message Authentication Code]] (MAC) or [[Partial MAC]] may also be used to ensure messages have not been tampered with while in transit between the ATM and the financial network.

===Customer identity integrity===
[[Image:Japanese ATM Palm Scanner.jpg|thumb|right|A [[The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ|BTMU]] ATM with a [[palm scanner]] (to the right of the screen)]]

There have also been a number of incidents of fraud by [[Man-in-the-middle attack]]s, where criminals have attached fake keypads or card readers to existing machines. These have then been used to record customers' PINs and bank card information in order to gain unauthorized access to their accounts. Various ATM manufacturers have put in place countermeasures to protect the equipment they manufacture from these threats.<ref>[http://www.atmmarketplace.com/article.php?id=7000&na=1 "The No. 1 ATM security concern"] www.atmmarketplace.com</ref><ref>{{PDFlink|[http://buy.cuna.org/download/diebold_fraudpaper.pdf "ATM Fraud And Security White Paper"]|126 KB}} a [[Diebold]] report via [[Credit Union National Association]]</ref>

===Device operation integrity===
[[Image:Worn ATM.jpg|thumb|ATMs that are exposed to the outside must be vandal and weather resistant.]]
Openings on the customer-side of ATMs are often covered by mechanical shutters to prevent tampering with the mechanisms when they are not in use. Alarm sensors are placed inside the ATM and in ATM servicing areas to alert their operators when doors have been opened by unauthorized personnel.

Rules are usually set by the government or ATM operating body that dictate what happens when integrity systems fail. Depending on the jurisdiction, a bank may or may not be liable when an attempt is made to dispense a customer's money from an ATM and the money either gets outside of the ATM's vault, or was exposed in a non-secure fashion, or they are unable to determine the state of the money after a failed transaction.<ref>[http://www.kuluttajavirasto.fi/user_nf/default_mag.asp?id=12263&lmf=11440&mode=readdoc&tmf=11440 "Consumer Complaint Board: Banks also responsible for the success of ATM withdrawals abroad"] [[Kuluttajavirasto]] ([[Finland|Finnish]] Consumer Agency & Ombudsman)</ref> Bank customers often complain that banks have made it difficult to recover money lost in this way, but this is often complicated by the bank's own internal policies regarding suspicious activities typical of the criminal element.<ref>[http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/Banking/P57803.asp "New reasons to guard your ATM card"] [[Christian Science Monitor]] via [[MSN]]</ref>

===Customer security===
[[Image:ATMs In A Van.jpg|thumb|right|Dunbar Armored ATM Techs watching over ATMs that have been installed in a [[van]].]]
In some countries, multiple [[security camera]]s and [[security guard]]s are a common feature.<ref>[http://www.banking.state.ny.us/legal/atmsafe.htm "Text of the ATM Safety Act"] [[State of New York]] Banking Department</ref> In the [[United States]], The [[New York]] State Comptroller's Office has criticized the New York State Department of Banking for not following through on safety inspections of ATMs in high crime areas.<ref>[http://www.osc.state.ny.us/press/releases/oct07/100407.htm DiNapoli Calls for Better Oversight of Bank ATMs]</ref>

Critics of ATM operators assert that the issue of customer security appears to have been abandoned by the banking industry;<ref>[http://www.atmmarketplace.com/research.htm?article_id=5171&pavilion=4&step=story "Consultants Call for Increased ATM Security Measures"] www.atmmarketplace.com, Jane Blake, 4 December 2000</ref> it has been suggested that efforts are now more concentrated on deterrent legislation than on solving the problem of forced withdrawals.<ref>[http://www.atmmarketplace.com/news_story.htm?i=20479 "Politics (not) as usual, with ATMIA's help"] www.atmmarketplace.com, John McGill, 7 September 2004</ref>

At least as far back as July 30, 1986, critics of the industry have called for the adoption of an emergency PIN system for ATMs, where the user is able to send a [[panic alarm|silent alarm]] in response to a threat.<ref>See comments of Representative Mario Biaggi, Congressional Record, July 30, 1986, Page 18232 et seq.</ref> Legislative efforts to require an emergency PIN system have appeared in [[Illinois]],<ref>[http://www.obre.state.il.us/AGENCY/News/atmrpt.htm "ATM Report"] [[Illinois]] Department of Financial and Professional Regulation</ref> [[Kansas]]<ref>[http://www.cunews.com/newsletters/2004216.htm "CU t-t News - 2/16/04"] [[Credit Union National Association]]</ref> and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]],<ref>[http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/2005_06/versions/sb379_SB_379_PF_2.htm "06 LC 34 0466 - Senate Bill 379 PRE-FILE] [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] General Assembly</ref> but none have succeeded as of yet.
In January 2009, Senate Bill 1355 was proposed in the Illinois Senate that revisits the issue of the reverse emergency PIN system.<ref>[http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=1355&GAID=10&DocTypeID=SB&LegId=42570&SessionID=76&GA=96 ILGA.gov]</ref>  The bill is again resisted by the banking lobby and supported by the police.<ref>[http://www.pjstar.com/news/x1745367387/ATM-software-aimed-at-reversing-crime PJstar.com]</ref>
In 1998 three towns outside of Cleveland Ohio, in response to an ATM crime wave, adopted ATM Consumer Security Legislation requiring that a 9-1-1 switch be installed at all outside ATMs within their jurisdiction.  Since the passing of these laws 11 years ago, there have been no repeat crimes.  In the wake of an ATM Murder in Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania, The City Council of Sharon Hill passed an ATM Consumer Security Bill as well, with the same result. As of July 2009, ATM Consumer Security Legislation is currently pending in New York, New Jersey, and Washington D.C.
In China, many efforts to promote security have been made. On-premises ATMs are often located inside the bank's lobby which may be accessible 24 hours a day. These lobbies have extensive CCTV coverage, an emergency telephone and a security guard on the premises. Bank lobbies that aren't guarded 24 hours a day may also have secure doors that can only be opened from outside by swiping your bank card against a wall-mounted scanner, allowing the bank to identify who enters the building. Most ATMs will also display on-screen safety warnings and may also be fitted with convex mirrors above the display allowing the user to see what is happening behind them.

Although ATMs were originally developed as just cash dispensers, they have evolved to include many other bank-related functions. In some countries, especially those which benefit from a fully integrated cross-bank ATM network (e.g.: [[Multibanco]] in Portugal), ATMs include many functions which are not directly related to the management of one's own bank account, such as:
* Deposit currency recognition, acceptance, and recycling<ref>[http://www.selfserviceworld.com/article.php?id=15827&site=5&prc= Rising interest rates, gas prices hit vault-cash providers]</ref><ref>[http://www.fujitsu.com/global/news/pr/archives/month/2004/20040318.html NCR and Fujitsu Develop Cash Deposit and Bill Recycling Module for ATMs] [[Fujitsu]]</ref>

Increasingly banks are seeking to use the ATM as a sales device to deliver pre approved loans and targeted advertising using products such as ITM (the Intelligent Teller Machine) from CR2 or Aptra Relate from NCR.
ATMs can also act as an advertising channel for companies to advertise their own products or third-party products and services.<ref>[http://www.creativematch.co.uk/?action=viewnews&ni=90724 Bank puts the 'fun' into 'funds']</ref>

In Canada, ATMs are called ''guichets automatiques'' in [[French language|French]] and sometimes "Bank Machines" in English. The [[Interac]] shared cash network does not allow for the selling of goods from ATMs due to specific security requirements for PIN entry when buying goods.<ref>[http://www.interac.org/en_n3_14_consumersfaq.html "Consumers' FAQ, IDP Point 4"] [[Interac]]</ref>  CIBC machines in Canada, are able to top-up the minutes on certain pay as you go phones.

==Reliability==
[[Image:DeLaRue ATM Crash.jpg|thumb|left|An ATM running [[Microsoft Windows]] that has [[blue screen of death|crashed]]]]

Before an ATM is placed in a public place, it typically has undergone extensive testing with both [[Test Money|test money]] and the [[backend]] computer systems that allow it to perform transactions. Banking customers also have come to expect high reliability in their ATMs,<ref>[http://www.managementjournals.com/journals/marketing/article27-p5.htm Barking Up the Wrong Tree – Factors Influencing Customer Satisfaction in Retail Banking in the UK - Page 5] [[International Management Journals]]</ref> which provides incentives to ATM providers to minimize machine and network failures. Financial consequences of incorrect machine operation also provide high degrees of incentive to minimize malfunctions.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,875749,00.html "ATM gives out free cash and lands family in court"] [[Guardian Unlimited]]</ref>

ATMs and the supporting electronic financial networks are generally very reliable, with industry benchmarks typically producing 98.25% customer availability for ATMs<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.ncr.com/en/self-service/services_v_1.pdf "Uptime in Real Time"]}} [[NCR Corportation|NCR]] publication</ref> and up to 99.999% availability for host systems. If ATMs do go out of service, customers could be left without the ability to make transactions until the beginning of their bank's next time of opening hours.

This said, not all errors are to the detriment of customers; there have been cases of machines giving out money without debiting the account, or giving out higher value notes as a result of incorrect [[denomination (currency)|denomination]] of [[banknote]] being loaded in the money cassettes. Errors that can occur may be [[Machine|mechanical]] (such as card transport mechanisms; keypads; [[hard disk failure]]s); [[software]] (such as [[operating system]]; [[device driver]]; [[application software|application]]); [[information transfer|communications]]; or purely down to operator error.
[[Image:ATM OS2 Crash.jpg|thumb|right|An ATM running [[OS/2]] that has crashed]]
To aid in reliability, some ATMs print each transaction to a roll paper journal that is stored inside the ATM, which allows both the users of the ATMs and the related financial institutions to settle things based on the records in the journal in case there is a dispute. In some cases, transactions are posted to an electronic journal to remove the cost of supplying journal paper to the ATM and for more convenient searching of data.

Improper money checking can cause the possibility of a customer receiving [[counterfeit]] banknotes from an ATM. While bank personnel are generally trained better at spotting and removing counterfeit cash,<ref>[http://www.ottawabusinessjournal.com/286598582617402.php BoC program gives merchants upper hand on counterfeiters] [[Ottawa Business Journal]]</ref><ref>[http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/banknotes/education/index.htm The Bank of Canada offers a range of free materials that explain the security features in genuine bills.] [[Bank of Canada]]</ref> the resulting ATM money supplies used by banks provide no absolute guarantee for proper banknotes, as the [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Federal Criminal Police Office of Germany]] has confirmed that there are regularly incidents of false banknotes having been dispensed through bank ATMs.<ref>[http://www.stern.de/wirtschaft/geldanlage/:Falschgeld-Bl%FCten-Geldautomat/523625.html Blüten aus dem Geldautomat?] [[Stern (magazine)|Stern]].de report of 2004-05-05 (in German)</ref> Some ATMs may be stocked and wholly owned by outside companies, which can further complicate this problem.
[[Bill validator|Bill validation]] technology can be used by ATM providers to help ensure the authenticity of the cash before it is stocked in an ATM; ATMs that have cash recycling capabilities include this capability.<ref>[http://www.wincor-nixdorf.com/internet/com/Products/CashSystems/CashRecycling/ProCash3100/index.html Welcome to Wincor Nixdorf] [[Wincor Nixdorf]] website describing [[Cash Recycling]]</ref>

==Fraud==
As with any device containing objects of value, ATMs and the systems they depend on to function are the targets of fraud. Fraud against ATMs and people's attempts to use them takes several forms.

The first known instance of a fake ATM was installed at a shopping mall in [[Manchester, Connecticut]] in 1993. By modifying the inner workings of a [[Fujitsu]] model [[Fujitsu 7020|7020]] ATM, a criminal gang known as The Bucklands Boys were able to steal information from cards inserted into the machine by customers.<ref>[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.05/atm_pr.html The Bucklands Boys and Other Tales of the ATM]</ref>

In some cases, bank fraud could occur at ATMs whereby the bank accidentally stocks the ATM with bills in the wrong denomination, therefore giving the customer more money than should be dispensed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/3667279.stm Double money in cash point error] [[BBC]]</ref> The result of receiving too much money may be influenced on the card holder agreement in place between the customer and the bank.<ref>[http://www.rbcroyalbank.com/cards/documentation/ch_agreements/ch_agree_client.html Client Agreement – Client Card and Personal Identification Number] [[Royal Bank of Canada]] Client Card Cardholder Agreement</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4552288.stm "Mad rush to faulty ATM in France"] [[BBC]] report about a cash machine not being stocked correctly</ref>

In a variation of this, [[WAVY-TV]] reported an incident in Virginia Beach of September 2006 where a hacker who had probably obtained a factory-default admin password for a gas station's white label ATM caused the unit to assume it was loaded with $5 USD bills instead of $20s, enabling himself&mdash;and many subsequent customers&mdash;to walk away with four times the money they said they wanted to withdraw.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/video/player/player.html?url=/video/tech/2006/09/14/owens.va.atm.scam.wavy "ATM turns $5s into $20s"] [[CNN]]/[[WAVY]] report, 9/14/06, about a hacked ATM at a gas station</ref><ref>Ibid, mirrored on [[YouTube]]</ref> This type of scam was featured on the TV series [[The Real Hustle]].

ATM behavior can change during what is called "stand-in" time, where the bank's cash dispensing network is unable to access databases that contain account information (possibly for database maintenance). In order to give customers access to cash, customers may be allowed to withdraw cash up to a certain amount that may be less than their usual daily withdrawal limit, but may still exceed the amount of available money in their account, which could result in fraud.<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/4.html Kennison v Daire [1986&#93; HCA 4; (1986) 160 CLR 129 (20 February 1986) ] [[AustLII|Australasian Legal Information Institute]]</ref>

===Card fraud===
[[Image:ATM lineup on ground.jpg|thumb|right|ATM lineup]]
[[Image:ATM Masalli.jpg|thumb|right|180 px|A big queue at an ATM in [[Masalli]], [[Azerbaijan]].]]
In an attempt to prevent criminals from [[shoulder surfing (computer security)|shoulder surfing]] the customer's [[Personal identification number|PIN]]s, some banks draw privacy areas on the floor.

For a low-tech form of fraud, the easiest is to simply steal a customer's card. A later variant of this approach is to trap the card inside of the ATM's card reader with a device often referred to as a [[Lebanese loop]]. When the customer gets frustrated by not getting the card back and walks away from the machine, the criminal is able to remove the card and withdraw cash from the customer's account.

Another simple form of fraud involves attempting to get the customer's bank to issue a new card and stealing it from their mail.<ref>[http://venus.soci.niu.edu/~cudigest/phracks/phrack-08 Fun with Automatic Tellers] [[Phrack Magazine]] Volume One, Issue Eight</ref>
[[Image:Tamper warning on ATM in London.jpg|thumb|left|Some ATMs may put up warning messages to customers to not use them when it detects possible [[Tampering (crime)|tampering]]]]

The concept and various methods of copying the contents of an ATM card's magnetic stripe on to a duplicate card to access other people's financial information was well known in the hacking communities by late 1990.<ref>[http://www.skepticfiles.org/hacker/phrack32.htm "Automatic Teller Machine Cards"], [[Phrack Magazine]], Phrack Classic Volume Three, Issue 32</ref>

In 1996 Andrew Stone, a computer security consultant from Hampshire in the UK, was convicted of stealing more than £1 million (at the time equivalent to US$1.6 million) by pointing high definition video cameras at ATMs from a considerable distance, and by recording the card numbers, expiry dates, etc. from the embossed detail on the ATM cards along with video footage of the PINs being entered. After getting all the information from the videotapes, he was able to produce clone cards which not only allowed him to withdraw the full daily limit for each account, but also allowed him to sidestep withdrawal limits by using multiple copied cards. In court, it was shown that he could withdraw as much as £10,000 per hour by using this method. Stone was sentenced to five years and six months in prison.<ref>[http://itnow.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/6/17 Seeking after the truth in computer evidence: any proof of ATM fraud?] [[Oxford Journals]] ITNOW</ref>

By contrast, a newer high-tech method of operating sometimes called '''card skimming''' or '''card cloning''' involves the installation of a magnetic card reader over the real ATM's card slot and the use of a wireless surveillance camera or a modified digital camera to observe the user's PIN. Card data is then cloned onto a second card and the criminal attempts a standard cash withdrawal. The availability of low-cost commodity wireless cameras and card readers has made it a relatively simple form of fraud, with comparatively low risk to the fraudsters.<ref>[http://www.snopes.com/crime/warnings/atmcamera.asp Snopes.com] [[Snopes]]</ref>

In an attempt to stop these practices, countermeasures against card cloning have been developed by the banking industry, in particular by the use of [[smart card]]s which cannot easily be copied or spoofed by unauthenticated devices, and by attempting to make the outside of their ATMs [[tamper-evident|tamper evident]]. Older chip-card security systems include the French [[Carte Bleue]], [[Visa Cash]], [[Mondex]], [[Blue from American Express]]<ref>[http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/56/wth.html What the Hell Do Smart Cards Do?] Fast Company</ref> and [[EMV 96|EMV '96 or EMV 3.11]]. The most actively developed form of smart card security in the industry today is known as [[EMV 2000|EMV 2000 or EMV 4.x]].

[[EMV]] is widely used in the UK ([[Chip and PIN]]) and other parts of Europe, but when it is not available in a specific area, ATMs must fallback to using the easy–to–copy magnetic stripe to perform transactions. This fallback behaviour can be exploited.<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/2006/05/19/stories/2006051920380300.htm Four more held in fake credit card racket case] [[The Hindu]]</ref> However the fallback option has been removed by several UK banks, meaning if the chip is not read, the transaction will be declined.

In February 2009, a group of criminals used counterfeit ATM cards to steal $9 million from 130 ATMs in 49 cities around the world all within a time period of 30 minutes.<ref>[http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/02/atm/ Global ATM Caper Nets Hackers $9 Million in One Day], Wired.com, February 3, 2009</ref>

Card cloning and [[Skimming (credit card fraud)|skimming]] can be detected by the implementation of magnetic card reader heads and firmware that can read a signature embedded in all magnetic stripes during the card production process.  This signature known as a "MagnePrint" or "BluPrint" can be used in conjunction with common two factor authentication schemes utilized in ATM, debit/retail point-of-sale and prepaid card applications.<ref>[http://www.magneprint.com/ Magneprint.com]</ref><ref>[http://veritechsecurity.com/default.aspx Veritechsecurity.com]</ref>

Another ATM fraud issue is ATM card theft which includes credit card trapping and debit card trapping at ATMs. Originating in South America this type of ATM fraud has spread globally. Although somewhat replaced in terms of volume by ATM skimming incidents, a re-emergence of card trapping has been noticed in regions such as Europe where EMV Chip and PIN cards have increased in circulation.<ref>[http://www.atmsecurity.com/articles/atm-fraud/atm-security-issues-atm-fraud-issues-by-geography.html ATMsecurity.com]</ref>

==Related devices==
A [[Talking ATM]] is a type of ATM that provides audible instructions so that persons who cannot read an ATM screen can independently use the machine. All audible information is delivered privately through a standard [[headphone jack]] on the face of the machine. Alternatively, some banks such as the [[Nordea]] and [[Swedbank]] use a built-in external speaker which may be invoked by pressing the talk button on the keypad. Information is delivered to the customer either through pre-recorded [[sound]] files or via text-to-speech [[speech synthesis]].

A postal [[interactive kiosk]] may also share many of the same components as an ATM (including a vault), but only dispenses items relating to postage.<ref>[http://www.usps.com/communications/news/press/2004/pr04_098.htm Postal Service Mailing Kiosks now in every state] [[United States Postal Service]] news release</ref><ref>[http://www.lunewsviews.com/apc.htm Automated Postal Centers], lunewsviews.com news report</ref>

A [[scrip cash dispenser]] may share many of the same components as an ATM, but lacks the ability to dispense physical cash and consequently requires no vault. Instead, the customer requests a withdrawal transaction from the machine, which prints a receipt. The customer then takes this receipt to a nearby sales clerk, who then exchanges it for cash from the till.<ref>[http://www.atmscrip.com/what_is_scrip.html What is Scrip ATM]</ref>

A [[Teller Assist Unit]] may also share many of the same components as an ATM (including a vault), but they are distinct in that they are designed to be operated solely by trained personnel and not the general public, they do not integrate directly into interbank networks, and are usually controlled by a computer that is not directly integrated into the overall construction of the unit.

==Health==
January 2011, scientists in England has proved that Automated Teller Machines 'as dirty as a public toilets'. And according to Britons, the top 10 dirties places in the UK were number 1.Public toilets, 2.Public telephones, 3.Bus stops, etc.<ref>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1346026/Cash-machines-dirty-public-toilets.html</ref>
