<html> <head> <title>List of types of systems theory</title></head><body>{{Copyedit|date=March 2010}}
This '''list of types of systems theory''' gives an overview of different types of [[systems theory]], which are mentioned in scientific book titles or articles.<ref>There are a lot of book titles named ''... systems: theory and applications''. This leaves the term ''... systems: theory'', which is not acceptable as a type systems theory.</ref> The following more than 40 types of systems theory are all explicitly named ''systems theory'' and represent a unique [[conceptual framework]] in a specific field of [[science]].

[[Systems theory]] has been developed since the 1950s and nowadays in the new Millennium a long set of specialized systems theories and [[cybernetics]] exist. In the beginnings [[General Systems Theory]] was developed by [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] to overcome the over-specialisation of the modern times and as a worldview of [[holism]]. The systems theories nowadays are closer to the traditional specialisation by than to holism by interdependences and mutual completing up of mutually different specialists. <ref>Matjaž Mulej (2006), "Systems, Cybernetics and Innovations", in: ''Kybernetics'', Vol 35 No. 7/8, pp. 939-940.</ref>

:Crawley states, that the students Eric Dent studied forms of systems theory and came up with a set of concepts that he thought marked off systems theory approaches from earlier science. Dent identified eight concepts:
:* holism rather than analysis or reductionism, 
:* relationships rather than entities, 
:* interaction with environment as opposed to closed or isolated systems,
:* indeterminism as opposed to predictability, 
:* circular causal loops rather than linear causality, 
:* self organization, observation as part of or directly related to systems, and

: Witherspoon states, that "the rise of abstract art and the development of various systems theories have an important parallel. Abstract art goes beyond the recognition of entity or image and focuses attention on interaction and interrelatedness, striving to uncover and reveal holistic essences. Systems theories have tried to get us beyond linear cause and effect notions and tried to get us to think of phenomena in terms of interaction and interrelationship. It is interesting and significant that abstract art and quantum theory arose at about the same time.  Both of these developments preceded the application of various forms of systems theory to the social and biological sciences. Scientific insight and conceptualization have paralleled artistic imagination and aesthetic formulation."
