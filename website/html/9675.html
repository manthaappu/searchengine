<html> <head> <title>De architectura</title></head><body>'''{{lang|la|''De architectura''}}''' [[s:Ten Books on Architecture]] ({{lang-en|On architecture}}) is a treatise on [[architecture]] written by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[architect]] [[Vitruvius]] and dedicated to his patron, the emperor [[Caesar Augustus]] as a guide for [[Caesar Augustus#Building projects|building projects]]. The work is one of the most important sources of modern knowledge of Roman building methods as well as the planning and design of structures, both large (aqueducts, buildings, baths, harbours) and small (machines, measuring devices, instruments). He is also the prime source of the famous story of [[Archimedes]] and his bath-time discovery.

==In summary==
Probably written around 15 BC <ref>Art Directory GmbH [http://www.vitruvius-pollio.com/] last accessed 3/9/2008</ref>, it is the only contemporary source on classical architecture to have survived in its entirety. Divided into ten sections or "books", it covers almost every aspect of Roman architecture. The books break down as follows:

# [[Urban planning|Town planning]], [[architecture]] or [[Civil engineering]] in general, and the qualifications required of an [[architect]] or more modernly the [[civil engineer]] 
# [[Building material]]s
# [[Roman temple|Temples]] and the [[orders of architecture]];
# ''continuation of book 3''
# [[Roman architecture|Civil buildings]]
# [[Roman villa|Domestic buildings]]
# [[Pavement (architecture)|Pavements]] and decorative [[plaster]]work
# [[Roman aqueduct|Water supplies]] and [[aqueducts]]
# Sciences influencing architecture - [[geometry]], [[mensuration]], [[astronomy]], [[sundial]]
# Use and construction of [[machines]] - [[Roman siege engines]], [[water mill]]s, drainage machines, [[Roman technology]], [[Hoist (device)|hoisting]], [[pneumatics]]

Roman architects were skilled in engineering, art, and craftsmanship combined. Vitruvius was very much of this type, a fact reflected in ''De architectura''. He covers a wide variety of subjects which he saw as touching on architecture. This included many aspects which may seem irrelevant to modern eyes, ranging from mathematics to astronomy, meteorology and medicine. In the Roman conception, architecture needed to take into account everything touching on the physical and intellectual life of man and his surroundings.

Vitruvius thus deals with many theoretical issues concerning architecture. For instance, in Book 2 of ''De architectura'', he advises architects working with [[brick]]s to familiarise themselves with pre-Socratic theories of matter so as to understand how their materials will behave. Book 9 relates the abstract [[geometry]] of [[Plato]] to the everyday work of the [[Surveyor (surveying)|surveyor]]. [[Astrology]] is cited for its insights into the organisation of human life, while [[astronomy]] is required for the understanding of [[sundial]]s. Similarly,  Vitruvius cites [[Ctesibius|Ctesibius of Alexandria]] and [[Archimedes]] for their inventions, [[Aristoxenus]] ([[Aristotle]]'s apprentice) for [[music]], [[Agatharchus]] for [[theatre]], and [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] for architecture.

===Buildings===
[[Image:Greekhse1.jpg|right|thumb|Greek house plan by Vitruvius]]
He sought to address the ethos of architecture, declaring that quality depends on the social relevance of the [[artist]]'s work, not on the form or workmanship of the work itself. Perhaps the most famous declaration from ''De architectura'' is one still quoted by architects:  "Well building hath three conditions: firmness, commodity, and delight."  This quote is taken from Sir [[Henry Wotton]]'s version of 1624, and is a plain and accurate translation of the passage in Vitruvius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/1*.html#3.2 (I.iii.2)]: but English has changed since then, especially in regard to the word "commodity", and the tag is usually misunderstood.

Vitruvius also studied human proportions (Book 3) and his ''canones'' were later encoded in a very famous drawing by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (''Homo Vitruvianus'', "[[Vitruvian Man]]").

==Roman technology==
[[Image:ballista.gif|thumb|left|200px|A Roman Ballista]]

The work is important for its descriptions of many different machines used for engineering structures such as [[Hoist (device)|hoist]]s, [[Crane (machine)|crane]]s and [[pulleys]], as well as war machines such as [[catapault]]s, [[ballistae]], and [[siege engine]]s. He also describes the construction of [[sundial]]s and [[water clock]]s, and the use of an [[aeolipile]] (the first [[steam engine]]) as an experiment to demonstrate the nature of atmospheric air movements (wind). 

===Aqueducts and mills===
[[Image:Pont du gard.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Pont du Gard]]]]
Books 8, 9 and 10 form the basis of much of what we know about Roman technology, now augmented by archaeological studies of extant remains, such as the [[Pont du Gard]] in southern France. Numerous such massive structures occur across the former Empire, a testament to the power of [[Roman engineering]]. His description of [[aqueduct]] construction is short, but does mention key details especially for the way they were surveyed, and the careful choice of materials needed. His book would have been of assistance to [[Frontinus]], a general who was appointed in the late first century AD to administer the many [[aqueducts of Rome]]. He discovered a discrepancy between the intake and supply of water caused by illegal pipes inserted into the channels to divert the water. They went far in exploiting water power, as the set of no less than 16 [[water mill]]s at [[Barbegal]] in [[France]] demonstrates. The mills ground grain in a very efficient operation, and many other mills are now known.

===Materials===
Vitruvius describes many different construction materials used for a wide variety of different structures, as well as such details as [[stucco]] painting. [[Cement]], [[concrete]] and [[lime (material)|lime]] receive in-depth descriptions, the longevity of many Roman structures being mute testimony to their skill in building materials and design.

It is worth noting that Vitruvius advises that [[lead]] should not be used to conduct drinking water, clay pipes being preferred. He comes to this conclusion in Book VIII of De Architectura after empirical observation of the apparent labourer illnesses in the [[plumbum]] foundries of his time. In 1986 the United States banned the use of lead in plumbing due to lead poisoning's neurological damage. However, much of the water used by Rome and many other cities was very hard, and coated the inner surfaces of the pipes, so [[lead poisoning]] was most unlikely. 
[[Image:VitruviusTenBooksMHMorgan1914p295.gif|thumb|right|200px|Design for an Archimedean water-screw]]
Vitruvius gives us the famous story about [[Archimedes]] and his detection of adulterated gold in a royal crown. When Archimedes realised that the volume of the crown could be measured exactly by the displacement created in a bath of water, he ran into the street with the cry of "[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!", and the discovery enabled him to compare the density of the crown with pure [[gold]]. He showed that the crown had been alloyed with [[silver]], and the king defrauded. We are not told what happened to the metal worker who crafted the crown, but no doubt he suffered a painful fate.

===Dewatering machines===
[[Image:Archscrew2.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Drainage wheel from Rio Tinto mines]]
[[Image:WaterwheelsSp.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Sequence of drainage wheels found in Spanish mine]]
He describes the construction of [[Archimedes' screw]] in Chapter X, although doesn't mention Archimedes by name.  It was a device widely used for raising water to irrigate fields and dewater mines. Other lifting machines he mentions include the endless chain of buckets and the [[reverse overshot water-wheel]]. Remains of the water wheels used for lifting water have been discovered in old mines such as those at [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] in [[Spain]] and [[Dolaucothi]] in west [[Wales]]. One of the wheels from Rio Tinto is now in the [[British Museum]], and the latter in the [[National Museum of Wales]]. The remains were discovered when these mines were re-opened in modern mining attempts. They would have been used in a vertical sequence, with 16 such mills capable of raising water at least 96 feet above the water table. Each wheel would have been worked by a miner treading the device at the top of the wheel, by using cleats on the outer edge. That they were using such devices in mines clearly implies that they were entirely capable of using them as [[water wheels]] to develop power for a range of activities, not just for grinding wheat, but also probably for sawing timber, crushing ores, [[fulling]] and so on.

===Force pump===
[[Image:heron2.jpg|thumb|left|200px||Hero's fire-engine]]
[[Ctesibius]] is credited with the invention of the [[force pump]] which Vitruvius describes as being built from [[bronze]] with valves to allow a head of water to be formed above the machine. The device is also described by [[Hero of Alexandria]] in his "Pneumatica". The machine is operated by hand in moving a lever up and down. He mentions its use for supplying fountains above a reservoir, although a more mundane use might be as a simple fire-engine. One was found at [[Roman Silchester]] or [[Calleva Atrebatum]] in [[England]], and another is on display at the [[British Museum]]. Their functions are not described but they are both made in bronze, just as Vitruvius specifies. 

Vitruvius also mentions the several [[automaton]]s that [[Ctesibius]] invented, and intended for amusement and pleasure rather than serving a useful function.

===Central heating===
[[Image:Hypocaustum.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Ruins of the hypocaust under the floor of a Roman villa. The part under the [[exedra]] is covered.]]
He describes the many innovations made in building design to improve the living conditions of the inhabitants. Foremost among them is the development of the [[hypocaust]], a type of [[central heating]] where hot air developed by a fire was channelled under the floor and inside the walls of [[public bath]]s and [[villa]]s. He gives explicit instructions how to design such buildings so that [[fuel efficiency]] is maximised, so that for example, the [[caldarium]] is next to the [[tepidarium]] followed by the [[frigidarium]]. He also advises on using a type of regulator to control the heat in the hot rooms, a [[bronze]] disc set into the roof under a circular aperture which could be raised or lowered by a [[pulley]] to adjust the ventilation. Although he does not suggest it himself, it is likely that his dewatering devices such as the [[reverse overshot water-wheel]] was used in the larger baths to lift water to header tanks at the top of the larger ''thermae'', such as the [[Baths of Diocletian]] and the [[Baths of Caracalla]].

===Surveying instruments===
That he must have been well practised in surveying is shown by his descriptions of surveying instruments, especially the water level or [[chorobates]], which he compares favourably with the [[groma]], a device using [[plumb line]]s. They were essential in all building operations, but especially in aqueduct construction, where a uniform gradient was important to provision of a regular supply of water without damage to the walls of the channel. He describes the [[Surveyor's wheel|hodometer]], essentially a device for automatically measuring distances along roads, a machine essential for developing accurate itineraries, such as the [[Peutinger Table]]. [[File:Miletus Bay silting evolution map-en.svg|thumb|right|350px|Locations of thirteen Asia Minor Athenian cities.]] 

===Sea level change===
In Book IV Chapter 1 Subsection 4, there is a description of thirteen [[Athenian]] cities in [[Asia Minor]], "the land of [[Caria]]", in present day Turkey. These cities are given as: [[Ephesus]], [[Miletus]], [[Myus]], [[Priene]], [[Samos]], [[Teos]], [[Colophon]], [[Chius]], [[Erythrae]], [[Phocaea]], [[Clazomenae]], [[Lebedos]], [[Melite]] and later a fourteenth, [[Smyrna]]eans. Myus, the third city, is described as being "long ago engulfed by the water, and its sacred rites and suffrage".  This sentence indicates that at the time of Vitruvius's writing it was known that sea-level change and/or land subsidence occurred. The layout of these cities is in general from South to North so that it appears that where Myrus should be located is inland. If this is the case then since the writing of ''De architectura'' the region has either experienced soil rebound or a sea-level fall. Though not indicative of sea-level change, nor speculation of such, many Roman ports suffered from silting. Roman salt works in Essex County, England today are located at the 5 meter contour implying this was the coastline<ref>Gilman, Paul "Securing a Future for Essex's Past" Heritage Conservation Planning Division, Essex County Council England, [http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/1099/essex.html], accessed 10/29/2008</ref><ref>{{Cite journal

==Survival and rediscovery==
[[Image:Escribano.jpg|thumb|250px|This miniature of [[Jean Miélot]] (d. 1475) depicts him writing, probably in the library of [[Philip the Good]].]]
Vitruvius' work is one of many examples of Latin texts that owe their survival to the palace [[scriptorium]] of [[Charlemagne]] in the early 9th century. (This activity of finding and recopying classical [[manuscript]]s is part of what is called the [[Carolingian Renaissance]].) Many of the surviving manuscripts of Vitruvius' work derive from an existing manuscript that was written there, [[British Library]] manuscript Harley 2767 [http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=8557&CollID=8&NStart=2767]. 

These texts were not just copied but also were known at the court of Charlemagne, since his historian, the bishop [[Einhard]], asked for explanations of some technical terms at the visiting English churchman [[Alcuin]].  Additionally, a number of individuals are known to have read the text or have been indirectly influenced by it, these are: Vussin, [[Hrabanus Maurus]], [[Hermann of Reichenau]], [[Hugo of St. Victor]], Gervase of Melkey, [[William of Malmesbury]], Theoderich of St. Trond, [[Petrus Diaconus]], [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Filippo Villani]], [[Jean de Montreuil]], [[Petrarch]], [[Boccaccio]], [[Giovanni de Dondi]], Domenico di Bandino, [[Niccolò Acciaioli]] bequeathed copy to the [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence]], [[Bernward of Hildesheim]] and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]<ref>{{Cite journal

Many copies of ''De architectura'', dating from the eight to the fifteenth centuries, did exist in manuscript form during the [[Middle Ages]] and ninety-two are still available in public collections. But they appear to have received little attention. Possibly due to the obsolescence of many specialized Latin terms used by Vitruvius {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} and the loss of most of the original ten illustrations thought by some to be helpful understanding parts of the text. 

Vitrivius' work was "rediscovered" in 1414 by the [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Humanism|humanist]] [[Poggio Bracciolini]], who found it in the Abbey of [[St Gallen]], [[Switzerland]]. He publicized the manuscript to a receptive audience of [[Renaissance]] thinkers, just as interest in the classical cultural and scientific heritage was reviving. 
[[File:De Architectura030.jpg|thumb|left|225px|"Vitruvian Man", illustration in the edition of "De Architectura" by Vitruvius; illustrated edition by Cesare Cesariano (1521)]]

The first printed edition (''editio princeps''), an [[incunabula]] version,  was published by the [[Verona|Veronese]] scholar [[Fra Giovanni Sulpitius]] in 1486 (with a second edition in 1495 or 1496). But none was illustrated. The [[Dominican friar]] [[Fra Giovanni Giocondo]] produced the first version illustrated with [[woodcut]]s in [[Venice]] in 1511. It had a thorough philosophical approach and superb illustrations. 

Translations into [[Italian language|Italian]] were in circulation by the 1520s, the first in print being the translation with new illustrations by [[Cesare Cesariano]], a Milanese friend of the architect [[Bramante]], printed in [[Como]] in 1521. It was rapidly translated into other European languages{{ndash}} the first [[German language|German]] version was published in 1528{{ndash}} and the first French versions followed in 1547 (but contained many mistakes). The first Spanish translation was published in 1582 by Miguel de Urrea and Juan Gracian. The most authoritative and influential edition was publicized in French in 1673 by [[Claude Perrault]], commissioned by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] in 1664.

The first English translation followed in 1692. It was an abridgment based on the French version of Claude Perrault. Curiously, English-speakers had to wait until 1771 for a full translation of the first five volumes and 1791 for the whole thing. Sir [[Henry Wotton]]'s 1624 version, ''The Elements of Architecture'', was more of a free adaptation than a literal translation, while a 1692 translation was much abbreviated. Thanks to the art of printing, Vitruvius' work had become a popular subject of [[hermeneutics]], with highly detailed and interpretive illustrations, and became widely dispersed.

==Impact==
The rediscovery of Vitruvius' work had a profound influence on architects of the [[Renaissance]], prompting the rise of the [[Neo-Classical style]]. Renaissance architects, such as [[Niccoli]], [[Brunelleschi]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti]],  found in "De Architectura" their rationale for raising their branch of knowledge to a [[scientific discipline]] as well as emphasising the skills of the [[artisan]].

The English architect [[Inigo Jones]] and the Frenchman [[Salomon de Caus]] were among the first to re-evaluate and implement those disciplines that Vitruvius considered a necessary element of architecture: arts and [[science]]s based upon number and [[proportion (architecture)]]. The 16th century architect [[Palladio]] considered Vitrivius his master and guide, and made some drawings based on Vitruvius' work before conceiving his own architectural precepts.

===Astrolabe===
The earliest evidence of use of the [[stereographic projection]] in a machine is in the writing of the Roman author and architect, Vitruvius (ca. 88 - ca. 26 BC), who in De architectura describes an anaphoric clock (probably a clepsydra or [[water clock]]) in Alexandria. The clock had a rotating field of stars behind a wire frame indicating the hours of the day. The wire framework (the spider) and the star locations were constructed using the stereographic projection. Similar constructions dated from the first to third century and have been found in Salzburg and northeastern France, so such mechanisms were apparently fairly widespread among Romans.
