In [[computing]], an '''intermediate representation''' (IR) is a [[data structure]] that is constructed from input data to a [[computer program|program]], and from which part or all of the output data of the program is constructed in turn.

Use of the term usually implies that most of the [[information]] present in the input is retained by the intermediate representation, with further annotations or rapid lookup features.

A canonical example is found in most modern [[compilers]], where the linear human-readable text representing a program is transformed into an intermediate [[graph (data structure)|graph]] data structure that allows [[flow analysis]] and re-arrangements before starting to create the list of actual CPU instructions that will do the work.  Use of an intermediate representation allows compiler systems like [[LLVM]] to be targeted by many different source languages, and support generation for many different target architectures.
