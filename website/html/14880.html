{{nihongo|'''Genbutsu'''|現物}} is a [[Japan]]ese word meaning “real thing” and it is a component of the [[Three Reals]] as related to [[lean manufacturing]] (or [[Toyota Production System]]).

This is the Japanese mindset teaching that when there is a problem somewhere (on the shop floor of a factory for example), one should get as close to the problem as possible before proposing a solution. By observing the actual process or problem at the actual place where it is occurring, the problem solver is able to obtain actual data or facts, which will improve the chances for a better solution. This is in contrast to the [[Western culture|Western]] thinking in which managers make decisions in a remote location (like behind a desk), armed only with second hand information from others.

==The Three Reals==
 
The Three Reals are a fundamental element of {{nihongo|[[kaizen]]|改善}}. They are:
#the shop floor or {{nihongo|[[gemba]]|現場}}.
#the actual product or genbutsu.
#the real facts and data or {{nihongo|genjitsu|現実}}.

As part of the Toyota philosophy, [[Genchi Genbutsu|genchi genbutsu]] means "go to the actual place and see the actual thing" or "go see" for short. The philosophy of going to the source to confirm at the actual place (genchi or gemba) is a core element of Toyota's continuous improvement.
