'''POU''' (pronounced 'pow') is a family of [[proteins]] that have well-conserved [[homeodomain]]s.<ref name="pmid11183772">{{cite journal | author = Phillips K, Luisi B | title = The virtuoso of versatility: POU proteins that flex to fit | journal = J.

==Function==
POU [[protein]]s are [[eukaryotic]] [[transcription factors]] containing a bipartite [[DNA]] binding domain referred to as the [[POU domain]]. 

The various members of the POU family have a wide variety of functions, all of which are related to the development of an [[organism]].

POU6F2 is also known as [[Human accelerated regions|Human Accelerated Region]] 8.  It may, therefore, have played a key role in differentiating Humans from Apes.

==Etymology==
The acronym POU is derived from the names of three [[mammal]]ian transcription factors:
* the [[pituitary|'''P'''ituitary]]-specific [[pituitary-specific positive transcription factor 1|Pit-1]]
* the [[octamer transcription factor|'''O'''ctamer transcription factor]] proteins [[POU2F1|Oct-1]] and [[Oct-2]] (octamer sequence is ATGCAAAT)
* the [[neural]] '''U'''nc-86 transcription factor from [[Caenorhabditis elegans]]. 

==Diversity==
POU domain [[genes]] have been described in organisms as divergent as ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', ''[[Drosophila]]'', ''[[Xenopus]]'', [[zebrafish]] and human but have not been yet identified in [[plants]] and [[fungi]].  

There is a surprisingly high degree of amino acid sequence conservation (37%-42%) of POU homeodomains to the transcriptional regulator comS from the [[gram positive]] [[prokaryote]] [[Bacillus subtilis]].<ref name="pmid7937777">{{cite journal | author = D'Souza C, Nakano MM, Zuber P | title = Identification of comS, a gene of the srfA operon that regulates the establishment of genetic competence in Bacillus subtilis | journal = Proc.
