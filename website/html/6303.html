The '''Cisco 1000 Series Routers''' are low end branch office router. Available in fixed configurations supporting [[10baseT]], [[ISDN]] and [[serial]] interfaces.  These routers are no longer supported and are replaced by the [[Cisco 800]] Series routers.

==Models==
*1001 - 1 Ethernet ([[10baseT]]), 1 Serial (V.35) (Leased Line LAN Extender)
*1002 - 1 Ethernet ([[10baseT]]), 1 Serial (X21) (Leased Line LAN Extender)
*1003 - 1 Ethernet ([[10baseT]]), 1 [[Basic Rate Interface|BRI]] [[ISDN]] S/T Interface
*1004 - 1 Ethernet ([[10baseT]]), 1 [[Basic Rate Interface|BRI]] [[ISDN]] Integrated NT1
*1005 - 1 Ethernet ([[10baseT]]), 1 Async#/Sync (network) Serial ([[DB60 connector|DB60]])
*1020 - 1 Ethernet ([[10baseT]]), 2 (Max) Async Serial (Dial on Demand Asyncronous Router)

(#)Running serial port in Async mode requires an IOS image that supports it such as c1005-qy-mz.xxx.bin (IP/ASYNC) or c1005-nqy-mz.xxx.bin (IP/IPX/ASYNC)

All models used a PCMCIA card for flash storage (typically 2 MB), and ran on 12VDC power provided by an external power supply.

==1001 / 1002==
The LAN Extender connects to a central 'host' router. The host router provides routing services to the LAN Extender, and all configuration is done remotly from the central router. The host router is connected to the 1001 via a leased line connection (up to T1/E1). 

==1020==
Developed through an alliance with Livingston Enterprises. Features two WAN ports, one asynchronous port supports PCMCIA modems up to V.34 rates (28.8 Kbps) and an external modem can be connected to a second asynchronous/console port to achieve aggregate throughput of up to 57.6 kbit/s uncompressed.
