Netlib comprises a large number of separate programs and [[library (computing)|libraries]]. Most of the code is written in [[Fortran]], with some programs in other languages.

The legal status of the code is not entirely clear. Some programs are clearly in the [[public domain]] (for example, [[SLATEC]]). However, no license terms or terms of use are stated for many programs.

Netlib is indexed by the [[Guide to Available Mathematical Software]].
