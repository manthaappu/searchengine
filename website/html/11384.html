'''eDRAM''' stands for "[[embedded system|embedded]] [[Dynamic Random Access Memory|DRAM]]", a [[capacitor]]-based [[dynamic random access memory]] integrated on the same [[die (integrated circuit)|die]] as an [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] or [[Microprocessor|processor]].  The cost-per-bit is higher than for stand-alone DRAM chips but in many applications the performance advantages of placing the eDRAM on the same chip as the processor outweighs the cost disadvantage compared with external memory.

Embedding memory on the ASIC or processor allows for much wider [[computer bus|bus]]ses and higher operation speeds, and due to much higher density of DRAM in comparison to [[static random access memory|SRAM]], larger amounts of memory can be installed on smaller chips if eDRAM is used instead of eSRAM. eDRAM requires additional fab process steps compared with embedded SRAM, which raises cost, but the 3X area savings of eDRAM memory offsets the process cost when a significant amount of memory is used in the design.  

eDRAM memories, like all DRAM memories, require periodic refreshing of the memory cells, which adds complexity.  However if the memory refresh controller is embedded along with the eDRAM memory, the remainder of the ASIC can treat the memory like a simple SRAM type such as in [[1T-SRAM]].
