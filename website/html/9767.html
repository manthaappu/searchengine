In [[mathematics]], the '''Dedekind numbers''' are a rapidly-growing [[integer sequence|sequence of integers]] named after [[Richard Dedekind]], who defined them in 1897. The Dedekind number ''M''(''n'') counts the number of [[Monotone boolean function|monotonic Boolean functions]] of ''n'' variables. Equivalently, it counts the [[Antichain#Integer sequences|number of antichains]] of subsets of an ''n''-element set, the number of elements in a [[Free distributive lattice|free distributive lattice]] with ''n'' generators, or the number of [[abstract simplicial complex]]es with ''n'' elements.

Finding a closed-form expression for ''M''(''n'') is known as '''Dedekind's problem'''. Although accurate [[asymptotic expansion|asymptotic]] estimates of ''M''(''n''),<ref>{{harvtxt|Kleitman|Markowsky|1975}}; {{harvtxt|Korshunov|1981}}; {{harvtxt|Kahn|2002}}.</ref> and an exact expression as a [[summation]],<ref>{{harvtxt|Kisielewicz|1988}}.</ref> are known, computing ''M''(''n'') remains difficult and its exact values have been found only for ''n'' ≤ 8.<ref>{{harvtxt|Wiedemann|1991}}.</ref>

==Definitions==
A [[Boolean function]] is a function that takes as input ''n'' [[Boolean data type|Boolean variables]] (that is, values that can be either false or true, or equivalently [[bit|binary values]] that can be either 0 or 1), and produces as output another Boolean variable. It is [[monotonic]] if, for every combination of inputs, switching one of the inputs from false to true can only cause the output to switch from false to true and not from true to false. The Dedekind number ''M''(''n'') is the number of different monotonic Boolean functions on ''n'' variables.

An [[antichain]] of sets (also known as a [[Sperner family]]) is a family of sets, none of which is contained in any other set. If ''V'' is a set of ''n'' Boolean variables, an antichain ''A'' of subsets of ''V'' defines a monotone Boolean function ''f'', where the value of ''f'' is true for a given set of inputs if some subset of the true inputs to ''f'' belongs to ''A'' and false otherwise. Conversely every monotone Boolean function defines in this way an antichain, of the minimal subsets of Boolean variables that can force the function value to be true. Therefore, the Dedekind number ''M''(''n'') equals the number of different antichains of subsets of an ''n''-element set.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kahn|2002}}.</ref>

A third, equivalent way of describing the same class of objects uses [[lattice theory]]. From any two monotone Boolean functions ''f'' and ''g'' we can find two other monotone Boolean functions ''f'' ∧ ''g'' and ''f'' ∨ ''g'', their [[logical conjunction]] and [[logical disjunction]] respectively. The family of all monotone Boolean functions on ''n'' inputs, together with these two operations, forms a [[distributive lattice]], the lattice given by [[Birkhoff's representation theorem]] from the [[partially ordered set]] of subsets of the ''n'' variables with set inclusion as the partial order. This construction produces the [[Free distributive lattice|free distributive lattice]] with ''n'' generators.<ref>The definition of free distributive lattices used here allows as lattice operations any finite meet and join, including the empty meet and empty join. For the free distributive lattice in which only pairwise meets and joins are allowed, one should eliminate the top and bottom lattice elements and subtract two from the Dedekind numbers.</ref> Thus, the Dedekind numbers count the number of elements in free distributive lattices.<ref>{{harvtxt|Church|1940}}; {{harvtxt|Church|1965}}; {{harvtxt|Zaguia|1993}}.</ref>

The Dedekind numbers also count the number of [[abstract simplicial complex]]es on ''n'' elements, families of sets with the property that any subset of a set in the family also belongs to the family. Any antichain determines a simplicial complex, the family of subsets of antichain members, and conversely the maximal simplices in a complex form an antichain.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kisielewicz|1988}}.</ref>

==Example==
For ''n'' = 2, there are six monotonic Boolean functions and six antichains of subsets of the two-element set {''x'',''y''}:
*The function ''f''(''x'',''y'') = false that ignores its input values and always returns false corresponds to the [[empty set|empty antichain]] Ø.
*The [[logical conjunction]] ''f''(''x'',''y'') = ''x'' ∧ ''y'' corresponds to the antichain { {''x'',''y''} } containing the single set {''x'',''y''}.
*The function ''f''(''x'',''y'') = ''x'' that ignores its second argument and returns the first argument corresponds to the antichain { {''x''} } containing the single set {''x''}
*The function ''f''(''x'',''y'') = ''y'' that ignores its first argument and returns the second argument corresponds to the antichain { {''y''} } containing the single set {''y''}
*The [[logical disjunction]] ''f''(''x'',''y'') = ''x'' ∨ ''y'' corresponds to the antichain { {''x''}, {''y''} } containing the two sets {''x''} and {''y''}.
*The function ''f''(''x'',''y'') = true that ignores its input values and always returns true corresponds to the antichain {Ø} containing only the empty set.

==Values==
The exact values of the Dedekind numbers are known for 0 ≤ ''n'' ≤ 8:

:2, 3, 6, 20, 168, 7581, 7828354, 2414682040998, 56130437228687557907788 {{OEIS|id=A000372}}.

The first six of these numbers are given by {{harvtxt|Church|1940}}. ''M''(6) was calculated by {{harvtxt|Ward|1946}}, ''M''(7) was calculated by {{harvtxt|Church|1965}} and {{harvtxt|Berman|Köhler|1976}}, and ''M''(8) by {{harvtxt|Wiedemann|1991}}.

If ''n'' is even, then ''M''(''n'') must also be even.<ref>{{harvtxt|Yamamoto|1953}}.</ref>
The calculation of the fifth Dedekind number ''M''(5) = 7581 disproved a conjecture by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] that ''M''(''n'') is always divisible by (2''n'' &minus; 1)(2''n'' &minus; 2).<ref>{{harvtxt|Church|1940}}.</ref>

==Summation formula==
{{harvtxt|Kisielewicz|1988}} proved the following formula for the Dedekind numbers:
:<math>M(n)=\sum_{k=1}^{2^{2^n}} \prod_{j=1}^{2^n-1} \prod_{i=0}^{j-1} \left(1-b_i^k b_k^k \prod_{m=0}^{\log_2 i} (1-b_m^i+b_m^i b_m^j)\right),</math>
where
:<math>b_i^k=\left\lfloor\frac{k}{2^i}\right\rfloor - 2\left\lfloor\frac{k}{2^{i+1}}\right\rfloor.</math>
However, this formula is not helpful for computing the values of ''M''(''n'') for large ''n'' due to the large number of terms in the summation.

==Asymptotics==
The [[logarithm]] of the Dedekind numbers can be estimated accurately via the bounds
:<math>{n\choose \lfloor n/2\rfloor}\le \log_2 M(n)\le {n\choose \lfloor n/2\rfloor}\left(1+O\left(\frac{\log n}{n}\right)\right).</math>
Here the left inequality counts the number of antichains in which each set has exactly <math>\lfloor n/2\rfloor</math> elements, and the right inequality was proven by {{harvtxt|Kleitman|Markowsky|1975}}.

{{harvtxt|Korshunov|1981}} provided the even more accurate estimates
:<math>M(n) = (1+o(1)) 2^{n\choose \lfloor n/2\rfloor}\exp a(n)</math>
for even ''n'', and
:<math>M(n) = (1+o(1)) 2^{n\choose \lfloor n/2\rfloor}\exp (b(n)+c(n))</math>
for odd ''n'', where
:<math>a(n)={n\choose n/2-1}(2^{-n/2} + n^2 2^{-n-5} - n2^{-n-4}),</math>
:<math>b(n)={n\choose (n-3)/2}(2^{-(n+3)/2} - n^2 2^{-n-6} - n2^{-n+3}),</math>
and
:<math>c(n)={n\choose (n-1)/2}(2^{-(n+1)/2} + n^2 2^{-n-4}).</math>
The main idea behind these estimates is that, in most antichains, all the sets have sizes that are very close to ''n''/2.<ref>{{harvtxt|Zaguia|1993}}.</ref> For ''n'' = 2, 4, 6, 8 Korshunov's formula provides an estimate that is inaccurate by a factor of 9.8%, 10.2%, 4.1%, and -3.3%, respectively.<ref>{{citation|first=K.
