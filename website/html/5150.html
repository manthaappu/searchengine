'''COPERT''' is an MS [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] software program aiming at the calculation of air pollutant [[Air pollution|emissions]] from road transport. The technical development of COPERT is financed by the [[European Environment Agency]] (EEA), in the framework of the activities of the European Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change. Since 2007, the European Commission's [[Joint Research Centre]] has been coordinating the further scientific development of the model. In principle, COPERT has been developed for use from the National Experts to estimate emissions from road transport to be included in official annual national inventories. However, it is available and free for use in any other research, scientific and academic applications.

The COPERT 4 methodology is also part of the EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook. The Guidebook, developed by the UNECE Task Force on Emissions Inventories and Projections, is intended to support reporting under the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary [[Air Pollution]] and the EU directive on national emission ceilings. The COPERT 4 methodology is fully consistent with the [[Road Transport]] chapter of the Guidebook. The use of a software tool to calculate road transport emissions allows for a transparent and standardized, hence consistent and comparable data collecting and emissions reporting procedure, in accordance with the requirements of international conventions and protocols and EU legislation.

== Features ==
* Calculation of [[Air pollution|Emissions]] from [[Road Transport]]
* Compilation of an emission inventory
* Calculation for different vehicle categories (passenger cars, light duty vehicles, heavy duty vehicles, mopeds and motorcycles)
* Pollutants covered:
** major air pollutants ([[Carbon monoxide|CO]], [[NOx]], [[Volatile organic compound|VOC]], [[Particulate matter|PM]], [[ammonia|NH<sub>3</sub>]], [[Sulfur dioxide|SO<sub>2</sub>]], [[heavy metals]]) 
** [[greenhouse gas]] [[Greenhouse gas#Greenhouse gas emissions|emissions]] ([[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]], [[nitrous oxide|N<sub>2</sub>O]], [[methane|CH<sub>4</sub>]])
