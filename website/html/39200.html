It is named after [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[computer]] [[researcher]] Wim van Eck, who in 1985 published the first paper on it, including [[proof of concept]].<ref name="emr">{{cite journal | author=Van Eck, Wim | title=Electromagnetic Radiation from Video Display Units: An Eavesdropping Risk? | journal=Computers & Security | volume=4 | year=1985 | pages=269–286 | url=http://jya.com/emr.pdf | doi=10.1016/0167-4048(85)90046-X }}</ref>
[[Phreaking]] is the process of exploiting [[telephone network]]s, used here because of its connection to eavesdropping. 

Van Eck phreaking might also be used to compromise the secrecy of the votes in an election using [[electronic voting]]. This caused the Dutch government to ban the use of NewVote [[computer]] [[voting machine]]s manufactured by [[SDU]] in the [[Dutch general election, 2006|2006 national elections]], under the belief that ballot information might not be kept secret.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/10/30/europe/EU_GEN_Netherlands_Voting_Machines.php   Dutch government scraps plans to use voting computers in 35 cities including Amsterdam (Herald tribune, 30.

== Basic principle ==
Information that drives the [[video display]] takes the form of [[high frequency]] electrical signals. These [[oscillating]] [[electric currents]] create [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the [[radio frequency|RF]] range. These [[radio]] [[radio waves|emission]]s are correlated to the [[video]] image being displayed, so, in theory, they can be used to recover the displayed image.

=== CRTs ===
In a [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] the image is generated by an [[electron beam]] that sweeps back and forth across the [[screen]]. The electron beam excites the [[phosphor]] coating on the glass and causes it to glow. The strength of the beam determines the brightness of individual [[pixel]]s (see [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] for a detailed description). The electric signal which drives the electron beam is amplified to hundreds of volts from TTL circuitry. This high frequency, high voltage signal creates electromagnetic radiation that has, according to Van Eck, "a remarkable resemblance to a broadcast TV signal".<ref name="emr"/> The signal leaks out from displays and may be captured by an antenna, and once [[Analogue television synchronization|synchronization pulses]] are recreated and mixed in, an ordinary analog television receiver can display the result. The sync can be recreated either through manual adjustment or by processing the signals emitted by [[electromagnetic coil]]s as they deflect the CRT's electron beam back and forth.<ref name="emr"/>

In the paper, Van Eck reports that in February 1985 a successful test of this concept was carried out with the cooperation of the [[BBC]]. Using a van filled with electronic equipment and equipped with a [[Very high frequency|VHF]] [[antenna array]], they were able to eavesdrop from a "large distance".

Van Eck phreaking and protecting a CRT display from it was demonstrated on an episode of [[Tech TV]]'s [[The Screen Savers]] on December 18, 2003.<ref>[http://g4tv.com/videos/8041/van-eck-phreaking Van Eck Phreaking]</ref><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0zsgrAMQ7g The Screen Savers: Dark Tip - Van Eck Phreaking]</ref>

=== LCDs ===
In April 2004 new academic research has revealed that flat panel and laptop displays are also vulnerable to electromagnetic eavesdropping. The required equipment for espionage was constructed in a university lab for less than US$2000.<ref name=Kuhn2004>{{cite journal | author = Kuhn, M.G. | year = 2004 | title = Electromagnetic Eavesdropping Risks of Flat-Panel Displays | journal = 4th Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies | pages = 23–25 | url = http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/pet2004-fpd.pdf }}</ref>

== Countermeasures ==
[[Countermeasure]]s are detailed in the article on [[TEMPEST]], the [[National Security Agency|NSA]]'s standard on spy-proofing digital equipment. One countermeasure involves [[Electromagnetic shielding|shielding]] the equipment to minimize [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] emissions.  Another method, specifically for video information, [[scramble]]s the signals such that the image is perceptually undisturbed, but the emissions are harder to [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineer]] into images. Examples of this include [[low-pass filter|low pass]] [[filter (signal processing)|filtering]] [[fonts]] and [[random]]izing the [[least significant bit]] of the video data information.

== In popular culture ==
*In [[Neal Stephenson]]'s 1999 novel ''[[Cryptonomicon]]'', Van Eck phreaking (of a laptop LCD) serves as a significant [[plot device]].
*Van Eck phreaking was referenced directly in the ''[[Numb3rs]]'' season one episode "Sacrifice", on an LCD flat screen rather than a CRT monitor.
*[[Phillip Finch]]'s 1995 novel ''[[f2f (novel)|f2f]]'' features the main character Ellis Hoile building a Van Eck scanner, and the device is used to finalize the plot of the book.
*In a [[Alias_episodes_(season_5)#No_Hard_Feelings|fifth season episode]] of ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', a character suggests that they use Van Eck phreaking.
* Is often referred to in [[Charles Stross]]' novel ''[[The Atrocity Archives]]'' as a danger when viewing classified information.
