'''Stakkato''' is the [[pseudonym|alias]] of the perpetrator or perpetrators of a worldwide [[hacker (computer security)|cyber attack]] known to occur from at least December 2003 until May 2005, launched against a large number of sites on the [[Internet]] including the [[US Military]], [[White Sands Missile Range]], [[NASA]], a number of US academic institutions (known to include [[Caltech]], [[Stanford University]], [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]], and UIUC), and a number of non-US academic institutions (known to include [[Uppsala University]] in [[Sweden]] and [[University College Cork]] in [[Ireland]]) and several other Internet locations. 

A 16-year-old from [[Uppsala]], [[Sweden]] was questioned over the attack in March 2005, while possible accomplices were searched in Sweden, Britain, and elsewhere in Europe.
