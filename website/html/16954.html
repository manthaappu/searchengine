'''HornFans''' is a [[University of Texas at Austin]]-focused [[online community]] that was created in 1999. It is currently the 22nd-most visited college sports website, 13th-most visited team-specific website, and the 8th-most visited independent college sports website.<ref>[http://www.alexa.com/browse?&CategoryID=30288 Alexa: Sites in College and University]</ref> The site has over 43,000 registered users as of December 19, 2006.

Hornfans was created as a partnership between Bob Wheeler and Katy Agnor, with an initial investment of $1000. At the time Wheeler was a relatively well-known contributor to sports websites such as CBSSportsline.com, and crafted a bi-weekly Longhorn newsletter under the pseudonym "LonghornBob", and was to provide content for the site. Agnor was an accomplished web designer and was to program the site. <ref name="statesman">{{cite news|title="Founders of UT fan Web site lock horns"|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&p_theme=aasb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0E9C2573C346AF3E&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|work=[[Austin American Statesman]]|date=1999-12-20|accessdate = 2008-01-18}}</ref>  Disputes between the pair over moderation of message forums, marketing, and site content led to a lawsuit being filed in federal court by Agnor, and led to the eventual purchase of the site by Agnor. After mediation Wheeler, author of Forged of a Hotter Fire, reportedly received approximately $100,000 for his 50% share of HornFans.com, and subsequently opened the now defunct (but still registered) LonghornFanZone.com.  <ref name="statesman"/>   HornFans is currently owned and operated by Robert and Katy Agnor.<ref>[http://www.hornfans.com/aboutus/index.php Hornfans.com -- About us]</ref>

== Criticism ==


HornFans has a strict policy against criticism of players or coaches.<ref>[http://forums.hornfans.com/php/wwwthreads/guidelines.php FAQ<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Moderators enforce it by deleting such posts and suspending (or banning outright) posters who go against this policy. Wheeler's early criticism of now-former Longhorn Offensive Coordinator Greg Davis is said to have been an original conflict between the founding parties. One of the moderators admitted in 2001 that 620 total users had been banned as of that date.<ref>[http://forums.hornfans.com/php/wwwthreads/showflat.php?Cat=&Board=lockerroom&Number=515183 Post-loss BBS phenomena<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Historically the forums have often become inaccessible due to the heavy traffic during Longhorn games which overloaded the hardware. For many years the computer hardware was not upgraded, even when posters offered to donate to pay for more servers and bandwidth (in early 2008 the HornFans hardware finally underwent a major upgrade). Alexa.com rates the site speed as "very slow" with the average load time at 5.3 seconds.<ref>[http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main/hornfans.com hornfans.com - Site Information from Alexa<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In late 2007, due to these concerns, several members parted to form a new website ([http://www.shaggybevo.com shaggybevo.com]).<ref>[http://www.shaggybevo.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=312 shaggybevo.com :: View topic - Anti-Hornfans identity<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
