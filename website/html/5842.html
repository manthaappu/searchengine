A '''Chancery hand''' confusingly signifies two very different styles of [[Paleography|historical handwriting]]. 

A chancery hand was at first a form of [[handwriting]] for business transactions that developed in the [[Apostolic Chancery|Lateran chancelry]] (the ''Cancelleria Apostolica'') of the thirteenth century, then spread to France, notably through the [[Avignon Papacy]], and to England after 1350 (Fisher et al.:3). This early "chancery hand" is a Gothic hand similar to [[blackletter]]. Versions of it were adopted by royal and ducal [[Chancery (medieval office)|chanceries]], which were often staffed by clerics who had taken minor orders.

A later [[cursive]] "chancery hand", also developed in the Vatican, was introduced in the 1420s by [[Niccolò Niccoli]]; it was the manuscript origin of the typefaces we recognize as ''[[italic type|italic]]''.

==English chancery hand==
In [[medieval England]] each of the royal departments tended to develop its own characteristic hand: the chancery hand used in the royal chancery at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] from the mid-century was employed for [[writ]]s, enrolments, patents and engrossing of royal letters; its use continued for the enrolment of acts of Parliament until 1836.

The English chancery hand was already an arcane specialty by the time of the Restoration. [[Samuel Pepys]] recorded (Thursday 12 July 1660):

{{quote|Up early and by coach to [[Whitehall|White Hall]] with Commissioner Pett, where, after we had talked with my Lord, I went to the Privy Seal and got my bill perfected there, and at the Signet: and then to the [[House of Lords]], and met with Mr. Kipps, who directed me to Mr. Beale to get my patent engrossed; but he not having time to get it done in Chancery-hand, I was forced to run all up and down Chancery-lane, and the Six Clerks’ Office but could find none that could write the hand, that were at leisure.}}

=="Italian hand"==
The later ''cancelleresca corsiva'' ("cursive chancery hand") in which the pen was held slanted at a forty-five-degree angle for speed could also produce beautiful [[Calligraphy|calligraphic]] work. 
 
It was adapted as the model for the [[italic type]]face developed by [[Aldus Manutius]] in [[Venice]], from punches cut by [[Francesco Griffo]] and first used in 1500 for the small portable series of inexpensive classics that issued from the Aldine press. In fifteenth-century [[Italy]] the chancery hand was employed in correspondence and everyday business, and for documents of minor formal importance. 

In sixteenth-century England, this became known as the "Italian hand" to distinguish it from the angular, cramped and gothic English chancery hand that had developed from the earlier tradition.

Among the historical exponents of this chancery hand, the most famous is [[Ludovico Vicentino degli Arrighi|Ludovico degli Arrighi]], a scribe in the [[Papal Curia]]. He wrote a book on the principles of writing, ''L'Operina'' in 1522, that embodies the basic calligraphic principles of the italic calligraphic hand of today.
