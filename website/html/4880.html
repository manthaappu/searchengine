'''C/AL''' ('''C'''lient'''/'''server '''A'''pplication '''L'''anguage) is the programming language used within C/SIDE the '''C'''lient'''/S'''erver '''I'''ntegrated '''D'''evelopment '''E'''nvironment in [[Microsoft Dynamics NAV]] (Formerly known as Navision Attain). C/AL is a database specific programming language, and is primarily used for retrieving, inserting and modifying records in a [[Microsoft Dynamics NAV|Navision]] database. C/AL is simple but effective, and resembles the [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal language]] it is based on.

== Examples ==
=== Hello World ===
This is the classic [[Hello world program|Hello World]] example. Since the [[C/SIDE]] (Client/Server Integrated Development Environment) does not have a console to output text, this example is made using a dialog box as the visual interface.
<syntaxhighlight lang="pascal">
  FOR i := 0 TO 10 DO
    MESSAGE('hello, world');
</syntaxhighlight>

=== Filtering and retrieving records ===

Variables in C/AL are not defined through code, but are defined via the variable declaration menu in the C/AL editor. In this example  ''Item'' is assumed to be a variable of type Record.
<syntaxhighlight lang="pascal">
  IF Item.GET('31260210') THEN
    MESSAGE('Item name is: %1',Item."Description");

  Item.RESET;
  item.SETFILTER(...);
</syntaxhighlight>
.

=== Looping and data manipulation===

Looping over a recordset and modifying the individual records is achieved with only a few lines of code.

<!-- There was no language setting for "C/AL". Used "pascal"-setting instead. Looks okay. -->
<syntaxhighlight lang="pascal">
  Item.SETRANGE("Blocked",TRUE);
  IF Item.FINDSET THEN
    REPEAT
      IF Item."Profit" < 10 THEN BEGIN
        Item."Profit %" := 20;
        Item.MODIFY(TRUE);
      END;
    UNTIL Item.NEXT = 0;
  Item.MODIFYALL("Blocked",FALSE);
</syntaxhighlight>
