In [[cryptography]], '''CAST-256''' (or '''CAST6''') is a [[block cipher]] published in June [[1998]]. It was submitted as a candidate for the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES); however, it was not among the five [[AES finalists]]. It is an extension of an earlier cipher, [[CAST-128]]; both were designed according to the "CAST" design methodology invented by [[Carlisle Adams]] and [[Stafford Tavares]]. [[Howard Heys]] and [[Michael Wiener]] also contributed to the design. 

CAST-256 uses the same elements as CAST-128, including [[S-box]]es, but is adapted for a [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] of 128 bits &mdash; twice the size of its 64-bit predecessor. (A similar construction occurred in the evolution of [[RC5]] into [[RC6]]). Acceptable [[key size]]s are 128, 160, 192, 224 or 256 bits. CAST-256 is composed of 48 rounds, sometimes described as 12 "quad-rounds", arranged in a generalised [[Feistel network]].

In [[Request for Comments|RFC]] 2612, the authors state that, "''The CAST-256 cipher described in this document is available worldwide on a royalty-free and licence-free basis for commercial and non-commercial uses.''"
