<html> <head> <title>Digital fabricator</title></head><body>A '''digital fabricator''' (commonly shortened to '''fabber''') is a small, self-contained [[factory]] that can make objects described by digital [[data]]. Fabbers make three-dimensional, solid objects that can be used as [[Physical model|model]]s, as [[prototype]]s, or as delivered products. They are widely used by [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]] for these purposes. Fabbers use a wide range of techniques to make products from a wide range of materials. The quality of these materials and the precision of fabrication can be a major constraint on functional applications.[http://www.ennex.com/~fabbers/intro.asp]

Proposed [[nanofactory|nanofactories]] would be fabbers that employ arrays of nanoscale machines to assemble macroscopic products from molecular feedstocks. This level of control would enable production of high-performance materials that form structures of nearly perfect precision.

The term "fabber" is also used to refer to hypothetical devices that would be capable of [[Universal assembler|Universal Fabrication]]. Given a sufficiently detailed set of plans, power and the correct raw feedstocks, a universal fabber could produce any manufacturable item, including a copy of itself. No proposed machine would be universal in the common sense of the word, since not all physical structures can be manufactured{{WTF}}.
