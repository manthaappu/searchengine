In [[topology]], a '''Jordan curve''' is a non-self-intersecting [[Loop (topology)|continuous loop]] in the plane. The '''Jordan curve theorem''' asserts that every Jordan curve divides the plane into an "interior" region bounded by the curve and an "exterior" region containing all far away points, so that any [[path (topology)|continuous path]] connecting a point of one region to a point of the other intersects that loop somewhere. While the statement is intuitively obvious, it takes quite a bit of ingenuity to prove it by elementary means. More transparent proofs rely on the machinery of [[algebraic topology]] and lead to generalisations to higher-dimensional spaces. 

The Jordan curve theorem is, perhaps, the oldest result in [[set-theoretic topology]] and is named after [[Camille Jordan]], who found the first proof. For a long time, it was generally thought that this proof had been flawed and that the first rigorous proof was due to [[Oswald Veblen]]; however, this view has been challenged by [[Thomas Callister Hales|Thomas Hales]].

== Definitions and the statement of the Jordan theorem ==

A '''Jordan curve''' or a '''simple closed curve''' in the plane '''R'''<sup>2</sup> is the [[image (mathematics)|image]] ''C'' of an [[injective]] [[continuous map]] of a [[circle]] into the plane, ''&phi;'': ''S''<sup>1</sup> &rarr; '''R'''<sup>2</sup>. 
A '''Jordan arc''' in the plane is the image of an injective continuous map of a closed interval into the plane.

Alternatively, a Jordan curve is the image of a continuous map ''&phi;'': [0,1] &rarr; '''R'''<sup>2</sup> such that ''&phi;''(0) = ''&phi;''(1) and the restriction of ''&phi;'' to [0,1) is injective. The first two conditions say that ''C'' is a continuous loop, whereas the last condition stipulates that ''C'' has no self-intersection points.

<blockquote>
Let ''C'' be a Jordan curve in the plane '''R'''<sup>2</sup>. Then its [[complement (set theory)|complement]], '''R'''<sup>2</sup> \ ''C'', consists of exactly two [[connected component (topology)| connected component]]s. One of these components is [[bounded set|bounded]] (the '''interior''') and the other is unbounded (the '''exterior'''), and the curve ''C'' is the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of each component.
</blockquote>

Furthermore, the complement of a Jordan arc in the plane is connected.

== Proof and generalisations ==

Jordan curve theorem was independently generalised to higher dimensions by [[H. Lebesgue]] and [[L.E.J. Brouwer]] in 1911, resulting in the '''Jordan–Brouwer separation theorem'''.

<blockquote>
Let ''X'' be a ''[[topological sphere]]'' in the (''n''+1)-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''<sup>''n''+1</sup>, i.e. the image of an injective continuous mapping of the [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]] ''S<sup>n</sup>'' into '''R'''<sup>''n''+1</sup>.  Then the complement ''Y'' of ''X'' in '''R'''<sup>''n''+1</sup> consists of exactly two connected components.  One of these components is bounded (the interior) and the other is unbounded (the exterior).  The set ''X'' is their common boundary.
</blockquote>

The proof uses [[homology theory]]. It is first established that, more generally, if ''X'' is homeomorphic to the ''k''-sphere, then the [[reduced homology|reduced integral homology]] groups of ''Y'' = '''R'''<sup>''n''+1</sup> \ ''X'' are as follows:

: <math>\tilde{H}_{q}(Y)= \begin{cases}\mathbb{Z},\quad q=n-k \\ 0,\quad \text{otherwise}\end{cases}</math>

This is proved by induction in ''k'' using the [[Mayer–Vietoris sequence]]. When ''n'' = ''k'', the zeroth reduced homology of ''Y'' has rank 1, which means that ''Y'' has 2 connected components (which are, moreover, [[path connected]]), and with a bit of extra work, one shows that their common boundary is ''X''. A further generalisation was found by [[J.W. Alexander]], who established the [[Alexander duality]] between the reduced homology of a [[compact space|compact]] subset ''X'' of '''R'''<sup>''n''+1</sup> and the reduced cohomology of its complement. If ''X'' is an ''n''-dimensional compact connected submanifold of '''R'''<sup>''n''+1</sup> (or '''S'''<sup>''n''+1</sup>) without boundary, its complement has 2 connected components.

There is a strengthening of the Jordan curve theorem, called the [[Jordan–Schönflies theorem]], which states that the interior and the exterior planar regions determined by a Jordan curve in '''R'''<sup>2</sup> are [[homeomorphic]] to the interior and exterior of the [[unit disk]]. In particular, for any point ''P'' in the interior region and a point ''A'' on the Jordan curve, there exists a Jordan arc connecting ''P'' with ''A'' and, with the exception of the endpoint ''A'', completely lying in the interior region. An alternative and equivalent formulation of the Jordan–Schönflies theorem asserts that any Jordan curve ''&phi;'': ''S''<sup>1</sup> &rarr; '''R'''<sup>2</sup>, where ''S''<sup>1</sup> is viewed as the [[unit circle]] in the plane, can be extended to a homeomorphism ''&psi;'': '''R'''<sup>2</sup> &rarr; '''R'''<sup>2</sup> of the plane. Unlike Lebesgues' and Brouwer's generalisation of the Jordan curve theorem, this statement becomes ''false'' in higher dimensions: while the exterior of the unit ball in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> is [[simply connected]], because it [[deformation retract|retracts]] onto the unit sphere, the [[Alexander horned sphere]] is a subset of '''R'''<sup>3</sup> homeomorphic to a [[sphere]], but so twisted in space that the unbounded component of its complement in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> is not simply connected, hence not homeomorphic to the exterior of the unit ball.

== History and further proofs ==

The statement of the Jordan curve theorem may seem obvious at first, but it is a rather difficult theorem to prove. [[Bernard Bolzano]] was the first one to formulate a version of the theorem, observing that it was not a self-evident statement, but required a proof. It is easy to establish the result for polygonal lines, but the problem came in generalising it to all kinds of badly behaved curves, which include [[nowhere differentiable]] curves, such as the [[Koch snowflake]] and other [[fractal curve]]s.

The first  proof was given by [[Camille Jordan]] in his lectures on [[real analysis]] and published in his book ''Cours d'analyse de l'École Polytechnique''.<ref>{{harvs|txt|authorlink=Camille Jordan|first=Camille|last= Jordan|year=1887}}</ref>  There is some controversy about whether Jordan's proof was complete: the majority of authors have claimed that the first complete proof was given by [[Oswald Veblen]], who said the following about Jordan's proof: 

{{cquote|His proof, however, is unsatisfactory to many mathematicians.  It assumes the theorem without proof in the important special case of a simple polygon, and of the argument from that point on, one must admit at least that all details are not given.<ref>{{harvs|txt|authorlink=Oswald Veblen|first=Oswald |last=Veblen|year=1905}}</ref>}} 

However, Thomas Hales wrote: 

{{cquote|Nearly every modern citation that I have found agrees that the first correct proof is due to Veblen... In view of the heavy criticism of Jordan’s proof, I was surprised when I sat down to read his proof to find nothing objectionable about it. Since then, I have contacted a number of the authors who have criticized Jordan, and each case the author has admitted to having no direct knowledge of an error in Jordan’s proof.<ref>{{harvtxt|Hales|2007b}}</ref>}}

Hales also pointed out that the special case of simple polygons is not only an easy exercise, but is not really used by Jordan anyway, and quoted Reeken as saying: 

{{cquote|Jordan’s proof is essentially correct... Jordan’s proof does not present the details in a satisfactory way. But the idea is right and with some polishing the proof would be impeccable.<ref>''Ibid''</ref>}}

Jordan's proof and another early proof due to [[de la Vallée-Poussin]] were later critically analyzed and completed by Shoenflies (1924).

Due to the importance of the Jordan curve theorem in [[low-dimensional topology]] and [[complex analysis]], it received a lot of attention from prominent mathematicians of the first half of the twentieth century. Various proofs of the theorem and its generalizations were found by [[James Waddell Alexander II|J. W. Alexander]], [[Louis Antoine|Antoine]], [[Bieberbach]], [[Luitzen Brouwer|Brouwer]], [[Denjoy]], [[Hartogs]], Kerékjártó, [[Alfred Pringsheim|Pringsheim]], [[Schoenflies]]. 

New elementary proofs of the Jordan curve theorem, as well as simplifications of earlier proofs, continue to be designed.

The first [[formal proof]] of the Jordan curve theorem was created by {{harvtxt|Hales|2007a}} in the [[HOL Light]] system, in January 2005 and contained about 60,000 lines. Another rigorous 6,500-line formal proof was produced in 2005 by an international team of mathematicians using the [[Mizar system]]. Both the Mizar and the HOL Light proof rely on libraries of previously proved theorems, so these two sizes are not comparable. {{harvs|txt | last1=Sakamoto | first1=Nobuyuki | last2=Yokoyama | first2=Keita | title=The Jordan curve theorem and the Schönflies theorem in weak second-order arithmetic | doi=10.1007/s00153-007-0050-6 | id={{MathSciNet | id = 2321588}} | year=2007 | journal=Archive for Mathematical Logic | issn=0933-5846 | volume=46 | issue=5 | pages=465–480}} showed that the Jordan curve theorem is equivalent in proof-theoretic strength to the [[weak  König's  lemma]].
