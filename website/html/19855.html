'''Jeffrey Peter Buzen''' (born May 28, 1943) is an [[United States|American]] [[computer scientist]] in system performance analysis best known for his contributions to [[queueing theory]].

has guided the study of queueing network modeling. 

Born in [[Brooklyn]], Buzen received a [[Bachelor of Science|Sc.B.]] in [[applied mathematics]] from [[Brown University]] (1965), and at [[Harvard University]] received a [[Master of Science|M.Sc.]] (1966) and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] (1971).   He was a systems programmer at the [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] in [[Bethesda, MD]] (1967â€“69), studying the performance of realtime systems, which led to his first publication in a 1969 IEEE conference.<ref>[http://www.cmg.org/measureit/issues/mit11/m_11_1.html Computer Measurement Group ''Casual Day with Jeff Buzen'']</ref>  From 1971 to 1976, he held various appointments as a Lecturer in [[Computer Science]] at Harvard, and as a [[Systems Engineer]] at [[Honeywell]].  Some of his students at Harvard have gone on to become well known figures in the computer industry.  [[Robert M. Metcalfe]] co-invented [[Ethernet]], [[John M. McQuillan]] developed routing algorithms used by [[ARPAnet]], and [[Bill Gates]] co-founded [[Microsoft]].

His career in computer performance analysis has included the creation of several fundamental mathematical models and analysis procedures used in [[operational research]], and the development of tools based on these models and procedures.  With fellow Harvard applied mathematics Ph.D.s Robert Goldberg and Harold Schwenk he co-founded [[BGS Systems]] in 1976 to support and market these tools, serving as its vice president in charge of R&D until BGS Systems merged with [[BMC Software]] in 1998.

He has held leadership positions in various professional societies, including [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] Sigmetrics, the [[International Federation for Information Processing|IFIP]] Working Group and the [[Computer Measurement Group|CMG]] (was President from 2000 to 2001). In 1979, he received CMG's A.A. Michelson award <ref>[http://cmg.org/national/michelson_awards.html Computer Measurement Group ''A. A. Michelson Award'']</ref> for technical excellence and professional contributions as a teacher and inspirer of others.
