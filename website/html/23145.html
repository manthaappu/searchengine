'''Mac OS X Tiger''' (version 10.4) is the fifth [[Software version|major release]] of [[Mac OS X]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple’s]] desktop and server [[operating system]] for [[Macintosh]] computers. Tiger was released to the public on 29 April 2005 for US$129.95 as the successor to [[Mac OS X Panther]] (version 10.3), which had been released 18 months earlier. Tiger was succeeded by [[Mac OS X Leopard]] (version 10.5) on 26 October 2007, after 30 months, making Tiger the longest running version of Mac OS X.<ref name="LowEnd"> {{cite news|last=Knight|first=Dan|title=Leopard Delayed to October.

Tiger was included with all new Macintosh computers, and was also available as an upgrade for existing Mac OS X users, or users of supported pre-Mac OS X systems. The server edition, [[Mac OS X Server#Mac OS X Server 10.4 Tiger|Mac OS X Server 10.4]], was also available for some Macintosh product lines. Tiger is also the first version of any released Apple operating system to work on [[Apple–Intel architecture]] machines (Apple machines using [[x86]] processors). The [[Apple TV]], as released in March 2007, ships with a customized version of Mac OS X Tiger branded "Apple TV OS" that replaces the usual [[graphical user interface]] with an updated version of [[Front Row (software)|Front Row]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macnn.com/articles/07/03/27/apple.tv.on.macs/ |title=Apple TV OS successfully booted on Macs|date=27 March 2007|work=MacNN|accessdate=2007-04-15}}</ref>

Six weeks after its official release, Apple had delivered 2 million copies of Tiger, representing 16 % of all Mac OS X users. Apple claimed that Tiger was the most successful Apple OS release in the company’s history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/news/2005/06/06/liveupdate/index.php|title=WWDC 2005 Keynote Live Update|author=Peter Cohen and Jason Snell| publisher=Macworld.com|date=6 June 2005|accessdate=2006-07-10}}</ref> At the World Wide Developers Conference on June 11, 2007, Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced that out of the 22 million Mac OS X users, more than 67 % were using Tiger.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/d7625zs/event/|title=WWDC 2007 Keynote|author=Apple Inc.|date =11 June 2007}}</ref> Tiger is the last version of Mac OS X to support a [[Mac OS 9]] compatibility layer called [[Classic Environment]]. However, Classic Environment will not work on Intel Macs.

==System requirements==
Tiger was initially available in a PowerPC edition, with an Intel edition released beginning at 10.4.4 all (Is not available for retail sale anymore); there is no universal version of the client operating system, although Tiger Server was made available on a universal DVD from version 10.4.7. While Apple shipped the PowerPC edition bundled with PowerPC-based Macs and also sold it as a separate retail box, the only way to get the Intel version was bundled with an Intel-based Mac. However, there were still unofficial places to buy the Intel version such as eBay, although the only Intel discs produced were the gray-colored "restore" DVDs supplied with new Macs that will only install on the model of Mac that they are intended for, unlike the retail DVD that can be used on any Mac supported by Tiger.

The system requirements of the PowerPC edition are:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1514|title=Mac OS X Tiger: System requirements|author=Apple|publisher=Apple|accessdate= 2009-10-18}}</ref>
*A [[PowerPC G3]], [[PowerPC G4|G4]], or [[PowerPC G5|G5]] processor running at 500 MHz or faster
*Built-in [[FireWire]] (Firewire 800 Recommended)
*At least 256 MB of RAM, 128 MB can run it unofficially though (512 MB or 1 GB recommended)
*At least 3 GB of available hard disk space; 4 GB of disk space including the [[Xcode]] 2 Tools, 2 GB for the minimal install
*DVD-R drive (CD-ROM exchange was available; offer ended on March 20th, 2007)

Tiger removed support for older [[New World ROM]] Macs such as the original [[iMac]]s and [[iBook]]s that were supported in [[Mac_os_x_panther|Panther]]; however it is possible to install Tiger on these Macs using third-party software (such as [[XPostFacto]]) that overrides the checks made at the beginning of the installation process. Likewise, machines such as [[Power Macintosh G3|beige Power Mac G3s]] and “Wall Street” PowerBook G3s that were dropped by Panther (the preceding release of Mac OS X) can also be made to run both Panther and Tiger in this way. Also, Tiger can be installed on unsupported New World ROM Macs by installing it on a supported Mac, then swapping hard drives. Old World ROM Macs require the use of XPostFacto to install Tiger.

Tiger was the last version of Mac OS X that supported the PowerPC G3 processor.

==History==
Apple CEO [[Steve Jobs]] first presented Tiger in his keynote presentation at the Worldwide Developers Conference on 28 June 2004, ten months before its commercial release in April 2005. Four months before that official release, several non-commercial, developer's releases of Tiger leaked onto the Internet via [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] file sharers. Apple sued these file sharers.<ref name="BBC-Tiger-sued">{{cite news|title=Apple sues 'Tiger' file sharers|work=BBC News| pages=|language=|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2004-12-22|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4117465.stm|accessdate=2007-12-09|location=London}}</ref> On April, 12 2005, Apple announced Tiger's official, worldwide release would be April 29. All [[Apple Store (retail)|Apple Store]]s around the world held Tiger seminars, presentations and demos.

On June 6, 2005 at the Worldwide Developers Conference in [[San Francisco]], Jobs reported that nearly two million copies had been sold in Tiger’s first six weeks of release, making it the most successful operating system release in Apple’s history. Jobs then disclosed that Mac OS X had been engineered from its inception to work with [[Intel]]’s [[X86|''x''86]] line of processors in addition to the [[PowerPC]], the CPU for which the operating system had always been publicly marketed. Apple concurrently announced its intent to release the first ''x''86-based computers in June 2006, [[Apple–Intel transition|and to move the rest of its computers to ''x''86 microprocessors]] by June 2007. On January 10, 2006, Apple presented its new [[iMac]] and [[MacBook Pro]] computers running on [[Intel Core|Intel Core Duo]] processors, and announced that the entire Apple product line would run on Intel processors by the end of 2006. Apple then released the [[Mac Pro]] and announced the new [[Xserve]] on August 8, completing the Intel transition in 210 days, roughly ten months ahead of the original schedule.

Tiger is the first version of Mac OS X to be supplied on a DVD, although the DVD could originally be exchanged for CDs for $9.95. It is also the first (and so far only) version of Mac OS that would eventually have an update version number ending with a value greater than 9.

==New and changed features==
===End-user features===
Apple advertises that Tiger has 150+ features, including:

*'''[[Spotlight (software)|Spotlight]]''' — Spotlight is a full-text and [[metadata (computing)|metadata]] search engine, which can search everything from [[Microsoft Word|Word]] documents to [[iCal]] calendars to [[vCard|Address Book cards]], as well as any text within [[Portable document format|PDF]] files. The feature is also used to build the concept of ''[[virtual folder|smart folders]]'' into the [[Macintosh Finder|Finder]]. Spotlight will index files as they are saved, so they can be quickly and easily found through a search-as-you-type box in the menu bar. As a side-effect, it adds hidden folders and indexing files to removable media like USB flash drives.
*'''[[iChat|iChat AV]]''' — The new iChat AV 3.0 in Tiger supports up to four participants in a video conference and ten participants in an audio conference. It also now supports communication using the [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]] protocol. A XMPP server called ''iChat Server'' is included on Mac OS X Tiger Server.
*'''[[Safari (web browser)|Safari RSS]]''' — The new Safari 2.0 [[web browser]] in Tiger features a built-in reader for [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] and [[Atom (standard)|Atom]] [[web syndication]] that can be accessed easily from an RSS button in the address bar of the web browser window. An updated version of Safari, included as part of the free Mac OS X v10.4.3 update, can also pass the [[Acid2]] web standards test.
*'''[[Mail (application)|Mail 2]]''' — The new version of Mail.app [[email client]] included in Tiger featured an updated interface, "Smart Mailboxes" which utilize the Spotlight search system, parental controls, as well as several other features.
[[File:Dashboard_Adding_Widget.png|thumb|right|200px|The Dashboard allows for miniature applications called "Widgets" to appear and disappear rapidly from the screen.]]

*'''[[Dashboard (software)|Dashboard]]''' — The Dashboard is a new mini-applications layer based on [[HTML]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], and [[JavaScript]], which returns the [[desk accessories]] concept to the Mac OS. These accessories are known as [[Widget (computing)|widget]]s. It comes with several widgets such as Weather, World Clock, Unit Converter, and Dictionary/Thesaurus. More are available for free online. Its similarity to the [[Konfabulator]] application caused some criticism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/macosx-10-4.ars/17|title=Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger|pages=17|author=[[John Siracusa]]|date=28 April 2005|accessdate= 2006-06-11}}</ref>
*'''[[Automator (software)|Automator]]''' — A scripting tool called ''Automator'' to link applications together to form complex automated workflows (written in [[AppleScript]], [[Cocoa (software)|Cocoa]], or both). Automator comes with a complete library of actions for several applications that can be used together to make a Workflow.
*'''[[VoiceOver]]''' — VoiceOver is an accessibility interface that offers the user magnification options, keyboard control and spoken English descriptions of what is happening on screen. VoiceOver enables users with visual impairment the ability to use applications via spoken commands. It also allows a user to work collaboratively with other users on a single Mac by allowing multiple users give voice commands to scroll text, etc. VoiceOver is capable of reading aloud the contents of files including web pages, mail messages and word processing files. The complete keyboard navigation lets the user control the computer with the keyboard rather than mouse, a menu is displayed in a window showing all the available keyboard commands that can be used.
*'''A complete built-in [[Dictionary]]/[[Thesaurus]]''' based on the ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary|New Oxford American Dictionary, Second Edition]]'', accessible through an application, Dictionary, a Dashboard widget, and as a system-wide command (see below).
*'''[[.Mac]] syncing''' — Though this is not a new feature, .Mac syncing in Tiger is much improved over Panther. Syncing tasks in Tiger are now accomplished through the .Mac system preferences pane rather than the [[iSync]] application.
*'''[[QuickTime]] 7''' — A new version of Apple’s multimedia software has support for the new [[H.264|H.264/AVC]] codec which offers better quality and scalability than other video [[codec]]s. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} This new codec is used by iChat AV for clearer video conferencing. New classes within Cocoa provide full access to QuickTime for Cocoa application developers. The new QuickTime 7 player application bundled with Tiger now includes more advanced audio and video controls as well as a more detailed Information dialog, and the new player has been rebuilt using Apple’s [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa API]] to take advantage of the new technologies more easily.
*'''New [[Unix]] features''' — New versions of [[cp (Unix)|cp]], [[mv]], and [[rsync]] which support files with [[resource fork]]s. Command-line support for features like the above-mentioned Spotlight are also included.
*'''[[Xcode|Xcode 2.0]]''' — Xcode 2.0, Apple’s Cocoa development tool now includes visual modelling, an integrated [[Apple Reference Library]] and graphical remote [[debugging]].

===New applications in Tiger===
*[[Automator (software)|Automator]] — Automator uses workflows to process repetitive tasks automatically
*[[Grapher]] — Grapher is a new application capable of creating 2D and 3D graphs similar to that of [[NuCalc|Graphing Calculator]].
*[[Dictionary (software)|Dictionary]] — A dictionary and thesaurus program which uses the [[New Oxford American Dictionary]]. It has a fast GUI for displaying the Dictionary, and allows the user to search the dictionary with Spotlight, to print definitions, and to copy and paste text into documents. Dictionary also provides a Dictionary service in the Application menu, and Cocoa and [[WebKit]] provides a global keyboard shortcut (ctrl-⌘-D by default) for all applications that display text with them. Its use was furthered in the [[Mac OS X Leopard|next version of OS X]] by providing definitions from [[Wikipedia]]. The Dictionary application is a more feature-filled version of the Dictionary widget.
*[[Quartz Composer]] — Quartz Composer is a development tool for processing and rendering graphical data.
*[[Apple Developer Tools#Audio Unit Lab|AU Lab]] — AU Lab is a developer application for testing and mixing [[Audio Units]].
*[[Dashboard (software)|Dashboard]] — Dashboard is a [[widget engine|widget]] application. Tiger widgets include: a calculator, dictionary, a world clock, a calendar, and more ([[Dashboard (software)#Included widgets|full list]]). A user can also download and install more widgets, including one for the [http://wikipedia-widget.en.softonic.com/Wikipedia Wikipedia encyclopedia].

==Improvements==
*An upgraded [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] with optimized kernel resource locking and [[access control list]]s, and with support for [[64-bit]] [[user space|userland]] [[address space]]s on machines with 64-bit processors.<ref name=64bit>{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/macosx-10-4.ars/4|title=Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger|pages=4|author=John Siracusa|date=28 April 2005| work=ArsTechnica.com|accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref>
*An updated libSystem with both 32-bit and 64-bit versions; combined with the aforementioned kernel change, this allows individual applications to address more than 4 GB of memory when run on 64-bit processors, although an application using Apple libraries or frameworks other than libSystem would need to have two processes, one running the 64-bit code and one running the code that requires other libraries and frameworks.<ref name=64bit/><ref>{{cite web|url= http://developer.apple.com/macosx/64bit.html|title=Developing 64-bit applications|author=Apple|date =6 March 2006|work=Apple Developer Connection|accessdate=2007-03-05}}</ref>
*A new startup [[daemon (computer software)|daemon]] called [[launchd]] that allows for faster boots.
*The printing dialog in Tiger now features a drop down menu for creating [[PDF]]s, sending PDFs to Mail, and other PDF related actions. However, the user interface has been criticized for creating a hybrid [[widget (computing)|widget]] that looks like a plain button but acts like a pop-up menu. This is one of only three places in the entire Mac OS X interface where such an element appears.
*Dock menus now have menu items to open an application at login, or to remove the icon from the dock.
*The Window menu in the Finder now features a "Cycle Through Windows" menu item.
*The Get Info window for items in the Finder now includes a "More Info" section that includes Spotlight information tags such as Image Height & Width, when the file was last opened, and where the file originated.
*Early development of resolution independence. Apple notes that this will be a user-level feature in a future version of Mac OS X.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://developer.apple.com/releasenotes/GraphicsImaging/RN-ResolutionIndependentUI/|title=Resolution Independent UI|publisher=Apple Developer Connection|accessdate=2006-07-10}}</ref> Among the changes, the maximum size of icons has been increased to 256x256. However, the Finder does not yet support this size.

===Technologies===
*A new graphics processing [[application programming interface|API]], [[Core Image]], leveraging the power of the available accelerated graphics cards.
::Core Image allows programmers to easily leverage programmable GPUs for fast image processing for special effects and image correction tools. Some of the included Image Units included are Blur, Color Blending, Generator Filters, Distortion Filters, Geometry Filters, Halftone features and much more.
*A new data persistence API, [[Core Data]], that makes it easier for developers to handle structured data in their applications.
::The Mac OS X [[Core Data]] API helps developers create data structures for their applications. Core Data provides undo, redo and save functions for developers without them having to write any code.
*A new video graphics API, [[Core Video]], which leverages Core Image to provide real-time video processing.
::Apple’s [[Apple Motion|Motion]] real-time video effects program takes advantage of [[Core Video]] in Tiger. Core Video lets developers easily integrate real-time video effects and processing into their applications.
*[[Core Audio]] integrates a range of audio functionality directly into the operating system.

===Interface differences===
In every major new revision of Mac OS X, Apple alters the [[graphical user interface]] somewhat. In Tiger the menu bar displayed at the top of the screen now features a colored Spotlight button in the upper right corner; the menu itself has a smoother '[[glass]]y' texture to replace the faint pinstripes in Panther.

Also of note, Tiger introduces a new window theme, often described as ‘Unified’. A variation on the standard, non-brushed metal theme used since the introduction of Mac OS X, this theme integrates the title bar and the toolbar of a window. A prominent example of an application that utilizes this theme is [[Mail (application)|Mail]].

==Tiger trademark lawsuit==
Shortly before the release of Mac OS X Tiger, the computer retailer [[TigerDirect.com|TigerDirect.com, Inc.]] filed a lawsuit against Apple, alleging that Apple infringed TigerDirect.com’s trademark with the Mac OS X ''Tiger'' operating system.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/05/04/28/apple_sued_over_tiger_injunction_sought.html| title=Apple sued over "Tiger," injunction sought|author=AppleInsider Staff|date=28 April 2005| publisher=AppleInsider|accessdate=2006-07-10}}</ref>

The following is a quotation from TigerDirect.com’s court memorandum:

:''Apple Computer’s use of its infringing family of Tiger marks to expand sales of products besides its operating system software is already evident — for example, Apple Computer is offering free iPods and laptops as part of its Tiger World Premiere giveaway. In short, notwithstanding its representation to the PTO that it would only use Tiger in connection with their unique computer operating system software, Apple Computer has in recent weeks used a family of Tiger marks in connection with a substantially broader group of products and services, including the very products and services currently offered by Tiger Direct under its famous family of Tiger marks.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apple.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=147715&cid=12377926|title=Some points for TigerDirect|author=lawyerguy|date=28 April 2005|publisher=Slashdot|accessdate=2006-07-10}}</ref>

The judge in the case ruled in Apple’s favor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/05/05/13/court_sides_with_apple_over_tiger_trademark_dispute.html|title=Court sides with Apple over “Tiger” trademark dispute|author=Kasper Jade|date=13 May 2005|publisher=AppleInsider| accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref>

==Support for Intel processors==
{{AppleIntel}}

At the 2005 [[Worldwide Developers Conference]], Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced that Apple would begin selling Mac computers with Intel processors in 2006. To allow developers to begin producing software for these Intel-based Macs, Apple made Developer Transition Kits available for sale which included a version of Mac OS X v10.4.1 designed to run on [[x86]] processors.

This build includes Apple’s [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]]—a translation process that allows Intel processor versions of the OS to run PPC software with little penalty. This is contrasted with the current Mac OS 9 [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]] mode, which uses comparably larger amounts of system resources.

Soon after the Developer Transition Kits began shipping, copies of Tiger x86 leaked onto [[file sharing]] networks. Although Apple had implemented a [[Trusted Computing]] [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]] scheme in the transition hardware and OS in an attempt to stop people installing Tiger x86 on non-Apple PCs, [[OSx86]] project had soon managed to remove this restriction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/commentary/cultofmac/2005/08/68501|title=Mac Hacks Allow OS X on PCs|author=Mark Baard|date=12 August 2005|publisher=Wired News|accessdate= 2006-07-10}}</ref> As Apple released each update with newer safeguards to prevent its use on non-Apple hardware, hacked versions were released that circumvented Apple’s safeguards. However, with the release of 10.4.5, 10.4.6, and 10.4.7 the hacked versions continued to use the kernel from the 10.4.4 because later kernels have hardware locks and depend heavily on [[Extensible Firmware Interface]]. By late 2006, the 10.4.8 kernel was cracked.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2006/10/25/osx_generic_intel/|title=Mac OS X 10.4.8 runs on any PC...| author=Tony Smith|date=25 October 2006|publisher=Reg Hardware ([[The Register]])|accessdate= 2006-12-16}}</ref>

At MacWorld San Francisco 2006, Jobs announced the immediate availability of Mac OS X v10.4.4, the first publicly available release of Tiger compiled for both PowerPC and Intel x86 based machines.
