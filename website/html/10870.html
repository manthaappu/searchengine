'''Doctor shopping''' refers to the practice of a patient requesting care from multiple physicians, often simultaneously, without making efforts to coordinate care or informing the physicians of the multiple caregivers.  This usually stems from a [[patient]]'s addiction to, or reliance on, certain [[prescription drug]]s or other medical treatment.  Usually a patient will be treated by their regular [[physician]] and be prescribed a drug that is necessary for the legitimate treatment of their current medical condition. Some patients will then actively seek out other physicians to obtain more of the same medication, often by faking or exaggerating the extent of their true condition, in order to feed their addiction to that drug.

Not all patients seeking inappropriate multiple prescriptions of drugs are doing so because of addiction or an intention to abuse the drugs for their recreational effects. In the United States, increasing scrutiny of prescribing practices and high-profile prosecutions of doctors<ref>[http://www.fanlight.com/catalog/films/352_mot.php Morphine on Trial — Fanlight Productions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> for allegedly over-prescribing drugs such as [[opiate]] painkillers and [[benzodiazepine]] tranquilizers has made many doctors extremely reluctant to prescribe large doses or repeat prescriptions of these drugs, even to patients with a legitimate medical need.  Some consider the high-profile case of [[Richard Paey]] an example of such.

==Commonly abused prescription drugs==

In the United States, most [[sedatives]] can only be legally dispensed with a prescription, because they have some potential for addiction and dependence. If sedatives are prescribed, it is sometimes in small quantities, which will last one week or even less.  Examples of such drugs include [[zolpidem]] (Ambien), [[alprazolam]] (Xanax), and [[diazepam]] (Valium).  Dependence on such medications usually arises because the patient,comes to rely on the effects of the drug to fall asleep, or to prevent anxiety attacks.

Prescription pain medications that contain an [[opiate]] or [[opioid]] painkiller have some potential for addiction and abuse, including [[oxycodone]] (common brand names [[Percocet]], OxyContin), [[hydrocodone]] ([[Vicodin]], Lortab), [[pethidine|meperidine]] (brand name Demerol), [[hydromorphone]] (Palladone, Dilaudid), [[oxymorphone]] (Opana, Numorphan), and [[morphine]] ([[MS Contin]], Kadian, Avinza). Less powerful opiates and opioids (such as [[codeine]], [[propoxyphene]]), and [[tramadol]] are generally less addictive. [[Tramadol]] is a novel, [[Controlled Substances Act|non-scheduled]] analgesic similar in effect to other narcotic painkillers, but has a high risk of inducing seizures.

Newer medications of abuse include various preparations of the extremely potent and potentially addictive narcotic analgesic [[fentanyl]], including [[Duragesic]] (a self-adhesive skin patch, available in four strengths) and [[Actiq]] (berry-flavored lollipops that that dissolve slowly in the mouth for absorption across the [[buccal mucosa]], available in six strengths). All of these are categorized as Schedule II drugs under the U.S. [[Controlled Substances Act]] (with the exception of tramadol and some preparations of codeine and hydrocodone) and have stringent physical security associated with them. They must remain under lock and key at all times; every tablet must be precisely accounted for; no refills are permitted on prescriptions; and no telephone orders are accepted, with the exception of [[palliative care]] facilities (i.e., to discourage prescription fraud).

==Legal issues==

Because of the widespread abuse of prescription drugs in both the United States and around the world, regulatory authorities have been discouraging the practice by cracking down on the process of doctor shopping, with some U.S. states even criminalizing the practice.  Doctors have also undergone both education and training in recent years about the dangers of prescribing unneeded medication (it casts a bad light on the doctor and often public health systems pay for prescribed medication, so it will cost the taxpayer more).
