'''Database Forensics''' is a branch of [[digital forensics|digital forensic science]] relating to the forensic study of [[databases]] and their related metadata.<ref>{{cite web|last=Olivier|first=Martin S.|title=On metadata context in Database Forensics|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B7CW4-4TSD9G6-1/2/a5031117d753054d92f2afba332eadf8|publisher=Science Direct|accessdate=2 August 2010|doi=10.1016/j.diin.2008.10.001.|month=March|year=2009}}</ref>

The discipline is similar to [[computer forensics]], following the normal forensic process and applying investigative techniques to database contents and metadata. Cached information may also exist in a servers [[RAM]] requiring [[Digital forensics#live analysis|live analysis]] techniques.

A forensic examination of a database may relate to the timestamps that apply to the update time of a row in a relational table being inspected and tested for validity in order to verify the actions of a database user.  Alternatively, a forensic examination may focus on identifying transactions within a database system or application that indicate evidence of wrong doing, such as fraud. 

Software tools such as ACL, Idea and Arbutus (which provide a read-only environment) can be used to manipulate and analyse data.  These tools also provide audit logging capabilities which provide documented proof of what tasks or analysis a forensic examiner performed on the database.

Currently many database software tools are in general not reliable and precise enough to be used for forensic work as demonstrated in the first paper published on database forensics.<ref>[http://www.giac.org/certified_professionals/practicals/gcfa/0159.php Oracle Database Forensics using LogMiner - GIAC Certified Student Practical<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
There is currently a single book published in this field,<ref>Oracle Forensics ISBN 0977671526 (May 2008)</ref> though more are destined.<ref>Oracle Forensics Using Quisix ISBN 047019118X (Dec 2008)</ref>
Additionally there is a subsequent SQL Server forensics book by Kevvie Fowler named SQL Server Forensics which is well regarded also.<ref>SQL Server Forensics  ISBN 0321544366 (Dec 2008)</ref>

The forensic study of relational databases requires a knowledge of the standard used to encode data on the computer disk. A documentation of standards used to encode information in well known brands of DB such as SQL Server and Oracle has been contributed to the public domain.<ref>[http://www.sans.org/reading_room/whitepapers/forensics/1906.php SANS Institute - Forensic Analysis of a SQL Server 2005 Database Server<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.databasesecurity.com/oracle-forensics.htm Oracle Forensics and Incident Response - databasesecurity.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
