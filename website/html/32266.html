'''Robomaxx''' is a [[robot]]ic [[vacuum cleaner]].
However, in stark contrast to most other robotic vacuum cleaners, no vacuum cleaner mechanism is present, nor are there any circuits to decide on which path the robot takes. Instead a kind of swiffer cloth is attached to the bottom of the robot and this pushes the dirt along. The robot changes direction because the central wheel has a differential and thus drives into the direction with the least resistance.
