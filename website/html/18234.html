'''Infoanarchism''' is an [[umbrella term]] for various groups of people who are opposed to forms of [[intellectual property]], such as [[copyright]] and [[patent]]s. The term was coined in a ''[[TIME Magazine]]'' article called "The Infoanarchist" in July 2000.  The article was about [[Ian Clarke (computer scientist)|Ian Clarke]], known as the original designer and lead developer of [[Freenet]].  The [[anti-copyright]] movement includes a wide range of groups and views.  Infoanarchists have emerged as part of the broader [[copyright social conflict]] and [[copyright]] debate.

Infoanarchists may use [[anonymous P2P]] networks, like [[Freenet]], [[Entropy (anonymous data store)|Entropy]], [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] or [[I2P]], to help protect their anonymity. These anonymous networks make it difficult for observers, or any middleman, to determine what traffic is going across the network. Such technology may serve to protect people who wish to publish or receive digital files anonymously, like corporate whistleblowers, political dissidents, or groups that engage in the deliberate infringement of copyright law. <!-- why is this paragraph relevant? they may also drive cars as well as use Tor! -->
