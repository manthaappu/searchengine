<html> <head> <title>Metric k-center</title></head><body>In [[graph theory]], the '''metric ''k''-center''', is a [[combinatorial optimization]] problem studied in [[theoretical computer science]]. Given ''n'' cities with specified distances, one wants to build ''k'' warehouses in different cities and minimize the distance of the farthest city from its closest warehouse. In graph theory this means finding a set of ''k'' vertices for which the largest distance of any point to its closest vertex in the ''k''-set is minimum. The vertices must be in a metric space, or in other words a [[complete graph]] that satisfies the [[triangle inequality]].

==Formal definition==
Given a complete undirected graph ''G'' = (''V'', ''E'') with distances ''d''(''v''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''v''<sub>''j''</sub>) &isin; ''N'' satisfying the triangle inequality, find a subset ''S'' &sube; ''V'' with |''S''| = ''k'' while minimizing:

: <math>\max_{v \in V} \min_{s \in S} d(v,s)</math>

==Computational complexity==
If we sort the edges in nondecreasing order of the distances: ''d''(''e''<sub>1</sub>) &le; ''d''(''e''<sub>2</sub>) &le; &hellip; &le; ''d''(''e''<sub>m</sub>) and let ''G''<sub>i</sub> = (''V''<sub>i</sub>, ''E''<sub>i</sub>), where ''E''<sub>i</sub> = {''e''<sub>1</sub>, ''e''<sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, ''e''<sub>i</sub>}. The ''k''-center problem is equivalent to finding the smallest index ''i'' such that ''G''<sub>i</sub> has a [[dominating set]] of size at most ''k''.<ref>{{harvnb|Vazirani|2003|pp=47&ndash;48}}.</ref> Dominating set is [[NP-complete]] and therefore the ''k''-center problem is also NP-complete.

==Approximations==
A simple [[greedy algorithm| greedy]] [[approximation algorithm]] that achieves an approximation factor of 2 builds S in ''k'' iterations. The first iteration chooses an arbitrary vertex and adds it to ''S''. Each subsequent iteration chooses a vertex ''v'' for which ''d''(S, v) is maximized and adds ''v'' to ''S''. The running time of the algorithm is ''O''(''nk'').<ref>{{harvnb|Gonzalez|1985|pp=293&ndash;306}}.</ref>

Another algorithm with the same approximation factor takes advantage of the fact that the ''k''-center problem is equivalent to finding the smallest index ''i'' such that ''G''<sub>i</sub> has a dominating set of size at most ''k'' and computes a maximal [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] on the of ''G''<sub>i</sub>, looking for the smallest index ''i'' that has a maximal independent set with a size of at least ''k''.<ref>{{harvnb|Hochbaum|Shmoys|1986|pp=533&ndash;550}}.</ref>

It is not possible to find an approximation algorithm with an approximation factor of 2 &minus; &epsilon; for any &epsilon; > 0.<ref>{{harvnb|Hochbaum|1997|pp=346&ndash;398}}.</ref> Furthermore, the distances of all edges in G must satisfy the triangle inequality if the ''k''-center problem is to be approximated unless P = NP.<ref>{{harvnb|Crescenzi|Kann|Halldórsson|Karpinski|2000}}.</ref>
