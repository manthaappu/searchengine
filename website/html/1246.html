Shihab al-Din abu 'l-Abbas Ahmad ben Ali ben '''Ahmad Abd Allah al-Qalqashandi''' (1355 or 1356 &ndash; 1418) was a medieval [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] writer and [[Islamic mathematics|mathematician]] born in a village in the [[Nile Delta]]. He is the author of ''Subh al-a 'sha'', a fourteen volume [[encyclopedia]] in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], which included a section on [[cryptology]]. This information was attributed to Taj ad-Din Ali ibn ad-Duraihim ben Muhammad ath-Tha 'alibi al-Mausili who lived from 1312 to 1361, but whose writings on cryptology have been lost. The list of ciphers in this work included both [[Substitution cipher|substitution]] and [[Transposition cipher|transposition]], and for the first time, a cipher with multiple substitutions for each [[plaintext]] letter. Also traced to Ibn al-Duraihim is an exposition on and worked example of cryptanalysis, including the use of tables of [[letter frequencies]] and sets of letters which can not occur together in one word.
