'''Theo de Raadt''' ({{IPA-en|ˈθiː.oʊ dɛˈrɔːt}}, {{IPA-nl|ˈteː.o dɛˈraːt}}), born May 19, 1968 in [[Pretoria]], [[South Africa]], is a [[software engineer]] who lives in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. He is the founder and leader of the [[OpenBSD]] and [[OpenSSH]] projects, and was a founding member of the [[NetBSD]] project.

== Childhood ==
Theo de Raadt is the eldest of four children to a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] father, and a [[South Africa]]n mother, with two sisters and a brother. Concern over the mandatory two-year armed forces [[conscription]] in South Africa led the family to emigrate to Calgary, Alberta, Canada in November 1977. In 1983 the largest [[recession]] in Canada since the [[Great Depression]] sent the family to the [[Yukon]]. Prior to the move de Raadt got his first computer, a [[Commodore VIC-20]], which was soon followed by an [[Amiga]]. It is with these computers that he first began to develop software.<ref>The Age article:  [http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/07/1097089476287.html "Staying on the cutting edge"]. October 8, 2004.  Accessed April 5, 2006.</ref>

In 1992 he obtained a [[BSc]] in [[Computer Science]] from the [[University of Calgary]].

== NetBSD ==

The [[NetBSD]] project was founded in 1993 by [[Chris Demetriou]], [[Adam Glass]], [[Charles Hannum]], and de Raadt, who collectively felt frustration at the speed and quality of [[Jolix]], the then standard Berkeley software distribution, and believed that a more open development model would be of greater benefit to development of an operating system.   Jolix, also known as [[386BSD]], was derived from the original University of California Berkeley's 4.3BSD release, while the new NetBSD project would merge relevant code from the Networking/2 and 386BSD releases.   The new project would centre its focus on clean, portable, correct code with the goal being to produce a unified, multi-platform, production-quality, BSD-based operating system.

Because of the importance of networks such as the Internet in the distributed, collaborative nature of its development, de Raadt suggested the name "NetBSD", which the three other founders agreed upon.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The first NetBSD source code repository was established on March 21, 1993 and the initial release, NetBSD 0.8, was made in April, [[1993]].  This was derived from 386BSD 0.1 plus the version 0.2.2 unofficial patchkit, with several programs from the Net/2 release missing from 386BSD re-integrated, and various other improvements.  In August the [[1993|same year]], NetBSD 0.9 was released, which contained many enhancements and bug fixes. This was still a [[PC compatible|PC]]-platform-only release, although by this time work was underway to add support for other architectures.

NetBSD 1.0 was released in October, [[1994]].  This was the first multi-platform release, supporting the [[IBM PC compatible]], [[HP 9000]] Series 300, [[Amiga]], [[68k]] [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]], [[Sun-4]]c series and [[PC532]].  Also in this release, the legally-encumbered Net/2-derived source code was replaced with equivalent code from 4.4BSD-lite, in accordance with the  [[USL v BSDi]] lawsuit settlement.  De Raadt played a vital role in the creation of the [[SPARC]] port, as together with  Chuck Cranor [http://chuck.cranor.org/], he implemented much of the initial code.

== OpenBSD ==

In December 1994, de Raadt was asked to resign his position as a senior developer and member of the NetBSD core team, and his access to the source code repository was revoked. The reason for this is not wholly clear, although there are claims that it was due to personality clashes within the NetBSD project and on its [[Electronic mailing list|mailing lists]].<ref name="glass">Glass, Adam.

In October 1995, de Raadt founded OpenBSD, a new project [[fork (software development)|forked]] from NetBSD 1.0. The initial [[Software release|release]], OpenBSD 1.2, was made in July 1996, followed in October of the same year by OpenBSD 2.0.<ref>de Raadt, Theo.

== Outspokenness ==

[[Image:Maddog-deraadt.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[maddog|Jon "maddog" Hall]] presents de Raadt with [[BSD Daemon|daemon]] horns at [[Fórum Internacional Software Livre|fisl8]]]]
De Raadt has been a vocal advocate of Free Software since the inception of OpenBSD, but he is also a strong proponent of free speech, having on occasion had rather public disputes with various groups, from Linux advocates to governments.  This outspoken attitude, while sometimes the cause of conflict, has also led him to acclaim; de Raadt has given presentations at open source, free software and security conferences around the world &mdash; including [[FOSDEM]] in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], [[Usenix]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]], [[United States|U.S.]], [[AUUG]] Conference in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] and [[fisl]] in [[Porto Alegre]], RS, [[Brazil]].

=== DARPA funding cancellation ===

After de Raadt stated his disapproval of the U.S.-led [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–present|occupation of Iraq]] in an April, 2003 [[interview]]<ref>Globe and Mail article: [http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/article996772.ece "U.S. military helps fund Calgary hacker"].  April 6, 2003.  Accessed October 30, 2006.</ref> with [[Toronto]]'s ''[[The Globe and Mail|Globe and Mail]]'', a multi-million-dollar [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] grant to the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s [[POSSE project]] was cancelled, effectively ending the project.  Funding from the grant had been used in the development of OpenSSH and OpenBSD, as well as many other projects and was to be used to pay for the ''[[hackathon]]'' planned for May 8, 2003.  Despite money from the grant already having been used to secure accommodations for sixty developers for a week, the money was reclaimed by the government at a loss and the hotel was told not to allow the developers to pay the reclaimed money to resecure the rooms.<ref>LWN.net article:  [http://lwn.net/Articles/29186/ "DARPA Cancels OpenBSD Funding"].  April 24, 2003.  Accessed April 5, 2006.</ref>  This resulted in criticism among some that the US military held an anti-[[free speech]] attitude. The grant termination was, however, not as bad a blow as some portrayed it.  The project's supporters rallied to help and the hackathon went on almost as planned.  The funding was cut mere months before the end of the grant, further fueling the speculations regarding the situation surrounding the grant's termination. It did, however, also negatively influence DARPA funding on other BSD-related projects, such as FreeBSD.

=== Free driver advocacy ===

De Raadt is also well known for his advocacy of [[free software]] [[device driver|drivers]].  He has long been critical of developers of [[Linux]] and other free platforms for their tolerance of non-free drivers and acceptance of [[non-disclosure agreement]]s.

In particular, de Raadt has worked to convince [[IEEE 802.11|wireless]] hardware vendors to allow the [[firmware]] images of their products to be freely redistributed. These efforts have been largely successful, particularly in negotiations with [[Taiwan]]ese companies, leading to many new wireless drivers.  Today, de Raadt encourages wireless users to "buy Taiwanese", due to lack of willingness from US companies like [[Intel]] and [[Broadcom]] to release firmware images free from [[software license|licensing]] restrictions.

For this de Raadt was awarded the [[Free Software Foundation]]'s [[2004]] [[Award for the Advancement of Free Software]].

=== Clash with Linux developers ===

In April 2007, de Raadt was involved in a controversy involving the use of [[GPL]] code from the Linux ''bcm43xx'' driver in the BSD ''bcw'' driver.<ref>LXer article: [http://lxer.com/module/newswire/view/85224/ Broadcom Driver Dispute Uglier Than Necessary].  April 7, 2007.  Accessed April 8, 2007.</ref><ref>Thread on gmane.linux.kernel.wireless.general: [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.wireless.general/1558/focus=1558 OpenBSD bcw: Possible GPL license violation issues] Various dates beginning April 4, 2007.  Accessed April 8, 2007.</ref>  Linux developers accused the BSD community of infringing GPL code, but de Raadt denied infringement, arguing that the BSD driver was not "released".  He also maintained that the conflict was not about GPL, but the way Linux developer [[Michael Buesch]] handled the situation.  To Buesch's email, he responded:<ref>Thread on gmane.linux.kernel.wireless.general: [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.wireless.general/1561 Re: OpenBSD bcw: Possible GPL license violation issues].  April 4, 2007.  Accessed April 15, 2007.</ref>

It will be resolved in our tree, but it is up to him which way he does
it.  But when you approach issues like this with comments like "We'd
like you to start contacting us to resolve the issue now" and your
first mail is cc'd to a couple hundred people.... in the future,
please think more carefully, ok?

Because right now, in that mail, you've pretty much done Broadcom's
job for them.  You've told the entire BSD community who may want to
use a driver for this chip later, that because of a few GPL issues you
are willing to use very strong words -- published very widely -- to
disrupt the efforts of one guy who is trying to do things for them.
And, you are going to do this using the GPL, even.  You did not
privately mail that developer.  No, you basically went public with it.

That is how about half the user and developer community will see it.
They will see your widely posted mail as an overly strong position.}}

Another clash occurred in August 2007, when a group of Linux developers attempted to modify the license of dual-licensed ath5k driver.  De Raadt summarized the issue as follows:<ref>[http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20070901041657] Accessed August 21, 2008.</ref>
{{quote|
GPL fans said the great problem we would face is that companies would
take our BSD code, modify it, and not give back.  Nope -- the great
problem we face is that people would wrap the GPL around our code, and
lock us out in the same way that these supposed companies would lock
us out.  Just like the Linux community, we have many companies giving
us code back, all the time.  But once the code is GPL'd, we cannot get
it back.}}
