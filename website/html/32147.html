'''''Ro-Busters''''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[comics|comic]] story that formed part of the original line-up of ''[[Starlord]]''. Similar in premise to that of the ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' television series, it was created by writer [[Pat Mills]] and was drawn by [[Carlos Pino]] and [[Ian Kennedy (comic artist)|Ian Kennedy]] initially, before Starlord's merger with ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]''. After the merger, [[Dave Gibbons]], [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]]  and [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]] were regular artists on the series, along with occasional contributions from [[Mike Dorey]]. 

Along with ''[[Strontium Dog]]'', Ro-Busters survived Starlord's merger with 2000 AD, its sister comic at IPC Magazines Ltd. The series introduced the de-commissioned war robot [[Hammerstein (robot)|Hammerstein]] and the sewer robot [[Ro-Jaws]], and gave rise to the popular ''[[ABC Warriors]]'' series.

==Mandate==

''Robots are going to take over Man's dirtiest jobs . . . clearing his garbage, tending his sick, even fighting his wars! By the year 2078 people will change their robots as today they change their cars. So step now through the slick plasto-glass doors of "Flash" Harry Lowder's robo-mart in the year 2078 . . .''<ref>Quoted from ''Ro-Busters'' "Day of the Robot", ''[[Starlord]]'' [[Starzine]] 1.</ref>

==Publication history==
The story was one of those aimed at being the core of the new title ''[[Starlord]]'', a sister-comic to ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]''. The concept was based on a suggestion from managing editor [[John Sanders]] and, according to writer [[Pat Mills]] "I did this really as a favour and as a way of pissing off the managing editor who pitched an idea to me about ex-servicemen with super powers who deal with disasters. It was a dreadful idea  and I bypassed it by doing Ro-Busters, which he hated - so I knew my story would be a hit"<ref>Bishop (2007) page 40</ref> Although he had stayed with ''2000 AD'', and would go on to be the art editor there, [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]] provided the initial designs for ''Ro-Buster''<ref>Bishop (2007) page 41</ref> but would only draw the series later after its move to ''2000 AD''.

The stories were drawn by a number of artists and [[Dave Gibbons]] has fond memories of his work on ''Ro-Busters'':

{{cquote|"I used to love doing Ro-Busters. I think the "Terra-Meks" story was arguably one of my finest hours. It was a great script  Pat wrote for that, really emotional and kind of ''2000 AD'' at its best. Grandiose, outrageous concepts, yet with a real humanity and emotional depth to it as well."<ref>Bishop (2007) page 45</ref>}}

Hammerstein, Ro-Jaws and Mek-Quake would go on to be members of the [[ABC Warriors]], first introduced in Hammerstein's flashbacks to his time in the [[Volgan War]].

After the launch of ''ABC Warriors'' Pat Mills never wrote another ''Ro-Busters'' story but there were a number of one-offs published in the ''2000 AD Annual'' during the early eighties, most notable three stories by [[Alan Moore]] which were the last ''Ro-Busters'' tales.

==Overview==
''Ro-Busters'' depicts a world where artificially intelligent robots are so ubiquitous they are treated with contempt by humans and there is a class hierarchy among the robots themselves. Ro-Busters is a commercial rescue organisation run by Howard Quartz, known as "Mr. 10 Per Cent" because 90% of him is robotic (a 'person' must have at least 10% organic matter to qualify as human). Quartz uses robots to carry out his perilous rescue missions because no-one cares if they live or die. Any insubordination in the ranks is dealt with by his enforcer, the psychotic and stupid "kill-dozer" Mek-Quake. Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein, the two main characters, are hugely courageous but after each successful mission they are usually greeted with indifference by the authorities. 

When the owner of Ro-Busters decides to destroy the robots in an 'accident' as a tax evasion measure, Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein lead an escape plot. Once free they learn that a robot underground exists and that a safe haven for free robots has been established on the [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. The Ro-Busters by this stage are being pursued by a ruthless police unit charged with suppressing robot liberation. A transport is arranged to take the robots to Titan but at the last moment the police close in so Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein with a few volunteers lead a seeming suicide mission to fight off the authorities and buy time for their comrades to escape. The mission is a success and Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein are seen dancing into the sunset.

The series has a high degree of satiric comment on contemporary Britain as [[Pat Mills]] had shown on other series. The brutal police squad sent to capture the robots is a parody of the [[Special Patrol Group]] while the willful destruction of a productive and loyal workforce reflects the effects of [[Thatcherism]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}. Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein's names are a word play on the musical writing pairing of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] and the story also features a number of song and dance routines.

It is also a ruthless parody of the [[Gerry Anderson]] puppet series [[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}. In Thunderbirds, International Rescue carried out its missions for purely altruistic reasons. In Ro-Busters, however, Quartz's team is only sent to help those who have paid for his overpriced 'disaster insurance', and the entire business is operated with a healthy profit margin as its highest priority - actually saving lives is some way down the list.

Ro-Busters would turn up in [[Invasion! (2000 AD)|''Savage Book Five'']], set in an alternate 2009; a human Howard Quartz and his Ro-Busters company designed the first [[ABC Warriors]] to liberate Volgan-occupied Britain. Quartz was revealed to be the brother of the US Vice-President [[Dick Cheney|Dick Quartz]] and a leading arms manufacturer; when the US was neutral towards the [[Volgans]], Quartz sold weapons to them via his British subsidiaries.
