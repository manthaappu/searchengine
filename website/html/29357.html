In [[computer graphics]], '''planar''' is the method of representing pixel colours with several ''[[bit plane|bitplanes]]'' of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]]. Each bit in a bitplane is related to one pixel on the screen. Unlike [[Packed pixel|Chunky]], [[Highcolour]] or [[Truecolor|Truecolour]] graphics, the whole data for an individual pixel isn't in one specific location in RAM, but spread across the bitplanes that make up the display.

For example, on a [[Packed pixel|chunky]] display, each byte represents one pixel. Three pixels in a row would be stored as follows, where up to 256 different colours are available:

Byte 0: 00000000 = Black pixel<br>
Byte 1: 00000001 = Blue pixel<br>
Byte 2: 00000010 = Green pixel

Whereas a planar data store could use 2 bitplanes, providing for a 4 colour display:

A row of 8 black pixels:<br>
Plane 0, Byte 0:   00000000<br>
Plane 1, Byte 0:   00000000

A row of 1 blue pixel, 2 black pixels, 1 green pixel, 4 black pixels:<br>
Plane 0, Byte 0:   10000000<br>
Plane 1, Byte 0:   00010000

Adding a third plane would make 2<sup>3</sup>=8 colours available. Where fewer than 256 colours are needed, planar graphics are economical in RAM compared with chunky graphics. Example: to display 8 colours using 3 bitplanes, so each pixel has 3 bits assigned to it instead of 8, reduces memory and bandwidth requirements by 62.5%. This saving was most significant in the 80s and early 90s when fast RAM was expensive and most computer graphics displayed fewer than 256 colours.

A disadvantage of planar graphics is that more RAM address cycles are needed for scrolling and animations, although these operations can be made faster by dedicated hardware.
