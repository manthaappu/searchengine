'''iCommune''' is a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] on-line community environment designed specifically for use by selected students of the [[European School]]s. It is a community system providing a safe environment for some students of the [[European School, Mol]]. It also delivers several other services to its members, like secure online storage, email, calendar sharing, web hosting, photo sharing, chat rooms and even cellular services. It can be compared to Apple's [[.Mac]] suite of services. Most importantly, however, it employs a proprietary protocol called The Repository to share homework and other files between the students.
