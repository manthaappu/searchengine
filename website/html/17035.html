==History==
In October 1963, a group of IBM employees had a visionâ€”to create a financial cooperative for IBM employees and their families in Poughkeepsie and Fishkill, New York. Their product line in the beginning was modest, consisting of basic savings and consumer loans. By the end of their first year, the credit union had 14 member accounts and $172 in assets.

The name of the credit union changed a few times over the years, and in 1994, the name changed to the present-day name of Hudson Valley Federal Credit Union.  

At the beginning of 2003, membership requirements were changed to allow those who live, work, worship, volunteer, or attend school in Dutchess, Orange, or Ulster counties to join the credit union.<ref name='Eligibility'> {{cite web|url=https://www.hvfcu.org/about-us/membership |title=Hudson Valley Federal Credit Union Membership |accessdate=2010-04-12 }}</ref>
