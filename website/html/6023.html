'''Chemspider''' is a [[Chemistry|chemical]] [[database]]. The system was first launched in March 2007 in a beta release form and transitioned to release in March 2008. ChemSpider has expanded the generic support of a chemistry database to include support of the [[Wikipedia]] chemical structure collection via their WiChempedia implementation.  ChemSpider was acquired by the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] in May, 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rsc.org/AboutUs/News/PressReleases/2009/ChemSpider.asp|title=RSC acquires ChemSpider
|date=11 May 2009|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=2009-05-11}}</ref>

==Database==
The database contains more than 20 million unique [[molecule]]s from the following sources
* '''A-L''': [[EPA DSSTox]], [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), Human Metabolome Database, [[Journal of Heterocyclic Chemistry]], [[KEGG]], [[KUMGM]], [[LeadScope]], [[LipidMAPS]]
* '''M-N''': [[Marinlit]], [[MDPI]], [[MICAD]], [[MLSMR]], [[MMDB]], [[MOLI]], [[MTDP]], [[Nanogen]], [[Nature Chemical Biology]], [[NCGC]], [[NIAID]], [[NIH/NLM]], [[NINDS Approved Drug Screening Program]], [[NIST]], [[NIST Chemistry WebBook]], [[NMMLSC]], [[NMRShiftDB]]
* '''P-S''': [[PANACHE]], [[PCMD]], [[PDSP]], [[Peptides]], [[Prous Science Drugs of the Future]], [[QSAR]], [[R&D Chemicals]], [[San Diego Center for Chemical Genomics]], [[SGCOxCompounds]], [[SGCStoCompounds]], [[SMID]], [[Specs]], [[Structural Genomics Consortium]], [[SureChem]], [[Synthon-Lab]]
* '''T-Z''': [[Thomson Pharma]], [[Total TOSLab Building-Blocks]], [[UM-BBD]], [[UPCMLD]], [[UsefulChem]], [[Web of Science]], [[xPharm]], [[ZINC]]

The database can be updated with user contributions including chemical structure deposition, spectra deposition and user curation.

==Searching==
A number of available search modules are provided
* The ''standard search'' allows [[query]]ing for systematic names, trade names and synonyms and registry numbers  
* The ''advanced search'' allows interactive searching by chemical structure, chemical substructure, using also molecular formula and [[molecular weight]] range, [[Chemical Abstracts Service|CAS]] numbers, suppliers, etc. The search can be used to widen or restrict already found results.
* The ''literature search'' allows text-based searching of almost 1/2 million Chemistry Open Access articles from a dozen different sources including the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]], [[IUPAC]], the [[Journal of Biological Chemistry]], the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]], the [[International Union of Crystallography]] and a number of other publishers.

==Chemistry document mark-up==
The ChemSpider database has been used in combination with [[text mining]] as the basis of [[markup language|chemistry document markup]]. ChemMantis<ref>Welcome ChemMantis to ChemZoo and a Call for Contributions from the Community,2008-10-23, A. Williams,[http://www.chemspider.com/blog/welcome-chemmantis-to-chemzoo-and-a-call-for-contributions-to-the-community.html blog post]</ref>, the Chemistry Markup And Nomenclature Transformation Integrated System uses algorithms to identify and extract chemical names from documents and web pages and converts the chemical names to chemical structures using name-to-structure conversion algorithms and [[dictionary]] look-ups in the ChemSpider database. The result is an integrated system between chemistry documents and information look-up via ChemSpider into over 150 data sources.

==Commercial versus free==
The ChemSpider service is owned by the Royal Society of Chemistry, and its services are offered free of charge.  Search hits include both free information and pointers into commercial databases that may require a subscription for access.  Prior to the acquisition by RSC, ChemSpider was controlled by a private corporation, ChemZoo Inc.

==Services==
A number of services are made available online. These include the conversion of chemical names to [[chemical structure]]s, the generation of [[SMILES]] and [[InChI]] strings as well as the prediction of many physicochemical parameters and integration to a web service allowing NMR prediction.  The organization is working with RSC to develop a [[hash table]] resolver for InChIKeys, shorter hashed forms of InChIs.
