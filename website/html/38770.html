'''UniFLEX''' is a [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]] developed by [[Technical Systems Consultants]] (TSC) for the [[Motorola]] [[Motorola 6809|6809]] family which allowed [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] and [[multiprocessing]]. It was released for [[Direct memory access|DMA]]-capable 8" floppy, extended memory addressing hardware (software controlled 4KiB paging), Motorola 6809 based computers. Examples included machines from [[SWTPC]] and [[GIMIX]]. On SWTPC machines, UniFLEX also supported a 20 [[megabyte|MB]], 14[[inch|"]] hard drive ([[OEM]]'d from [[Century Data Systems]]) in 1979. Later on, it also supported larger 14" drives (up to 80 MB), 8" hard drives, and 5-1/4" floppies.

Due to [[hardware]] limitations, main memory space for the UniFLEX kernel had to be smaller than 56 [[kilobyte|kB]] (code + data). This was achieved by writing the kernel entirely in [[assembly language]], and by removing a few classic [[Unix]] features, such as group permissions for files. Otherwise, UniFLEX was very similar to [[Version 7 Unix|Unix Version 7]], though some command names were slightly different. There was no technical reason for the renaming. By simply restoring the Unix style names, a considerable degree of "Unix Look & Feel" could be established, though due to memory limitations the command line interpreter (shell) was less capable than the Bourne Shell known from Unix Version 7.

TSC never bundled a [[C (programming language)|C]] [[compiler]] with UniFLEX for the 6809, though they produced one. But in the early 1980s a C language implementation became available as a 3rd party product (the "McCosh Compiler"). Using such a C compiler could establish  source-level compatibility with Unix Version 7, i.e., a number of Unix tools and applications could be ported to UniFLEX - if size allowed: Unix on a [[PDP-11]] limited executables to 64 kB of code and another 64 kB of data, while the UniFLEX limitation was approximately 56 kB for both, code and data together.

In the mid 1980s a successor version for the [[Motorola]] [[68000]] was announced. Though it removed the pressing space limitations, it was not commercially successful because it had to compete with source-code ports of original Unix.

The source code for UniFLEX and supporting software is available on the Internet. ([http://www.rtmx.com/UniFLEX The Missing 6809 UniFLEX Archive])
