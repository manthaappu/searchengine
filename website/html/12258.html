<html> <head> <title>Enterprise portal</title></head><body>An '''enterprise portal''', also known as an ''enterprise information portal'' (EIP) or ''corporate portal'', is a framework for integrating information, people and processes across organizational boundaries. It provides a secure unified access point,<ref>{{cite web | last = Boye | first = Janus | title = Portal Software: Passing Fad or Real Value? | publisher = CMS Watch | date = 2005-01-18 | url = http://www.cmswatch.com/Feature/120-Case-Against-Portals }}</ref> often in the form of a web-based [[user interface]], and is designed to aggregate and personalize information through application-specific [[portlets]].  One hallmark of enterprise portals is the de-centralized content contribution and content management, which keeps the information always updated.

==History==
The mid-1990s saw the advent of public [[Web portal]]s like [[AltaVista]], [[AOL]], [[Excite]], and [[Yahoo]]!. These sites provided a key set of features (e.g., news, e-mail, weather, stock quotes, and search) that were often presented in self-contained boxes or [[portlets]].  Before long, enterprises of all sizes began to see a need for a similar starting place for their variety of internal repositories and applications, many of which were migrating to Web-based technologies.<ref>{{cite news | last = Knorr | first = Eric | title = The new enterprise portal | publisher = InfoWorld | date = 2004-01-09 | url =http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/01/09/02FEportal_1.html }}</ref>

By the late 1990s, software vendors began to produce prepackaged enterprise portals.  These software packages would be toolkits for enterprises to quickly develop and deploy their own customized enterprise portal. The first commercial portal software vendor began to appear in 1998. Pioneers in this marketing included "pure play" vendors like [[Epicentric]], [[Plumtree Software]] and Viador. The space, however, quickly became crowded by 2002, with the entry into the market of competing product offerings from [[application server]] vendors (such as [[BEA Systems|BEA]], [[IBM]], [http://www.passageways.com Passageways], [[Oracle Corporation]] and [[Sun Microsystems]]), who saw portals as an opportunity to stave off the [[commoditization]] of application server technology, and [[Business Intelligence]] vendors
such as [[Liferay]] portal.
Enterprises may choose to develop multiple enterprise portals based on business structure and strategic focus while reusing architectural frameworks, component libraries, or standardized project methods (e.g. [[business-to-employee electronic commerce|B2E]], [[business-to-consumer|B2C]], [[business-to-business|B2B]], [[business-to-government electronic commerce|B2G]], etc.). 

In 2003, vendors of [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based enterprise portals produced a standard known as [[JSR-168]].  It was to specify an API for interoperability between enterprise portals and portlets.  Software vendors began producing JSR-168 compliant portlets that can be deployed onto any JSR-168 compliant enterprise portal.  The second iteration of the standard, [[JSR-286]], is final-released on 12 Jun, 2008.

==Fundamental Features==
* '''Single Sign-On''' — enterprise portals can provide [[single sign-on]] capabilities between their users and various other systems. This requires a user to authenticate only once. 
* '''Integration''' — the connection of functions and data from multiple systems into new components/[[portlet]]s/[[web part]]s with an integrated navigation between these components.
* '''Federation''' — the integration of content provided by other portals, typically through the use of [[Web Services for Remote Portlets|WSRP]] or similar technologies.
* '''Customization''' — Users can customize the look and feel of their environment. Customers who are using EIPs can edit and design their own web sites which are full of their own personality and own style; they can also choose the specific content and services they prefer.  Also refers to the ability to prioritize most appropriate content based on attributes of the user and metadata of the available content.
* '''Personalization''' — Personalization is more about matching content with the user. Based on a user profile, personalization uses rules to match the "services", or content, to the specific user. To some degree, you can think of the two like this: customization is in hands of the end user, personalization is not. Of course actual personalization is often based on your role or job function within the portal context.
* '''Access Control''' — the ability for portal to limit specific types of content and services users have access to. For example, a company's proprietary information can be entitled for only company employee access. This access rights may be provided by a portal administrator or by a provisioning process. Access control lists manage the mapping between portal content and services over the portal user base.
* '''Enterprise Search''' — search enterprise content using enterprise search
