The '''FourTrack''' multitrack audio recorder iPhone app is a songwriting and practice tool for singers, guitar players, piano players and other musicians who want to capture musical ideas and record songs on their iPhone and iPod touch (2nd and 3rd generation). FourTrack works with the iPhone built-in microphone or a headset mic. WiFi sync allows FourTrack recordings to be transferred to any desktop computer either by launching [[RiffWorks]] recording software and clicking import, or by downloading the tracks with a browser, then importing them into any recording software (DAW). FourTrack is developed by [[Sonoma Wire Works]], makers of RiffWorks guitar recording software, and by The Retronyms, makers of Recorder, a voice recorder for the iPhone and iPod touch.
