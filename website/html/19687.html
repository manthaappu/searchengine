'''Jamie W. Zawinski''' (born November 3, 1968<ref>{{cite web | url = http://jwz.livejournal.com/profile | title = jwz User Profile | last = Zawinski | first = Jamie}}</ref> in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]), commonly known as '''jwz''', is a former professional [[United States|American]] computer [[programmer]] responsible for significant contributions to the [[free software]] projects [[Mozilla]] and [[XEmacs]], and early versions of the [[Netscape Navigator]] web browser. He maintains the [[XScreenSaver]] project which provides [[screensaver|screenblanking]] for [[Unix-like]] computer [[operating system]]s using the [[X Window System]].

Zawinski is currently the [[ownership#In_person|proprietor]] of the [[DNA Lounge]], a [[nightclub]] in [[San Francisco]].

==Biography==
Zawinski's early career included stints with [[Scott Fahlman]]'s Lisp research group at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Expert Technologies, Inc.]] and Robert Wilensky and [[Peter Norvig]]'s group at Berkeley. In the early 1990s, he was hired by [[Richard P. Gabriel]]'s [[Lucid Inc.]] where he was eventually put to work on Lucid's Energize [[C++]] [[Integrated Development Environment|IDE]]. Lucid decided to use [[GNU Emacs]] as the text editor for their IDE due to its free license, popularity, and extensibility.  Zawinski and the other programmers made fundamental changes to GNU Emacs to add new functionality.  Tensions over how to merge these patches into the main tree eventually led to the [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of the project into GNU Emacs and [[XEmacs]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Zawinski | first = Jamie | title = The Lemacs/FSFmacs Schism. | date = February 11, 2000 | url = http://www.jwz.org/doc/lemacs.html | accessdate = December 12, 2009 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5lyRUxhVp | archivedate = December 12, 2009}}</ref>

Zawinski worked on the early releases of [[Netscape Navigator]], particularly the 1.0 release of the [[Unix]] version. He became quite well known in the early days of the [[world wide web]] through an [[easter egg (virtual)|easter egg]] in the Netscape browser: typing "about:jwz" into the address box would take the user to his home page (a similar trick worked for other Netscape staffers).  In addition, Zawinski says he created the name "Mozilla".<ref>{{cite web | last = Zawinski | first = Jamie | title = nscp dorm | year = 1996 | url = http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/nscpdorm.html | accessdate = October 12, 2007}}</ref>

Zawinski was a major proponent of [[Open source|opening]] the [[source code]] of the Mozilla browser, but became disillusioned with the project when others decided to rewrite the code instead of incrementally improving it. When Netscape was acquired by [[AOL]] he wrote a famous bulletin explaining the nature of the [[Free Software]] Mozilla code.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www-archive.mozilla.org/fear.html | title = fear and loathing on the merger trail | date = November 23, 1998 | last = Zawinski | first = Jamie}}</ref> He resigned from [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] on April 1, 1999.<ref>{{cite web | last = Zawinski | first = Jamie | title = resignation and postmortem. | date = March 31, 1999 | url = http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/nomo.html | accessdate = September 26, 2006 }}</ref> His current occupation is managing his [[DNA Lounge]] [[nightclub]] in [[San Francisco]].

==Quotes==
[[Peter Norvig]] in ''[[Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years]]'':<ref>{{cite web | url = http://norvig.com/21-days.html | title = Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years | first = Peter | last = Norvig | authorlink = Peter Norvig | year = 2001}}</ref> "One of the best programmers I ever hired had only a High School degree; he's produced a lot of great software, has his own news group, and made enough in stock options to buy his own nightclub."

''Zawinski's Law of Software Envelopment'' (also known as ''Zawinski's Law'') relates the pressure of popularity to the phenomenon of [[software bloat]]:

{{quote|Every program attempts to expand until it can read [[E-mail|mail]]. Those programs which cannot so expand are replaced by ones which can.|Jamie Zawinski|[http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/Z/Zawinskis-Law.html Jargon file entry]}} 

A long time member of the UNIX-HATERS mailing list, Jamie was quoted in the "X-Windows Disaster" chapter of [[The UNIX-HATERS Handbook]], commenting about [[widget toolkit]]s for the [[X Window System]]:

{{quote|Using these toolkits is like trying to make a bookshelf out of mashed potatoes.|Jamie Zawinski|[http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/unix-haters/x-windows/disaster.html ''The X-Windows Disaster'' chapter] of ''[[The UNIX-HATERS Handbook]]''}}

A widely quoted aphorism, originally from a USENET post:
