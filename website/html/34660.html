<html> <head> <title>Slow design</title></head><body>'''Slow design''' is a relatively new concept of [[design]] thinking, a derivative of the [[slow food movement]]. Slow Design's implications are vast and yet to be fully explored.

It could mean any of the following:
#Longer design processes with more time for research, contemplation, real life impact tests and fine tuning.
#Design for manufacturing with local/regional materials and technologies or Design that supports local industries, workshops and craftspeople.
#Design that takes into account local/regional culture both as a source of inspiration and as an important consideration for the design outcome.
#Design that studies the concept of natural timecycles and incorporates them into design and manufacturing processes.
#Design that looks at longer cycles of human behavior and sustainability.
