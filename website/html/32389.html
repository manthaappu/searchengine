Trimen arrived at the Cape in 1859, taking up a post in the Auditor-General's office in [[Cape Town]] and then transferred to the office of the Colonial Secretary. In 1872 he became curator of the [[South African Museum]] in Cape Town, succeeding [[Edgar Leopold Layard]]. He attended the international congress on [[Phylloxera]] in [[Bordeaux]] in 1880.

Trimen was born the son of Richard and Mary Ann Esther Trimen and was the elder brother of [[Henry Trimen]], botanist and director of the botanical gardens at [[Peradeniya]], [[Ceylon]].
