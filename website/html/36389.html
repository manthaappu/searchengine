<html> <head> <title>Synchronization Complexity</title></head><body>'''Synchronization Complexity''' is a quantified attribute (see also: [[measurement]]) of a characteristic of a concurrent [[software]] product. It measures the additional complexity incurred by the synchronization constructs used in the software, and does that by analyzing the software source code. It is essentially an extension of the [[Cyclomatic complexity]] for multitasking/multithreaded programs.
