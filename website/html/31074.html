'''RTML''' is a proprietary [[programming language]] used exclusively by [[Yahoo!]]'s '''Yahoo! Store''' and '''Yahoo! Site''' [[web hosting service]]s.

==History==
The language originated at [[Viaweb]], a company founded in 1995 by [[Paul Graham (computer programmer)|Paul Graham]] and [[Robert Tappan Morris|Robert T. Morris]], as the template language for their [[electronic commerce|e-commerce]] platform. RTML stands for "Robert T. Morris Language". The RTML editor was offered as an option for customers (usually [[small business]]es) who wanted to customize their [[Online shop|online stores]] more than the built-in templates allowed. The built-in templates were also written in RTML, and provided the starting point for most people who used the language.

In 1998, Yahoo! bought Viaweb for $49.6 million and renamed the service '''Yahoo! Store'''. Yahoo! later offered the RTML-based [[content management system]] in a hosting platform without a [[shopping cart]], under the name '''Yahoo! Site'''<ref>http://site.yahoo.com/</ref>.

In 2003, Yahoo! renamed the '''Yahoo! Store''' service '''''Yahoo! Merchant Solutions''''' (part of '''[[Yahoo!#Small_business|Yahoo! Small Business]]'''), and at the same time began offering new customers the choice of a more standard [[PHP]]/[[MySQL]] web hosting environment instead of the RTML-based Store Editor. {{As of|2006}}, many new Yahoo! Merchant Solutions sites and legacy Yahoo! Stores continue to be built using the Store Editor and RTML.

==Language==
Although Yahoo!'s documentation does not mention it, RTML is actually implemented on top of a [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]]-based system. The language is somewhat unique in that the programmer cannot edit the source code directly as text. Instead, keywords are presented as [[hyperlink]]s in a [[web browser|browser]]-based [[HTML]] interface. Clicking on a keyword selects it, and its attributes can be edited. Blocks of code can be pushed and popped from a clipboard, using the [[Stack (data structure)|stack metaphor]]. The editor maintains the code's [[s-expression]] structure automatically, and visually represents it in the web interface using [[indentation]] instead of Lisp's [[Bracket#Parentheses_%28_%29|parentheses]].
Most of the keywords correspond to [[HTML]] elements, but there are also [[conditional]]s, [[recursion]], and other [[control flow]] features that make it a "real" programming language.

RTML templates are evaluated dynamically for each pageview during editing, but for the live site a "publish" process generates static HTML files from them.

==Abbreviation==
Yahoo!'s documentation used to say that RTML was an [[acronym]] for "Real Time Markup Language," but Graham admitted that "we made up various explanations for what RTML was supposed to stand for, but actually I named it after Robert Morris, the other founder of Viaweb, whose username is rtm."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/bbnexcerpts.txt |title=Lisp in Web-Based Applications}}</ref>.
