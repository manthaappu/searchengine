<html> <head> <title>Green Pages</title></head><body>'''Green Pages''' are one of the three main components of [[UDDI]] - the protocol used to discover [[Web Services]] (the other two components being [[White Pages (UDDI)|White Pages]] and [[Yellow Pages (UDDI)|Yellow pages]]).

Green pages are used to describe how to access a Web Service, with information on the service bindings.  Some of the information is related to the Web Service - such as the address of the service and the parameters, and references to specifications of interfaces.<ref>Taylor, Ian J. From P2P to Web Services and Grids - Peers in a Client/Server World. Springer, 2005</ref>  Other information is not related directly to the Web Service - this includes e-mail, [[FTP]], [[CORBA]] and telephone details for the service.  Because a Web Service may have multiple bindings (as defined in its [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]] description), a service may have multiple Green Pages, as each binding will need to be accessed differently.
