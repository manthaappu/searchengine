'''Immaterialism''' is the theory propounded by [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]] in the 18th century which holds that there are no material objects, only minds and ideas in those minds. Berkeley summarized his theory with the motto "''esse est percipi''" ("To be is to be perceived"), but went on to elaborate it with [[God]] as the source of [[consensus reality]] and other particulars.

Today this theory is considered the first formulation of [[subjective idealism]], a branch of [[idealism]] and a form of [[phenomenalism]]. Since it is not [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]], it is a theory not of [[science]] but of [[metaphysics]] and other philosophical methods.  The idea that objects exist independently of mind is not testable or provable by the [[scientific method]], because all objects we would wish to examine must enter our awareness in order to experiment on them.

Earlier ideas about the immaterial and the [[incorporeal]] go back to [[Plato]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Plotinus]], and many other ancient and medieval [[philosophers]].  [[Plato]] and [[Socrates]] made many references to eternal [[forms]] that are immaterial or [[incorporeal]].  A classic philosophical problem is whether or not there is a First Cause or [[Cosmological argument|Prime Mover]] of this material universe.  Some philosophers also wondered if the universe was eternal or repeating for eternity.  A main question being what truly is eternal or timeless?  [[Aristotle]]'s notion of a [[formal cause]] is also partially related to Plato's idea of eternal [[Forms]].  Plato's theory of the [[divided line]] also mentions the [[intelligible]] method and the [[dialectical]] method that may lead one to [[The Good]], or to what truly exists eternally, without change.  The Good, unlike changing physical bodies, is claimed to exist in some incorporeal or immaterial state.  Many philosophers have contrasted the notions of [[being]] and [[becoming]] in a similar kind of way.  

[[Christian]] [[theology]] also refers to the incorporeal and immaterial in reference to [[God]], the [[Holy Spirit]], [[angels]], and [[demons]].  This is in contrast to the [[corporeal]] human body of the physical realm that decays over time.  The incorporeal is unchanging, whereas the corporeal is ever changing.  [[Jesus]] was [[resurrected]] in a mysterious way that suggests some kind of incorporeal [[soul]] that can exist independently of the physical body.  The ghostly appearance of various [[saints]], [[prophet]]s, and other [[supernatural]] beings imply some kind of immaterial realm.  Some supernatural [[miracle]]s can also imply the existence of the immaterial realm.  If it is proven that consciousness can exist after death, this would require some kind of explanation that materialist theories alone cannot explain.

Bishop Berkeley's assessment of immaterialism was criticized by [[Samuel Johnson]], as recorded by [[James Boswell]].  Responding to the theory, Dr. Johnson exclaimed "I refute it thus!" while kicking his shoe into a rock.  This episode is cited by [[Stephen Dedalus]] in [[James Joyce]]'s "[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]," chapter three.  Reflecting on the "ineluctable modality of the visible," Dedalus conjures the image of Johnson's refutation, before engaging in his own refutation - closing his eyes and feeling the rocks under his feet while walking along the beach. However Berkeley did not confine his theory to visual perception, but perception by any of the five senses.
