<html> <head> <title>LOBOS</title></head><body>'''LOBOS''' (Linux OS Boots OS) is a software program (or "system") that allows remote booting ("netbooting") of a [[personal computer]] without using a [[BIOS]]. It allows one [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]] to boot another kernel. LOBOS is part of an effort to move away from fixed, proprietary BIOSes to systems that allow more adaptability, especially with different physical peripheral devices.
