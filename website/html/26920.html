'''OPIE''' (Open Palmtop Integrated Environment) is a completely [[open source]] based [[graphical user interface]] for [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]] and other devices running [[Linux]].  It is a fork of [[Trolltech]]'s [[Qtopia]] environment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.linuxdevices.com/links/LK3806469853.html |title=LinuxDevices.com: Project OPIE -- Qt-based apps and tools for handhelds |accessdate=2007-10-21 |date=2002-05-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070504212706/http://www.linuxdevices.com/links/LK3806469853.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-05-04}}</ref>.

Opie features a personal information (PIM) framework as well as several other productivity applications. It has also extended multimedia capabilities, document model, networking and communication tools as well as multi-language support for more than a dozen languages. Based on common industry standards like XML, Obex, IrDa et al., Opie is capable of interacting with devices ranging from cell phones to server backends. Opie is highly optimized for mobile devices and tries to support the user with shortcuts and ease of use.

Opie has undergone a long spell of slow development and eroding user and developer base, and only recently has seen a new surge of interest culminating with release 1.2.3 <ref>{{cite web |url=http://lwn.net/Articles/243675/ |title=lwn.net: Opie 1.2.3 Release Announcement |accessdate=2007-10-21 |date=2007-07-27}}</ref>.
