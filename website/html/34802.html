'''Social blogging''' is a popular concept developed due to the advances of [[weblogging]], [[micro-blogging]], and [[social networking]]. These ever-changing constructions represent the new way of communicating for people who like to express their activities and share their common interests. 

On social blogs people inform each other about their activities by providing them with updates continually. These updates often include text (around 140 characters), pictures, audio or video. Through several  ways messages can be transmitted to social blogs, including the web, instant messaging, text messaging and e-mail.

People can create blogs on places like blogspot.com, and it's completely free.

Social blogging serves as a useful weight loss tool, as its inherent form allows for continuous updates on calorie intake and exercise completed throughout the day. Acting as a virtual support system, Twitter and various blog communities have assisted many people in losing a great deal of weight.<ref>{{cite web | last = Kearl | first = Mary | authorlink = http://www.aolhealth.com/bio/mary-kearl| title = Using Twitter and Blogging As a Diet and Weight Loss Tool |  publisher = AOL Health | date = April 2009 | url = http://www.aolhealth.com/diet/basics/twitter-diet | accessdate = August 2009}}</ref><references/>
