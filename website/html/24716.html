'''Miroslav Gospels''' ([[Serbian language|Serbia]]n: Мирослављево Јеванђеље or ''Miroslavljevo Jevanđelje'') is a 362-page [[illuminated manuscript]] [[Gospel Book]] on [[parchment]], with very rich decorations. It is one of the oldest surviving documents written in [[Old Church Slavonic]], along with the [[Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja]]. Miroslav Gospels manuscript<ref>[http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.wdl.wdl.2363 "Miroslav's Gospel" or "Mирослављево јеванђеље"][[World Digital Library]]. Primary source Cyrillic manuscripts on parchment in Cyrillic uncial (the Cyrillic script that developed from Greek in the 9th century).</ref> represents the most precious and significant document in [[cultural heritage]] of [[Serbia]].

It was created by order by Miroslav, brother of [[Stefan Nemanja]], [[List of Serbian monarchs|Grand Prince of Rascia]]. The first to discover and study the manuscript were three Russian scholars: [[Vladimir Stasov]], [[Fyodor Buslayev]], and [[Nikodim Kondakov]]. A leaf of the book which Archbishop Porfiry Uspensky cut out of the book from the Hilandar Monastery library in 1845 was first shown at the exhibition in Kiev in 1874.<ref>[http://www.nlr.ru/eng/exib/Gospel/slav/20.html NLR.ru]</ref> The earliest facsimile edition appeared in [[Vienna]] in 1897. The book was traditionally preserved in the [[Hilandar]] Monastery on [[Mount Athos]], but, after passing through several hands during [[World War II]], it wound up at the collection of the [[National Museum of Serbia]] in [[Belgrade]].

The book was transcribed in [[Kotor]] (in today's [[Montenegro]]) between [[1186]] and [[1190]] from an earlier text. "Miroslav Gospels" were commissioned by [[Serbia]]n prince [[Miroslav of Hum]], ruler of today's [[Herzegovina]] (in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]). Most pages are by the unknown scribe from [[Zeta (state)|Zeta]], with the last few pages being by the scribe Gligorije from [[Raška (state)|Raška]]. 

In 2005, the Miroslav Gospel was inscribed on [[UNESCO]]’s [[Memory of the World Register]] in recognition of its historical value.<ref name=mow>{{cite web|title= Miroslav Gospel – Manuscript from 1180 |url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=23171&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html | date=2008-05-16 |publisher=UNESCO Memory of the World Programme |accessdate=2009-12-14}}</ref>
