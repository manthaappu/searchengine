'''Programmed Data Processor''' (abbreviated ''PDP'') was the name of a series of [[minicomputer]]s made by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]. The name 'PDP' intentionally avoided the use of the term 'computer' because at the time of the first PDPs, computers had a reputation of being large, complicated, and expensive machines, and the [[venture capitalist]]s behind Digital (esp. [[Georges Doriot]]) wouldn't support Digital's attempting to build a "computer". The word "minicomputer" was not invented yet. So instead, Digital used their existing line of logic modules to build a ''Programmable Data Processor'' and aimed it at a market which couldn't afford the larger computers. 

The various PDP machines can generally be grouped into families based on word length.

Members of the PDP series include:
;[[PDP-1]]: The original PDP, an [[18-bit]] machine  used in early [[time-sharing]] [[operating system]] work, and prominent in early [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hacker]] culture.  One of the first [[computer game]]s, [[Spacewar!]], was developed for this machine.
;PDP-2: An unbuilt 24-bit design. 
;PDP-3: First 36-bit machine DEC designed, though DEC did not offer it as a product. The only PDP-3 was built by the [[CIA]]'s Scientific Engineering Institute (SEI) in [[Waltham, MA]] to process [[radar cross section]] data for the [[Lockheed A-12]] [[reconnaissance aircraft]] in 1960.<ref>{{cite web

;PDP-4: Supposed to be a slower, cheaper alternative to the PDP-1, but not commercially successful; all later 18-bit PDP machines were based on its [[instruction set]]. One customer of these early PDP machines was  [[Atomic Energy of Canada]]. The installation at Chalk River, Ontario included an early PDP-4 with a display system and a new PDP-5 as interface to the research reactor instrumentation and control.
;PDP-5: DEC's first [[12-bit]] machine.  Introduced the instruction set later used in the PDP-8.
;[[PDP-6]]: [[36-bit]] [[timesharing]] machine. Very elegant architecture.  It was considered a large [[minicomputer]] or a [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]].
;[[PDP-7]]: Replacement for the PDP-4; DEC's first [[wire-wrap]]ped machine. The first version of [[Unix]] was for this machine.
;[[PDP-8]]: 12-bit machine with a tiny instruction set; DEC's first major commercial success. Many were purchased by schools, university departments, and research laboratories. Later models were also used in the [[DECmate]] [[word processor]] and the [[VT-78]] [[workstation]]. It is reported that Edson de Castro, who had been a key member of the design team, left to form [[Data General]] when his design for a 16-bit successor to the PDP-8 was rejected in favour of the PDP-11; the "PDP-X" did NOT resemble the [[Data General Nova]], although that is a common myth.
;[[LINC-8]]: A hybrid of the [[LINC]] and PDP-8 computers; two instruction sets. Progenitor of the PDP-12.
;PDP-9: Successor to the PDP-7, DEC's first [[micro-program]]med machine.
;[[PDP-10]]: 36-bit timesharing machine, and fairly successful over several different models. The instruction set was a slightly elaborated form of that of the PDP-6.
;[[PDP-11]]: The archetypal minicomputer; a [[16-bit]] machine and another commercial success for DEC. (Also the LSI-11, primarily for [[embedded system]]s). The [[32-bit]] [[VAX]] series was descended from it, and early VAX models had a PDP-11 compatibility mode. The 16-bit PDP-11 instruction set has been very influential, with processors ranging from the [[Motorola 68000]] to the [[Renesas]] [[Renesas H8|H8]] and [[Texas Instruments]] [[MSP430]], inspired by its highly [[orthogonal]], general-register oriented [[instruction set]] and rich [[addressing mode]]s. The PDP-11 family was extremely long-lived, spanning 20 years and many different implementations and technologies.
;PDP-12: Descendant of the LINC-8. See [[LINC]] and [http://users.rcn.com/crfriend/museum/doco/PDP-12/index.shtml PDP-12 User Manual].
;PDP-13: Designation was not used, apparently due to superstition.
;PDP-14: A 1-bit machine intended as an industrial controller ([[Programmable logic controller|PLC]]). Later versions (for example, the PDP-14/30) were based on PDP-8 physical packaging technology. I/O was line voltage.
;PDP-15: DEC's final 18-bit machine.  It was their only 18-bit machine constructed from [[Transistor-transistor logic|TTL]] [[integrated circuit]]s rather than discrete transistors. Later versions of the system were referred to as the "XVM" family.
;PDP-16: A "roll-your-own" sort of computer using [[Register Transfer Modules]], mainly intended for industrial control systems with more capability than the PDP-14.  The PDP-16/M was introduced as a standard version of the PDP-16.

*[[LINC]] (Laboratory Instrument Computer), originally designed by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s [[Lincoln Laboratory]], some built by DEC. Not in the PDP family, but important as progenitor of the PDP-12. The LINC and the PDP-8 can be considered the first [[minicomputer]]s, and perhaps the first [[personal computer]]s as well. The PDP-8 and PDP-11 were the most popular of the PDP series of machines. Digital never made a PDP-20, although the term was sometimes used for a [[PDP-10]] running [[TOPS-20]] (officially known as a [[DECSYSTEM-20]]).

Various sites list documents by Charles Lasner, the creator of the alt.sys.pdp8 discussion group, and related documents by various members of the alt.sys.pdp8 readership with even more authoritative information about the various models, especially detailed focus upon the various members of the PDP-8 "family" of computers both made and not made by DEC.
