{{Italic title}}
'''''Neural Networks''''' is the official journal of the three oldest societies dedicated to research in [[neural network]]s: [[International Neural Network Society]], [[European Neural Network Society]] and [[Japanese Neural Network Society]], published by [[Elsevier]].<ref name=profile>[http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/841/description#description Journal description] by Elsevier</ref> The journal is issued 10 times annually and available in electronic form via [[Science Direct]].<ref name=profile/>

The journal covers a broad range of topics in both [[artificial neural network]]s and [[biological neural network]]s, "ranging from behavioral and brain modeling, through mathematical and computational analyses, to engineering and technological applications of systems that significantly use neural network concepts and algorithms."<ref name=profile/> The editors-in-chief are [[Stephen Grossberg]] (Cognitive and Neural Systems Dept., Boston University, USA), [[Kenji Doya]] (Initial Research Project, Okinawa Inst. Of Science & Tech., Japan) and [[John G. Taylor]] (Dept. of Mathematics, King's College, University of London, UK).

'' Neural Networks'' is abstracted and indexed in [[Scopus]] and [[Science Citation Index]]. According to the 2008  [[Journal Citation Reports]] its [[impact factor]] is 2.656 and the 5-year impact factor is 2.838.
