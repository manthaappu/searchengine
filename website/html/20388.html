'''K Desktop Environment 3''' was the third series of releases of the K Desktop Environment (now called ''[[KDE Software Compilation]]''). There were six major releases in this series.

==K Desktop Environment 3.0==
[[Image:KDE 3.0.jpg|thumb|K Desktop Environment 3.0]]
K Desktop Environment 3.0 introduced better support for restricted usage. Some environments, such as kiosks, Internet cafes and enterprise deployments, demand that the user not have full access to all the capabilities of a piece of software, in order to preclude certain undesirable actions. To address these needs, KDE 3.0 included a new lockdown framework. This is essentially a permissions-based system for altering application configuration options and supplements standard UNIX permissions. The KDE panel and the desktop manager were modified to employ this system, but other major desktop components, such as Konqueror and the Control Center, had to wait for subsequent releases.<ref name="3.0 announcement">[http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-3.0.php KDE 3.0 Released to public]</ref>

A new printing framework, KDEPrint debuted. Its modular design enabled it to support different printing engines, such as CUPS, LPRng, LPR, LPD or other servers or programs. In conjunction with CUPS, KDEPrint was able to manage an elaborate enterprise networked printing system. As KDEPrint provides a command-line interface, the framework, including the GUI configuration elements, are accessible to non-KDE applications, such as [[OpenOffice.org]], the [[Mozilla Application Suite]], and [[Acrobat Reader]].<ref name="3.0 announcement"/>

This release also introduced a new KDE address book library which provides a central address book to all KDE applications. The new library is based on the [[vCard]] standard and has provisions for being extended by additional [[backend]]s like [[LDAP]] or database servers.<ref name="3.0 announcement"/>

==K Desktop Environment 3.1==
[[Image:KDE-3.1-es-ES.png|thumb|K Desktop Environment 3.1 with Konqueror and the About screen.]]
K Desktop Environment 3.1 introduced new default window (Keramik) and icon (Crystal) styles as well as a number of feature enhancements.<ref name="3.1 announcement">[http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-3.1.php KDE 3.1 Release Announcement]</ref>

[[Kontact]] included greatly improved [[LDAP]] integration throughout Kontact, enhanced security for [[KMail]] (S/MIME, PGP/MIME and X.509v3 support) and Exchange 2000 compatibility for [[KOrganizer]]. The desktop "lockdown" framework, introduced in version 3.0, enabling system administrators to restrict various configuration settings, such as bookmarks, user actions, and launching applications was extended. Other improvements included tabbed browsing in [[Konqueror]], [[KGet]] - a new download manager, a new multimedia player plugin (based on [[Xine]]) and a desktop sharing framework.<ref name="3.1 announcement"/>

==K Desktop Environment 3.2==
[[Image:Kde-3.2.3-es-es.png|thumb|K Desktop Environment 3.2 with Konqueror and the About screen. This has been described as a watershed release.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2008/11/milestones.html | title=milestones | author=Aaron Seigo | accessdate=2008-11-10}}</ref>]]
K Desktop Environment 3.2 included new features, such as inline spell checking for web forms and e-mails, improved e-mail and calendaring support, tabs in Konqueror and support for Microsoft Windows desktop sharing protocol (RDP). Performance and standards compliance were improved with lowered start up times for applications and increased support for [[FreeDesktop.org]] standards to strengthen interoperability with other Linux and UNIX software. Working in concert with Apple's Safari web browser team, KDE's web support saw performance boosts and increased compliance with web standards.<ref name="3.2 announcement">[http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-3.2.php Announcing KDE 3.2]</ref>

Usability was improved by reworking many applications, dialogs and control panels to focus on clarity and utility, and reducing clutter in many menus and toolbars. Hundreds of new icons were created to improve the consistency of the environment, and there were changes to the default look including new splash screens, animated progress bars and styled panels. The Plastik style debuted in this release.<ref name="3.2 announcement"/>

New applications included:<ref name="3.2 announcement"/>
*[[JuK]], a jukebox-style music player.
*[[Kopete]] instant messenger with support for AOL Instant Messenger, MSN, Yahoo Messenger, ICQ, Gadu-Gadu, Jabber, IRC, SMS and WinPopup.
*[[KWallet]], providing integrated, secure storage of passwords and web form data.
*[[Kontact]], a unified interface that draws KDE's email, calendaring, address book, notes and other PIM features together.
*KGpg, KDE interface to industry-standard encryption tools.
*KIG, an interactive geometry program.
*[[KSVG]], a viewer for SVG files.
*KMag, KMouseTool and KMouth. New accessibility tools.
*KGoldRunner, a new game.

==K Desktop Environment 3.3==
[[Image:Kde 3 3 screengrab.png|thumb|K Desktop Environment 3.3.]]
K Desktop Environment 3.3 focused on integrating different desktop components. Kontact was integrated with Kolab, a groupware application, and Kpilot. Konqueror features better support for Instant Messaging contacts, with the capability to send files to IM contacts, and support for IM protocols (e.g. <nowiki>irc://</nowiki>), while KMail can display the online presence of IM contacts. Juk has support for burning audio CDs with [[K3b]].<ref name="3.3 announcement">[http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-3.3.php Announcing KDE 3.3]</ref>

There were also many small desktop enhancements. Konqueror received tab improvements, an RSS feed viewer sidebar and a searchbar - compatible with all keyword: searches. HTML composing, anti-spam/anti-virus wizards, automatic handling of mailing lists, improved support for cryptography and a quick search bar were additions to KMail. Kopete gains support for file transfers with Jabber, aRts gains jack support and KWin has new buttons to support more features, such as "always on top".<ref name="3.3 announcement"/>

New applications included:<ref name="3.3 announcement"/>
*[[Kolourpaint]], a replacement for KPaint
*KWordQuiz, KLatin and [[KTurtle]] expand the list of education packages for schools and families
*Kimagemapeditor and klinkstatus for web designers
*KSpell2, a new spellchecking library that fixes KSpell's shortcomings
*KThemeManager, a new control center module to globally handle KDE visual themes

==K Desktop Environment 3.4==
[[Image:Kde34screenshot.png|thumb|K Desktop Environment 3.4 with Konqueror and Amarok.]]

[[Accessibility]] was a key focus for K Desktop Environment 3.4. A text-to-speech system was included with support built into Konqueror, Kate, KPDF and the standalone application KSayIt, and support for text-to-speech synthesis is integrated with the desktop. A new high contrast style and a complete monochrome icon set were available, plus an icon effect to paint all icons in two chosen colors, converting third party application icons into high contrast monochrome icons.<ref name="3.4 announcement">[http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-3.4.php Announcing KDE 3.4]</ref>

Kontact got support for various groupware servers, while Kopete was integrated into Kontact. KMail stores passwords securely with KWallet. KPDF can select, copy & paste text and images from PDFs, along with many other improvements. A new application, [[Akregator]] provides the ability to read news from RSS-enabled websites in one application.<ref name="3.4 announcement"/>

[[DBUS]]/[[HAL]] support allows dynamic device icons to keep in sync with the state of all devices. Kicker has an improved look and feel, and the trash system was redesigned to be more flexible. SVG files may be used as wallpapers. KHTML has improved standards support, putting it close to full support for [[CSS]] 2.1 and the CSS 3 Selectors module. In addition, KHTML plug-ins were made configurable, so the user can selectively disable ones that are not used. There were also improvements to the way Netscape plug-ins are handled.<ref name="3.4 announcement"/>

==K Desktop Environment 3.5==
The K Desktop Environment 3.5 release included [[SuperKaramba]], providing integrated and simple-to-install widgets for the user's desktop. Konqueror included an ad-block feature and became the second web browser to pass the [[Acid2]] CSS test, ahead of [[Firefox]] and [[Internet Explorer]]. Kopete gained webcam support for MSN and Yahoo! [[Instant messaging|IM]] protocols. The edutainment module included three new applications ([[KGeography]], Kanagram and blinKen), while [[Kalzium]] also saw improvements.<ref name="3.5 announcement">[http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-3.5.php K Desktop Environment 3.5 Released]</ref>

The '''Trinity Desktop Environment project''', organised and led by Timothy Pearson, Kubuntu release manager for KDE 3.5<ref name="Article about Trinity KDE 3">[http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/3890311/Trinity-KDE-KDE-3-Zombified-or-Resurrected.htm Trinity KDE: KDE 3 Zombified or Resurrected?]</ref>, has released Trinity to pick up where the KDE e.V. left. It is currently trying to keep the KDE 3.5 branch alive, attempting to fix bugs during the process, enhance it with additional features and make it more compatible with recent hardware.

The Kolab Enterprise<ref>[http://wiki.kolab.org/index.php/Kontact_development Kontact development] (KDEPIM Enterprise)</ref> packages are also still actively being developed and tested based on Kontact 3.5; a version based on Kontact 4 is available but not recommended for regular use<ref>[http://wiki.kolab.org/index.php/KDE_Kolab_Client KDE Kolab Client] – excerpt: <cite>KDE4 is something you should not consider installing at the moment if you are not a programmer.</cite></ref>.
