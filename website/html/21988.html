* Sandy QLT / Futura (only produced in prototype form)
* [[CST Thor]] series (Thor 1 / Thor 20 / Thor XVI)
* Qubbesoft Aurora (a replacement QL [[motherboard]])
* Peter Graf's [[Qx0]] series of motherboards: Q40, Q40i and Q60

The following hardware devices provided QL compatibility for other computer platforms:

* Futura Datasenter QL Emulator for the [[Atari ST]]
* Jochen Merz's QVME card for the [[Atari ST]]e and  [[Atari TT]]
* [[Miracle Systems]] QXL and QXL II cards for [[PC compatible]]s

The [[International Computers Limited|ICL]] [[One Per Desk]] (also sold as the [[British Telecom|BT]] Merlin Tonto or the [[Telecom Australia]] Computerphone) shared some hardware components with the QL but was not intended to be software-compatible.

In addition, several software [[emulator]]s of the QL exist including QPC, uQLX, QLay and Q-emuLator.<ref name="dilwyn-emu">{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Dilwyn|title=Sinclair QL Software - Emulators|url=http://www.dilwyn.me.uk/emu/index.html|work=Dilwyn Jones Sinclair QL Pages|accessdate=23 July 2010}}</ref>
