==Double groupoids, fundamental groupoids, 2-categories, categorical QFTs and TQFTs==
In '''higher-dimensional algebra''' ('''HDA'''), a [[double groupoid]] is a generalisation of a one-dimensional [[groupoid]] to two dimensions,<ref>{{cite journal

}}
</ref> and the latter groupoid can be considered as a special case of a category with all invertible arrows, or [[morphism]]s.

[[Double groupoid]]s are often used to capture information about [[geometrical]] objects such as [[n-dimensional space|higher-dimensional manifolds]] (or [[List of manifolds|''n''-dimensional manifolds]]).<ref>

A first step towards defining higher dimensional algebras is the concept of [[2-category]] of [[higher category theory]], followed by the more `geometric' concept of   [http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~fiore/1/fiorefolding.pdf double category].<ref>{{cite journal

A Note on Quantum Groupoids, posted by Jeffrey Morton under C*-algebras, deformation theory, groupoids, noncommutative geometry, quantization</ref> 
In the latter case, by considering [[fundamental group]]oids defined via a [[2-functor]] allows one to think about the physically interesting case of [[quantum fundamental groupoid]]s (QFGs) in terms of the [[bicategory]] '''Span(Groupoids)''', and then constructing 2-[[Hilbert space]]s and 2-[[linear map]]s for manifolds and [[cobordism]]s. At the next step, one obtains [[cobordism]]s with corners via [[natural transformation]]s of such 2-functors. A claim was then made that, with the [[gauge group]] [[SU(2)]], ``''the extended [[TQFT]], or ETQFT,  gives a theory equivalent to the [[Ponzano-Regge model]] of [[quantum gravity]]''";<ref>http://theoreticalatlas.wordpress.com/2009/03/18/a-note-on-quantum-groupoids/ March 18, 2009. A Note on Quantum Groupoids, posted by Jeffrey Morton under C*-algebras, deformation theory, groupoids, noncommutative geometry, quantization</ref> similarly, the [[Turaev-Viro model]] would be then obtained with [[representation]]s of SU_q(2). Therefore, according to the construction proposed by Jeffrey Morton, one can describe the [[state space]] of a gauge theory – or many kinds of quantum field theories ([[QFT]]s) and local quantum physics, in terms of the [[transformation groupoid]]s given by symmetries, as for example in the case of a gauge theory, by the [[gauge transformation]]s acting on states that are, in this case, connections. In the case of symmetries related to [[quantum group]]s, one would obtain structures that are representation categories of [[quantum groupoid]]s,<ref>http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/QuantumCategory.html Quantum Categories of Quantum Groupoids</ref> instead of the 2-[[vector space]]s that are representation categories of groupoids.

==Double categories, Category of categories and Supercategories==
A higher level concept is thus defined as a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of categories, or '''super-category''', which generalises to higher dimensions the notion of [[Category (mathematics)|category]] &ndash; regarded as any structure which is an interpretation of [[Lawvere]]'s axioms of the ''elementary theory of abstract categories'' (ETAC).<ref>Lawvere, F. W., 1964, ``An Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets'', ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences U.S.A''., '''5'''2, 1506&ndash;1511. http://myyn.org/m/article/william-francis-lawvere/</ref><ref>Lawvere, F.

An important part of nonabelian algebraic topology is concerned with the properties and applications of [[homotopy group]]oids and [[filtered space]]s. Noncommutative [[double groupoid]]s and double [[algebroid]]s are only the first examples of such higher dimensional structures that are nonabelian. The new methods of Nonabelian Algebraic Topology (NAAT) ''``can be applied to determine [[homotopy invariant]]s of spaces, and [[homotopy classification]] of maps, in cases which include some classical results, and allow results not available by classical methods"''.<ref>http://planetphysics.org/?op=getobj&from=books&id=374 ''Nonabelian Algebraic Topology: Filtered Spaces, Crossed Complexes and Cubical Homotopy groupoids'', by Ronald Brown, Bangor University, UK, Philip J. Higgins, Durham University, UK Rafael Sivera, University of Valencia, Spain</ref> Cubical omega-groupoids, higher [[homotopy group]]oids, [[crossed module]]s, [[Timeline of category theory and related mathematics|crossed complexes]] and [[Galois group]]oids are key concepts in developing applications related to homotopy of filtered spaces, higher dimensional space structures, the construction of the [[fundamental group]]oid of a topos E in the general theory of topoi, and also in their physical applications in nonabelian quantum theories, and recent developments in [[quantum gravity]], as well as categorical and [[topological dynamics]].<ref>http://www.springerlink.com/content/92r13230n3381746/ ''A Conceptual Construction of Complexity Levels Theory in Spacetime Categorical Ontology: Non-Abelian Algebraic Topology, Many-Valued Logics and Dynamic Systems'' by R. Brown et al., '''Axiomathes''', Volume '''17''', Numbers 3-4, 409-493, DOI: 10.1007/s10516-007-9010-3</ref> Further examples of such applications include the generalisations of [[noncommutative geometry]] formalizations of the [[noncommutative standard model]]s ''via'' fundamental double groupoids and [[spacetime]] structures even more general than [[topos|topoi]] or the lower-dimensional [[noncommutative spacetime]]s encountered in several [[topological quantum field theories]] and noncommutative geometry theories of quantum gravity.

A fundamental result in NAAT is the generalised, higher homotopy [[van Kampen theorem]] proven by R. Brown which states that ``''the homotopy type of a topological space can be computed by a suitable [[colimit]] or [[homotopy colimit]] over homotopy types of its pieces''''. A related example is that of van Kampen theorems for categories of [[covering morphism]]s in [[lextensive categories]].<ref>Ronald Brown and George Janelidze, van Kampen theorems for categories of covering morphisms in lextensive categories, ''J. Pure Appl. Algebra''. '''119''':255–263, (1997)</ref> Other reports of generalisations of the van Kampen theorem include statements for [[2-category|2-categories]]<ref>http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:nJq9lpZj-3gJ:www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/stevel/papers/vkt.ps.gz+Kampen+theorems+for+toposes&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us Marta Bunge and Stephen Lack. Van Kampen theorems for 2-categories and toposes</ref> and a topos of topoi [http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/stevel/papers/vkt.ps.gz].
Important results in HDA are also the extensions of the [[Galois theory]] in categories and [[variable categories]], or indexed/`parametrized' categories.<ref>http://www.springerlink.com/content/gug14u1141214743/ George Janelidze, Pure Galois theory in categories, J.

Thus, indexing by bicategories in the sense of Benabou one also includes here the [[Joyal-Tierney theory]].<ref>'''MSC'''(1991): 18D30,11R32,18D35,18D05</ref>
