<html> <head> <title>Arptables</title></head><body>The '''arptables''' computer software utility is a network administrator's tool for maintaining the [[Address Resolution Protocol]] (ARP) packet filter rules in the [[Linux kernel]] firewall modules.

The tools may be used to create, update, and view the tables that contain the filtering rules, similarly to the [[iptables]] program from which it was developed. A popular application is the creation of filter configurations to prevent [[ARP spoofing]].
