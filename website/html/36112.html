'''Sukhotins' Algorithm''' is a [[statistical classification]] [[algorithm]] for classifying characters in a text as [[vowel]]s or [[consonant]]s. It may also be of use in some of [[substitution cipher]]s and has been considered in deciphering the [[Voynich manuscript]], though one problem is to agree on the set of symbols the manuscript is written in.
