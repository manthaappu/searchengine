<html> <head> <title>Typed assembly language</title></head><body>In [[computer science]], a '''typed assembly language''' ('''TAL''') is an [[assembly language]] that is extended to include a method of annotating the [[datatype]] of each value that is manipulated by the code. These annotations can then be used by a program (type checker) that processes the assembly language code in order to analyse how it will behave when it is executed.  Specifically, such a type checker can be used to prove the [[type safety]] of code that meets the criteria of some appropriate [[type system]].  

Typed assembly languages usually include a high-level memory management system based on a [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]].

A typed assembly language with a suitably expressive type system can be used to enable the safe execution of untrusted code without using an intermediate representation like [[bytecode]], allowing features similar to those currently provided by virtual machine environments like [[Java platform|Java]] and [[.NET Framework|.NET]].
