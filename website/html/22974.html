'''MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory''' (also '''CSAIL''') is a research laboratory at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] formed by the 2003 merger of the Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Housed within the [[Stata Center]], CSAIL is the largest on-campus laboratory as measured by research scope and membership.

==Research activities==
CSAIL's research activities are organized around a number of semi-autonomous research groups, each of which is headed by one or more [[professor]]s or research scientists. These groups are divided up into seven general areas of research:

*[[Artificial Intelligence]]
*[[Computational biology]]
*[[Computer graphics|Graphics]] and [[Machine vision|Vision]]
*[[Natural language processing|Language]] and [[Machine learning|Learning]]
*[[Theory of computation]]
*[[Robotics]]
*Systems (includes [[computer architecture]], databases, [[distributed system]]s, [[Computer networking|networks]] and networked systems, [[operating system]]s, programming methodology, and [[software engineering]] among others)

In addition, CSAIL hosts the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C).

==History==

Computing research at MIT began with [[Vannevar Bush]]'s research into a [[differential analyzer]] and [[Claude Shannon]]'s electronic [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] in the 1930s, the wartime [[Radiation Laboratory]], the post-war [[Project Whirlwind]] and [[Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT|Research Laboratory of Electronics]] (RLE), and [[Lincoln Laboratory]]'s [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] in the early 1950s.

Research at MIT in the field of artificial intelligence began in 1959.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

=== Project MAC ===

On July 1, 1963, Project MAC (the Project on '''M'''athematics '''a'''nd '''C'''omputation, later [[backronym]]ed to '''M'''ultiple '''A'''ccess '''C'''omputer, '''M'''achine '''A'''ided '''C'''ognitions, or '''M'''an '''a'''nd '''C'''omputer) was launched with a $2 million grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]). Project MAC's original director was [[Robert Fano]] of MIT's [[Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT|Research Laboratory of Electronics]] (RLE). Fano decided to call MAC a "project" rather than a "laboratory" for reasons of internal MIT politics&mdash;if MAC had been called a laboratory, then it would have been more difficult to raid other MIT departments for research staff. The program manager responsible for the DARPA grant was [[J.C.R. Licklider]], who had previously been at MIT conducting research in RLE, and would later succeed Fano as director of Project MAC.

Project MAC would become famous for groundbreaking research in [[operating system]]s, [[artificial intelligence]], and the [[theory of computation]]. Its contemporaries included [[Project Genie]] at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], the [[Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], and (somewhat later) [[University of Southern California]]'s (USC's) [[Information Sciences Institute]].

An "AI Group" including [[Marvin Minsky]] (the director), [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] (who invented [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]]) and a talented [[Hacker (computing)|community]] of [[computer programmer]]s was incorporated into the newly-formed [[Project MAC]]. It was interested principally in the problems of vision, mechanical motion and manipulation, and language, which they view as the keys to more intelligent machines.  In the 1950s - 1970s the AI Group shared a computer room with a [[computer]] (initially a [[PDP-6]], and later a [[PDP-10]]) for which they built a [[time-sharing]] [[operating system]] called [[Incompatible Timesharing System|ITS]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

The early Project MAC community included Fano, Minsky, Licklider, [[Fernando J. Corbató]], and a [[Hacker (computing)|community]] of [[computer programmer]]s and [[TMRC|enthusiasts]] among others who drew their inspiration from former colleague [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]]. These founders envisioned the creation of a [[utility computing|computer utility]] whose computational power would be as reliable as an electric utility. To this end, Corbató brought the first computer [[time-sharing]] system, [[Compatible Time-Sharing System|CTSS]], with him from the MIT Computation Center, using the DARPA funding to purchase an [[IBM 7094]] for research use.  One of the early focuses of Project MAC would be the development of a successor to CTSS, [[Multics]], which was to be the first [[high availability]] computer system, developed as a part of an industry consortium including [[General Electric]] and [[Bell Laboratories]].

In 1966, [[Scientific American]] featured Project MAC in the September thematic issue devoted computer science, which was later published in book form. At the time, the system was described as having approximately 100 TTY terminals, mostly on campus but with a few in private homes. Only 30 users could be logged in at the same time.

=== LCS and AI Lab ===

In the late 1960s, Minsky's [[artificial intelligence]] group was seeking more space, and was unable to get satisfaction from project director Licklider. University space-allocation politics being what it is, Minsky found that although Project MAC as a single entity could not get the additional space he wanted, he could split off to form his own lab and then be entitled to more office space. As a result, the MIT AI Lab was formed in 1970, and many of Minsky's AI colleagues left Project MAC to join him in the new lab, while most of the remaining members went on to form the Laboratory for Computer Science. Talented programmers such as [[Richard Stallman]], who used [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]] to write [[Emacs|EMACS]], flourished in the AI Lab during this time.

Those researchers who did not join the smaller AI Lab formed the Laboratory for Computer Science and continued their research into [[operating system]]s, [[programming language]]s, [[distributed system]]s, and the [[theory of computation]]. Two professors, [[Hal Abelson]] and [[Gerald Jay Sussman]], chose to remain neutral – their group was referred to variously as Switzerland and Project MAC for the next 30 years.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

=== CSAIL ===

On the fortieth anniversary of Project MAC's establishment, July 1, 2003, LCS re-merged with the [[MIT AI Lab|AI Lab]] to form the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, or '''CSAIL'''. This merger created the largest laboratory (over 600 personnel) on the MIT campus and was regarded as a reuniting of the diversified elements of Project MAC.

== Outreach activities ==
The IMARA (from [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word for "power") group sponsors a variety of outreach programs which bridge the [[Global digital divide|Global Digital Divide]]. Its aim is to find and implement long-term, sustainable solutions which will increase the availability of educational technology and resources to domestic and international communities. These projects are run under the aegis of CSAIL and staffed by MIT volunteers who give training, install and donate computer setups in greater [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Kenya]], [[Native Americans in the United_States|Native American Indian]] [[Indian reservation|tribal reservations]] in the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]] such as the [[Navajo Nation]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]]. The CommuniTech project strives to empower under-served communities through sustainable technology and education and does this through the MIT Used Computer Factory (UCF), providing refurbished computers to under-served families, and through the Families Accessing Computer Technology (FACT) classes, it trains those families to become familiar and comfortable with computer technology.<ref name="OUTREACH">[http://www.csail.mit.edu/node/34 Outreach activities at CSAIL] - CSAIL homepage, MIT.</ref><ref>[http://imara.csail.mit.edu/ IMARA Project at MIT]</ref><ref>{{Citation
