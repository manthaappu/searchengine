'''Bandwidth management''' is the process of measuring and controlling the communications (traffic, packets) on a network link, to avoid filling the link to capacity or overfilling the link, which would result in [[network congestion]] and poor performance.

== Management ==
Bandwidth management mechanisms may be used to further engineer performance and includes:

* [[Traffic shaping]] ([[rate limiting]]):
** [[Token bucket]]
** [[Leaky bucket]]
** TCP rate control - artificially adjusting TCP window size as well as controlling the rate of ACKs being returned to the sender{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}
* [[Scheduling algorithms]]:
** [[Weighted fair queuing]] (WFQ)
** [[Class based weighted fair queuing]]
** [[Weighted round robin]] (WRR)
** [[Deficit weighted round robin]] (DWRR)
** [[Hierarchical Fair Service Curve]] (HFSC)
* Congestion avoidance:
** [[Network congestion avoidance|RED]], [[network congestion avoidance|WRED]] - Lessens the possibility of [[Computer port (software)|port queue buffer]] [[network congestion avoidance|tail-drop]]s and this lowers the likelihood of [[TCP global synchronization]]
** Policing (marking/dropping the packet in excess of the committed traffic rate and burst size)
** [[Explicit congestion notification]]
** Buffer tuning
* Bandwidth reservation protocols / algorithms
** [[Resource reservation protocol]] (RSVP)
** [[Constraint-based Routing Label Distribution Protocol]] (CR-LDP)
** [[Top-nodes algorithm]]

== Link performance ==
Issues which may limit the performance of a given link include:

* [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] determines the capacity of a connection by flooding it until packets start being dropped ([[Slow-start]])
* Queueing in routers results in higher [[Lag|latency]] and [[jitter]] as the network approaches (and occasionally exceeds) capacity
* [[TCP global synchronization]] when the network reaches capacity results in waste of bandwidth
* [[Burstiness]] of web traffic requires spare bandwidth to rapidly accommodate the bursty traffic
* Lack of widespread support for [[Network congestion avoidance#IP ECN|explicit congestion notification]] and [[Quality of Service]] management on the Internet
* [[ISPs|Internet Service Provider]]s typically retain control over queue management and quality of service at their end of the link
* [[Network_congestion_avoidance#TCP_Window_Shaping|Window Shaping]] allows higher end products to reduce traffic flows, which reduce queue depth and allow more users to share more bandwidth fairly

== Tools and techniques ==
* [[Packet sniffer]]s
* [[Network traffic measurement]]
