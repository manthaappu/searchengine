'''Open access''' ('''OA''') refers to unrestricted online access to articles published in [[scholarly journal]]s.<ref name="earlham.edu">[http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/overview.htm Peter Suber: Open Access Overview (definition, introduction)]</ref>

Open Access comes in two forms, [[Gratis versus Libre]]: Gratis OA is no-cost online access, while Libre OA offers some additional usage rights.<ref name="arl.org">[http://www.arl.org/sparc/publications/articles/gratisandlibre.shtml Peter Suber: Gratis and libre Open Access]</ref>  
[[Open content]] is similar to OA, but usually includes the right to ''modify'' the work, whereas in scholarly publishing it is usual to keep an article's content intact and to associate it with a fixed author. [[Creative Commons]] licenses can be used to specify usage rights. The Open Access idea can be extended to the [[learning object]]s and resources provided in [[e-learning]].

OA can be provided in two ways<ref>[http://www.ercim.eu/publication/Ercim_News/enw64/jeffery.html Keith G. Jeffery: Open Access: An Introduction]</ref>:
* "Green OA"<ref>[http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/15753 Harnad, S. (2007) The Green Road to Open Access: A Leveraged Transition. In: ''The Culture of Periodicals from the Perspective of the Electronic Age'', pp. 99-105, L'Harmattan]</ref> is provided by authors publishing in any journal and then [[self-archiving]] their [[postprints]] in their [[institutional repository]] or on some other OA website.<ref name="linkinghub.elsevier.com"/> Green OA journal publishers<ref>[http://romeo.eprints.org/stats.php Romeo registry of Journal OA Policies]</ref> endorse immediate OA self-archiving by their authors.
* "Gold OA"<ref>http://www.doaj.org/</ref> is provided by authors publishing in an [[open access journal]] that provides immediate OA to all of its articles on the publisher's website.<ref name="linkinghub.elsevier.com">[http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0098791307001530 The Access/Impact Problem and the Green and Gold Roads to Open Access: An Update]</ref> ([[Hybrid open access journal]]s provide Gold OA only for those individual articles for which their authors (or their author's institution or funder) pay an OA publishing fee.)

Public access to the [[World Wide Web]] became widespread in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The low-cost distribution technology has fueled the OA movement, and prompted both the Green OA self-archiving of non-OA journal articles and the creation of Gold OA journals. Conventional non-OA journals cover publishing costs through access tolls such as subscriptions, site-licenses or pay-per-view. Some non-OA journals provide OA after an [[Embargo (academic publishing)|embargo]] period of 6–12 months or longer (see "[[Delayed open access journal]]s"). Active debate over the economics and reliability of various ways of providing OA continues among [[researcher]]s, academics, [[librarians]], [[university]] administrators, [[funding agency|funding agencies]], government officials, commercial [[publisher]]s, and [[learned society|society]] publishers.

==Adoption statistics==
An empirical study published in 2010 showed that of the total output of peer-reviewed articles roughly 20 % could be found Openly Accessible.<ref>http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0011273</ref>  8,5 % of the journal literature could be found free at the publishers’ sites (“Gold OA”), of which 62 % in full OA journals, 14 % in subscription journals making their electronic versions free after a delay, and 24 % as individually open articles (against payment) in otherwise subscription journals. For an additional 11,9 % of the articles free full text copies were found elsewhere (“Green OA”) in either subject-based repositories (43 %), institutional repositories (24%) or on the home pages of the authors or their departments (33%). These copies were further classified into exact copies of the published article (38 %), manuscripts as accepted for publishing (46 %) or manuscripts as submitted (15 %).

[[File:OA by Discipline.png|none|left|480px|alt=Open Access by Discipline 2009]]

Chemistry (13 %) had the lowest overall share of OA of all scientific fields, Earth Sciences (33%) the highest. In medicine, biochemistry and chemistry gold publishing in OA journals was more common than the author posting of manuscripts in repositories. In all other fields author-posted green copies dominated the picture.

==Manner of distribution==
Like the self-archived Green OA articles, most Gold OA journal articles are distributed via the [[World Wide Web]],<ref name="earlham.edu"/> due to low distribution costs, increasing reach, speed, and increasing importance for scholarly communication. [[Open source software]] is sometimes used for [[institutional repositories]],<ref>[http://www.soros.org/openaccess/software/ Budapest Open Access Initiative]</ref> OA journal websites,<ref>[http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/ Open Journal Systems | Public Knowledge Project]</ref> and other aspects of OA provision and OA publishing. Gratis OA articles are free online and Libre OA articles have limited copyright and licensing restrictions.<ref name="arl.org"/>

Access to online content requires Internet access, and this distributional consideration presents physical and sometimes financial "barriers" to access. Proponents of OA argue that Internet access barriers are relatively low in many circumstances, that efforts should be made to subsidize universal Internet access, whereas pay-for-access presents a relatively high additional barrier over and above Internet access itself.

OA can be provided by traditional publishers, or under other arrangements. Some OA publishers, such as [[Public Library of Science]] (PLoS), publish only OA journals; others publish OA as well as subscription-based journals.

==Methods of financing gold OA publishing==
Advertising is a major source of funding for mass media that do not charge for content, as well as modern [[web site]]s and [[search engine]]s. [[Public broadcasting]] relies on government funding and voluntary donations from consumers.

Direct private funding from the author for web hosting is very common on the Internet, and is also a traditional mechanism for wealthy print authors. [[Non-profit organization]]s often freely distribute advocacy materials, and some fund free [[public art]] or the production of artistic works.

In scholarly publishing, there are many business models for OA journals. Some charge publication fees (paid by authors or by their funding agencies or employers) and some do not. Some of the no-fee journals have institutional subsidies and some do not. For more detail, see [[open access journals]].

Roughly half<ref>[http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/overview.htm "Open Access Overview"], Peter Suber, June 19, 2007</ref> the Gold OA journals have author fees to cover the cost of publishing (e.g. PLoS fees vary from $1,300 to $2,850<ref>[http://www.plos.org/journals/pubfees.html Publication Fees for PLoS Journals]</ref>) instead of reader subscription fees. Advertising revenue and/or funding from foundations and institutions are also used to provide funding.

==Authors and researchers==
The main reason authors make their articles openly accessible is to maximize their [[impact factor|research impact]]. A study in 2001 first reported an OA [[citation impact]] advantage,<ref>[http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/online-nature01/ Online or Invisible? Steve Lawrence; NEC Research Institute]</ref> and a growing number of studies<ref name=autogenerated3>[http://opcit.eprints.org/oacitation-biblio.html Effect of OA on citation impact: a bibliography of studies]</ref> have confirmed, with varying degrees of methodological rigor, that an OA article is more likely to be used and cited than one behind subscription barriers.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> For example, a 2006 study in ''[[PLoS Biology]]'' found that articles published as immediate open access in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]]'' were three times more likely to be cited than non-open access papers, and were also cited more than ''PNAS'' articles that were only self-archived.<ref>Eysenbach G (2006). [http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040157 PLoS Biology - Citation Advantage of Open Access Articles]. PLoS Biol 4(5): e157 doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0040157</ref> This result has been challenged as possibly due to authors self-selectively making higher quality articles OA,<ref>[http://ideas.repec.org/p/cmi/wpaper/cemi-workingpaper-2008-007.html Getting cited: does open access help?]</ref> but a recent study comparing self-selected OA with mandated OA found that the citation advantage remained just as big when the OA was mandated.<ref>[http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/18493 Gargouri, Y., Hajjem, C., Lariviere, V., Gingras, Y., Brody, T., Carr, L. and Harnad, S. (2010) Self-Selected or Mandated, Open Access Increases Citation Impact for Higher Quality Research]</ref>.

Scholars are paid by research funders and/or their universities to do research; the published article is the report of the work they have done, rather than an item for commercial gain. The more the article is used, cited, applied and built upon, the better for research as well as for the researcher's career.<ref name="uk">[http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/28-guid.html Maximising the Return on the UK's Public Investment in Research - Open Access Archivangelism]</ref><ref>http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v11p354y1988.pdf</ref> Similarly, the more ''quickly'' it is accessible, the better<ref name="uk"/>; open access can reduce publication delays, an obstacle which led many research fields to traditions of widespread preprint access.<ref>[http://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.5418v1 Gentil-Beccot, Anne; Salvatore Mele, Travis Brooks (2009) Citing and Reading Behaviours in High-Energy Physics: How a Community Stopped Worrying about Journals and Learned to Love Repositories]</ref>

Some professional organizations have encouraged use of OA: In 2001, the [[International Mathematical Union]] communicated to its members that "Open access to the mathematical literature is an important goal" and encouraging them to "[make] available electronically as much of our own work as feasible" to "[enlarge] the reservoir of freely available primary mathematical material, particularly helping scientists working without adequate library access."<ref name="imu">{{cite web | url = http://cr.yp.to/bib/imu-call.html | title = Call to All Mathematicians | author = Committee on Electronic Information and Communication (CEIC) of the [[International Mathematical Union]] | date = 15 May 2001 }}</ref>

Authors who wish to make their work openly accessible have two options. One option is to publish in an OA journal ("Gold OA"). An open access journal may or may not charge a processing fee; open access publishing does not necessarily mean that the author has to pay. Traditionally, many [[academic journal]]s levied page charges, long before open access became a possibility. When OA journals do charge processing fees, it is the author's employer or research funder who typically pays the fee, not the individual author, and many journals will waive the fee in cases of financial hardship, or for authors in less-developed countries.

The other option is author [[self-archiving]] ("Green OA"). To find out if a publisher or journal has given a green light to author self-archiving, the author can check the Publisher Copyright Policies and Self-Archiving list<ref>[http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo.php SHERPA/RoMEO - Publisher copyright policies & self-archiving]</ref> on the [[SHERPA (organisation)|SHERPA]] RoMEO web site. To find out by journal, the author can check the EPrints Romeo site,<ref>[http://romeo.eprints.org/ Journal Policies - Self-Archiving Policy By Journal]</ref> which is derived from the SHERPA/RoMEO dataset. There is a self-archiving FAQ.<ref>[http://www.eprints.org/self-faq Self-Archiving FAQ]</ref> Extensive details and links can also be found in the Open Access Archivangelism blog<ref>[http://openaccess.eprints.org/ Open Access Archivangelism]</ref> and the Eprints Open Access site.<ref>[http://www.eprints.org/openaccess/ Open Access]</ref>

While open access is currently focused on scholarly [[scientific literature|research articles]], any content creator who wishes to can share work openly, and decide how to make their content available. [[Creative Commons]] provides a number of licenses with which authors may easily indicate which uses are allowed. <!--opinion While universities, libraries, and funding agencies all have their own reasons to advocate open access, authors are instrumental in making it happen (see [[Peter Suber]]'s ''The Primacy of Authors in Achieving Open Access''<ref>[http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/accessdebate/24.html]</ref>). Authors decide whether to submit their work to open access journals, whether to deposit it in open access repositories, and whether to transfer copyright. -->

==Users==
For the most part, the direct users of research articles are other researchers. Open access helps researchers as readers by opening up access to articles that their libraries do not subscribe to. One of the great beneficiaries of open access may be users in [[developing countries]],where currently some [[universities]] find it difficult to pay for subscriptions required to access the most recent journals.<ref>[http://0-vnweb.hwwilsonweb.com.library.simmons.edu/hww/jumpstart.jhtml?recid=0bc05f7a67b1790e0df0e5347ba8f6b217a5d78d6c41bbca1ac2a6710867c32481c865e2d86e1932&fmt=H Sivaraj, S., et. al., Resource Sharing among Engineering College Libraries in Tamil Nadu in a Networking System. Information Studies v. 14 no. 1 (January 2008) p. 39-49]     Resource Sharing among Engineering College Libraries in Tamil Nadu in a Networking System</ref> Some schemes exist for providing subscription scientific publications to those affiliated to institutions in developing countries at little or no cost.<ref>[http://www.alpsp.org/ Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers]</ref> All researchers benefit from OA as no library can afford to subscribe to every [[scientific journal]] and most can only afford a small fraction of them – this is known as the [[serials crisis]]".<ref>[http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA516819.html Periodicals Price Survey 2005: Choosing Sides - 4/15/2005 - Library Journal]</ref>

Open access extends the reach of research beyond its immediate [[academic]] circle. An OA article can be read by anyone – a [[professional]] in the field, a [[researcher]] in another field, a [[journalist]], a [[politician]] or [[civil servant]], or an interested [[hobbyist]]. Indeed, a 2008 study revealed that [[mental health professional]]s are roughly twice as likely to read a relevant article if it is freely available.<ref>[http://decisionsciences.columbia.edu/papers/hardisty-haaga-2008-preprint.pdf Diffusion of Treatment Research: Does Open Access Matter?]</ref>

The [[Directory of Open Access Journals]] lists a number of [[peer-review]]ed open access journals for browsing and searching. [[Open J-Gate]] <ref>[http://www.openjgate.com World's biggest Open Access English Language Journals Portal - OPEN J-Gate]</ref> is another index of articles published in [[English language]] OA journals, peer reviewed and otherwise, which launched in 2006. Open access articles can also often be found with a [[web search]], using any general [[search engine]] or those specialized for the scholarly/scientific literature, such as [[OAIster]] and [[Google Scholar]]. Results may include [[preprints]] that have not yet been peer reviewed, or [[gray literature]] that will remain unreviewed.

==Research funders and universities==
[[Research funding]] agencies and universities want to ensure that the research they fund and support in various ways has the greatest possible research impact.

Research funders are beginning to expect open access to the research they support. Forty-two of them (including all seven UK Research Councils<ref>[http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/outputs/ Access to Research Outputs]</ref>) have already adopted Green OA [[self-archiving]] mandates, and four more (including two in the US) have proposed to adopt mandates.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.eprints.org/openaccess/policysignup/ Roarmap]</ref>

Canada's Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council,<ref>[http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/ SSHRC/CRSH - Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council / Conseil de recherches en sciences humaines]</ref> which made a commitment to open access in October 2004, has not yet adopted or proposed a mandate but the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) proposed a mandate in 2006 and adopted it in September 2007,<ref>[http://www.eprints.org/openaccess/policysignup/fullinfo.php?inst=Canadian%20Institutes%20of%20Health%20Research%20%28CIHR%29 OA Self-Archiving Policy: Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)]</ref> the first North American public research funder to do so.

In May 2006, the [http://cornyn.senate.gov/doc_archive/05-02-2006_COE06461_xml.pdf US Federal Research Public Access Act (FRPAA)] was proposed toward improving the [http://publicaccess.nih.gov/ NIH Public Access Policy]. Besides points about making open access mandatory, to which the NIH complied in 2008, it argues to extend self-archiving to the full spectrum of major US-funded research. In addition, the FRPAA would no longer stipulate that the self-archiving must be [http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/11000/ central]; the deposit can now be in the author's own institutional repository (IR).
The new U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]]'s Public Access Policy took effect in April 2008 and states that "all articles arising from NIH funds must be submitted to PubMed Central upon acceptance for publication".<ref>[http://publicaccess.nih.gov/ Public Access Homepage]</ref> It stipulates self-archiving in [[PubMed Central]] rather than in the author's own [[institutional repository]], which some consider a strength and others a weakness.

The [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]] (CIHR) Policy on Access to Research Outputs<ref>http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/32005.html</ref> provides a number of options to researchers, including publication in open access journals, or making their manuscripts available in an online repository such as [[PubMed Central Canada]].

In April 2006, the [[European Commission]]<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/old-address-ec.htm Study on the Economic and Technical Evolution of the Scientific Publication Markets in Europe]</ref> recommended: «EC Recommendation A1 : "Research funding agencies... should [e]stablish a European policy mandating published articles arising from EC-funded research to be available after a given time period in open access archives...». This recommendation has since been updated and strengthened by the [http://ec.europa.eu/research/eurab/pdf/eurab_scipub_report_recomm_dec06_en.pdf European Research Advisory Board (EURAB)].<br>
The OpenAIRE (Open Access Infrastructure for Research in Europe) project has hence been started. The EC Open Access pilot covers about 20 % of the budget of the [[Seventh Research Framework Programme]].<ref>''[http://www.openaire.eu/en/about-openaire/news-a-events/69-press-release.html European Countries join forces to realize the EC Open Access pilot: OpenAIRE]'', OpenAIRE, 20-02-2010.</ref>

To somewhat improve on the EC's (and FRPAA's) allowable embargo (of up to six months), [http://ec.europa.eu/research/eurab/pdf/eurab_scipub_report_recomm_dec06_en.pdf EURAB] has revised the mandate: all articles must be deposited immediately upon acceptance: the allowable delay applies only to the time when access to the deposit must be made open access rather than to the time when it must be deposited. This is intended to permit individual users to use an eprint request "[http://www.eprints.org/news/features/request_button.php email eprint]" button found on some archives to send a semi-automatic email message to the author requesting an individual eprint during the embargo period: This is not open access, but in the view of at least some advocates it provides for some needs during any embargo, and might help hasten the demise of embargoes altogether, while facilitating the adoption of self-archiving mandates by funders and universities.

A growing number of universities are providing institutional repositories in which their researchers can deposit their published articles. Eighty-six individual universities and eighteen faculties and departments have already adapted self-archiving mandates (including Harvard, MIT, Stanford, U. College London, U. Edinburgh) and ten further individual multi-university mandates (in Europe and Brazil) have been proposed. [[Eprints]] maintains a Registry of OA Repository Material Archiving Policies (ROARMAP).<ref>[http://www.eprints.org/signup/fulllist.php Roarmap]</ref> and EnablingOpenScholarship (EPS) provides universities with OA policy-building.<ref>http://www.openscholarship.org/</ref>

In May 2005, 16 major [[Dutch universities]] cooperatively launched [[Darenet|DAREnet]], the Digital Academic Repositories, making over 47,000 research papers available to anyone with internet access.<ref>[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/05/11/open_access_research/ Dutch academics declare research free-for-all]</ref> From 1 January 2007, at the completion of the DARE programme, KNAW Research Information has taken over responsibility for the DAREnet portal. On 2 June 2008, DAREnet has been incorporated into the scholarly portal NARCIS.<ref>[http://www.narcis.info Portal NARCIS]</ref> At the end of 2009 NARCIS provides access to 185.000 open access publications from all Dutch universities, KNAW, NWO and a number of scientific institutes.

==Public and advocacy==
Open access to scholarly research is argued to be important to the public for a number of reasons. One of the arguments for public access to the scholarly literature is that most of the research is paid for by taxpayers through [[government grant]]s, who therefore have a right to access the results of what they have funded. This is one of the primary reasons for the creation of advocacy groups such as The Alliance for Taxpayer Access in the US.<ref>[http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/ ATA | The Alliance for Taxpayer Access]</ref> Examples of people who might wish to read scholarly literature include individuals with medical conditions (or family members of such individuals) and serious hobbyists or 'amateur' scholars who may be interested in specialized scientific literature (e.g. [[Amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]]). Additionally, professionals in many fields may be interested in continuing education in the research literature of their field, and many businesses and academic institutions cannot afford to purchase articles from or subscriptions to much of the research literature that is published under a toll access model.

Even those who do not read scholarly articles benefit indirectly from open access<ref>[http://eprints.rclis.org/4940/1/OAbasics.pdf Open Access: Basics and Benefits]</ref>. For example, patients benefit when their doctor and other [[health care]] professionals have access to the latest research. As argued by open access advocates, open access speeds research progress, productivity, and knowledge translation <ref>Eysenbach, Gunther. [http://www.jmir.org/2006/2/e8/ The Open Access Advantage]. J Med Internet Res 2006;8(2):e8.</ref>. Every researcher in the world can read an article, not just those whose library can afford to subscribe to the particular journal in which it appears. Faster discoveries benefit everyone. High school and [[junior college]] students can gain the information literacy skills critical for the knowledge age. Critics of the various open access initiatives{{Who|date=December 2009}} point out that there is little evidence that a significant amount of scientific literature is currently unavailable to those who would benefit from it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} While no library has subscriptions to every journal that might be of benefit, virtually all published research can be acquired via [[interlibrary loan]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Note that interlibrary loan may take a day or weeks depending on the loaning library and whether they will scan and email, or mail the article. Open Access online, by contrast is faster, often immediate, making it more suitable than interlibrary loan for high paced research. 

Due to the benefits of open access, many governments are considering whether or not to mandate open access to publicly funded research. However, some organizations representing publishers, such as the DC Principles group in the United States, feel that such mandates are an unwarranted governmental intrusion in the publishing marketplace. Lobbying on both sides is fierce, both for pro-OA and contra-OA.

In developing nations, open access archiving and publishing acquires a unique importance. Scientists, health care professionals, and institutions in developing nations often do not have the capital necessary to access scholarly literature, although schemes exist to give them access for little or no cost. Among the most important is [[HINARI]],<ref>[http://www.who.int/hinari/en/ World Health Organization] Health InterNetwork Access to Research Initiative</ref> the Health InterNetwork Access to Research Initiative, sponsored by the [[World Health Organization]]. HINARI, however, also has restrictions. For example, individual researchers may not register as users unless their institution has access,<ref name=WHOeligibility>[http://www.who.int/hinari/eligibility/en/ World Health Organization]: Eligibility</ref> and several countries that one might expect to have access do not have access at all (not even "low-cost" access) (e.g. South Africa).<ref name=WHOeligibility/>

Many open access projects involve international collaboration. For example the [[SciELO]] (Scientific Electronic Library Online),<ref>[http://www.scielo.org/index.php?lang=en SciELO - Scientific Electronic Library Online]</ref> is a comprehensive approach to full open access journal publishing, involving a number of [[Latin America]]n countries. Bioline International, a [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to helping publishers in developing countries is a collaboration of people in the UK, Canada, and Brazil; the Bioline International Software is used around the world. [[Research Papers in Economics]] (RePEc), is a collaborative effort of over 100 volunteers in 45 countries. The [[Public Knowledge Project]] in [[Canada]] developed the [[open source]] publishing software [[Open Journal Systems]] (OJS), which is now in use around the world, for example by the [[African Journals Online]]<ref>[http://www.ajol.info/ AJOL - African Journals Online :: African Research, Journals, Medical Research]</ref> group, and one of the most active development groups is Portuguese.

A 2004 study of open access publishing by Kristin Antelman found that in philosophy, political science, electrical and electronic engineering and mathematics, open access papers had a greater research impact.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/acrl/publications/crljournal/2004/sep/antelman.pdf| title = Do Open-Access Articles Have a Greater Research Impact? | publisher = College & Research Libraries 65(5) | date = September 2004 | pages =372–382| author = Kristin Antelman}} and summarized by [http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/acrl/publications/crlnews/2006/dec/scholarlycom.cfm C&RL News]</ref>

==Libraries and librarians==
Many [[librarian]]s have been vocal and active advocates of open access. These librarians believe that open access promises to remove both the ''price barriers'' and the ''permission barriers'' that undermine library efforts to provide access to the journal literature<ref>[http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/acrl.htm Peter Suber, "Introduction to Open Access for Librarians"]</ref>, see also the [[Serials crisis]]. Many library associations have either signed major open access declarations, or created their own. For example, the [[Canadian Library Association]] endorsed a Resolution on Open Access in June 2005.<ref>[https://mx2.arl.org/Lists/SPARC-OAForum/Message/2017.html SPARC-OAForum@arl.org]</ref> Librarians also educate faculty, administrators, and others about the benefits of open access. For example, the [[Association of College and Research Libraries]] of the [[American Library Association]] has developed a Scholarly Communications Toolkit.<ref>[http://www.ala.org/ala/acrl/acrlissues/scholarlycomm/scholarlycommunicationtoolkit/toolkit.htm ALA] Scholarly Communication Toolkit</ref> The [[Association of Research Libraries]] has documented the need for increased access to scholarly information, and was a leading founder of the [[Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition]] (SPARC).<ref>[http://www.arl.org/sparc/index.html Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition]</ref>

There is question, however, as to the extent to which Open Access will solve the serials crisis. In a [[Nature]] Web Focus forum, [http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/accessdebate/34.html The Pros and Cons of Open Access], Kate Worlock discusses whether Open Access is truly the answer to the crisis, or if it is simply an ends to a means in a world with shrinking library budgets. The argument from the publisher is that while the cost of publications have "undisputedly [sic] risen more sharply than the library budgets," the library budget is too small of a portion of the university's (in this example)overall budget at roughly 2% <ref>Worlock, K. (2004). The pros and cons of Open Access. http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/accessdebate/34.html, Nature</ref>.

At most universities, the library houses the institutional repository, which provides free access to scholarly work of the university's faculty. Some open access advocates believe that institutional repositories will play a very important role in responding to open access mandates from funders<ref>[http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/369-guid.html How To Integrate University and Funder Open Access Mandates]</ref>. The Canadian Association of Research Libraries has a program<ref>[http://www.carl-abrc.ca/projects/institutional_repositories/institutional_repositories-e.html CARL - Online Resource Portal]</ref> to develop institutional repositories at all Canadian university libraries.

An increasing number of libraries provide hosting services for open access journals. A recent survey by the Association of Research Libraries <ref>[http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2008/04/more-on-libraries-as-oa-publishers.html Peter Suber, Open Access News]</ref> found that 65% of surveyed libraries either are involved in journal publishing, or are planning to become involved in the very near future.

==History==
The roots of the concept of open access can be found in the distant past, from the very beginnings of publishing, re-emerging with every [[innovation]] in publishing technology. The [[printing press]] allowed the written word to be printed and distributed, thereby extending [[literacy]] to the population at large. Moving from [[vellum]] to paper made it possible to [[Printing|print]] more cheaply. The [[invention]] of the [[Mail|postal]] system provided a means of widespread [[distribution (business)|distribution]].

The beginnings of the scholarly journal were a way of expanding low-cost access to scholarly findings. Many individuals anticipated the open access concept long before modern low-cost distribution methods. One early proponent was the physicist [[Leo Szilard]]. To help stem the flood of low-quality publications, he jokingly suggested in the [[1940]]s that at the beginning of his career each [[scientist]] should be issued with 100 vouchers to pay for his papers. The [[Common Knowledge]] project was an attempt to share information for the good of all, the brainchild of [[Brower Murphy]], formerly of The Library Corporation. Brower and [[Common Knowledge]] are recognised in the Library Microcomputer Hall of Fame.<ref>[http://www.wiredlibrarian.com/wln/wlnhalloffame.htm WLN: Library Microcomputer Hall of Fame]</ref>

The modern [[Open Access movement]] (as a [[social movement]]) traces its history at least back to the 1960s, but became much more prominent in the 1990s with the advent of the [[Digital Age]]. With the spread of the [[Internet]] and the ability to copy and distribute electronic data at no cost, the arguments for open access gained new importance.

Probably the earliest book publisher to provide open access was the [[National Academies Press]], publisher for the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], [[Institute of Medicine]], and other arms of the [[National Academies]]. They have provided free online full-text editions of their books alongside priced, printed editions since 1994, and assert that the online editions promote sales of the print editions. As of June 2006 they had more than 3,600 books up online for browsing, searching, and reading.

An explosion of interest and activity in open access journals has occurred since the 1990s, largely due to the widespread availability of [[Internet]] access. It is now possible to publish a scholarly article and ''also'' make it instantly accessible anywhere in the world where there are [[computers]] and Internet connections. The fixed cost of producing the article is separable from the minimal marginal cost of the online distribution.

These new possibilities emerged at a time when the traditional, print-based scholarly journals system was in a crisis. The number of journals and articles produced has been increasing at a steady rate; however the average cost per journal has been rising at a rate far above [[inflation]] for decades, and budgets at academic libraries have remained fairly static. The result was decreased access - ironically, just when technology has made almost unlimited access a very real possibility, for the first time. [[Libraries]] and [[librarian]]s have played an important part in the open access movement, initially by alerting faculty and administrators to the serials crisis. The Association of Research Libraries developed the [[Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition]] (SPARC), in 1997, an alliance of academic and research libraries and other organizations, to address the crisis and develop and promote alternatives, such as open access.

The first online-only, free-access journals (eventually to be called "open access journals") began appearing in the late 1980s. Among them was ''[[Bryn Mawr Classical Review]]''<ref>[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/ The Bryn Mawr Classical Review]</ref>, ''Postmodern Culture''<ref>[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/postmodern_culture/ Project MUSE - Postmodern Culture]</ref> and ''Psycoloquy''<ref>[http://psycprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/ Welcome to PsycPrints]</ref>.

The first free scientific online archive was arXiv.org, started in 1991, initially a preprint service for physicists, initiated by [[Paul Ginsparg]]. Self-archiving has become the norm in physics, with some sub-areas of physics, such as high-energy physics, having a 100% self-archiving rate. The prior existence of a "preprint culture" in high-energy physics is one major reason why arXiv has been successful.<ref>[http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0102004 [physics/0102004&#93; Predecessors of preprint servers]</ref> arXiv now includes papers from related disciplines, such as computer science and mathematics, but computer scientists mostly self-archive on their own websites and have been doing so for even longer than physicists. ([[Citeseer]] is a computer science archive that harvests, [[Google]]-style, from distributed computer science websites and [[institutional repository|institutional repositories]] and contains almost twice as many papers as arxiv.) arXiv now includes postprints as well as preprints.<ref>[http://www.eprints.org/openaccess/self-faq/#What-is-Eprint Self-Archiving FAQ]</ref> The two major physics publishers ([[American Physical Society]] and [[Institute of Physics]] Publishing have reported that arXiv has had no effect on journal subscriptions in physics; even though the articles are freely available, usually before publication, physicists value their journals and continue to support them.<ref>[http://www.iop.org/ Institute of Physics - Home of the Institute of Physics]</ref>) <ref>[http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/11006/ Open access self-archiving: An Introduction - ECS EPrints Repository]</ref>

The [[inventor]]s of the [[Internet]] and the [[World Wide Web|Web]] -- computer scientists—had been self-archiving on their own [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] sites and then their websites since even earlier than the physicists, as was revealed when [[Citeseer]] began harvesting their papers in the late 1990s. The 1994 "[[Subversive Proposal]]"<ref>[http://www.arl.org/scomm/subversive/sub01.html Association of Research Libraries :: Scholarly Journals at the Crossroads: A Subversive Proposal for Electronic Publishing]</ref> was to extend [[self-archiving]] to all other disciplines; from it arose [[CogPrints]] (1997) and eventually the [[Open Archives Initiative|OAI]]-compliant generic [[GNU]] [[Eprints.org]] software in 2000.<ref>[http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october00/10inbrief.html#HARNAD D-Lib - In Brief (October 2000)]</ref>

In 1997, the U.S. [[National Library of Medicine]] (NLM) made [[Medline]], the most comprehensive index to medical literature on the planet, freely available in the form of [[PubMed]]. Usage of this database increased a hundredfold when it became free, strongly suggesting that prior limits on usage were impacted by lack of access. While indexes are not the main focus of the open access movement, free Medline is important in that it opened up a whole new form of use of [[scientific literature]] - by the public, not just professionals.

In 1998, the [[American Scientist Open Access Forum]]<ref>[http://amsci-forum.amsci.org/archives/American-Scientist-Open-Access-Forum.html Archives Of American-Scientist-Open-Access-Forum@Listserver.Sigmaxi.Org]</ref> was launched (and first called the "September98 Forum").
The ''Journal of Medical Internet Research'' (''JMIR'')<ref>[http://www.jmir.org/ JMIR Home]</ref>,one of the first Open Access journals in medicine, was created in 1998, publishing its first issue in 1999.

In 1999, [[Harold Varmus]] of the [[NIH]] proposed a journal called [http://www.nih.gov/about/director/pubmedcentral/ebiomedarch.htm E-biomed], intended as an open access electronic publishing platform combining a [[preprint]] server with peer-reviewed articles. E-biomed later saw light in a revised form<ref>[http://www.nih.gov/about/director/pubmedcentral/pubmedcentral.htm PubMed Central: An NIH-Operated Site for Electronic Distribution of Life Sciences Research Reports]</ref> as [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/[[PubMed Central]], a [[postprint]] archive.

It was also in 1999 that the [[Open Archives Initiative]] and its [[OAI-PMH]] protocol for metadata harvesting was launched in order to make online archives interoperable.

In 2000, [[BioMed Central]], a for-profit open access publisher, was launched by the then Current Science Group (the founder of the ''Current Opinion'' series, and now known as the Science Navigation Group) <ref>[http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/about/pr-releases#bn00 BioMed Central | about us | Press releases<]</ref>. In some ways, BioMed Central resembles [[Harold Varmus]]' original E-biomed proposal more closely than does [[PubMed Central]] <ref>[http://www.infotoday.com/it/jan05/poynder.shtml Interview with Vitek Tracz: Essential for Science]</ref>. BioMed Central now publishes over 170 journals <ref>[http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/authors/journaloverview BioMed Central | for authors | Overview<]</ref>.

In 2001, 34,000 scholars around the world signed "An Open Letter to Scientific Publishers",<ref>[http://www.plos.org/about/letter.html Public Library of Science: Read the Open Letter]</ref> calling for "the establishment of an online public library that would provide the full contents of the published record of research and scholarly discourse in medicine and the life sciences in a freely accessible, fully searchable, interlinked form". Scientists signing the letter also pledged not to publish in or peer-review for non-open access journals. This led to the establishment of the [[Public Library of Science]], an advocacy organization. However, most scientists continued to publish and review for non-open access journals. PLoS decided to become an open access publisher aiming to compete at the high quality end of the scientific spectrum with commercial publishers and other open access journals, which were beginning to flourish <ref>[http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0000036 PLoS Biology - Why PLoS Became a Publisher]</ref>. Critics have argued that, equipped with a $10 million grant, PLoS competes with smaller OA journals for the best submissions and runs danger to destroy what it originally wanted to foster <ref>[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v441/n7096/full/441914a.html Open-access journal hits rocky times : Article : Nature<]</ref>.

The ''first major international'' statement on open access<ref name=autogenerated5>[http://www.soros.org/openaccess/read.shtml Budapest Open Access Initiative]</ref> was the [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]] in February 2002, launched by the [[Open Society Institute]] .<ref>[http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/boaifaq.htm Budapest Open Access Initiative, FAQ]</ref> This provided a definition of open access, and has a growing list of signatories.<ref>[http://www.soros.org/openaccess/view.cfm Budapest Open Access Initiative]</ref> Two further statements followed: the Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing<ref>[http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/bethesda.htm Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing]</ref> in June 2003 and the [[Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities]] in October 2003.

In 2003, the [[Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities]] was drafted and the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] included open access in its Declaration of Principles and Plan of Action.

In 2006, a [[Federal Research Public Access Act]] was introduced in US Congress by senators [[John Cornyn]] and [[Joe Lieberman]].<ref>Robin Peek, [http://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/nbreader.asp?ArticleID=15852 The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006 ], May 8, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.arl.org/sparc/advocacy/frpaa/index.shtml Federal Research Public Access Act]</ref> The act is awaiting reintroduction in the [[110th Congress]].

The idea of mandating self-archiving was mooted at least as early as 1998.<ref>[http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Hypermail/Amsci/0010.html American-Scientist-Open-Access-Forum: Re: Savings from Convertin]</ref> Since 2003<ref>[http://listserver.sigmaxi.org/sc/wa.exe?A2=ind03&L=american-scientist-open-access-forum&F=l&S=&P=91229 AMERICAN-SCIENTIST-OPEN-ACCESS-FORUM archives - 2003 (#710)]</ref> efforts have been focused on open access mandating by the funders of research: governments,<ref>[http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Temp/UKSTC.htm Recommendations For Uk Open-Access Provision Policy]</ref> research funding agencies,<ref>[http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/access/index.asp Access to Research Outputs]</ref> and universities.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> These efforts have been fought by the publishing industry<ref>[http://www.prismcoalition.org/ PRISM]</ref>. However, many countries, funders, universities and other organizations have now either made commitments to open access, or are in the process of reviewing their policies and procedures, with a view to opening up access to results of the research they are responsible for.

One of the many [[librarian]]s who have been leaders{{peacock term|date=October 2010}} in the self-archiving approach to open access is [[Hélène Bosc]]; her work can be found in her "15-year retrospective".<ref>[http://open-access.infodocs.eu/tiki-index.php Open Access to scientific communication]</ref>

==Criticism==
{{Main|open access journal|self-archiving}}
{{Weasel|date=December 2008}}

Opponents of the open access model assert that the pay-for-access model is necessary to ensure that the publisher is adequately compensated for their work. Scholarly journal publishers that support pay-for-access claim that the "gatekeeper" role they play, maintaining a scholarly reputation, arranging for [[peer review]], and editing and indexing articles, require economic resources that are not supplied under an open access model, though acknowledging that open access journals do provide peer review. The cost of paper publication may also make open access to paper copies infeasible. Opponents claim that open access is not necessary to ensure fair access to developing nations; differential pricing, or financial aid from developed countries or institutions can make access to proprietary journals affordable. Conventional journal publishers may also lose customers to open access publishers who compete with them. The Partnership for Research Integrity in Science and Medicine (PRISM), a [[Political action committee|lobbying organization]] formed by the [[Association of American Publishers]] (AAP), is opposed to the open access movement.<ref>[http://www.salon.com/tech/htww/2007/08/28/prism_open_access/index.html]</ref> PRISM and AAP have lobbied against the increasing trend amongst funding organizations to require open publication, describing it as "government interference" and a threat to [[peer review]].<ref>[http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6471211.html]</ref>

Textbook publishers generally make an even greater investment in the editing process, and electronic textbooks have yet to become widely accepted. For researchers, publishing an article describing novel results in a reputable scientific journal usually does more to enhance one's reputation among scientific peers, and advance one's academic career. Journal article authors are generally not directly financially compensated for their work beyond their institutional salaries and the indirect benefits that an enhanced reputation provides in terms of institutional funding, job offers, and peer collaboration <ref>Nicholas, D., Rowlands, I. (2005). Open Access publishing: The evidence from the authors. The Journal of Academic Librarianship, Vol. 31, no 3, pp. 179-181.</ref>. It could be argued, then, that the financial reward from writing a successful textbook is an important motivating factor, without which the quality and quantity of available textbooks would decrease.{{Dubious|date=September 2009}}

There are those, for example PRISM, who think that open access is unnecessary or even harmful. It has been argued{{Who|date=January 2009}} that there is no need for those outside major academic institutions to have access to primary publications, at least in some fields.<ref>[http://arizona.openrepository.com/arizona/handle/10150/105958 DLIST - Goodman, David (2005) Open Access: What Comes Next]</ref> 

In the entertainment industry, it is argued that, unlike science, there is no pressing social need for widespread and barrier-free access to the content.

One argument against Open Access is highlighted in a Nature (a for-profit publication) Web Focus forum, [http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/accessdebate/34.html The Pros and Cons of Open Access]. One argument brought up in the forum is that the supposed tax-payer right to access is blown out of proportion by the advocates of Open Access. Kate Worlock, the author of the forum article argues,  "...where research is publicly-funded, taxes are generally not paid so that taxpayers can access research results, but rather so that society can benefit from the results of that research; in the form of new medical treatments, for example. Publishers claim that 90% of potential readers can access 90% of all available content through national or research libraries, and while this may not be as easy as accessing an article online directly it is certainly possible <ref>Worlock, K. (2004). The Pros and Cons of Open Access. Accessed online http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/accessdebate/34.html, Nature.</ref> ." The argument for tax-payer funded research is only applicable in certain countries as well. For instance in Australia, 80% of research funding comes through taxes, whereas in Japan and Switzerland, only approximately 10% is from the public coffers <ref>Worlock, K. (2004). The Pros and Cons of Open Access. Accessed online http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/accessdebate/34.html, Nature</ref>.

===Funding issues===
The "article processing charges" for open access shifts the burden of payment from readers to authors, which could conceivably create a new set of concerns. For example, budget processes may need adjustments to provide funding for the "article processing charges" required to publish in almost all open access journals (e.g. those published by [[BioMed Central]] [http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/authors/apcfaq#why]). Unless discounts are available to authors from countries with low incomes or external funding is provided to cover the cost, article processing charges could exclude authors from developing countries or less well-funded research fields from publishing in open access journals. However, under the traditional model, the prohibitive cost of non-open access journal subscriptions would preclude conducting any research in the first place. Moreover, many open access publishers offer discounts or publishing fee waivers to authors from developing countries or those suffering financial hardship. [[Self-archiving]] of non-OA publications also provides a low cost alternative model <ref>Corrado, E. (2005). The importance of Open Access, Open Source, and Open Standards for libraries. Issues in Science and Technology Librarianship.</ref>.

Outside of science and academia, it is unusual for producers of creative output to be financially compensated on anything other than a pay-for-access model. (Notable exceptions include [[open source software]] and public broadcasting.) Successful writers, for example, support themselves by the revenues generated by people purchasing copies of their works; publishing houses are able to finance the publication of new authors based on anticipated revenues from sales of those that are successful. Opponents of open access would argue that without direct financial compensation via pay-for-access, many authors would be unable to afford to write, though some would accept the economic hardship of holding down a [[day job]] while continuing to write as a "labor of love". However, this argument has no relevance to [[academic publishing]], because scientific journals do not pay royalties to article authors.

===Citation study===
A study published in the British Medical Journal<ref>[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/337/jul31_1/a568 Open access publishing, article downloads, and citations: randomised controlled trial] BMJ 2008(31 July);337:a568</ref> disputes the claim that open access articles equal more citations. In the study, researchers from [[Cornell University]] randomly made some journal articles freely available while keeping others available by subscription only in order to determine whether increased access to journal articles results in more article downloads and citations. They found, in an interim analysis, that in the first year after the articles were published, open-access articles were downloaded more but were no more likely to be cited than subscription-based articles.<ref>[http://newswise.com/articles/view/543150/ Free Articles Get Read but Don't Generate More Citations] Newswise, Retrieved on July 31, 2008.</ref> However, many responses to the paper argue that the interim analysis was premature.<ref>[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/337/jul31_1/a568 Rapid Responses to BMJ 2008;337:a568]</ref>

==Comparison with other media==
Many traditional media such as certain [[newspapers]], [[television]], and [[radio]] broadcasts could be considered "open access". These include [[commercial broadcasting]] and free newspapers supported by [[advertising]], [[public broadcasting]], and privately funded political advocacy materials. Minor barriers are also present in other media: broadcast media require receiving equipment, online content requires Internet access, and locally distributed printed media requires transportation to a distribution point.

Many other types of material can also be published in this manner: [[magazine]]s and newsletters, [[e-text]] or other [[e-book]]s, music, fine arts, or any product of intellectual activity.
