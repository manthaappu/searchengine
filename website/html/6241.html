A '''chunk''' is a fragment of information which is used in many multimedia formats, such as [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[MP3]] and [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]]. 

Each chunk contains a header which indicates some parameters (e.g. the type of chunk, comments, size etc.) In the middle there is a variable area containing data which are decoded by the program from the parameters in the header.  

Chunks may also be fragments of information which are downloaded or managed by [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] programs. 

In distributed computing, a chunk is a set of data which are sent to a processor or one of the parts of a computer for processing. For example a sub-set of rows of a matrix.
