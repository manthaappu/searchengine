A '''bigraph''' (often used in the plural '''bigraphs''') can be modelled as the superposition of a [[Graph (mathematics)|graph]] (the ''link graph'') and a set of [[Tree (mathematics)|trees]] (the ''place graph'').<ref name="intro">''[http://www.itu.dk/research/pls/wiki/index.php/A_Brief_Introduction_To_Bigraphs A Brief Introduction To Bigraphs]'', [[IT University of Copenhagen]], Denmark.</ref><ref name="milner">[[Robin Milner]], ''[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/archive/rm135/uam-theme.html The Bigraphical Model]'', [[University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory]], UK.</ref>

Each [[Node (mathematics)|node]] of the bigraph is part of a graph and also part of some tree that describes how the nodes are nested. Bigraphs can be conveniently and formally displayed as [[diagram]]s.<ref name="intro" /> They have applications in the modelling of distributed systems for [[ubiquitous computing]] and can be used to describe [[Mobile agent|mobile]] interactions. They have also been used by [[Robin Milner]] in an attempt to subsume [[Calculus of Communicating Systems]] (CCS) and [[Pi calculus|π-calculus]].<ref name="milner" /> They have been studied in the context of [[category theory]].<ref>Robin Milner, "Bigraphs and Their Algebra".
