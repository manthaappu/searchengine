{{Puzzles}}
A '''puzzle''' is a [[problem]] or enigma that tests the [[ingenuity]] of the solver. In a basic  puzzle, one is intended to put together pieces in a logical way in order to come up with the desired solution. Puzzles are often contrived as a form of entertainment, but they can also stem from serious mathematical or logistical problems &mdash; in such cases, their successful resolution can be a significant contribution to mathematical [[research]].<ref>Kendall G., Parkes A. and Spoerer K. (2008) A Survey of NP-Complete Puzzles, International Computer Games Association Journal, 31(1), pp 13-34</ref>

Solutions to puzzles may require recognizing [[pattern]]s and creating a particular order.  People with a high [[inductive reasoning aptitude]] may be better at solving these puzzles than others. Puzzles based on the process of [[inquiry]] and discovery to complete may be solved faster by those with good [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] skills.

==History==
The first [[jigsaw puzzle]] was created around 1760, when John Spilsbury, a British engraver and mapmaker, mounted a map on a sheet of wood that he then sawed around each individual country.  Spilsbury used the product to aid in teaching geography.  After catching on with the wider public, this remained the primary use of jigsaw puzzles until about 1820.<ref>[http://www.jigsaw-puzzle.org/jigsaw-puzzle-history.html Puzzle History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

By the early 20th century, magazines and newspapers found that they could increase their daily subscriptions by publishing [[puzzle contest]]s. Puzzles may also include letters, numbers, shapes, and riddles.

==Contemporary puzzles==
A sample of notable puzzle authors includes [[Sam Loyd]], [[Henry Dudeney]], [[Boris Kordemsky]] and, more recently, [[David J. Bodycombe]], [[Will Shortz]], [[Lloyd King (puzzle designer)|Lloyd King]] and [[Martin Gardner]].

There are organizations and events catering to puzzle enthusiasts such as [[Ravenchase]], the [[International Puzzle Party]], the [[World Puzzle Championship]] and the [[National Puzzlers' League]]. There are also Puzzlehunts like [[Maze of Games]] or the Rittenhouse Chronicles.

The [[Rubik's Cube]] and other [[combination puzzles]] are [[toy]]s based on puzzles that can be stimulating toys for kids and are a recreational activity for adults. Puzzles can be used to hide or obscure objects. A good example is a [[puzzle box]] used to hide [[jewelry]].

[[Game]]s are often based on a puzzle. For example there are thousands of [[computer puzzle game]]s and many [[letter game]]s, [[word game]]s and [[mathematical game]]s which require solutions to puzzles as part of the gameplay. One of the most popular puzzle games is ''[[Tetris]]''. 

A [[chess problem]] is a puzzle that uses chess pieces on a chess board.

==Types of puzzles==
The large number of puzzles that have been created can be divided into categories, for example a [[maze]] is a type of [[tour puzzle]]. Other categories include [[construction puzzle]]s, [[stick puzzle]]s, [[tiling puzzle]]s, [[transport puzzle]]s, [[disentanglement puzzle]]s, [[jigsaw puzzle]]s, [[lock puzzle]]s, [[Mechanical puzzle#Fold Puzzles|folding puzzle]]s, [[combination puzzles]] and [[mechanical puzzle]]s.

==Etymology==
The 1989 edition of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dates the word ''puzzle'' (as a [[verb]]) to the end of the 16th century.  That first documented use comes from a book called ''The Voyage of [[Robert Dudley, styled Earl of Warwick|Robert Dudley]]...to the West Indies, 1594–95, narrated by Capt. Wyatt, by himself, and by Abram Kendall, master'' (published circa 1595).

Their research, based on the "chronology of the words, and still more the consideration of their sense-history, seem[s] to make it clear that the verb came first, and that the noun was its derivative."
