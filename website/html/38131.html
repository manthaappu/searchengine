Transmissibility, in the context of [[Structural Dynamics]], can be defined as the ratio of the maximum force (<math>f_{max}</math>) on the floor as a result of the vibration of a machine to the maximum machine force (<math>P_0</math>):

:<math>TR = \frac{f_{max}}{P_0} = R_d\sqrt{1+(2\zeta\beta)^2}</math>

:Where <math>\zeta</math> is equal to the [[damping ratio]] and <math>\beta</math> is equal to the frequency ratio. <math>R_d</math> is the ratio of the dynamic to static amplitude.
