== What is an MSIC? ==
A '''Maritime Security Identification Card''' (MSIC) is a nationally consistent identification card which is issued to identify a person who has been the subject of a background check. It shows that the holder has met the minimum security requirements and needs to work unescorted or unmonitored in a maritime security zone. The MSIC is not an access card and the relevant authority at each port or facility still controls access to its maritime security zones. MSICs are valid for up to five years.<ref>http://www.msic.id.au/background.php</ref>

== Background ==
In May 2005, the Australian Government introduced amendments to the Maritime Transport Security Act 2003 <ref>http://www.comlaw.gov.au/comlaw/management.nsf/lookupindexpagesbyid/IP200401896?OpenDocument</ref> in Federal Parliament in an effort to further secure the nation's maritime and offshore industries. These amendments have led to the introduction of maritime security identity cards (MSIC) which will ensure that those working in these critical industries are subject to appropriate background checking as now occurs in the aviation industry.

As a nationally recognised form of maritime and offshore industry identification, the MSIC will distinguish the holder as having met the minimum background checking requirements. It is essential for all maritime industry workers and contractors who operate within maritime security zones at ports, ships and oil and gas facilities. 

From 1 January 2007, all personnel requiring unmonitored access to a maritime or offshore security zone will be required to display an MSIC.<ref>http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/transport/security/maritime/msic.aspx</ref>

The MSIC is a program similar to the [[w:Aviation Security Identification Card|Aviation Security Identification Card]], program found in the aviation industry.

== Who needs an MSIC? ==
A person has an operational need to hold an MSIC if his or her occupation or business interests require, or will require, him or her to have unmonitored access to a maritime security zone at least once a year.
This includes:
<br />•	Port, port facility and port service workers; 
<br />•	Stevedores; 
<br />•	Transport operators such as train and truck drivers; 
<br />•	Seafarers on Australian regulated ships and; 
<br />•	People who work on and/or supply offshore oil and gas facilities.

== What does the application process involve? ==
Once an applicant has lodged their application, the issuing body will confirm the applicant's identity, confirm the applicant's operational need for an MSIC, request a background check of the applicant by AusCheck <ref>http://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/OrganisationalStructure_NationalSecurityandCriminalJustice_AusCheck_AusCheck</ref>, and if necessary, confirm the applicant's right to work in Australia.

The [[Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement]] allows Australian and New Zealand citizens to live and work in each country respectively.  As such, New Zealand citizens possess an Entitlement to Work in Australia upon entry into Australia.   

== What is involved in a background check for an MSIC? ==
AusCheck, a unit of the [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney General's Department]], is now responsible for coordinating the background checks of MSIC applicants and people who are involved in the issue of MSICs.  The Background checking process includes an assessment of:
<br />• A criminal records check undertaken by the Australian Federal Police, which is used to determine if an applicant has an adverse criminal record; 
<br />• A security assessment conducted by the [[w:Australian Security Intelligence Organisation|Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]]; and,
<br />• If the applicant is not an Australian citizen, confirmation that the applicant has a right to work in Australia.

== How do I apply for an MSIC? ==
The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government ([[w:Infrastructure Australia|Infrastructure Australia]]) authorises organisations to serve as an approved MSIC Issuing Body. There are currently 21 authorised MSIC Issuing Bodies.  Of these 21 issuing bodies:
<br />• Three provide an international service in addition to their national service
<br />• Four provide a nationwide service
<br />• Six provide only a local service
<br />• Eight provide only to their employees
