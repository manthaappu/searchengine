'''Morpheus''' was a [[file sharing]] and searching [[peer-to-peer]] client for [[Microsoft Windows]], developed and distributed by the company [[StreamCast Networks|StreamCast]], that originally used the [[Opennap]] protocol, but later supported many different peer-to-peer protocols.  On April 22, 2008, distributor StreamCast Networks filed for Chapter 7 [[bankruptcy]] after a long legal battle with music companies; all of their employees were laid off and the official download at www.morpheus.com stopped being available, though for a small period the website remained online. As of October 29, 2008 the  official Morpheus website is offline, including all other websites owned by StreamCast Networks including Morpheus.com, MusicCity.com, Streamcastnetworks.com and NeoNetwork.com

==Download restriction==
Currently, Morpheus redirects a user attempting to download unauthorized copyrighted music and movie files to a site with purchase links for music.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

== Availability ==
Users of the Morpheus community have set up a website where you are still able to download the Morpheus software. At that site, there is a support forum and support chatroom setup from the [http://www.gnutellaforums.com/morpheus-windows/91786-clean-updated-morpheus-installers-available-here.html site] and within the client.

==Presence of adware/spyware==
The current version of Morpheus, version 5.5.1, contains no adware or spyware, and no additional software is bundled with Morpheus. However, when Morpheus is open and running, the interface contains online ads that support the application. 

During installation, an <nowiki>optional</nowiki> peer-to-peer Morpheus Toolbar is offered.  Both the Morpheus application and the Morpheus Toolbar are easily uninstalled with Windows Add/Remove Programs commands, however this is not the case with previous versions.

Version 5.3 didn't install [[adware]] or [[spyware]], though it did install some Desktop shortcuts to adware websites and the Morpheus Toolbar without user approval.
