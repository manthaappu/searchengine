</ref> and is freely available in versions tailored for most popular operating systems, including but not limited to Microsoft's Windows, Apple's Mac OS X, and GNU/Linux.

In addition to detailed image retouching and free-form drawing, GIMP can accomplish essential image editing tasks such as resizing, editing, and cropping photos, photomontages combining multiple images, and converting between different image formats. GIMP can also be used to create basic animated images in the [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] format. With its encyclopedic abilities, GIMP is widely considered <ref>http://www.zdnet.co.uk/reviews/content-creation/2007/07/20/can-gimp-replace-photoshop-39288136/</ref> to be the main free-software functional drop-in replacement for  [[Adobe Photoshop]], with a similar feature set and a similar and complex user interface. 

GIMP's product vision is that GIMP is or will become a free software high-end graphics application for the editing and creation of original images, icons, graphical elements of web pages and art for user interface elements.<ref>{{cite web |title=GIMP UI Redesign |url=http://gui.gimp.org/index.php/GIMP_UI_Redesign |date=17 May 2008 |work=GIMP UI redesign |publisher=GIMP UI team |accessdate=2 July 2009}}</ref> GIMP is also used by photographers and the film industry {{who?|date=December 2010}}.

{{cite web|url=http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/why.html |title=why port to windows}}

{{cite book |title=Grokking the GIMP |last=Bunks |first=Carey |year=2000 |publisher=New Riders |isbn=0735709246 |page=14|url=http://gimp-savvy.com/BOOK/index.html |accessdate=8 July 2009}}
</ref> Since the initial release, GIMP has been ported to many operating systems including [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]]; the original port to the win32 platform was started by Finnish programmer Tor Lillqvist (tml) in 1997 and was supported in the GIMP 1.1 release.<ref name="why-win32" />

GIMP has used three graphical user interface (GUI) toolkits since its inception; GIMP originally used [[Motif (widget toolkit)|Motif]] on the first public release (0.54). At some point Peter Mattis became disenchanted with Motif and developed his own GUI toolkit named the GIMP toolkit ([[GTK+|GTK]]); GTK had successfully replaced Motif in the 0.60 release of GIMP.<ref name="ancient-history" /><ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/19990417052141/http://www.linuxworld.com/linuxworld/lw-1999-01/lw-01-gimp.html LinuxWorld - Where did Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis go?]</ref> Finally GTK was re-written to be [[object oriented]] and was renamed GTK+; this was first visible in GIMP 0.99. <!-- section summarized from gimp release history -->

==User interface==
GIMP has a main window and several dialogue windows used for tools, color palettes and so forth; as such GIMP uses a (controlled) [[single document interface]]. In a single document interface the responsibility of managing additional windows is left to the operating system. This windowing format has been criticised and where some attention to the user interface is being debated.<ref>
{{cite web |url = http://blogs.gnome.org/bolsh/2006/09/18/the-gimp-usability/ |title = The GIMP usability |accessdate = 2007-07-29 |author=Dave Neary |date=18 September 2006
| work = Safe as Milk blog}}
</ref> Because GIMP uses multiple windows a given user must place each window in a functional location. Other user concerns for windowing include a situation where the toolbox and layer windows end up hidden behind unrelated application windows. This occurs less often in recent versions, where GIMP tells desktop environments how to handle its windows.

In order to construct its interface GIMP uses the [[GTK+|GIMP tool kit]] (GTK+). GTK+ was designed to replace [[Motif (widget toolkit)|Motif]], a [[proprietary software|proprietary]] toolkit upon which GIMP depended. Originally GTK+ was a part of the GIMP source tree, but has since been made into a standalone library. While originally being designed to run on [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s, GIMP and GTK+ have been ported to Microsoft Windows, [[Mac OS X]], and other operating systems.

====GIMP usability team====
GIMP contributors signed up to join the [[OpenUsability]] project.<ref>

====Single window GIMP====
At [[Libre Graphics Meeting]] 2008 Peter Sikking gave a presentation outlining future plans for GIMP to have a single window interface,<ref>
{{cite web |author=Peter Sikking |coauthors=river-valley.tv |title=GIMP: a new simple interface for a complex application |url=http://river-valley.tv/gimp-a-new-simple-interface-for-a-complex-application/ |year=2008 |work=Libre Graphics Meetings recordings |publisher=river-valley.tv |accessdate=5 July 2009}}
</ref> amongst many other changes. The use of single window mode will be optional.

==Media attention==
As a popular application, GIMP is regularly reviewed. The reviews often examine the fitness of GIMP for use in professional environments; as such GIMP is often cited as a replacement for [[Adobe Photoshop]].<ref name="ars-2.6">
{{cite web |title=GIMP 2.6 released, one step closer to taking on Photoshop |url=http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2008/10/gimp-2-6-released-one-step-closer-to-taking-on-photoshop.ars |date=1 October 2008 |publisher=Ars Technica |author=Ryan Paul |accessdate=2 July 2009}}

GIMP 2.6 has been reviewed twice by [[Ars Technica]]. In the first review, Ryan Paul noted that GIMP provides "Photoshop-like capabilities and offers a broad feature set that has made it popular with amateur artists and open source fans. Although GIMP is generally not regarded as a sufficient replacement for high-end commercial tools, it is beginning to gain some acceptance in the pro market."<ref name="ars-2.6" /> While previously it had been recognized that GIMP had extensive capabilities, few reviewers have cited GIMP as a tool used in professional environments.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Dave Girard also reviewed GIMP 2.6, specifically with the aim of testing GIMP's fitness for professional tasks. He noted at the beginning that GIMP was a high-end tool, but the review conclusion noted that although many of GIMP's tools were of high quality, he felt that it lacked in some areas such as [[non-destructive editing]], tools such as a saturation brush and that GIMP did not integrate well to Mac OS X; Dave Girard recognized however that OS X is not the native platform of GIMP.<ref>

==Features==
{{See|Comparison of raster graphics editors}}
[[File:Gimp brushes.png|thumb |Brushes dialogue in [[GNOME]]]]
Tools used to manipulate images can be accessed via the toolbox, through menus and dialogue windows. They include filters and brushes, as well as transformation, selection, layer and masking tools.

* ''Color'': GIMP has several ways of selecting colors including palettes, color choosers and using an eyedropper tool to select a color on the canvas. The built in color choosers include [[RGB color model|RGB]]/[[HSV color space|HSV]] selector or scales, water-color selector, [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] (cyan, magenta, yellow, key (black)) selector and a color-wheel selector. Colors can also be selected using hexadecimal color codes as used in HTML color selection. GIMP has native support for indexed color and [[RGB]] color spaces, other color spaces are supported using decomposition where each channel of the new color space becomes a black and white image. CMYK, [[Lab color space|LAB]] and [[HSL and HSV|HSV]] ([[hue]], [[colorfulness|saturation]], [[Value (colorimetry)|value]]) are supported this way.<ref>{{cite web |author=Yoshinori Yamakawa|title=Separate+ |url=http://cue.yellowmagic.info/softwares/separate.html |date=6 January 2007 |publisher=cue.yellowmagic.info |accessdate=2 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=The GIMP documentation team |title=Decompose |url=http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/plug-in-decompose-registered.html|work=GIMP user manual |publisher=docs.gimp.org |accessdate=2 July 2009}}</ref> Color blending can be achieved using the blend tool, by applying a [[Image gradient|gradient]] to the surface of an image and using GIMP's color modes. Gradients are also integrated into tools such as the brush tool, when the user paints this way the output color slowly changes. There are a number of default gradients included with GIMP, a user can also create custom gradients with tools provided.

* ''Selections and paths'': in GIMP there are several tools that can be used to create [[selection (user interface)|selection]]s including a rectangular and circular selection tool, free select tool, and fuzzy select tool (also known as magic wand). More advanced selection tools include the select by color tool for selecting contiguous regions of color and the scissors select tool which creates selections semi-automatically between areas of highly contrasting colors. GIMP also supports a quick mask mode where a user can use a brush to paint the area of a selection, visibly this looks like a red colored overlay being added or removed. The foreground select tool is an implementation of [[Simple Interactive Object Extraction]] (SIOX) a method used to perform the extraction of foreground elements, such as a person or a tree in focus. The Paths Tool allows a user to create vectors (also known as [[Bézier curve]]s). Paths can be used to create complex selections around natural curves, paths can also be named, saved, and painted (or "stroked") with brushes, patterns, or various line styles.

* ''Image editing'': there are many tools that can be used for editing images in GIMP. The more common tools include a paint brush, pencil, airbrush, eraser and ink tools used to create new or blended pixels. Tools such as the bucket fill and blend tools are used to change large regions of space in an image and can be used to help blend images. GIMP also has a selection of smart tools, which are tools that use a more complex algorythm to enable a user to do things that otherwise would be time consuming or impossible; these smart tools include the clone tool that copies pixels using a brush, the healing brush which copies pixels from an area and corrects the tone and color where it is being used. The perspective clone tool works in a similar way to the clone tool previously mentioned but also allows a user to correct for distance changes. The blur and sharpen tool is a brush that blurs and sharpens. Finally the dodge and burn tool is a brush that makes target pixels lighter (dodges) or darker (burns).<br />A list of GIMP transform tools include the align tool, move, crop, rotate, scale, shear, perspective and flit tools.
[[File:Layers Channels Paths.gif|thumb |Animation showing three docked and tabbed dialogs: layers, channels, and paths.]]

* ''Layers, layer masks and channels'': an image being edited in GIMP can consist of many [[Layers (digital image editing)|layers]] sitting in a stack. The GIMP user manual suggests that "A good way to visualize a GIMP image is as a stack of transparencies" where in GIMP terminology each transparency is a layer.<ref>{{cite web |author=GIMP documentation team |title=Introduction to layers |url=http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-image-combining.html#gimp-concepts-layers |work=GIMP user manual |publisher=docs.gimp.org |accessdate=2 July 2009}}</ref> Each layer in an image is made up of several channels. In an [[RGB]] image there are normally 3 or 4 channels, each consisting of a red, green and blue channel. Color sublayers look like slightly different gray images, but when put together they make a complete image. The fourth channel that may be part of a layer is the [[alpha channel]] (or layer mask), this channel measures opacity where a whole or part of an image can be completely visible, partially visible or invisible.
<!--

-->Text layers can be created using the text tool, allowing a user to write on an image. Text layers can be transformed in several ways, such as converting it to a path or selection.<ref>{{cite web |author=GIMP documentation team |title=Paths and Text |url=http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/ch07s05s05.html |work=GIMP manual |publisher=gimp.org |accessdate=5 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=GIMP documentation team |title=Text and Fonts |url=http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-concepts-text.html |work=GIMP manual |publisher=gimp.org |accessdate=5 July 2009}}</ref>

* ''Automation, scripts and plug-ins'': GIMP has approximately 150 standard effects and filters, including Drop Shadow, Blur, Motion blur and Noise.<br />GIMP operations can be automated with [[scripting language]]s. The Script-Fu is a [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] based [[extension language]] implemented using [[TinyScheme]], GIMP can also be scripted in [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] (Python-fu), or [[Tcl]].

GIMP has support for several methods of sharpening and blurring images including the blur and sharpen tool. The [[Unsharp masking#Digital unsharp masking|unsharp mask]] tool is used to sharpen an image selectively - it only sharpens areas of an image that are sufficiently detailed. The unsharp mask tool is considered to give more targeted results for photographs than a normal sharpening filter.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sharpening - Unsharp Mask |url=http://www.scantips.com/simple6.html |publisher=www.scantips.com |accessdate=8 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Unsharp Mask |url=http://manual.gimp.org/en/plug-in-unsharp-mask.html |date=2002, 2003<!--, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 -->|work=GIMP manual |publisher=manual.gimp.org |accessdate=8 August 2009}}</ref> The Selective Gaussian Blur tool works in a similar way, except it blurs areas of an image with little detail.

* ''GEGL'': The ''[[GEGL|Generic Graphics Library]]'' (''GEGL'') was first introduced as part of GIMP on the 2.6 release of GIMP. This initial introduction does not yet exploit all of the capabilities of GEGL; as of the 2.6 release GIMP can use GEGL to perform high bit depth color operations, because of this less information is lost when performing color operations.<ref>
{{cite web |author=GIMP development team |title=GIMP 2.6 Release Notes |url=http://gimp.org/release-notes/gimp-2.6.html |publisher=gimp.org |accessdate=2 July 2009}}
</ref> When fully integrated, GEGL will allow GIMP to have a higher color bit depth and also a better non-destructive work-flow.

* ''File formats'': GIMP supports saving and loading a large number of different [[file format]]s,<ref>
{{cite web |title=File formats supported by the GIMP |url=http://www.gimphelp.org/formats.shtml |year=2007 |publisher=gimphelp.org |accessdate=2 July 2009}}</ref> GIMP's native format [[XCF (file format)|XCF]] is designed to store an image including all features specific to GIMP such as layers, channels and vectors; XCF is named after the e''X''perimental ''C''omputing ''F''acility where GIMP was authored.

{|- class="wikitable"
 !Type
 !File formats

 |-
 !Readable and writable
 |GIMP has import/export support for popular image formats such as [[BMP file format|BMP]], [[JPEG]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] and [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]], along with the file formats of several other applications such as [[Autodesk]] flic animations, [[Corel Paint Shop Pro]] images, and Adobe Photoshop documents. Other formats with read/write support include [[PostScript]] documents, [[X Window system|X]] bitmap image and Zsoft [[PCX]]. GIMP can also read and write path information from [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] files and read/write [[ICO (icon image file format)|ICO]] Windows icon files.

 |-
 !Read-only
 |GIMP can import Adobe [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] documents and the [[raw image format]]s used by many [[digital camera]]s, but cannot save to these formats. An open source plug-in, [[UFRaw]], adds full raw compatibility, and has been noted for beating Adobe in updating for new camera models several times.

 |-
 !Write-only
 |GIMP can export to [[Multiple-image Network Graphics|MNG]] layered image files (GNU/Linux version only) and [[HTML]] (as a table with colored cells), [[C (programming language)|C]] source code files (as an array) and [[ASCII art|ASCII Art]] (using a plug-in to represent images with characters and punctuation making up images), though it cannot read these formats.

==Variants==
[[File:gimp 2.2.8 Mac.png|thumb|300px|GIMP 2.2.8 running under [[X11.app|X11]] on [[Mac OS X]]]]
Several variations and derived graphic applications exist today, these applications can exist because GIMP is released under the [[GNU General Public License]]; the GPL specifically allows anybody to take the [[source code]] and use it as they see fit, so long as they follow the rules laid out in the license. GIMP is available on many popular operating systems, even so, some variants of GIMP exist for OS-specific modifications.

The GIMP website only offers source code downloads; executable version of GIMP are made available by other sources.

* ''[[GIMPshop]]'' is a derivative of GIMP that re-arranges the user interface to mimic [[Adobe Photoshop]]. This is achieved by modifying menus and user interface items. GIMPshop is released on Mac OS X, GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows, and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]].  The project is stagnant and has not been updated since 2006.

* ''[[GimPhoto]]'' has a similar aim to GIMPshop, but has been made using a more recent version of GIMP.<ref>
{{cite web |author=zenith |title=GimPhoto - free Photoshop alternative for photo and image editor |url=http://www.gimphoto.com/ |publisher=gimphoto.com |accessdate=2 July 2009}}

* ''GIMP Animation Package'' (''GAP'') is an advanced plug-in for GIMP for creating animations, extending GIMP's normal capabilities. GAP can save animations in several formats including [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] and AVI.<ref>
{{cite web |author=Jakub Steiner |title=Advanced Animations Tutorial |url=http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Advanced_Animations/ |work=GIMP user manual |publisher=the GIMP documentation team |accessdate=2 July 2009}}
</ref> The animation function relies on GIMP's layering capability. Animations are created by placing each image on its own layer (in other words, treating each layer as an animation cel), then then placing and rotating the layers within time constraints. The resulting project can be saved as an animated GIF or encoded video file. GAP also provides programmed layer transitions, timing, and move paths, allowing the creation of sophisticated animations.

* ''GIMP Paint Studio'' (''GPS'') is a collection of brushes and accompanying tool presets for GIMP aimed at artists and graphic designers. It speeds up repetitive tasks and allows tool settings to be saved between sessions.<ref name="gps-google-code">

* ''[[Instrumented GIMP]]'' was created at the [[University of Waterloo]] to track and report user interaction with the program to generate statistics about how GIMP is used.

==Mascot==
[[File:GIMPLogo.png|thumb|Wilber, the [[mascot]] of GIMP]]
The official [[mascot]] of GIMP, Wilber was created by Tuomas Kuosmanen (''tigert'') at some point before 25 September 1997; since then Wilber has received additional accessories from other GIMP developers.<ref name="gimp-linking">
[http://www.gimp.org/about/linking.html GIMP - linking to us]. For Wilber kit see <code>/docs/Wilber_Construction_Kit.xcf.gz</code>
</ref> Accessories for Wilber can be found in the ''Wilber construction kit'', included with the GIMP source code.<ref name="gimp-linking" />

Wilber is also used as a free software cultural reference outside of GIMP, for example Wilber can be played as a racing car driver in [[SuperTuxKart]] along with other free software cultural icons.<ref>[http://mac.softpedia.com/progChangelog/SuperTuxKart-Changelog-24037.html SuperTuxKart changelog, see 0.6]</ref> In addition to being referenced  in other software projects, Wilber has been shown on the side of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] as part of [[Project Blinkenlights]].<ref>

==Development==
GIMP is primarily developed by volunteers, however, the GIMP project has a development branch, unstable branches and stable branches. New features are added to the development branch of GIMP, when the developers decide that there are enough new features they begin the process of creating a release. The process starts off by creating an unstable branch from the development branch; this unstable branch will be stabilized and will receive bug-fixes until it is ready to replace the existing stable branch. GIMP has adopted a scheme also used by many other [[free and open source software|FOSS]] projects: the second number in a version (for example, the "6" in 2.6.11) denotes whether a GIMP release is stable or unstable.  An odd number means an unstable version and an even number means a stable version. The final number represents the number of bug-fix releases after a stable or unstable branch is released. {{As of|2010|10}}, the current stable version of GIMP is 2.6.11.

Each year GIMP applies for several positions in the [[Google Summer of Code]] (GSoC),<ref name="gimp-gsoc">

</ref> From 2006 to 2009 there have been 9 GSoC projects that have been listed as successful,<ref name="gimp-gsoc" /> although not all successful projects have been merged into GIMP yet. The healing brush and perspective clone tools and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] bindings were created as part of the 2006 GSoC and can be used in the current version of GIMP, although there were three other projects that were completed and are not yet available in a stable version of GIMP; those projects being Vector Layers, a [[JPEG 2000]] plug-in. Several projects were completed in 2008, but none are yet a part of a stable release of GIMP.

====Libre Graphics Meetings====
{{Main|Libre Graphics Meeting}}
The Libre Graphics Meeting (LGM) is a yearly event where developers of GIMP and other projects meet up to discuss issues related to free and open source graphics software. The GIMP developers take the opportunity to hold [[Birds of a Feather (computing)|birds of a feather]] (BOF) sessions at this event.

====Distribution====
GIMP is released as [[source code]] under the [[GNU General Public License]] as [[free software]].<ref>
{{cite web
 |title=GNU General Public License

</ref> The current version of GIMP works with numerous operating systems, including [[GNU]]/[[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]] and Microsoft Windows. Many GNU/Linux distributions include GIMP as a part of their desktop operating systems, including [[Debian]]  and [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]]. Due to file size constraints, [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] no longer includes GIMP by default as of Ubuntu 10.04, but it remains available for installation via the package manager.

A port of GIMP to Microsoft Windows was started by Tor Lillqvist in 1997. The GIMP website links to binary installers compiled by Jernej Simončič for the platform.<ref>{{cite web |title=GIMP - Windows installers |url=http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/ |publisher=The gimp-win project |accessdate=2 July 2009}}</ref> MacPorts is listed as the recommended provider of recent Mac builds of GIMP,<ref>
{{cite web |title=GIMP for Mac OS X |url=http://www.gimp.org/macintosh/ GIMP download/Macintosh |date=2001-2009 |publisher=The GIMP Project |accessdate=2 July 2009}}
</ref> MacPorts also provides builds of other [[free and open source software]] applications and provides tools to make doing so simpler.<ref>
{{cite web |title=The MacPorts Project -- Home |url=http://www.macports.org/ |date=2002–2009 |publisher=MacPorts |accessdate=2 July 2009}}
</ref> Mac OS X can optionally use an X11 server; GTK+ was originally designed to run on an X11 server, as such porting GIMP to Mac OS X was much simpler than creating a Windows port.

There is no stable 64-bit Windows distribution version of GIMP available as of December 2009, although there have been experimental 64-bit versions like GIMP 2.6.8 for Windows.<ref>{{cite web |title=GIMP 2.6.8 for Win64 |url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/gimp-win/files/GIMP%20%2B%20GTK%2B%20%28stable%20release%29/GIMP%202.6.8%20%2B%20GTK%2B%202.16.6/gimp-2.6.8-x64-setup.exe/download |date=2009-12-10 |accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref>
