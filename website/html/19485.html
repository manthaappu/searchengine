<html> <head> <title>JAMA (numerical linear algebra library)</title></head><body>'''JAMA''' is a [[software library]] for performing numerical [[linear algebra]] tasks created at [[NIST]] similar in functionality to [[LAPACK]].  Versions exist for both [[C++]] and the [[Java programming language]].  The C++ version uses the [[Template Numerical Toolkit]] for lower-level operations.  The Java version provides the lower-level operations itself.  The main capabilities provided by JAMA are:
* [[Eigensystem]] solving
* [[LU decomposition]]
* [[Singular value decomposition]]
* [[QR decomposition]]
* [[Cholesky decomposition]]

JAMA is in the public domain.
