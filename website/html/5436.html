'''Thomson Canopus Co., Ltd.''' was a manufacturer of [[video editing card]]s and [[video editing software]]. The company's focus shifted from enthusiast video cards to other areas of video hardware and software after the release of their Spectra line of products.<ref>[http://www.firingsquad.com/guides/tnt2buyers/page16.asp Firingsquad's TNT2 Buyer's Guide: What Happened to Canopus]</ref> Some of their previous competitors included [[Matrox]] and [[Pinnacle Systems]]. In 2005 Canopus was acquired by [[Thomson SA|Thomson Multimedia]] in order to bolster their [[Grass Valley (company)|Grass Valley]] broadcasting and network business.<ref>[http://www.thomsongrassvalley.com/news/2005/20051205-Canopus.html Thomson Buys 33 1/3% Stake in HD Video Editing Leader Canopus, Intends to Launch Public Tender Offer to Acquire Remaining Shares]</ref>

When [[3dfx]]'s Voodoo series of PC-gaming-oriented 3D graphics cards became popular in the mid-1990s, Canopus was well-known for producing the Pure3D, a Voodoo-based graphics card with 6MB of memory instead of the standard 4MB. When the Voodoo 2 was released, the Canopus Pure3D II was praised for the fact that their cards were shorter than competitors' Voodoo 2 cards.  Canopus also had a reputation for driver optimization, giving them a performance advantage over the other cards.  They were the cards of choice for Maximum PC's 1998 Dream Machine.

Canopus also released a version of the nVidia TNT that offered a unique internal cable to connect the TNT card to the Voodoo2 based Pure3D II, as opposed to the standard connection with an external cable.

The '''Canopus DVStorm2''' was a realtime [[video editing card]], discontinued by Canopus  in early 2005.

Canopus is also known for [[Edius|EDIUS]], [[non-linear editing system|non-linear]] [[video editing software]].

Canopus also manufactures [[ProCoder]], software used for encoding MPEGs.  However Canopus has been criticized for declining to provide its users with replacement keys [http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Canopus_ProCoder].
