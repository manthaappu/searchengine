{{nihongo|'''''The Anatomy of Dependence'''''|甘えの構造|''Amae no kōzō''}} is a non-fiction book written by [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[psychoanalyst]] [[Takeo Doi]]. It was originally published in Japanese in 1971, and an English translation by [[John Bester]] was later published in 1973.

The book describes at length Doi's concept of ''[[amae]]'', which he describes as a uniquely Japanese need to be in good favor with, and be able to depend on, the people around oneself. He likens this to behaving childishly in the assumption that parents will indulge you (Doi 2001:16), and claims that the ideal relationship is that of the parent-child, and all other relationships should strive for this degree of closeness (Doi 2001:39).

==Criticism==

Doi's work has been criticized as being anecdotal and full of inaccuracies. (See Dale, P 1986 The Myth of Japanese Uniqueness, Mouer and Sugimoto 1986, 1982, Kubota 1999)
