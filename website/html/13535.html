<html> <head> <title>File shadowing</title></head><body>There are several different technologies that use the term '''file shadowing''', but the intent of file shadowing within these technologies is to provide an exact copy (or [[Mirror (computing)|mirror]] of a set of data).  

For file shadowing to be effective, the shadow needs to exist in a separate physical location than the original data.  Depending on the [[Mirror (computing)#Reasons|reasons]] behind the shadow operation, this location may be as close as a second harddrive in the same chassis or as far away as the other side of the globe.
