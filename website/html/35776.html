'''Steve Wilhite''' of [[CompuServe]] invented the [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] file format which went on to become the [[de facto standard]] for 8-bit images on the [[Internet]] until the late 1990s.{{citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Steve Wilhite remained on the [[CompuServe]]/[[AOL]] payroll into the first decade of the 21st century working on a variety of CompuServe systems.  These included CompuServe's wire protocol for their [[graphical user interface|GUI]] clients in the 1980s, new service features in the early 1990s, web chat software in the late 1990s, and investigating web community models until his departure after being disabled by a [[stroke]].{{citation needed|date=October 2009}} He has since recovered.

Wilhite's name comes up frequently in debate over the pronunciation of the GIF acronym.{{citation needed|date=October 2009}} Steve Wilhite always used the pronunciation that sounds like Jif peanut butter and if asked would usually reply "Choosy programmers choose 'jif'."
