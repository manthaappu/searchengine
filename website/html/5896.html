'''Character Map''' is a utility included with [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating systems]] and is used to view the characters in any installed [[font]], to check what keyboard input ([[Windows Alt keycodes|Alt code]]) is used to enter those characters, and to copy characters to the [[clipboard]] in lieu of typing them. The tool is usually useful for entering ''[[special characters]]''.

The ''Advanced view'' check box can be used to inspect the character sets in a font according to different [[Character encoding|encodings]] ([[Windows code page|code pages]]), including [[Unicode]] code ranges, to locate particular characters by their Unicode [[Universal Character Set|code point]] and to search for characters by their Unicode name. For Unicode fonts, the characters can be grouped by their ''Unicode subrange''. Although the Unicode standard already extends character field to plane 16 and many fonts e.g. [[Ming (typeface)|MingLiU-ExtB]] begin to support higher ranges, this tool still only supports code points on [[basic multilingual plane|plane 0]] (between U+0000 and U+FFFF). Additionally, it does not display certain characters in that range though for reasons unexplained.
