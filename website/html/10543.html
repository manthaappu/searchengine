'''DirSync Pro''' is an [[open source]] [[File synchronization|synchronization]] and [[backup]] utility for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]] and every other [[OS]] which runs [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. ''DirSync Pro'' is based on the program 'Directory Synchronize (DirSync)' which was first released in February 2003 by E. Gerber. It was developed afterwards by himself, Frank Gerbig and T. Groetzner. ''DirSync Pro'' is officially born in July 2008, based on a branch of the Directory Synchronize (DirSync) code. Many parts of ''DirSync Pro'' have gone through major rewriting and redesign ever since.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dirsyncpro.org/news.html|title=DirSync Pro release notes|publisher=DirSync Pro |accessdate=2009-09-22}}</ref>

''DirSync Pro'' offers a [[graphical user interface]] from which the user can manage and run multiple synchronization tasks.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mathews |first=Lee |url=http://www.downloadsquad.com/2009/05/12/open-source-dirsync-pro-syncs-folders-on-any-platform/ |title=Open source DirSync Pro syncs folders on any platform |publisher=Downloadsquad.com |date=2009-05-12 |accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref> As of version 1.31, it supports local folder to folder synchronization, but does not support synchronization via [[FTP]] yet. The application is self-contained within its own directory, and is therefore fully [[Portable application|portable]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Fitzpatrick |first=Jason |url=http://lifehacker.com/5259214/dirsync-pro-keeps-your-files-synchronized |title=DirSync Pro Keeps Your Files Synchronized - synchronization |publisher=Lifehacker |date= |accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref>

''DirSync Pro'' makes it possible to compare a couple of directories and synchronize their content. It can be used to create incremental backups. The synchronization could be setup to mirror a directory into another one (mono-directional/one way) or synchronize the content of two directories into each other (bi-directional/two way).

''DirSync Pro'' provides the following predefined synchronzation modes:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dirsyncpro.org/features.html|title=DirSync Pro features |publisher=DirSync Pro |accessdate=2009-09-18}}</ref>
* Synchronize A -> B (incremental): This mode makes a shadow of directory A in B. Only new and modified files are copied from A to B.
* Synchronize B -> A (incremental): This mode makes a shadow of directory B in A. Only new and modified files are copied from B to A.
* Synchronize A <-> B (incremental): This mode mirrors directories A and B to each other. Only new and modified files are copied.
* Backup A -> B (full): This mode makes a full copy of directory A into directory B. All files are copied.
* Restore B -> A (full): This mode makes a full copy of directory B into directory A. All files are copied.
* Contribute A -> B: This mode copies only the new files from directory A into directory B. Modified files are left away.
* Contribute B -> A: This mode copies only the new files from directory B into directory A. Modified files are left away.
* Synchronize A -> B (custom): This is a custom mode to synchronize directory A into directory B mode in which all advanced options could be set up to the users need.
* Synchronize B -> A (custom): This is a custom mode to synchronize directory B into directory A mode in which all advanced options could be set up to the users need.

When synchronizing bi-directionally (two way), ''DirSync Pro'' detects synchronization conflicts. These conflicts may occur if a file is edited in both directories independently. ''DirSync Pro'' offers these options to solve the bi-directional synchronization conflict:
* Copy the latest modified file to both directories.
* Copy the largest modified file to both directories.
* Rename and copy both files to both directories.
* Do nothing and warn the user so he decide himself.

[[Linux.com]] rated the application positively, saying that "it makes defining a bidirectional sync as simple as picking two directories".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.linux.com/feature/154149 |title=Bidirectional filesystem syncing - DirSync Pro vs. Unison |publisher=Linux.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref> Likewise, [[freshmeat]] calls it a "powerful, easy-to-configure tool to synchronize the contents of one directory with another".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://freshmeat.net/projects/dirsyncpro |title=DirSync Pro |publisher=freshmeat.net |date= |accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref>
