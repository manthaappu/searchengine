<html> <head> <title>NSW Photo Card</title></head><body>[[Image:NSW Photo Card.jpg|right|thumb|NSW Photo Card, front (top) back (bottom). Holographic, plastic coated card.]]The '''NSW Photo Card''' is a voluntary card provided by the [[Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales]] [[Australia]], for people who do not hold a current NSW [[driver licence]] or learner licence (16 year olds), or other form of photo identification, to help them show who they are. It is credit-card sized and bears the cardholderâ€™s photo, signature, name, address, date of birth, gender and organ donor status. NSW residents over 16 years who do not hold a current NSW driver licence can apply for the card. The card currently cost $44<ref>[http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/licensing/licensingfees.html NSW Licensing Fees]</ref> ([[AUD]]) from any of the 129 Motor Registries Offices across NSW.

The NSW Photo Card replaced the RTAs 'proof of age' card in 14 December 2005. Until that time there was no ID card for over 25s. RTAs 'proof of age' card could only be issued to adults between 18 and 25 years of age meaning that any one over 25 could not obtain ID from the RTA unless they sat and qualified for some form of Drivers licence.

The NSW Photo Card can also be obtained even if the individual had an RTA business restriction in place.

The NSW Photo Card is just a photo id card to provide name, address and age for identification reasons and should not be confused with an [[Australian national identity card]] program, which has been proposed, but still does not exist.
