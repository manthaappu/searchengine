<html> <head> <title>Squad Mission Support System</title></head><body>'''Squad Mission Support System''' is an unmanned all terrain wheel vehicle being developed by [[Lockheed Martin]].

==History==
The SMSS is being developed for the [[US Army]] as transport and logistics support by [[Lockheed Martin]] Missiles and Fire Control division.

The SMSS can travel up to 25 miles/h and carry up to 1000 pounds in gear.

Unloaded, the SMSS weight up to 2000 pounds and can be parachuted from an [[aircraft]].

The SMSS can be driven by an operator or remotely operated. Currently the SMSS is unarmed, but there are plans to arm it with either [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]] or small [[missile]] systems.

No SMSS are in service as of yet.  Testing is expected to begin in Afghanistan sometime in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1884169,00.html?iid=tsmodule|title=Army Robots: Will Humans Still Be in Control?|quote=Meanwhile, the mountainous terrain and high altitudes of Afghanistan have led the Army to increasingly emphasize rapid delivery of anything that can lighten a soldier's load. As a result, the U.S. Army Infantry Center at Fort Benning, Ga., is experimenting with a 4,000-lb, six-wheeled semiautonomous, supply-carrying robot vehicle called the Squad Mission Support System (SMSS), which will likely head to the mountains of Afghanistan for testing sometime next year.|author=[[Kris Osborn]]|date=2009-03-15|work=[[Time magazine]]|language=English|accessdate=2009-03-16}}</ref>
