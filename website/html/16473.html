The '''Height-Velocity diagram''' or '''H/V curve''' is a [[graphics|graph]] charting the safe/unsafe flight profiles relevant to a specific [[helicopter]]. As operation outside the safe area of the chart can be [[death|fatal]] in the event of a power or transmission failure it is sometimes referred to as the '''dead man's curve''' or '''Coffin Corner''' by helicopter [[aviator|pilots]].

In the simplest explanation, the H/V curve is a [[diagram]] where the shaded areas should be avoided, as the average pilot may be unable to complete an [[Autorotation_(helicopter)|autorotation]] landing without damage. The H/V curve will usually contain a take-off profile, where the diagram can be traversed from 0 height and 0 speed to cruise, without entering the shaded areas or with minimum exposure to shaded areas.  

The portion in the upper left of this diagram demonstrates a flight profile which will likely not allow the pilot to successfully complete an autorotation, primarily due to having insufficient airspeed to enter an autorotative profile in time to avoid a crash.  The shaded area on the lower right is dangerous due to the airspeed and proximity to the ground resulting in dramatically reduced [[reaction time]] for the pilot in the case of [[mechanical failure]], or other in-flight [[emergency|emergencies]].  This shaded area at the lower right is not portrayed in H/V curves for multiengine helicopters capable of safely hovering and flying with a single engine failure.

The following examples further illustrate the relevance of the H/V curve to a single engine helicopter.

At low [[height]]s with low [[airspeed]], such as a [[hover taxi]], the pilot can simply cushion the [[landing]] with collective, converting [[Angular momentum|rotational inertia]] to [[Lift (force)|lift]].  The [[aircraft]] is in a safe part of the H/V curve.  At the extreme end of the scale (say a three-foot hover taxi at walking pace) even a complete failure to recognise the power loss resulting in an un-cushioned landing would probably be survivable.

As the airspeed increases without an increase in height, there comes a point where the pilot's reaction time would be insufficient to react with a [[flare_(aviation)|flare]] in time to prevent a high-speed, and thus probably fatal, ground impact.  Even small increases in height give the pilot much greater time to react, thus the bottom right part of the H/V curve is usually a shallow [[gradient]].  If above ideal autorotation speed, the pilot's instinct is usually to flare to convert speed to height and increase rotor RPM through [[coning]]; which also immediately gets them out of the dead man's curve.

Conversely, an increase in height without a corresponding increase in airspeed will put the aircraft above a survivable un-cushioned impact height, and eventually above a height where rotor inertia can be converted to sufficient lift to enable a survivable landing.  This occurs abruptly with airspeeds much below the ideal autorotative speed (typically 40-80 [[Knot (speed)|knots]]).  The pilot must have enough [[time]] to [[acceleration|accelerate]] to autorotation speed in order to be able to successfully autorotate; this directly relates to a requirement for height.  Above a certain height the pilot can achieve autorotation speed even from a 0-knot start, thus putting "high hovers" outside the curve.

The typical safe takeoff profile will involve initiation of forward flight from a low hover, only gaining height as airspeed approaches a safe autorotative speed but keeping above the lower right area of the H/V curve.
