'''SigmaQuad - Quad Data Rate SRAM''' is a type of static [[RAM]] computer memory that can transfer up to four [[word (computing)|word]]s of data in each clock cycle. Like [[Double Data-Rate]] (DDR) [[SDRAM]], SigmaQuad SRAM transfers data on both [[Clock edge|rising and falling edges]] of the [[clock signal]]. This requires more wires between the memory device and the [[memory controller]], but doubles the theoretical maximum data transfer rate. SigmaQuad SRAM uses two clocks, one for read data and one for write data. This helps to eliminate problems caused by the propagation delay of the clock wiring, and allows concurrent reads and writes, thereby doubling the transfer rate again.

SigmaQuad SRAM was designed for high-speed communications and networking applications, where data [[throughput]] is more important than cost, power efficiency or density. The technology was a joint development by [http://www.gsitechnology.com GSI Technology], [http://products.sel.sony.com/semi/ Sony Microelectronics] and [http://www.issi.com/index.html ISSI].

== Clock Inputs ==
Clocks:
#Input clock: K, /K 
#Output clock: C, /C

== Control Inputs ==
Control Lines:
#not-Write enable: /WPS 
#not-Read enable: /RPS

== Buses ==
Address and Data Buses:
#Address bus 
#Data in bus 
#Data out bus

== Clocking scheme ==
Address Clock 
#Read address latched on rising edge of K 
#Write address latched on rising edge of K 

Write Data Clock
If /WPS is low 
#A data word on Data In is latched on rising edge of K 
#The next data word on Data In is latched on rising edge of /K 

Read Data Clock
A read is a two-cycle process 
#If /RPS is low 
#The first rising edge of K latches the read address, A 
#The second rising edge of K puts the data word, from address A, on the Data Out bus 
#The next rising edge of /K puts the next data word, from address A+1, on the Data Out bus
