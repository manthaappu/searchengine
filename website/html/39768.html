{{lowercase|title=wait}}
In [[computing]], '''<code>wait</code>''' is a [[command (computing)|command]] which pauses until execution of a [[Background (computer software)|background process]] has ended.

==Usage==
<source lang="bash">
 wait [n]
</source>

where '''n''' is the [[process identifier|pid]] or [[Job control (Unix)#Job ID|job ID]] of a currently executing background process (job). If '''n''' is not given, the command waits until all jobs known to the invoking shell have terminated.

'''wait''' normally returns the [[exit status]] of the last job which terminated. It may also return 127 in the event that '''n''' specifies a non-existent job or zero if there were no jobs to wait for.

Because <code>wait</code> needs to be aware of the job table of the current shell execution environment, it is usually implemented as a [[shell builtin]].

==Example==
This command can be useful where part of a script can execute in parallel to implement a barrier where an upcoming section depends on the successful completion of the preceding sections.

The following example will fetch the '''src/''' directory from a machine named '''iona''' using [[rsync]] and simultaneously update the libraries on which this program depends, before building the combination.

<source lang="bash">
#!/bin/bash

# Parallel update script which makes use of the wait command

# Update local copy
rsync iona:src/ . &
# Upgrade required libraries, or exit indicating failure if make failed for some reason
make -C lib || exit 1

# Wait for rsync to terminate (may have already happened) and finish the job, unless rsync failed
wait && make
</source>
