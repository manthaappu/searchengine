== Prediction Suffix Tree ==


The concept of the [[Markov chain]] of order L, which we essentially owe to the Russian
mathematician [[Andrey Markov|Andrej Andreevic Markov]] (1907), has two drawbacks. First, the number of
parameters of the model grows exponentially with the order L of the chain. This brings about
computational and storage problems during implementation, including for limited memory length
L. 

An improvement initially put forward by (Rissanen - 1983) and used particularly in compression
data (Weinberger - 1992, Willems - 1995) was the [[Variable Length Markov chain]] (Buhlmann -
1999). This model can be represented by a tree, known as '''Prediction Suffix Tree''' â€“ PST (Ron -
1996), certain branches of which are depth L and others of an inferior depth to L, whereas the
[[Markov chain of order L]] corresponds to a complete tree of depth L. By reducing the storage cost,
pruning the branches of the tree will enable us to increase the order of the model and, thereby
improve performance.
