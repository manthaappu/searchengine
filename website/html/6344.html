'''cksum''' is a command in [[Unix-like]] operating systems that generates a [[checksum]] value for a file or stream of data. The cksum command reads the file or files specified as arguments, or [[Standard streams|standard input]] if no arguments are provided, and calculates a checksum value, [[cyclic redundancy check]] (CRC) and the [[byte]] count. The checksum, number of bytes, and file name are written to [[Standard streams|standard output]].

The cksum command can be used to verify the equality of two files on different computers, such as a copy made over noisy transmission lines.<ref>[http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/cksum-invocation.html GNU cksum manual page available with most Unix-like distributions; invoked via man cksum]</ref>.  (If the files are on the same computer, equality can be verified with the [[cmp (Unix)|cmp]] command.) The comparison made by the cksum command is not [[Cryptography|cryptographically]] secure. However, it is unlikely that an accidentally damaged file will produce the same checksum as the original file.

== Interoperability ==

The standard cksum command, as found on most UNIX-like OS (including GNU/Linux, *BSD, Mac OS X, and Solaris) uses a CRC algorithm based on the [[ethernet]] standard frame check and is therefore interoperable between implementations. This is in contrast to the [[Sum (Unix)|sum command]], which is not as interoperable. On [[Tru64]] operating systems, the cksum command returns a different CRC value, unless the [[environment variable]] <code>CMD_ENV</code> is set to “<code>xpg4</code>”.

== Syntax ==

<source lang="bash">
 cksum [ File ... ]
</source>

==Usage example==
<source lang="bash">
 $ cksum test.txt
 4038471504 75 test.txt
 $
</source>

"4038471504" represents the checksum value.  "75" represents the file size of test.txt.
