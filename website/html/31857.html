<html> <head> <title>Representational theory of mind</title></head><body>The '''representational theory of mind''' is the prevailing [[Philosophical theory|theory]] attempting to [[explanation|explain]] the nature of [[idea]]s, [[concept]]s and other mental content in [[contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] [[philosophy of mind]], [[cognitive science]] and [[experimental psychology]]. According to the representational theory of mind, [[thinking]] occurs within an internal system of representation. The [[propositional attitude]]s of the mind are [[Type-token distinction|token]] [[mental representation]]s (i.e., mental particulars with [[semantics|semantic]] properties).

For example, when someone arrives at the belief that his or her floor needs sweeping, the representational theory of mind states that he or she forms a mental representation, one that represents the floor and its state of cleanliness. What makes this representation a [[belief]] is its [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functional]] role; it plays a function in mental processes in the way that is characteristic of beliefs. Desires and other types of attitudes have their own distinctive functional roles.<ref>''The Ontology of Conceptsâ€”Abstract Objects or Mental Representations?'', Eric Margolis and Stephen Laurence</ref>

In contrast to theories of naive or [[direct realism]], the representational theory of mind postulates the actual existence of [[mental representation]]s which act as intermediaries between the [[observation|observing]] subject and the [[object (philosophy)|objects]], processes or other entities observed in the external world. These intermediaries stand for or represent to the mind the objects of that world.

The original or "classical" representational theory probably can be traced back to [[Thomas Hobbes]] and was a dominant theme in classical [[empiricism]] in general. According to this version of the theory, the mental representations were images (often called "ideas") of the objects of states of affairs represented. For modern adherents, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Steven Pinker]] and many others, the representational system consists rather of an internal [[language of thought]]. The contents of thoughts are represented in symbolic structures (the formulas of Mentalese) which, analogously to natural languages but on a much more abstract level, possess a [[syntax]] and [[semantics]] very much like those of natural languages.
