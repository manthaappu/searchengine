On [[POSIX]]-compliant platforms, '''SIGBUS''' is the [[Signal (computing)|signal]] sent to a [[process (computing)|process]] when it causes a [[bus error]]. The [[C_preprocessor|symbolic constant]] for SIGBUS is defined in the [[header file]] <code>[[signal.h]]</code>. Symbolic signal names are used because signal numbers can vary across platforms.

==Etymology==
''SIG'' is a common [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] for signal names. ''BUS'' refers to the [[data bus]] in the context of a [[bus error]].

==Usage==
Computer programs may throw SIGBUS for improper memory handling:
; Invalid address alignment: The program has attempted to read or write data that does not fit the CPU's memory-alignment rules.
; Non-existent physical address: This is equivalent to a [[segmentation fault]], but for a physical address rather than a virtual address.
; Object-specific hardware error: This is far less common, but it is present in [[Linux]] and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], when virtual memory pages have disappeared (e.g. accessing an [[mmap]]ed file which has been truncated.)<ref>http://groups.google.com/group/comp.unix.internals/browse_thread/thread/6369e8f923aedcb0/54f8ed15e326dc0</ref>

For further discussion, see ''[[bus error]]''.

The [[operating system]] may inform the application of the nature of the error using the [[signal stack]], which developers can use to [[debug]] their programs or handle errors.

The default action for a program upon receiving '''SIGBUS''' is abnormal termination. This will end the [[Process (computing)|process]], but may generate a [[core file]] to aid debugging, or other platform dependent action.

SIGBUS can be handled (caught). That is, applications can request what action they want to occur. Examples of such action might be ignoring it, calling a [[subroutine|function]], or restoring the default action. In some circumstances, ignoring '''SIGBUS''' results in [[undefined behaviour]].

An example of an application that might handle SIGBUS is a [[debugger]], which might check the signal stack and inform the [[Software developer|developer]] of what happened, and where the program terminated.

SIGBUS is usually generated by the [[operating system]], but users with appropriate permissions can use the <code>kill</code> [[system call]] or [[Kill (Unix)|kill]] command (a [[userland]] program, or sometimes a [[Operating system shell|shell builtin]]) to send the signal to a process at will.
