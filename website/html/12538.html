<html> <head> <title>Eugen Pavel</title></head><body>'''Dr. Eugen Pavel''' is a [[Romania]]n scientist and the inventor of the ''[[Hyper CD-ROM]]'', a [[3D optical data storage]] medium with a claimed initial capacity of 10 [[Terabyte|TB]] and with a theoretical capacity of 1 [[Petabyte|PB]]<ref name=cdfreaks>[http://www.cdfreaks.com/news/10000-GB-can-be-stored-on-one-Hyper-CD-ROM.html cdfreaks.com's translation of a Romanian article on the Hyper CD-ROM]</ref> on a single disc. It is considered by some to be the next revolution in [[computer storage]].

Dr. Pavel graduated with a [[physics]] [[Bachelor's degree|degree]] from the [[University of Bucharest]] in [[1976]].<ref name=hypercd>[http://www.dntb.ro/users/frdbuc/hyper-cdrom/hyper.htm  Hyper CD-ROM: Three Dimensional Optical Memory with Fluorescent Photosensitive Glass]</ref> He was awarded the [[Romanian Academy]] Prize in [[1991]] and obtained his [[doctorate]] in Physics from the Romanian Institute of Atomic Physics in [[1992]].<ref name=tripod>[http://ponteuxin.tripod.com/science.html  The Center of Excellence for Advanced Technologies "Euro-Asia"] ''The [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]] era sets - the Pavel era begins.''</ref>

He won the "Prix International de lâ€™Organisation Mondiale de la Presse Periodique" and a gold medal at the November [[1999]] [[EUREKA]] Contest in [[Brussels]] for inventions that led to the creation of the ''Hyper CD-ROM''. Dr. Pavel has published more than 40 books and articles, and he is the holder of 62 patents and patent applications.<ref name=hypercd/>

In an interview about his work on the Hyper CD-ROM, Dr. Pavel stated that "the research for this project is 100% personal, (and) so is the support for experiments." (English translation of quote originally published in [[Romanian language|Romanian]])<ref name=cdfreaks/>

Dr. Pavel's Hyper CD-ROM technology is patented in 21 countries: the USA, Canada, Japan, Israel and 17 European states.<ref name=hypercd/>
USA company [[Constellation 3D]]  announced on June 7, 2000 a similar optical storage media under the name ''[[Fluorescent Multilayer Disc]]''<ref name=pcworld>[http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,31724-page,1/article.html "Hyper CD-ROM Packs Terabytes"] [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]], 12 October 2000</ref>
Recently ''Hyper CD-ROM'' was reported again <ref name=ourpicks>[http://www.our-picks.com/archives/2006/12/07/the-future-of-discs-100tb-cds/ The future of discs: 10TB CDs] News article, 7 December 2006</ref> but it is not clear what progress has been made since first announcement in 2000.
