<html> <head> <title>Hardness of approximation</title></head><body>In [[computer science]], '''hardness of approximation''' is a field  that studies the complexity of finding near-optimal solutions to optimization problems. It complements the study of [[approximation algorithm]]s by proving, for certain problems, a limit on the factors with which their solution can be efficiently approximated. Typically such limits show a factor of approximation beyond which a problem becomes NP-hard, implying that finding a polynomial time approximation for the problem is impossible unless [[P=NP]]. Some hardness of approximation results, however, are based on other hypotheses, a notable one among which is the [[unique games conjecture]].

Since the early 1970s it was known that many optimization problems could not be solved in [[polynomial time]] unless [[NP=P]], but in many of these problems the optimal solution could be efficiently approximated to a certain degree. In the early 1990s, with the development of [[PCP (complexity)|PCP]] theory, it became clear that there is a limit to the approximability of many of these optimization problems: for many optimization problems there is a threshold beyond which they are [[NP-hard]] to approximate. Hardness of approximation theory deals with studying the approximation threshold of such problems.
