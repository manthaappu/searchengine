'''MOLCAS''' is an [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio]] [[computational chemistry]] program, developed at [[Lund University]] in collaboration with  others.<ref>[http://www.molcas.org MOLCAS]</ref> Focus in the program is placed on methods for calculating general [[electronic structure]]s in [[molecule|molecular systems]] in both [[ground state|ground]] and [[excited state]]s. MOLCAS is, in particular, designed to study the potential surfaces of excited states. The current version of MOLCAS is 7.4. Version 7.2 was reviewed in the [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]].<ref> [http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja900300h JACS review of MOLCAS]</ref>

The program covers a wide range of features, including:<ref> [http://www.teokem.lu.se/molcas/features.html MOLCAS features]</ref> 
* Ab initio [[Hartree-Fock]], [[Density functional theory|DFT]], second order [[MÃ¸ller-Plesset perturbation theory]], [[Multi-configurational self-consistent field|MCSCF]], [[Multireference configuration interaction|MRCI]], [[Coupled cluster|CC]] , [[Multiconfigurational reference 2nd order perturbation theory|CASPT2]] wavefunctions and energies
* Analytic gradient geometry optimization based on HF, DFT, CASSCF, and RASSCF wavefunctions
* [[Cholesky decomposition|CD]] and [[Resolution of Identity|RI]] techniques for HF, DFT, CASSCF, CC, MBPT2, and CASPT2.
* On-the-fly auxiliary basis function technique, [[atomic CD|aCD]] and [[atomic compact CD|acCD]].
* CD/RI gradients for "pure" DFT functionals.
* Numerical gradient geometry optimization based on CASPT2 wavefunctions
* Excited state energies for all wavefunctions, and excited optimized geometries from state averaged CASSCF wavefunctions
* Transition properties in excited states calculated at the CASSCF/RASSCF level, using a unique RASSCF State Interaction Method
* Solvent effects can be treated by the Onsager spherical cavity model or [[Polarizable continuum model]] (PCM)
* Combined QM and [[molecular mechanics]] calculations for systems such as proteins and molecular clusters
* The NEMO procedure for creating intermolecular force fields for MC/MD simulations; these force fields include electrostatics, induction, dispersion, and exchange-repulsion terms, and are based on calculations for individual molecules
* The Molcas INput Generator (MING) is a GUI for alternative graphical generation of MOLCAS input
