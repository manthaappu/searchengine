Ribbon diagrams are generated by interpolating a smooth curve through the [[polypeptide]] backbone. [[Alpha_helix|α-helices]] are shown as coiled ribbons or thick tubes, [[Beta_strand|β-strands]] as arrows, and lines or thin tubes for random coils. The direction of the [[Peptide|polypeptide chain]] may be indicated by a colour ramp along the length of the ribbon.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.danforthcenter.org/smith/molview/over/overview.html |first=Thomas J. |last=Smith |title=Displaying and Analyzing Atomic Structures on the Macintosh |date=October 27, 2005 }}</ref>

Ribbon diagrams are simple, yet powerful, in expressing the visual basics of a molecular structure (twist, fold and unfold). This method has successfully portrayed the overall organization of the protein structure, reflecting its 3-dimensional information, and allowing for better understanding of a complex object both by the expert structural biologists and also by other scientists, students<ref>{{Citation |first=D.

==History==

Originally conceived by [[Jane S. Richardson]] in 1980 (influenced by some earlier individual illustrations, e.g., see<ref name="earlyRib" />), her hand-drawn ribbon diagrams were the first schematics of 3D protein structure to be produced systematically,<ref name="MethEnz">{{Citation |last=Richardson |first=Jane S. |title=Schematic Drawings of Protein Structures |journal=Methods in Enzymology |volume=115 |pages=359–380 |year=1985 |doi=10.1016/0076-6879(85)15026-3 |pmid=3853075 }}.</ref><ref name="earlyRib">{{Citation |last=Richardson |first=Jane S. |title=Early ribbon drawings of proteins |journal=Nature Structural Biology |volume=7 |issue=8 |pages=624–625 |year=2000 |doi=10.1038/77912 |pmid=10932243 }}.</ref> to illustrate a classification of protein structures for an article in  ''Advances in Protein Chemistry''<ref name="Adv">{{Citation |last=Richardson |first=Jane S. |title=Anatomy and Taxonomy of Protein Structures |journal=Advances in Protein Chemistry |volume=34 |pages=167–339 |year=1981 |doi=10.1016/S0065-3233(08)60520-3 |pmid=7020376 }}.</ref> (now available in annotated form on-line at [http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/teaching/anatax/ Anatax]).  These drawings were made in pen on tracing paper over a printout of a [[Alpha and beta carbon|Cα]] trace of the atomic coordinates; they preserved positions, smoothed the backbone path, and incorporated small local shifts to disambiguate the visual appearance.<ref name="MethEnz"/> As well as the TIM ribbon drawing at right, other hand-drawn examples are for [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:PrealbuminDimer_ribbon.jpg prealbumin], [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Flavodoxin_ribbon_BWline.jpg flavodoxin], and [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:2SOD_ribbon_pastel.jpg Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase].

In 1982, [[Arthur M. Lesk]] and co-workers first enabled automatic generation of ribbon diagrams through a computational implementation that uses Protein Data Bank files as input.<ref>{{Citation |first=Arthur M. |last=Lesk |first2=Karl D. |last2=Hardman |title=Computer-Generated Schematic Diagrams of Protein Structures |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=216 |issue=4545 |pages=539–540 |year=1982 |doi=10.1126/science.7071602 }}.</ref> This conceptually simple [[algorithm]] fit [[cubic polynomial]] [[B-spline]] curves to the peptide planes. Most modern graphics systems provide B-splines as a basic drawing primitive. B-Splines are well suited to fitting between data points but not necessarily interpolating through each of those points. To create a line that intersects all data points, [[Hermite spline]]s can be used. In order to give the right radius for helical spirals while preserving smooth β-strands, B-splines can be modified by offsets proportional to local curvature, as first developed by Mike Carson for his Ribbons program<ref>{{Citation |first=M. |last=Carson |first2=C. E. |last2=Bugg |title=Algorithm for Ribbon Models of Proteins |journal=Journal of Molecular Graphics |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=121–122 |year=1986 |doi=10.1016/0263-7855(86)80010-8 }}.</ref> (figure at right) and later adapted by other molecular graphics software, such as the open-source Mage program for [[kinemage]] graphics<ref>{{citation |first=D.

Since their inception, and continuing in the present, a ribbon diagram is the single most common representation of protein structures and a very common choice of cover image for a journal or textbook.

===Current computer programs===

One popular program used for drawing ribbon diagrams is [[Molscript]]. Molscript utilizes [[Hermite spline]]s to create coordinates for coils, turns, strands and helices. The curve passes through all its control points (Cα atoms) guided by direction vectors. The program was built on the basis of traditional molecular graphics by [[Arthur M. Lesk]], Karl Hardman, and John Priestle.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.avatar.se/molscript/doc/about.html |title=MolScript v2.1: About the program }}</ref>  <!-- An example of a ribbon diagram produced by Molscript is shown in Figure 1. --> [[Jmol]] is an open-source Java-based viewer for browsing molecular structures on the web; it includes a simplified "cartoon" version of ribbons. Other graphics programs such as DeepView (example: [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Urease-1E9Z.jpg urease]) and MolMol (example: [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:1lkkA_SH2_domain.png SH2 domain]) also produce ribbon images.

[[UCSF Chimera]] is a powerful molecular modeling program that also includes visualizations such as ribbons, notable especially for the ability to combine them with contoured shapes from cryo-[[electron microscopy]] data.<ref>{{Citation |last=Goddard |first=Thomas D. |first2=Conrad C. |last2=Huang |first3=Thomas E. |last3=Ferrin |year=2005 |title=Software Extensions to UCSF Chimera for Interactive Visualization of Large Molecular Assemblies |journal=Structure |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=473–482 |doi=10.1016/j.str.2005.01.006 |pmid=15766548 }}.</ref>  [[PyMOL]], by [[Warren DeLano]],<ref>{{Citation |last=Brunger |first=Axel T. |first2=James A. |last2=Wells |year=2009 |title=Warren L.

|Polypeptide direction,
NH2  and COOH termini
|Small arrows on one or both of the termini or by letters. For β-strands, the direction of the arrow is sufficient. Today, the direction of the polypeptide chain is often indicated by a colour ramp.

|Shading and colour
|Shading or colour adds dimensionality to the diagram. Generally, the features at the front are the darkest, while becoming lighter and lower in contrast towards the back.
