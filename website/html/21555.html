== Construction ==
A lexicode of minimum distance ''d'' and length ''n'' over a [[finite field]] is generated by starting with the all-zero vector and iteratively adding the next vector (in [[lexicographic order]]) of minimum Hamming distance ''d'' from the vectors added so far.  As an example, the length-3 lexicode of minimum distance 2 would consist of the vectors marked by an "X" in the following example:

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Vector
! In code?
|-
| 000
| X
|-
| 001
| 
|-
| 010
|
|-
| 011
| X
|-
| 100
|
|-
| 101
| X
|-
| 110
| X
|-
| 111
|
|}

Since lexicodes are linear, they can also be constructed by means of their [[Basis (linear algebra) | basis]]. <ref>[[Ari Trachtenberg]], Designing Lexicographic Codes with a Given Trellis Complexity, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, January 2002.</ref>
