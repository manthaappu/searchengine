'''Michael Hartley Freedman''' (born 21 April 1951 in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[United States|U.S.]]) is a [[mathematician]] at [[Microsoft Station Q]], a research group at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].<ref>[http://stationq.ucsb.edu/ Microsoft Station Q Group at UCSB]. ([http://web.archive.org/web/20080129205055/http://stationq.ucsb.edu/index.html Station Q (archived page - 2008)])</ref> In 1986, he was awarded a [[Fields Medal]] for his work on the [[Poincaré conjecture]]. Freedman and [[Robion Kirby]] showed that an [[exotic R4|exotic '''R'''<sup>4</sup>]] manifold exists.

Freedman was born into a [[Jewish]] family in Los Angeles. He entered the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1968, and continued his studies at [[Princeton University]] where he received [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in 1973 for his doctoral dissertation titled ''Codimension-Two Surgery'', written under the supervision of [[William Browder (mathematician)|William Browder]]. After graduating, Freedman was appointed a lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He held this post from 1973 until 1975, when he became a member of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] (IAS) at Princeton. In 1976 he was appointed assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD). He spent the year 1980/81 at IAS, returning to UCSD, where in 1982 he was promoted to professor. He was appointed the Charles Lee Powell chair of mathematics at UCSD in 1985.

Freedman has received numerous other awards and honors including [[Sloan Fellowship|Sloan]] and [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]s, a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellowship]] and the [[National Medal of Science]]. He is an elected member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], and  the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

He currently works at [[Microsoft Station Q]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], where his team is involved in the development of the [[topological quantum computer]].
