The '''Seal of the Vice President of the Philippines''' is a symbol used to represent the history and dignity of the [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]] of the [[Philippines]]. Its design was prescribed by [http://www.ops.gov.ph/records/eo_no310.htm Executive Order No. 310 of 2004], and is similar in design to the [[Seal of the President of the Philippines]].

==Description and Symbolism==
The seal is composed of the coat-of-arms of the Vice President, which, according to [http://www.ops.gov.ph/records/eo_no310.htm Executive Order No. 310 of 2004] consists of:
{{cquote|A circular white shield with an eight-rayed golden-yellow Philippine sun at the center. Overlapping the Philippine sun is a red equilateral triangle. Inside and at the center of the equilateral triangle is the traditional golden-yellow sea lion (Ultramar) of the Coat-of-Arms granted to the City of Manila in 1596, on guard with a sword on its right paw, at hilt.

Inside and at the corner of each of the three (3) angles of the equilateral triangle, a five-pointed golden-yellow star to represent Luz√≥n, Visayas, and Mindanao, respectively.}}

The coat-of-arms is then surrounded by a [[blue]] circle. The upper [[Arc (geometry)|arc]] of the white circle contains the words <small>SAGISAG NG PANGALAWANG PANGULO NG PILIPINAS</SMALL> ("Seal of the Vice President of the Philippines") in white letters. The bottom of the outer rim is marked with one five-pointed white star.

==History==
The seal was first designed in 1947 via Executive Order No. 38 signed by President [[Manuel Roxas]], in which the presidential flag and seal was created. It indicated that the vice presidential coat of arms will follow the pattern of the presidential coat of arms, except that the sun and sealion will be blue to create a distinction compared to the latter <ref name="mlq3">[http://www.quezon.ph/2005/05/29/executive-order-no-310/ Executive Order No. 310], Manuel L. Quezon III</ref>. After President [[Elpidio Quirino]] amended Roxas' order, he changed the design of the coat of arms, and ordered that it will be identical to the president's, but without the ring of stars <ref name="mlq3"/>. This version of the coat of arms and seal was used until the position of vice president was abolished by martial law in 1972 and its subsequent non-inclusion in the original text of the 1973 Constitution.

After the position was restored in 1986, a literal reading of Quirino's order caused confusion on what the design of the vice presidential coat of arms and seal should be.<ref name="mlq3"/> Thus, the government adopted the seal with a similar design compared to the president's with a blue background but no amulet of stars and it is surrounded by text contains the words <small>SEAL OF THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES</SMALL>. 

To remove the confusion and to create a distinction between the presidential and vice presidential coat of arms and seal, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] signed Executive Order 310 of 2004, defining the design of both position's coat of arms, seal and flag.
