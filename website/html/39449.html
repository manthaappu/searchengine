'''Vimscript''', also '''Vim script''', is the [[scripting language]] built into [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]].<ref>http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_41.html</ref> Based on the [[Ex (text editor)|ex]] editor language of the original [[vi]] editor, early versions of Vim added commands for control flow and function definitions. Since version 7, Vimscript also supports more advanced data types such as [[List (computing)|Lists]] and [[Associative array|Dictionaries]] and (a simple form of) [[object-oriented programming]]. Built-in functions such as <tt>map()</tt> and <tt>filter()</tt> allow a basic form of [[functional programming]], but Vimscript is mostly written in an [[Imperative programming|imperative programming style]]. 

Vim [[macro]]s can contain a sequence of ''normal-mode'' commands, but can also invoke ex commands or functions written in Vimscript for more complex tasks. Almost all extensions (called plugins) of the core Vim functionality are written in Vimscript, but plugins can also utilize other scripting languages like [[Perl]] or [[Python (programming language)|Python]] (if support for them is compiled into the Vim binary).

Vimscript files are stored in plain text format and the file name extension is .vim.

== Example ==
<pre>
:let i = 1
:while i < 5
:  echo "count is" i
:  let i += 1
:endwhile
</pre>
