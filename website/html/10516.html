'''Dimensional Metrology''' is the science of calibrating and using physical measurement equipment to quantify the physical size of or distance from any given object. Inspection is a critical step in [[product development]] and [[quality control]]. Dimensional Metrology requires the use of a variety of physical scales to determine dimension, with the most accurate of these being holographic etalons or laser interferometers. The realization of dimension using these accurate scale technologies is the end goal of dimensional metrologists.  

Early [[metrologist]]s would often create a central measurement standard based on a yard stick or meter. For example, early Egyptian meter sticks where based on a piece of metal that was the size of the Pharaoh's forearm called a [[Cubit]]. Carpenters were some of the first dimensional inspectors as seen today.

Modern measurement equipment includes; hand tools, CMM ([[Coordinate-Measurement Machine]]), and optical comparators. For hand tools, see [[Caliper]] and [[micrometer]]. A CMM is based on [[CNC]] technology to automate measurement of Cartesian coordinates from physical contact with the part. Optical comparators are used when physically touching the part is undesirable. Optical comparators can now build 3D models of a scanned part and internal passages using x-ray technology. 
Furthermore, optical 3d (laser) scanners are becoming more and common. By using a light sensitive detector (e.g. digital camera) and a light source (laser, line projector) the triangulation principle is employed to generate 3d data, which is evaluated in order to compare the measures against nominal geometries.

Data is collected in or compared to a print. A print is a blueprint illustrating crucial features. Prints can be hand drawn or automatically generated by a [[CAD]] model.
