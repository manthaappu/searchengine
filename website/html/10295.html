<html> <head> <title>Diffuse element method</title></head><body>The '''diffuse element method''' (DEM) is a [[computer simulation]] technique used in engineering analysis. It is a [[meshfree methods|meshfree method]].

The diffuse element method was developed by Nayroles, Touzot and Villon in 1992.
It is in concept rather similar to the much older [[smoothed particle hydrodynamics]], though there is no reference to it in their paper.
In the paper they describe a "diffuse approximation method", a method for function approximation from a given set of points.
In fact it seems they rediscovered an already known technique, [[moving least squares]].
Using this function approximation method, [[partial differential equation]]s and thus [[fluid dynamic]] problems can be solved. For this, they coined the term '''Diffuse Element Method''' (DEM).
Advantages over [[finite element method]]s are that DEM doesn't rely on a grid, and is more precise in the evaluation of the derivations of the reconstructed functions.
