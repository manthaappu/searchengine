'''Netpbm''' is an [[open source]] package of graphics programs and a programming library, used mainly in the [[Unix]] world. It is a highly portable package, working under many Unix platforms, [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], [[OpenVMS|VMS]], [[Amiga OS]] and others and is included in all major [[open source]] [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]] distributions. 

==File formats and programs==

Netpbm defines a set of graphics formats called the '''netpbm formats''':
*The [[Netpbm format|portable pixmap/greymap/bitmap formats]] PPM, PGM, PBM. They are collectively referred to as PNM.
*The more sophisticated [[PAM graphics format|PAM]] format.

Netpbm contains over 220 separate programs in the package, most of which have "pbm", "pgm", "ppm", "pam", or "pnm" in their names. For example, you might use <tt>pamscale</tt> to shrink an image by 10%, <tt>pamcomp</tt> to overlay one image on top of another, <tt>pbmtext</tt> to create an image of text or reduce the number of colors in an image with <tt>pnmquant</tt>.

The Netpbm package can, for example, use two successive conversion programs to turn a picture in the PBM format into a [[BMP file format|.bmp]] file:

 pgmtoppm "#FFFFFF" somepic.pbm  > somepic.ppm
 ppmtobmp somepic.ppm > somepic.bmp

This is more commonly done as a [[Pipeline (Unix)|pipeline]], to save execution time and to avoid
leaving a temporary ''somepic.ppm'' file around:

 pgmtoppm "#FFFFFF" somepic.pbm | ppmtobmp > somepic.bmp

The Netpbm programs are frequently used as intermediates to convert between obscure formats. For instance, there may be no tool to convert an X11 window dump ([[XWD]] format) directly to a Macintosh [[PICT]] file, but one can do this by running <tt>xwdtopnm</tt>, then <tt>ppmtopict</tt>. (Tools which say that they output PNM may output PPM, PGM or PBM. Tools importing PNM will read any of the three formats.)

==History==

The PBM (black and white) format was invented by [[Jef Poskanzer]] in the mid-1980s.  At the time, there was no standard, reliable way to send binary files in email, and attempting to send anything other than 7-bit [[ASCII]] in email often resulted in [[data corruption]].  PBM was designed to allow images to be sent via email without being corrupted.  Poskanzer released the forerunner of Netpbm, called '''Pbmplus''' in 1988.  By the end of 1988, Poskanzer had developed the PGM (greyscale) and PPM (color) formats and released them with Pbmplus.

The last release of Pbmplus was on December 10, 1991.  Poskanzer never released any further updates, and in 1993 Netpbm was developed to replace it.  At first it was nothing more than a renamed release of Pbmplus, but updates continued to occur until 1995 when the package again became abandoned.  In 1999 the Netpbm package was picked up by its present maintainer, [[Bryan Henderson]].

In 2000 PAM was added to the file formats of the NetPBM library allowing an alpha channel.<ref>http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pam.html</ref>

The name Netpbm came from the program developers collaborating over the [[Internet]], which was notable at the time. (The [[NetBSD]] operating system and [[Nethack]] game got their names similarly.)
