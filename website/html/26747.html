'''ntfsresize''' is a [[Free software|free]] [[Unix]] utility that non-destructively resizes the [[NTFS]] filesystem used by [[Windows NT 4.0]], [[Windows 2000|2000]], [[Windows XP|XP]], [[Windows Server 2003|2003]],  and [[Windows Vista|Vista]] typically on a hard-disk [[partition (computing)|partition]]. All NTFS versions used by 32-bit and 64-bit Windows are supported. No defragmentation is required prior to resizing since version 1.11.2. ntfsresize is included in the [[ntfsprogs]] package, developed by the [[Linux-NTFS]] project. For those that don't have a [[Unix]] system installed, it is still possible to run ntfsresize by using one of the many Linux [[Live CD]]s.

== ntfsresize features==
* Full compatibility with all known NTFS versions from Windows NT 3.1 to Windows Vista
* Checks internal structures for errors
* Will work in various difficult situations:
** No [[defragmentation]] needed prior to use
** Supports both shrinking and expanding NTFS
** Supports resizing volumes with known [[bad sector]]s in them
* Will refuse to run under certain conditions:
** When the volume is flagged dirty, that is marked for Windows to run [[CHKDSK]] at boot.  The --force switch will over-ride this
** When Windows is hibernated on the partition
