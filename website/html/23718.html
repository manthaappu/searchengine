'''Mathematics''' is the study of [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]], and [[calculus|change]]. <!-- <<< Please do NOT change the opening sentence without discussion; much time and discussion has been invested in its current form. --> [[Mathematician]]s seek out [[patterns]],<ref>[[Lynn Steen|Steen, L.A.]] (April 29, 1988). ''The Science of Patterns'' [[Science (journal)|Science]], 240: 611–616. and summarized at [http://www.ascd.org/publications/curriculum-handbook/409/chapters/The-Future-of-Mathematics-Education.aspx Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development], ascd.org</ref><ref>[[Keith Devlin|Devlin, Keith]], ''Mathematics: The Science of Patterns: The Search for Order in Life, Mind and the Universe'' (Scientific American Paperback Library) 1996, ISBN 978-0-7167-5047-5</ref> formulate new [[conjecture]]s, and establish truth by [[Mathematical rigour|rigorous]] [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] from appropriately chosen [[axiom]]s and [[definition]]s.<ref>Jourdain.</ref>

There is debate over whether mathematical objects such as [[number]]s and points exist naturally or are human creations. The mathematician [[Benjamin Peirce]] called mathematics "the science that draws necessary conclusions".<ref>Peirce, p. 97.</ref> [[Albert Einstein]], on the other hand, stated that "as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."<ref name=certain/>

Through the use of [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstraction]] and [[logic]]al [[reasoning]], mathematics evolved from [[counting]], [[calculation]], [[measurement]], and the systematic study of the [[shape]]s and [[motion (physics)|motions]] of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity for as far back as [[History of Mathematics|written records]] exist. [[Logic|Rigorous arguments]] first appeared in [[Greek mathematics]], most notably in ''[[Euclid's Elements]]''. Mathematics continued to develop, for example in China in 300 BC, in India in AD 100, and in the [[Muslim world]] in AD 800, until the [[Renaissance]], when mathematical innovations interacting with new [[timeline of scientific discoveries|scientific discoveries]] led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that continues to the present day.<ref>Eves</ref>

Mathematics is used throughout the world as an essential tool in many fields, including [[natural science]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], and the [[social sciences]]. [[Applied mathematics]], the branch of mathematics concerned with application of mathematical knowledge to other fields, inspires and makes use of new mathematical discoveries and sometimes leads to the development of entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as [[statistics]] and [[game theory]]. Mathematicians also engage in [[pure mathematics]], or mathematics for its own sake, without having any application in mind, although practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered.<ref>Peterson</ref>

==Etymology==
The word "mathematics" comes from the [[ancient Greek language|Greek]] μάθημα (''máthēma''), which means ''learning'', ''study'', ''science'', and additionally came to have the narrower and more technical meaning "mathematical study", even in Classical times.<ref>Both senses can be found in Plato. Liddell and Scott, ''s.voce''μαθηματικός</ref> Its adjective is {{lang|el|μαθηματικός}} (''mathēmatikós''), ''related to learning'', or ''studious'', which likewise further came to mean ''mathematical''. In particular, {{polytonic|μαθηματικὴ τέχνη}} (''mathēmatikḗ tékhnē''), {{lang-la|ars mathematica}}, meant ''the mathematical art''.

The apparent plural form in English, like the French plural form {{lang|fr|''les mathématiques''}} (and the less commonly used singular derivative {{lang|fr|''la mathématique''}}), goes back to the Latin neuter plural {{lang|la|''mathematica''}} ([[Cicero]]), based on the Greek plural {{lang|el|τα μαθηματικά (''ta mathēmatiká'')}}, used by [[Aristotle]], and meaning roughly "all things mathematical"; although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective ''mathematic(al)'' and formed the noun ''mathematics'' anew, after the pattern of [[physics]] and [[metaphysics]], which were inherited from the Greek.<ref>''[[The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology]]'', ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''sub'' "mathematics", "mathematic", "mathematics"</ref> In English, the noun ''mathematics'' takes singular verb forms. It is often shortened to ''maths'' or, in English-speaking North America, ''math''.

==History==
{{Main|History of mathematics}}
[[Image:Kapitolinischer Pythagoras adjusted.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Greek mathematician [[Pythagoras]] (c.570-c.495 BC), commonly credited with discovering the [[Pythagorean theorem]].]]
The evolution of mathematics might be seen as an ever-increasing series of [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstractions]], or alternatively an expansion of subject matter. The first abstraction, which is shared by many animals,<ref>{{cite journal|author1=S. Dehaene|author2= G. Dehaene-Lambertz|author3 = L. Cohen|title = Abstract representations of numbers in the animal and human brain|journal = Trends in Neuroscience|volume = 21 |issue = 8|month = Aug|year = 1998|pages = 355–361|doi = 10.1016/S0166-2236(98)01263-6}}</ref> was probably that of [[number]]s: the realization that a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges (for example) have something in common, namely quantity of their members.

In addition to recognizing how to [[counting|count]] ''physical'' objects, [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] peoples also recognized how to count ''abstract'' quantities, like time – days, [[season]]s, years.<ref>See, for example, Raymond L. Wilder, ''Evolution of Mathematical Concepts; an Elementary Study'', ''passim''</ref> [[Elementary arithmetic]] ([[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]]) naturally followed.

Since numeracy pre-dated [[writing]], further steps were needed for recording numbers such as [[Tally sticks|tallies]] or the knotted strings called [[quipu]] used by the [[Inca]] to store numerical data.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} [[Numeral system]]s have been many and diverse, with the first known written numerals created by [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] in [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] texts such as the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
[[File:maya.svg|thumb|[[Mayan numerals]]]]

The earliest uses of mathematics were in [[Trade|trading]], [[land measurement]], [[painting]] and [[weaving]] patterns and the recording of time. More complex mathematics did not appear until around 3000 BC, when the [[Babylonian]]s and Egyptians began using arithmetic, algebra and geometry for [[taxation]] and other financial calculations, for building and construction, and for [[astronomy]].<ref>Kline 1990, Chapter 1.</ref> The systematic study of mathematics in its own right began with the [[Ancient Greeks]] between 600 and 300 BC.<ref>"''[http://books.google.com/books?id=drnY3Vjix3kC&pg=PA1&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false A History of Greek Mathematics: From Thales to Euclid]''". Thomas Little Heath (1981). ISBN 0-486-24073-8</ref>

Mathematics has since been greatly extended, and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and [[science]], to the benefit of both. Mathematical discoveries continue to be made today. According to Mikhail B. Sevryuk, in the January 2006 issue of the ''[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]'', "The number of papers and books included in the [[Mathematical Reviews]] database since 1940 (the first year of operation of MR) is now more than 1.9 million, and more than 75 thousand items are added to the database each year. The overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical [[theorem]]s and their [[mathematical proof|proofs]]."<ref>Sevryuk</ref>

==Inspiration, pure and applied mathematics, and aesthetics==
{{Main|Mathematical beauty}}
[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|left|thumb|Sir [[Isaac Newton]] (1643-1727), an [[inventor]] of [[calculus|infinitesimal calculus]].]]

Mathematics arises from many different kinds of problems. At first these were found in [[commerce]], [[land measurement]], [[architecture]] and later [[astronomy]]; nowadays, all sciences suggest problems studied by mathematicians, and many problems arise within mathematics itself. For example, the [[physicist]] [[Richard Feynman]] invented the [[path integral formulation]] of [[quantum mechanics]] using a combination of mathematical reasoning and physical insight, and today's [[string theory]], a still-developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces of nature]], continues to inspire new mathematics.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Feynman Integral and Feynman's Operational Calculus | author = Johnson, Gerald W.; Lapidus, Michel L. | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2002 | isbn = 0821824139}}</ref> Some mathematics is only relevant in the area that inspired it, and is applied to solve further problems in that area. But often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts. A distinction is often made between [[pure mathematics]] and [[applied mathematics]]. However pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications, e.g. [[number theory]] in [[cryptography]]. This remarkable fact that even the "purest" mathematics often turns out to have practical applications is what [[Eugene Wigner]] has called "[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences|the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics]]".<ref>Eugene Wigner, 1960, "[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences,]" ''[[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]]'' '''13'''(1): 1–14.</ref>
As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] runs to 46 pages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |title=Mathematics Subject Classification 2010 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}</ref> Several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right, including [[statistics]], [[operations research]], and [[computer science]].

For those who are mathematically inclined, there is often a definite aesthetic aspect to much of mathematics. Many mathematicians talk about the ''elegance'' of mathematics, its intrinsic [[aesthetics]] and inner [[beauty]]. [[Simplicity]] and generality are valued. There is beauty in a simple and elegant [[proof (mathematics)|proof]], such as [[Euclid]]'s proof that there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, and in an elegant [[numerical method]] that speeds calculation, such as the [[fast Fourier transform]]. [[G. H. Hardy]] in ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]'' expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He identified criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy as factors that contribute to a mathematical aesthetic.<ref>{{cite book | title = A Mathematician's Apology | author = Hardy, G. H. | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1940 | isbn = 0521427061}}</ref> Mathematicians often strive to find proofs of theorems that are particularly elegant, a quest [[Paul Erdős]] often referred to as finding proofs from "The Book" in which God had written down his favorite proofs.<ref>{{cite book | title = Proof and Other Dilemmas: Mathematics and Philosophy | author = Gold, Bonnie; Simons, Rogers A. | publisher = MAA | year = 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title = Proofs from the Book | author = Aigner, Martin; Ziegler, Gunter M. | publisher = Springer | year = 2001 | isbn = 3540404600}}</ref> The popularity of [[recreational mathematics]] is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions.

==Notation, language, and rigor==
{{Main|Mathematical notation}}
[[File:Leonhard Euler 2.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Leonhard Euler]], who created and popularized much of the mathematical notation used today]]

Most of the mathematical notation in use today was not invented until the 16th century.<ref>[http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html Earliest Uses of Various Mathematical Symbols] (Contains many further references).</ref> Before that, mathematics was written out in words, a painstaking process that limited mathematical discovery.<ref>Kline, p. 140, on [[Diophantus]]; p.261, on [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]].</ref> [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] (1707–1783) was responsible for many of the notations in use today. Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. It is extremely compressed: a few symbols contain a great deal of information. Like [[musical notation]], modern mathematical notation has a strict syntax (which to a limited extent varies from author to author and from discipline to discipline) and encodes information that would be difficult to write in any other way.

Mathematical [[language]] can also be hard for beginners. Words such as ''or'' and ''only'' have more precise meanings than in everyday speech. Moreover, words such as ''[[open set|open]]'' and ''[[field (mathematics)|field]]'' have been given specialized mathematical meanings. [[Mathematical jargon]] includes technical terms such as ''[[homeomorphism]]'' and ''[[Integral|integrable]]''. But there is a reason for special notation and technical jargon: mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech. Mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as "rigor".

[[File:Infinity symbol.svg|thumb|left|upright|The [[infinity]] symbol '''∞''' in several typefaces.]]
[[Mathematical proof]] is fundamentally a matter of [[rigor]]. Mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning. This is to avoid mistaken "[[theorem]]s", based on fallible intuitions, of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject.<ref>See ''[[false proof]]'' for simple examples of what can go wrong in a formal proof. The [[History of the four color theorem|history of the Four Color Theorem]] contains examples of false proofs accidentally accepted by other mathematicians at the time.</ref> The level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time: the Greeks expected detailed arguments, but at the time of [[Isaac Newton]] the methods employed were less rigorous. Problems inherent in the definitions used by Newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th century. Misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics<!-- This part needs improvement | >> -->. Today, mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about [[computer-assisted proof]]s. Since large computations are hard to verify, such proofs may not be sufficiently rigorous.<ref>Ivars Peterson, ''The Mathematical Tourist'', Freeman, 1988, ISBN 0-7167-1953-3. p. 4 "A few complain that the computer program can't be verified properly", (in reference to the Haken-Apple proof of the Four Color Theorem).</ref>

[[Axiom]]s in traditional thought were "self-evident truths", but that conception is problematic. At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols, which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an [[axiomatic system]]. It was the goal of [[Hilbert's program]] to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] every (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic system has [[independence (mathematical logic)|undecidable]] formulas; and so a final [[axiomatization]] of mathematics is impossible. Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal content) nothing but [[set theory]] in some axiomatization, in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.<ref>Patrick Suppes, ''Axiomatic Set Theory'', Dover, 1972, ISBN 0-486-61630-4. p. 1, "Among the many branches of modern mathematics set theory occupies a unique place: with a few rare exceptions the entities which are studied and analyzed in mathematics may be regarded as certain particular sets or classes of objects."</ref>

==Mathematics as science==
[[File:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], himself known as the "prince of mathematicians",<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> referred to mathematics as "the Queen of the Sciences".]]

Carl Friedrich Gauss referred to mathematics as "the Queen of the Sciences".<ref>Waltershausen</ref> In the original Latin ''Regina Scientiarum'', as well as in [[German language|German]] ''Königin der Wissenschaften'', the word corresponding to ''science'' means (field of) knowledge. Indeed, this is also the original meaning in English, and there is no doubt that mathematics is in this sense a science. The specialization restricting the meaning to ''natural'' science is of later date. If one considers [[science]] to be strictly about the physical world, then mathematics, or at least [[pure mathematics]], is not a science. [[Albert Einstein]] stated that ''"as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.''"<ref name=certain>Einstein, p. 28. The quote is Einstein's answer to the question: "how can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality?" He, too, is concerned with ''[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences]]''.</ref>

Many philosophers believe that mathematics is not experimentally [[falsifiability|falsifiable]], and thus not a science according to the definition of [[Karl Popper]].<ref>{{cite book | title = Out of Their Minds: The Lives and Discoveries of 15 Great Computer Scientists | author = Shasha, Dennis Elliot; Lazere, Cathy A. | publisher = Springer | year = 1998 | page = 228}}</ref> However, in the 1930s [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] convinced many mathematicians that mathematics cannot be reduced to logic alone, and Karl Popper concluded that "most mathematical theories are, like those of [[physics]] and [[biology]], [[hypothesis|hypothetico]]-[[deductive]]: pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures, than it seemed even recently."<ref>Popper 1995, p. 56</ref> Other thinkers, notably [[Imre Lakatos]], have applied a version of [[falsificationism]] to mathematics itself.

An alternative view is that certain scientific fields (such as [[theoretical physics]]) are mathematics with axioms that are intended to correspond to reality. In fact, the theoretical physicist, [[J. M. Ziman]], proposed that science is ''public knowledge'' and thus includes mathematics.<ref>Ziman</ref> In any case, mathematics shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences, notably the [[deductive reasoning|exploration of the logical consequences]] of assumptions. [[intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]] and [[experiment]]ation also play a role in the formulation of [[conjecture]]s in both mathematics and the (other) sciences. [[Experimental mathematics]] continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics, weakening the objection that mathematics does not use the [[scientific method]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} In his 2002 book ''[[A New Kind of Science]]'', [[Stephen Wolfram]] argues that computational mathematics deserves to be explored empirically as a scientific field in its own right.

The opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. Many mathematicians{{Who|date=August 2009}} feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven [[liberal arts]]; others{{Who|date=August 2009}} feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and [[engineering]] has driven much development in mathematics. One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is ''created'' (as in art) or ''discovered'' (as in science). It is common to see [[university|universities]] divided into sections that include a division of ''Science and Mathematics'', indicating that the fields are seen as being allied but that they do not coincide. In practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer levels. This is one of many issues considered in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Fields of mathematics==
[[File:Abacus 6.png|right|thumb|An [[abacus]], a simple calculating tool used since ancient times.]]

Mathematics can, broadly speaking, be subdivided into the study of quantity, structure, space, and change (i.e. [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]], and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} In addition to these main concerns, there are also subdivisions dedicated to exploring links from the heart of mathematics to other fields: to [[mathematical logic|logic]], to [[set theory]] ([[foundations of mathematics|foundations]]), to the empirical mathematics of the various sciences ([[applied mathematics]]), and more recently to the rigorous study of [[uncertainty]].

===Quantity===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]] -->
The study of quantity starts with [[number]]s, first the familiar [[natural number]]s and [[integer]]s ("whole numbers") and arithmetical operations on them, which are characterized in [[arithmetic]]. The deeper properties of integers are studied in [[number theory]], from which come such popular results as [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. Number theory also holds two problems widely considered to be unsolved: the [[twin prime]] conjecture and [[Goldbach's conjecture]].

As the number system is further developed, the integers are recognized as a [[subset]] of the [[rational number]]s ("[[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]"). These, in turn, are contained within the [[real number]]s, which are used to represent [[Continuous function|continuous]] quantities. Real numbers are generalized to [[complex number]]s. These are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include [[quarternion]]s and [[octonion]]s. Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the [[transfinite number]]s, which formalize the concept of "[[infinity]]". Another area of study is size, which leads to the [[cardinal number]]s and then to another conception of infinity: the [[aleph number]]s, which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets.

|}

===Structure===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]] -->
Many mathematical objects, such as [[set (mathematics)|sets]] of numbers and [[function (mathematics)|functions]], exhibit internal structure as a consequence of [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] or [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] that are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance [[number theory]] studies properties of the set of [[integer]]s that can be expressed in terms of [[arithmetic]] operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured sets (or [[Mathematical structure|structures]]) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of [[abstraction]], to state [[axiom]]s for a class of structures, and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of [[abstract algebra]]. By its great generality, abstract algebra can often be applied to seemingly unrelated problems; for instance a number of ancient problems concerning [[compass and straightedge constructions]] were finally solved using [[Galois theory]], which involves field theory and group theory. Another example of an algebraic theory is [[linear algebra]], which is the general study of [[vector space]]s, whose elements called [[vector (geometric)|vectors]] have both quantity and direction, and can be used to model (relations between) points in space. This is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of [[geometry]] and [[algebra]] have very strong interactions in modern mathematics. [[Combinatorics]] studies ways of enumerating the number of objects that fit a given structure.

===Space===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]] -->
The study of space originates with [[geometry]] – in particular, [[Euclidean geometry]]. [[Trigonometry]] is the branch of mathematics that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the trigonometric functions; it combines space and numbers, and encompasses the well-known [[Pythagorean theorem]]. The modern study of space generalizes these ideas to include higher-dimensional geometry, [[non-euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] (which play a central role in [[general relativity]]) and [[topology]]. Quantity and space both play a role in [[analytic geometry]], [[differential geometry]], and [[algebraic geometry]]. Within differential geometry are the concepts of [[fiber bundles]] and calculus on [[manifold]]s, in particular, [[Vector calculus|vector]] and [[tensor calculus]]. Within algebraic geometry is the description of geometric objects as solution sets of [[polynomial]] equations, combining the concepts of quantity and space, and also the study of [[topological groups]], which combine structure and space. [[Lie group]]s are used to study space, structure, and change. [[Topology]] in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth area in 20th century mathematics; it includes [[point-set topology]], [[set-theoretic topology]], [[algebraic topology]] and [[differential topology]]. In particular, instances of modern day topology are [[metrizability theory]], [[axiomatic set theory]], [[homotopy theory]], and [[Morse theory]]. Topology also includes the now solved [[Poincaré conjecture]] and the controversial [[four color theorem]], whose only proof, by computer, has never been verified by a human.

===Change===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]] -->
Understanding and describing change is a common theme in the [[natural science]]s, and [[calculus]] was developed as a powerful tool to investigate it. [[function (mathematics)|Functions]] arise here, as a central concept describing a changing quantity. The rigorous study of [[real number]]s and functions of a real variable is known as [[real analysis]], with [[complex analysis]] the equivalent field for the [[complex number]]s. [[Functional analysis]] focuses attention on (typically infinite-dimensional) [[space#Mathematics|spaces]] of functions. One of many applications of functional analysis is [[quantum mechanics]]. Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change, and these are studied as [[differential equation]]s. Many phenomena in nature can be described by [[dynamical system]]s; [[chaos theory]] makes precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]] behavior.

===Foundations and philosophy===
In order to clarify the [[foundations of mathematics]], the fields of [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]] were developed. Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of [[logic]] and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics; set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] or collections of objects. [[Category theory]], which deals in an abstract way with [[mathematical structure]]s and relationships between them, is still in development. The phrase "crisis of foundations" describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately 1900 to 1930.<ref>Luke Howard Hodgkin & Luke Hodgkin, ''A History of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press, 2005.</ref> Some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics continues to present day. The crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number of controversies at the time, including the [[controversy over Cantor's theory|controversy over Cantor's set theory]] and the [[Brouwer-Hilbert controversy]].

Mathematical logic is concerned with setting mathematics within a rigorous [[axiom]]atic framework, and studying the implications of such a framework. As such, it is home to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] which (informally) imply that any [[formal system]] that contains basic arithmetic, if ''sound'' (meaning that all theorems that can be proven are true), is necessarily ''incomplete'' (meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved ''in that system''). Whatever finite collection of number-theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation, Gödel showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true number-theoretical fact, but which does not follow from those axioms. Therefore no formal system is a complete axiomatization of full number theory.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Modern logic is divided into [[recursion theory]], [[model theory]], and [[proof theory]], and is closely linked to [[theoretical computer science|theoretical]] [[computer science]].

===Theoretical computer science===
[[Theoretical computer science]] includes [[computability theory (computation)|computability theory]], [[computational complexity theory]], and [[information theory]]. Computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer, including the most powerful known model – the [[Turing machine]]. Complexity theory is the study of tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically solvable by computer, are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain practically unfeasible, even with rapid advance of computer hardware. A famous problem is the "[[P = NP problem|P=NP?]]" problem, one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]].<ref>[http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ Clay Mathematics Institute], P=NP, claymath.org</ref> Finally, information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium, and hence deals with concepts such as [[data compression|compression]] and [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]].

===Applied mathematics===
[[Applied mathematics]] considers the use of abstract mathematical tools in solving concrete problems in the [[science]]s, [[business]], and other areas.

Applied mathematics has significant overlap with the discipline of [[statistics]], whose theory is formulated mathematically, especially with [[probability theory]]. Statisticians (working as part of a research project) "create data that makes sense" with [[random sampling]] and with randomized [[design of experiments|experiments]]; the design of a statistical sample or experiment specifies the analysis of the data (before the data be available). When reconsidering data from experiments and samples or when analyzing data from [[observational study|observational studies]], statisticians "make sense of the data" using the art of [[statistical model|modelling]] and the theory of [[statistical inference|inference]] – with [[model selection]] and [[estimation]]; the estimated models and consequential [[Scientific method#Predictions from the hypothesis|predictions]] should be [[statistical hypothesis testing|tested]] on [[Scientific method#Evaluation and improvement|new data]].<ref>Like other mathematical sciences such as [[physics]] and [[computer science]], statistics is an autonomous discipline rather than a branch of applied mathematics. Like research physicists and computer scientists, research statisticians are mathematical scientists. Many statisticians have a degree in mathematics, and some statisticians are also mathematicians.</ref>

[[Computational mathematics]] proposes and studies methods for solving [[mathematical problem]]s that are typically too large for human numerical capacity. [[Numerical analysis]] studies methods for problems in [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]] using ideas of [[functional analysis]] and techniques of [[approximation theory]]; numerical analysis includes the study of [[approximation]] and [[discretization]] broadly with special concern for [[rounding error]]s. Other areas of computational mathematics include [[computer algebra]] and [[symbolic computation]].

==Mathematics as profession==

The best-known award in mathematics is the {{nowrap|[[Fields Medal]]}},<ref>"''The Fields Medal is now indisputably the best known and most influential award in mathematics.''" Monastyrsky</ref><ref>Riehm</ref> established in 1936 and now awarded every 4 years. It is often considered the equivalent of science's [[Nobel Prize]]s. The [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]], instituted in 1978, recognizes lifetime achievement, and another major international award, the [[Abel Prize]], was introduced in 2003. The [[Chern Medal]] was introduced in 2010 to recognize lifetime achievement. These are awarded for a particular body of work, which may be innovation, or resolution of an outstanding problem in an established field.

A famous list of 23 [[open problem]]s, called "[[Hilbert's problems]]", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician [[David Hilbert]]. This list achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least nine of the problems have now been solved. A new list of seven important problems, titled the "[[Millennium Prize Problems]]", was published in 2000. Solution of each of these problems carries a $1 million reward, and only one (the [[Riemann hypothesis]]) is duplicated in Hilbert's problems.

==Common misconceptions==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}
{{Original research|date=August 2009}}

Mathematics is not a closed intellectual system, in which everything has already been worked out. There is no shortage of [[unsolved problems in mathematics|open problems]]. Every month, mathematicians publish many thousands of papers that embody new discoveries in the field.

Mathematics is not [[numerology]]; it is not concerned with "supernatural" properties of numbers. It is not [[accountancy]]; nor is it restricted to [[arithmetic]].

[[Pseudomathematics]] is a form of mathematics-like activity undertaken outside [[academia]], and occasionally by mathematicians themselves. It often consists of determined attacks on famous questions, consisting of proof-attempts made in an isolated way (that is, long papers not supported by previously published theory). The relationship to generally accepted mathematics is similar to that between [[pseudoscience]] and real science. The misconceptions involved are normally based on:
* misunderstanding of the implications of [[mathematical rigor]];
* attempts to circumvent the usual criteria for publication of [[mathematical paper]]s in a [[learned journal]] after [[peer review]], often in the belief that the journal is biased against the author;
* lack of familiarity with, and therefore underestimation of, the existing literature.

Like [[astronomy]], mathematics owes much to [[List of amateur mathematicians|amateur contributors]] such as [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]] and [[Marin Mersenne|Mersenne]]. -->
