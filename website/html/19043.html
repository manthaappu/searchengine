<html> <head> <title>International Society for Biosemiotic Studies</title></head><body>The '''International Society for Biosemiotic Studies''' (ISBS) is an academic society for the researchers in [[semiotic biology]]. The Society was established in 2005.<ref>Favareau, Don 2005. Founding a world biosemiotics institution: The International Society for Biosemiotic Studies. ''[[Sign Systems Studies]]'' 33(2): 481-485.</ref> Its official journal is [[Biosemiotics (journal)|Biosemiotics]], published by [[Springer Science|Springer]] and launched in 2008. 

The purpose of the ISBS is to constitute an organizational framework for the collaboration among scholars dedicated to biosemiotic studies, including the [[interdisciplinary]] research of [[sign process]]es in [[living system]]s, organic codes, and [[biocommunication (science)|biocommunication]]. The ISBS attempts to develop the [[qualitative research]] methods in biology. Among the central focuses is also [[theoretical semiotics]] as a basis for [[theoretical biology]].

The ISBS assures the organization of regular meetings on research into the semiotics of nature, as well as promotes publication of scholarly work on the semiotics of life processes. The ISBS organizes the annual international conferences (''Gatherings in Biosemiotics'') that were started by Copenhagen and Tartu biosemioticians and have taken place regularly already since 2001.<ref>[[Claus Emmeche|Emmeche, Claus]] 2001. The emergence of signs of living feeling: Reverberations from the first Gatherings in Biosemiotics. ''Sign Systems Studies'' 29(1): 369–376.</ref>

The first President of the ISBS is [[Jesper Hoffmeyer]] (Copenhagen University).
