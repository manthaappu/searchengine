<html> <head> <title>Out of the Inner Circle</title></head><body>'''''Out of the Inner Circle: A Hacker's Guide to Computer Security''''' is a book by [[Bill Landreth]] and [[Howard Rheingold]], published in 1985 by [[Microsoft Press]] and distributed by [[Simon & Schuster, Inc.]] (ISBN 0-671-30942-0). The book was created to provide insight into the ways and methods of the [[Hacker (computing)|hacking]] community in days before [[internet]] became prevalent. Although largely outdated and more than a little nostalgic, it does show what brought on many of the current trends we see in network security today.
