The '''MCP-1600''' was a multi-chip [[microprocessor]] made by [[Western Digital]] in the late 1970s through the early 1980s. Used in the [[Pascal MicroEngine]], the original [[AlphaMicro]] system, and the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-11#The_LSI-11|LSI-11]] microcomputer, a cost-reduced and compact implementation of the DEC [[PDP-11]].

There were three types of chips in the chip-set:
* CP1611 RALU - Register [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]] chip
* CP1621 CON - Control chip
* CP1631 MICROM - Mask-programmed [[microcode]] [[Read-only memory|ROM]] chip (512 &ndash; 22 bit words)

The chips used a 3.3[[MHz]] [[clock signal#4-phase clock|four phase clock]] and four power supply voltages (+5V, +12V, -12V, and -5V).  Internally the MCP-1600 was a (relatively fast) 8-bit processor that could be micro-programmed to emulate a 16-bit CPU.  Up to four MICROMs were supported, but usually two or three could hold the needed microprogram for a processor.
