'''Network cloaking''' is a technology that makes a protected [[Computer network|network]] invisible to malicious external traffic, while allowing complete and uninterrupted access for legitimate users.

Network cloaking is accomplished via a promiscuous [[bridge]] with [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] functionality, located in front of the internet firewall. All [[encryption|non-encrypted]] [[Internet]] traffic entering a network is inspected for [[malware|malicious code]], prohibited behaviors, malformed [[Packet (information technology)|packet]]s, and [[hacking|hack]] attempts. The '''network cloaking''' function immediately drops all packets from an offending [[IP address]], including the initial request packets, and responses from the protected network. To the perpetrator, the protected network simply appears to be unused, or invisible.
