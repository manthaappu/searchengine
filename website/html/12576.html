The ECB was located in [[Ispra]], [[Italy]].  It was under the responsibility of the [[Institute for Health and Consumer Protection]] (IHCP) of the [[Joint Research Centre]] (JRC) of the [[European Commission]].

== Mission ==
The mission of the ECB was to provide scientific and technical support for the conception, development, implementation and monitoring of EU policies related to dangerous chemicals. It co-ordinateed the EU [[risk assessment]] programmes that covered the risks posed by existing substances and new substances to workers, consumers and the environment. It supported the legal classification and labeling, the notification of new substances, the information exchange on import and export of dangerous substances, the development and harmonization of testing methods and the authorization of [[biocide]]s.<br />

== Biocides ==
The [[Biocides]] Work Area provided scientific and technical support for the approval of active substances in biocidal products as laid down in [[Directive 98/8/EC]] concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market.

== Existing Chemicals ==
The Existing Chemicals Work Area provided technical and scientific support to the Commission concerning the data collection, priority setting, and risk assessment steps of Council Regulation (EEC) 793/93.

== New Chemicals ==
The principal function of the New Chemicals work area were:
* Co-ordination of EU notification scheme and risk assessment for new chemical substances (Directive 67/548/EEC including Annexes VII and VIII, Directive 93/67/EEC).
* Management of the New Chemicals Database (NCD) maintained in a security area with authorised access only.
* Preparation of European LIst of Notified Chemical Substances (ELINCS).
* Supervision of Technical and Scientific Meetings (TSMs) and Working Group Meetings allowing Member State Competent Authorities to discuss issues arising related to implementation of Directives.

== ESIS ==
The [[European chemical Substances Information System]] (ESIS) is an IT system that provides information on chemicals in different lists.
