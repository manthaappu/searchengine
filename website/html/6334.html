'''CitySurf Globe''' is a family of Geography 2.0 [[Geographical Information System]] software, developed by [[PiriReis Bilişim Teknolojileri]], known as a new model in mapping servers and interaction with the final user. 

'''CitySurf Globe''' family models raster data, such as high resolution [[satellite images]] and aerial images, under high speeds using [[digital terrain model]] and vector [[geographical information systems]] and accordingly serves these via internet or local nets. Prepares geographical analyses and arranges the geographical data thanks to its interaction with the final user.

'''CitySurf Globe''' has an [[OpenGL]]-based viewer, which connects to the servers for streaming of content, elevation, satellite and/or airphoto imagery, roads, 3D buildings, points of interest, etc. This is similar to [[Google Earth]], [[Microsoft Virtual Earth]], and [[ArcGIS]] concepts.
