'''Ferret''' is an interactive computer [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]] and analysis environment designed to meet the needs of [[oceanographer]]s and [[meteorologist]]s analyzing large and complex gridded data sets. Ferret offers a Mathematica-like approach to analysis; new variables may be defined interactively as mathematical expressions involving data set variables. Calculations may be applied over arbitrarily shaped regions. Fully documented [[graphics]] are produced with a single command. It runs on most [[Unix]] and [[Linux]] systems using [[X Window]] for display, and on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] XP/NT/9x.
