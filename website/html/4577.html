<html> <head> <title>British undergraduate degree classification</title></head><body>The '''British Undergraduate/Postgraduate degree classification''' system is a [[grade (education)|grading]] scheme for [[undergraduate degree]]s ([[bachelor's degree]]s and [[master's degree]]s) in the [[United Kingdom]]. The system has been applied (sometimes with significant variations) in other countries, such as [[Australia]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Barbados]], [[Canada]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Jamaica]], [[Kenya]], [[Malaysia]], [[Malta]], [[Mauritius]], [[New Zealand]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], [[Singapore]], [[South Africa]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]].

The [[Latin honors|Latin honours]] system used in the [[United States]] is different but has some similarities.

==Degree classification==
A degree may be awarded with or without honours, with the class of an honours degree based on the average mark of the assessed work a candidate has completed. Below is a list of the possible classifications with common abbreviations.

* '''First-class Honours''' (1st)
* '''Second-class Honours, upper division''' (2:1)
* '''Second-class Honours, lower division''' (2:2)
* '''Third-class Honours''' (3rd)
* '''Ordinary-Degree''' (Pass) 

At most institutions the system does allow for a small amount of discretion and candidates may be elevated to the next degree class if their average mark is close or the [[median]] of their weighted marks achieves the higher class and they have submitted many pieces of work worthy of the higher class. However, they may be demoted a class if they fail to pass all parts of the course even if they have a high average.

There are also variations between universities (especially in [[Scotland]], where honours are usually reserved only for courses lasting four years or more, with a three-year course leading to the awarding of an Ordinary degree; ''see [[Master of Arts (Scotland)]]'') and requirements other than the correct average are often needed to be awarded honours. (In Scotland it is possible to start University a year younger than in the rest of the United Kingdom as the Scottish Highers exams are often taken at age seventeen, not eighteen, so four-year courses end at the same chronological age as a rest-of-UK three-year course, assuming no [[gap year]]s.)

When a candidate is awarded a degree with Honours, "(Hons)" may be suffixed to their type of degree, such as BA (Hons), a BSc (Hons) or an MA (Hons). An MA (Hons) would generally indicate a degree award from certain Scottish universities.

At [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], honours classes apply to examinations, not to degrees. Thus, in Cambridge, where undergraduates are examined at the end of each Part (one- or two-year section) of the [[Tripos]], a student may receive different classifications for different Parts. The degree itself does not formally have a class. Most Cambridge graduates use the class of the final Part as the class of the degree, but this is an informal usage. At Oxford, the Final Honour School results are generally applied to the degree.

In some universities, candidates who successfully complete one or more years of degree-level study, but do not complete the full degree course, may be awarded a lower qualification: a [[Certificate of Higher Education]] or [[Higher National Certificate]] for one year of study, or a [[Diploma of Higher Education]] or [[Higher National Diploma]] for two years.

The Graduateship (post-nominal GCGI) and Associateship (post-nominal ACGI) awarded by the [[City & Guilds of London Institute]] are mapped to a British Honours degree.

The Engineering Council Graduate Diploma is set at the same level as the final year of a British BEng.

{{Anchor|First Class Honours}}
===First-class honours===
First-class honours degrees (often simply "firsts") are the highest level of degree awarded and are taken to indicate high academic achievement and ability. 

In most universities, first-class honours are the highest honours that can be achieved, with percentages of graduates achieving a first varying greatly from attended university and course studied. For instance a first class honours degree in Law or Physics can be relatively rare. <ref>[http://www.hesa.ac.uk/index.php/content/view/1100/161/ SFR 117: Higher education student enrollments and qualifications obtained at higher education institutions in the United Kingdom for the academic year 2006/07], ''[[Higher Education Statistics Agency]]'', 10 January 2008</ref>

A minority of universities award first-class honours with particular distinction, informally known as a "Starred First" ([[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[University of York|York]], [[University of East Anglia|UEA]]) or a "Congratulatory First" ([[University of Oxford|Oxford]]). Several of these tend to be awarded each year in certain subjects, depending on the number of candidates deemed worthy of the award; among notable recipients are the writer [[Karen Armstrong]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/passedfailed-an-education-in-the-life-of-karen-armstrong-writer-and-former-nun-406759.html |title=Passed/Failed: An education in the life of Karen Armstrong, writer and former nun - Profiles, People |publisher=The Independent |date=2006-07-06 |accessdate=2010-06-14 | location=London | first=Jonathan | last=Sale}}</ref> the philosopher [[Bernard Williams]], the historians [[Simon Schama]] and [[Quentin Skinner]] and the classicist Bob Cowan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alumni.balliol.ox.ac.uk/news/fd2007/passion_classics.asp |title=Balliol College - Old Members - Floreat Domus, Issue 13, August 2007 |publisher=Alumni.balliol.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref>

===Upper second-class Honours===
The upper division is commonly abbreviated to 2:1 (pronounced ''two-one''). This classification along with first class honours is highly sought after by many firms and academic institutions. Top tier [[bulge bracket]] firms such as Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley seek out graduates with at least 2:1 degrees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goglobal.jpmorgan.com/student/jpmorgan/careers/europe/preintern/springbreak/ |title=JP Morgan Careers |publisher=JP Morgan |date= |accessdate=2010-10-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morganstanley.co.uk/about/careers/careers/programs/print/626.html
 |title=Morgan Stanley Careers |publisher=Morgan Stanley |date= |accessdate=2010-10-18}}</ref>. Similarly, the leading global law firms headquartered both in the USA and UK seek Upper Second Class Honours graduates (and above), such as Slaughter & May, Skadden Arps, Dewey leBoeuf, Linklaters, Allen & Overy and Clifford Chance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aograduate.com/en/Work-For-Us/What-We-Look-For/ |title=Allen & Overy Careers |publisher=Allen & Overy |date= |accessdate=2010-10-17}}</ref>

The percentage of graduates who achieve an upper second class honours can vary widely by degree obtained as well as university attended.<ref name="hesa">[http://www.hesa.ac.uk/dox/dataTables/studentsAndQualifiers/download/quals0506.xls HE qualifications obtained in the UK by level, mode of study, domicile, gender, class of first degree and subject area 2005/06], ''[[Higher Education Statistics Agency]]''</ref>

===Lower second-class Honours===
This is the second division of second class degrees and is abbreviated as 2:2 (pronounced ''two-two'').

===Third-class Honours===
Third-class honours is the lowest honours classification in most modern universities. Until the 1970s, Oxford awarded Fourth-class honours degrees, but did not distinguish between "Upper-Seconds" (2:1s) and "Lower-Seconds" (2:2s), and so still had four classes like other establishments. Roughly 7.2% of students graduating in 2006 with an honours degree received a Third.<ref name=hesa/><ref name="dutton">[[David Dutton]], ''[[Alec Douglas-Home|Douglas-Home]]'' (Haus Publishing Limited, 2006), page 4 ISBN 9-781904-950677</ref>

===Ordinary Degree===
An Ordinary degree is a pass degree without honours. A number of universities offer ordinary degree courses to students, but most students enrol in honours degree courses. Some honours courses permit students who fail the first year by a small margin (around 10%) to transfer to the Ordinary degree. Ordinary degrees are sometimes awarded to honours degree students who do not complete an honours degree course to the very end but complete enough of it to earn a pass.

Scottish universities offer Ordinary degrees as a qualification in its own right, which last three years, as well as an honours degree over four years. This is in contrast to English universities that have honours degree with three years of study, though a similar programme in Scotland is not unheard of, provided a high entrance grade is achieved. An Ordinary degree from a Scottish university (also known as a designated degree) is often sufficient to study a post graduate course.    

An Ordinary degree in Scotland is not therefore, as in England, a failed honours degree.  Students can decide, usually at the end of their second or third year, whether or not they wish to complete a fourth honours year.  Scottish universities may also award their Ordinary degrees with 'distinction' if a student achieves a particularly good grade average, usually 65% or above.  A common example of a Scottish Ordinary degree is the [[Bachelor of Laws]] course taken by graduates of other subjects, as this is sufficient (without honours) for entry to the legal profession.

===Uncommon Degree Classifications===

====Double first====

A "double first" at both Oxford and Cambridge originally referred to first-class honours in two separate subjects in the same set of examinations, usually the [[Classical Tripos|Classical]] and [[Mathematical Tripos|Mathematics]] [[Tripos]]es in Cambridge, or the [[Literae Humaniores]] and [[Mathematics]] [[Final Honours School]]s in Oxford. It was also possible to obtain "double firsts" at [[Honour Moderations]]. Today, the expression is used at Cambridge to describe first-class honours "in two sets of examinations corresponding to two different Parts of Triposes".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/camdata/tripos.html |title=CamDATA: course information and statistics |publisher=University of Cambridge |date= |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref>

The term "double first" is also sometimes informally used to describe first-class honours in both Honour Moderations and the Final Honour School in Oxford in the same subject, but this usage is considered improper by some writers.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Balsdon |first1=Dacre |authorlink1=John Percy Vyvian Dacre Balsdon |title=Oxford Now and Then |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HDY8AAAAIAAJ |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate=2010-10-16 |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=1970 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Duckworth |location=London |isbn=  |page=20 |pages= |at= |quote=The expression is used legitimately today of anyone who takes a First in two Final Honours Schools, say in Lit. Hum. and in Law. It is improperly used of a man who takes Firsts in Moderations and Finals.}}</ref> Such "double firsts" are unknown in subjects where Moderations or a Preliminary Examination are sat instead of Honour Moderations, because no honours are awarded - the highest award in those exams is known instead as a distinction.

A  "double first" can also signify that a candidate has achieved [[First Class Honours]] in both subjects of a [[Joint Honours]] degree.

====Aegrotat====

A candidate who is unable to take his or her exams because of illness can sometimes be awarded an [[aegrotat]] degree; this is an honours degree without classification, awarded on the understanding that had the candidate been well, he or she would have passed.

==International comparisons==
	 
	
An approximate mapping between UK classifications and [[Academic grading in the United States#Grade point average|US Grade Point Averages]] can be inferred from the [[University College London]] graduate admissions criteria.<ref name="UCL GPA">[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate-study/application-admission/general-entrance-requirement General entrance requirements], ''[[University College London]]''</ref> Canadian GPAs differ; the ''UK Graduate Admissions Fact Sheet'' from [[McGill University]] states that in their system, where standings are reported in lieu of an average, a CGPA (cumulative grade point average) is determined.<ref name="McGill equiv">[http://www.mcgill.ca/gradapplicants/apply/prepare/requirements/internationaldegree/europe/ Future graduate students: European Fact Sheets], ''[[McGill University]]''</ref> However, different universities convert grades differently. UCL's system is at odds with [[London School of Economics and Political Science|LSE]], which for example considers GPA (US) of 3.5 as equivalent to a 2.1.<ref name="LSE entrance requirement">[http://www2.lse.ac.uk/graduateProspectus2010/entryRequirements/Home.aspx#generated-subheading1 International entrance requirement]''[[London School of Economics and Political Science|LSE]]''</ref> Also most Oxbridge departments consider a 3.8 the equivalent of a First; see for instance English Language and Literature post graduate requirement at Oxford.<ref name="Oxford English Language and Literature entrance requirement">[http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/postgraduate_courses/course_guide/english_language_.html Oxford Prospectus 2010/2011]''[[Oxford University]]''</ref> Grade equivalents given by [[WES]],<ref name="WES conversion">[http://www.wes.org/gradeconversionguide/index.asp: WES GPA conversion ]''[WES]''</ref> World Educational Services, which provide qualification conversion services to many Universities, also converts UK degrees to higher GPAs than the conversion used by UCL, if the guidelines for converting grades to GPA given by [[Duke University]]<ref name="Duke grade to GPA conversion">[http://gradschool.duke.edu/admissions/requirements/ugpa.php Calculation of GPA using Grades]''[[Duke University]]''</ref> are used. Another comparison of UK degree with US used by [[Carnegie Mellon]], [[Virginia Commonwealth University]], [[Texas A & M University]], [[CHN University Netherlands]], [[Georgetown University]] and [[University of Exeter]] can be seen here.<ref name="Exeter comparison">[http://offices.exeter.ac.uk/international/staff/Qualifications_Guide/qatar.shtml]''Exeter University International Comparisons''</ref> Interestingly, this conversion is very similar to that given by WES and Duke, and that used by LSE and Oxbridge. 
It should be noted that there is no hard and fast rule of converting the degrees, as obviously different institutions compare differently.

BA (Hons) degrees attained in Britain are at the level of NQF 6 - where the BA and Honours degrees exist. MA degrees are at NQF 7 and PhD degrees are at level NQF 8. Other countries, specifically South Africa, equate different NQF levels to degrees: for instance, a Masters degree in South Africa is at NQF 8, while a doctoral degree is at NQF 9. The reason for this difference in NQF levels is that South Africa requires students to undertake a fourth year, or an Honours degree, between their Bachelors and Masters degree. SAQA, the South African Qualifications Accreditation company, compares international degrees with local degrees before any international student continues their studies in that country. While the UK degree accreditation and classification system allows students to go straight from a three year Bachelors degree onto a Masters degree, South Africa does not do so, unless the student has proven research capabilities. South African Honours degrees prepare the students to undertake a research-specific degree (in terms of Masters), by spending an in-depth year (up to 5 modules) creating research proposals and undertaking a research project of limited scope. This prepares students for the research degrees later in their academic career.

==Progression to postgraduate study==
Regulations governing the progression of undergraduate degree graduates to postgraduate programmes vary between universities, and are often flexible. A candidate for a postgraduate [[master's degree]] is usually required to have at least a 2:2 degree, although candidates with 2:1s are in a considerably stronger position to gain a place on a postgraduate course and to obtain funding. Some institutions specify a 2:1 minimum for certain types of master's program, such as for a [[Master of Research]] course.<ref>[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/gsprospectus/applying/entry.html Entrance requirements: Graduate Prospectus 2010–11], ''[[University of Cambridge]]'', September 2009</ref><ref>[https://lfylive.lse.ac.uk/lfy/tc/enquiries/enquiry.html?a=4&q=565 What are the entry requirements for graduate programmes at LSE?], ''[[London School of Economics]]''</ref>

Candidates with a Third or ordinary degree are sometimes accepted, provided they have acquired satisfactory professional experience subsequent to graduation. A candidate for a [[doctorate|doctoral]] programme who does not hold a [[master's degree]] is nearly always required to have a First or 2:1. 
On the whole, postgraduate funding opportunities vary according to institution, field, entry requirements and candidate degree classification. The diverse range of opportunities available is such that in many cases a lower class of degree does not necessarily preclude candidates from postgraduate funding.

==Medical degrees==
In Britain, [[medicine]] is taught as an undergraduate course and, upon successful completion of the course, the graduate holds the conjoined degrees of [[Bachelor of Medicine,]] and [[Bachelor of Surgery]] (MB BS or MB ChB; chirurgery meaning surgery); in some cases Bachelor in the Art of Obstetrics (BAO) is added to the formal name of these degrees.  These degrees cannot be awarded separately.  By tradition these graduates are addressed as 'doctor', the only example in the United Kingdom for people with bachelor's degrees.

Unlike most undergraduate degrees, MBBS is not awarded in classes (i.e., there are no first, second or third class honours MBBS degrees). Individual degrees are marked as pass, fail or merit (which is the equivalent of a first in most other degrees, although the system varies between medical schools). Results of final examinations in fourth or fifth year split the year groups into one of four quartiles. These quartiles allocate base points for NHS job applications where the top quartile awards 40 points, decreasing by two points for the second quartiles and again for the third and fourth.

Distinctions can be awarded for certain parts of the course to the best students (who will usually have several merits already). Honours are awarded at some institutions for exceptional performance throughout the course.

The Bachelor of Medicine awarded in the UK is equivalent to the Doctor of Medicine (MD) in the US, Canada, etc.  In contrast, the degree of Doctor of Medicine (MD) in the UK  is a doctorate earned by research and thesis, similar to a PhD in most universities. About 5% of medical doctors in the UK hold both MBBS / MBBChB plus either an MD or a PhD.  In some UK universities, because it is unsupervised, the MD is considered to be a higher doctorate.

==Undergraduate degree honours slang==<!-- This section is linked from [[Cockney rhyming slang]] -->
A form of [[rhyming slang]] has developed from degree classes, usually using names of famous people. Due to the conventions of rhyming slang, only the person's first name is used, the last name referencing the degree by rhyming with it.<ref name="bbc">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/1060952.stm Student slang leaves parents dazed], ''[[BBC News Online]]'', 8 December 2000</ref>

* A Third is known as a "Douglas" or a "Thora" after [[Douglas Hurd]]<ref name=bbc/> or [[Thora Hird]]<ref name=dailymail/>; it is also sometimes called a "Gentleman's Degree"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2009/aug/01/third-class-degrees|title=Getting the third degree|author=Louise Tickle|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=2009-08-01|accessdate=2010-09-03 | location=London}}</ref>. A Third is also known as a ''Richard'' after the monarch [[Richard III of England|Richard III]]. However, this is used primarily as a derogatory term, due to the more common [[cultural depictions of Richard III of England#Other|meaning of that term]], a reference in rhyming slang to the word [[turd]].<ref>[http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/301800.html Richard the Third], ''The Phrase Finder''</ref> Getting a third in each year of your degree is referred to as a 'Vorderman' after the British television celebrity [[Carol Vorderman]] who managed this unusual feat when studying Engineering at [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]].<ref>[http://education.independent.co.uk/higher/article328872.ece Degree classification: Have the Desmond and Vorderman had their day?], ''[[The Independent]]'', 24 November 2005</ref> Achieving three consecutive third-class passes is also sometimes known as joining the "Nines Club"
* At Cambridge, achieving a Third at Part I followed by a First at Part II is known as a "Zadie", after the novelist [[Zadie Smith]] who achieved this in English Literature at [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]]{{fact|never heard this piece of whimsy myself, though I knew ZS a little as a student, and by coincidence myself got a third in part I and a first in part II|date=January 2011}}
