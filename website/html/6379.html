'''CLN''' is a [[free software|free]] [[Library (computing)|library]] for [[arbitrary precision arithmetic]]. It operates on signed [[integer]]s, [[rational numbers]], [[floating point]] numbers, [[complex numbers]], [[modular arithmetic|modular]] numbers, and univariate [[polynomial]]s. Its implementation [[programming language]] is [[C++]].

CLN uses [[object oriented]] techniques and [[operator overloading]] to achieve a natural [[algebra]]ic syntax: The sum ''x'' of two variables ''a'' and ''b'' is written as ''x''=''a''+''b'', as opposed to the function sum(&''x'',''a'',''b'').

CLN uses [[Inheritance (computer science)|class inheritance]] to model the natural [[subset]]s of the available number types: E.g. the integer class is a subtype of the rational class, just as the integer numbers are a subset of the rational numbers. The complex numbers and all its subtypes behave exactly like the types of numbers known to the [[Common Lisp]] language, giving CLN another meaning: it becomes an abbreviation of ''Common Lisp Numbers''. Due to this, CLN can be and is used for implementations of Common Lisp, other interpreted languages, or [[computer algebra system]]s.

The implementation is efficient. It can be configured to use the [[GNU Multi-Precision Library]] as kernel for speed-critical [[inner loop]]s and implements advanced algorithms like [[Schönhage-Strassen algorithm|Schönhage-Strassen multiplication]], [[binary splitting]] and others. All CLN objects are either immediate or [[Reference counting|reference counted]], providing for non-interruptive [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] with no burden on the main application.
