<html> <head> <title>The Magic Words are Squeamish Ossifrage</title></head><body>The text "'''The Magic Words are Squeamish Ossifrage'''" was the solution to a challenge [[ciphertext]] posed by the inventors of the [[RSA]] [[cipher]] in 1977. The problem appeared in [[Martin Gardner]]'s ''[[Mathematical Games]]'' column in ''[[Scientific American]]''. It was solved in 1993&ndash;1994 by a large joint computer project co-ordinated by [[Derek Atkins]], [[Michael Graff]], [[Arjen Lenstra]] and [[Paul Leyland]]. More than 600 volunteers contributed [[Central processing unit|CPU]] time from about 1,600 machines (two of which were [[fax]] machines) over six months. The coordination was done via the [[Internet]] and was one of the first such projects.

Ossifrage is an older name for the [[lammergeier]], a scavenging vulture that is famous for dropping animal bones and live tortoises onto rocks to crack them open.  It might perhaps be considered among the least squeamish of creatures. The 1993-1994 effort began the tradition of using the words "squeamish ossifrage" in [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalytic]] challenges.

The difficulty of breaking the RSA cipher &mdash; recovering a [[plaintext]] message given a ciphertext and the public key &mdash; is connected to the difficulty of [[integer factorization|factoring]] large numbers. While it is not known if the two problems are mathematically equivalent, factoring is currently the only method of directly breaking RSA. The [[decryption]] of the 1977 ciphertext involved the factoring of a 129-digit number, [[RSA-129]], in order to recover the [[plaintext]].

[[Ron Rivest]] estimated in 1977 that factoring a 125-digit number would require 40 [[1000000000000000 (number)|quadrillion]] years, even with the highly conservative assumption that [[modular multiplication]] could be carried out in a [[nanosecond]]; he therefore then believed that RSA-129 could never be broken in practice. What he failed to take into account was the possibility of progress in factoring [[algorithm]]s, and a lot of progress was made in the following decades. Atkins et al. used the [[quadratic sieve]] algorithm invented by [[Carl Pomerance]] in 1981. While the asymptotically faster [[number field sieve]] had just been invented, it was not clear at the time that it would be better than the quadratic sieve for 129-digit numbers. The memory requirements of the newer algorithm were also a concern.

There was a US$100 prize associated with the challenge, which the winners donated to the [[Free Software Foundation]].

==In popular culture==
In the anime ''[[Summer Wars]]'', the encrypted text whose decryption leads to the hacking of OZ begins with the words "The magic words are squeamish ossifrage."
