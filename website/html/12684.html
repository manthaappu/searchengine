<html> <head> <title>Evidential reasoning approach</title></head><body>In [[decision theory]], the '''evidential reasoning approach (ER)''', is a generic evidence-based [[multi-criteria decision analysis]] (MCDA) approach for dealing with problems having both quantitative and qualitative criteria under various uncertainties including ignorance and randomness. It has been used to support various [[decision analysis]], assessment and [[evaluation]] activities such as [[environmental impact assessment]]<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ejor.2004.09.059 |author=Wang Y.M., Yang J.B., Xu D.L. |title=Environmental Impact Assessment Using the Evidential Reasoning Approach |journal=European Journal of Operational Research |volume=174 |issue=3 |pages=1885–1913 |year=2006 }}</ref> and organizational [[self-assessment]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Siow C.H.R., Yang J.B., Dale B.G. |title=A new modelling framework for organisational self-assessment: development and application |journal=Quality Management Journal |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=34–47 |year=2001 }}</ref> based on a range of [[EFQM|quality models]]. 

== Overview ==
The evidential reasoning approach is recently developed on the basis of decision theory in particular [[utility theory]],<ref>{{cite book |author=Keeney, R.L., Raiffa, H. |title=Decisions with Multiple Objectives |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1976 |isbn=0521438837 }}</ref> artificial intelligence in particular the theory of evidence<ref>{{cite book |author=Shafer, G.A. |title=Mathematical Theory of Evidence |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1976 |isbn=0691081751 }}</ref>, [[statistical analysis]] and [[computer]] technology. It uses a [[belief structure]] to model an assessment with uncertainty, a [[belief decision matrix]] to represent an MCDA problem under uncertainty, evidential reasoning algorithms<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/TSMCA.2002.802746 |author=Yang J.B., Xu D.L. |title=On the evidential reasoning algorithm for multiple attribute decision analysis under  uncertainty |journal=IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics Part A: Systems and Humans |volume=32 |pages=289–304 |year=2002 }}</ref> to aggregate criteria for generating distributed assessments, and the concepts of the belief and plausibility functions to generate a utility interval for measuring the degree of ignorance. A conventional [[Decision Matrix|decision matrix]] used for modeling an MCDA problem is a special case of a belief decision matrix<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ejor.2005.02.064 |author=Xu D.L., Yang J.B., Wang Y.M. |title=The ER approach for multi-attribute decision analysis under interval uncertainties |journal=European Journal of Operational Research |volume=174 |issue=3 |pages=1914–43 |year=2006 }}</ref>.

The use of belief decision matrices for MCDA problem modelling in the ER approach results in the following features:
# An assessment of an option can be more reliably and realistically represented by a belief decision matrix than by a conventional decision matrix. 
# It accepts data of different formats with various types of uncertainties as inputs, such as single numerical values, probability distribution, and subjective judgments with belief degrees.  
# It allows all available information embedded in different data formats, including qualitative and incomplete data, to be maximally incorporated in assessment and decision making processes.
# It allows assessment outcomes to be represented more informatively.

The ER approach is implemented in a software tool called [http://www.e-ids.co.uk Intelligent Decision System].
