<html> <head> <title>Boot flag</title></head><body>A '''boot flag''' is a 1-[[byte]] value in a non-extended partition record, within a [[master boot record]]. Its primary function is to indicate to a [[MS-DOS]]/[[MS Windows]]-type [[boot loader]] which partition to boot. In some cases it is used by Windows XP/2000 to [[Drive letter assignment|assign]] the active partition, the letter "C:".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goodells.net/multiboot/partsigs.htm|title=Fixing Windows 2000/XP Drive Letters|work=Understanding MultiBooting and Booting Windows from an Extended Partition}}</ref> The '''active partition''' is the partition where the boot flag is set. 

Other [[boot loader]]s used by third-party [[boot manager]]s (such as [[GRUB]] or [[XOSL]]), can be installed to a [[master boot record]] and can boot primary or extended partitions, which do not have the boot flag set.

The boot flag appears in a [[disk editor]] at the beginning of a [[Master_boot_record#MBRs_and_disk_partitioning|partition record]], as the value 0x80. A value of 0x00 indicates the partition does not have the boot flag set. Any other value is invalid.
