The '''Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council''' ('''EPSRC''') is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Research Council]] that provides [[UK government|government]] funding for grants to undertake [[research]] and postgraduate degrees in [[engineering]] and the [[physical sciences]] (including [[mathematics]], [[artificial intelligence]] and [[computer science]]), mainly to [[university|universities]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The head office is in [[Swindon]], [[Wiltshire]] in the same building ([http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/findus/default.htm Polaris House]) that houses the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]], [[Natural Environment Research Council]], [[Research Councils UK]], and the [[UK Space Agency]].

==History==
EPSRC was created in 1994. It was formerly a part of the [[Science and Engineering Research Council]] (SERC).

==Structure==
Former [[Network Rail]]'s chief executive [[John Armitt]] was appointed the Chairman of the EPSRC from 1 April 2007  for four years. He succeeded Dame [[Julia Higgins]].

As of September 2007 the chief executive and deputy chair of EPSRC is [[David Delpy]] FRS, a [[medical physics|medical physicist]] and formerly vice provost at [[University College London]] [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0705/07053002].

==Functions==
In addition to funding academic research projects, the EPSRC also funds [[Doctoral_Training_Centre|Doctoral Training Centres (DTCs)]] (now sometimes also referred to as Centres for Doctoral Training or CDTs).  These deliver four-year doctoral training programmes to cohorts of PhD students studying within UK universities, and are funded to target specific areas of research for which there is recognised need. In 2008, the EPSRC has announced funding for 44 new DTCs spanning its entire remit.<ref name=NewDTCs>[http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/PostgraduateTraining/Centres/NewCentres.htm New Centres for Doctoral Training - December 2008], from EPSRC's site</ref><ref name="DTC University">,{{cite web|url= http://www.uel.ac.uk/studentservices/moneymatters/pgstudents.htm|title= UEL - DTC University}}</ref>
