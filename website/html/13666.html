“First-Year Composition” is the name of core curriculum courses in [[North American]] colleges.  They focus on improving a student’s ability to write at the university level. These courses are traditionally required of incoming students, thus the previous name, "Freshman Composition". First Year Composition is a discipline of [[Composition studies|Composition Studies]].

==Structure of Modern First Year Composition==

First Year Composition is designed so that it meets the goals for successful completion set forth by the [http://www.wpacouncil.org/ Council of Writing Program Administrators]. To reach these goals, students learn specific material in both semesters of First Year Composition.

===First Semester Composition===

First Year Composition (FYC)courses are structured in a variety of ways.  Some institutions of higher education require only one semester of FYC, while others requires two or three courses. Some courses continue to help students learn to write in modes, which are types of essays that are often named for their organizational pattern or apparent purpose, such as:

*Evaluation
*Classification
*Contrast
*Comparison
*Cause and Effect
*[[Definition]]
*Process
*[[Narrative]]
*Description

However, composition professionals, including those with degrees in Writing Studies and Rhetoric and Composition, will focus on a much more rhetorical approach to help students learn how to apply an understanding of audience, purpose, context, invention, and style to their writing processes.

===Basic Writing===

[[Basic writing|Basic Writing]] is a division of Composition Studies that strives to bring students entering college to a more complete understanding of the rhetorical aspects of the writing process.

== First Year Composition and Rhetoric ==

With the publication of James Kinneavy's ''Theory of Discourse'' in 1971, English departments began incorporating [[rhetoric]] into their composition classrooms.<ref>Clark, Irene. ''Concepts in Composition: Theory and Practice in the Teaching of Writing.'' Mahweh, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2003. p 6.</ref> In doing this, composition instructors have placed more emphasis on teaching audience awareness, Aristotle's three appeals (''ethos'', ''pathos'', and ''logos'') and teaching Kinneavy's modes of discourse.
