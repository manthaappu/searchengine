The '''Perl Shell''' (psh) is a [[command line interface|command line]] environment that can be used as the user's primary post-login [[Shell (computing)|shell]] on [[Unix-like]] operating systems.

Being itself written in [[Perl]], psh can also be used under [[Microsoft Windows]] (with or without [[Cygwin]] or [[Interix]]) and other operating systems.  Packages are available for [[Linux distribution]]s like [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], though on most systems it can be installed from [[CPAN]] by simply issuing the following command:

<source lang="bash">
perl -MCPAN -e 'install Psh'
</source>

== Features ==
Perl Shell combines aspects of [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]] (and other [[Unix shell]]s) with the power of Perl scripting.

== Code examples ==
 ls | s/y/k/                    # Substitution via [[Perl Compatible Regular Expression|PCRE]].
 ls | { print ++$i, ": $_"; }q  # Iterate over lines.
 [[netstat]] | { $_[1]>2; }g        # [[Grep]]-ish.
