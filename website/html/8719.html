A '''curtain wall''' is an outer covering of a building in which the outer walls are non-structural, but merely keep out the weather.  As the curtain wall is non-structural it can be made of a lightweight material reducing construction costs.  When glass is used as the curtain wall, a great advantage is that natural light can penetrate deeper within the building. The curtain wall [[façade]] does not carry any [[dead and live loads|dead load weight]] from the building other than its own dead load weight.  The wall transfers horizontal wind loads that are incident upon it to the main building structure through connections at floors or columns of the building. A curtain [[wall]] is designed to resist air and water infiltration, sway induced by wind and [[seismic]] forces acting on the building, and its own dead load weight forces.

Curtain walls are typically designed with extruded aluminum members, although the first curtain walls were made of steel. The aluminium frame is typically infilled with glass, which provides an architecturally pleasing building, as well as benefits such as [[daylighting]]. However, parameters related to solar gain control such as [[thermal comfort]] and visual comfort are more difficult to control when using highly-glazed curtain walls. Other common [[infill]]s include: stone veneer, metal panels, [[Louver|louvers]], and operable windows or vents.

Curtain walls differ from store-front systems in that they are designed to span multiple floors, and take into consideration design requirements such as: thermal expansion and contraction; [[tuned mass damper|building sway]] and movement; water diversion; and thermal efficiency for cost-effective heating, cooling, and lighting in the building.

==History==
[[Image:Oriel_chambers.jpg|thumb|right|Oriel Chambers, Liverpool, England,1864. The world's first glass curtain walled building. The stone mullions are decorative.]]

[[Image:Partially completed buildings in Wuhan.jpg|thumb|right|A building project in [[Wuhan]] China, the difference in progress between the two towers illustrates the relationship between the inner load bearing structure and the exterior glass curtain.]]
Prior to the middle of the nineteenth century, buildings were constructed with the exterior walls of the building (bearing walls, typically masonry) supporting the load of the entire structure. The development and widespread use of structural steel and later reinforced concrete allowed relatively small columns to support large loads and the exterior walls of buildings were no longer required for structural support. The exterior walls could be non-load bearing and thus much lighter and more open than the masonry load bearing walls of the past.  This gave way to increased use of glass as an exterior façade and the modern day curtain wall was born.

[[Oriel Chambers]] in [[Liverpool]], [[England]], was the world's first metal framed glass curtain walled building in 1864, followed by [[16 Cook Street]], [[Liverpool]], in 1866. Both buildings were designed and built by local architect [[Peter Ellis (architect)|Peter Ellis]].  The extensive glass walls allowed light to penetrate further into the building utilising more floor space and reducing lighting costs in short winter months.  [[Oriel Chambers]] comprises {{convert|43000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} set over a maximum of five floors as the elevator had not been invented.<ref name="Oriel Chambers History">{{cite web|url=http://www.orielchambers.co.uk/#/411|title=History|publisher=Oriel Chambers|accessdate=27 July 2009}}</ref>  

Some of the first curtain walls were made with steel [[mullions]] and the plate glass was attached to the mullions with asbestos or fiberglass modified glazing compound. Eventually [[silicone]] [[sealant]]s or glazing tape were substituted. Some designs included an outer cap to hold the glass in place and to protect the integrity of the seals. The [[Lever House|first curtain wall]] installed in [[New York City]] was this type of construction. Earlier [[modernist]] examples are the [[Bauhaus]] in [[Dessau]] and the [[Hallidie Building]] in [[San Francisco]].

The 1970’s began the widespread use of aluminum [[extrusion]]s for mullions. Aluminum offers the unique advantage of being able to be easily extruded into nearly any shape required for design and aesthetic purposes. Today, the design complexity and shapes available are nearly limitless. Custom shapes can be designed and manufactured with relative ease.

Similarly, sealing methods and types have evolved over the years, and as a result, today’s curtain walls are high performance systems which require little maintenance.

;Stick systems
The vast majority of curtain walls are installed long pieces (referred to as ''sticks'') between floors vertically and between vertical members horizontally. Framing members may be fabricated in a shop, but all installation and [[glazing in architecture|glazing]] is typically performed at the jobsite.

;Unitized systems
Unitized curtain walls entail factory fabrication and assembly of panels and may include factory glazing. These completed units are hung on the building structure to form the building enclosure.  Unitized curtain wall has the advantages of: speed; lower field installation costs; and quality control within an interior climate controlled environment. The economic benefits are typically realized on large projects or in areas of high field labor rates.

;Rainscreen principle
A common feature in curtain wall technology, the rainscreen principle theorizes that equilibrium of air pressure between the outside and inside of the "rainscreen" prevents water penetration into the building itself. For example the glass is captured between an inner and an outer gasket in a space called the glazing rebate. The glazing rebate is ventilated to the exterior so that the pressure on the inner and outer sides of the exterior gasket is the same. When the pressure is equal across this gasket water cannot be drawn through joints or defects in the gasket.

==Design==
Curtain wall systems must be designed to handle all loads imposed on it as well as keep air and water from penetrating the building envelope.  

===Loads===
The loads imposed on the curtain wall are transferred to the building structure through the anchors which attach the mullions to the building. The building structure design must account for these loads.

;Dead load
''Dead load'' is defined as the weight of structural elements and the permanent features on the structure. In the case of curtain walls, this load is made up of the weight of the mullions, anchors and other structural components of the curtain wall, as well as the weight of the infill material.  Additional dead loads imposed on the curtain wall, such as sunshades, must be accounted for in the design of the curtain wall components and anchors.

;Wind load
''Wind load'' acting on the building is the result of wind blowing on the building. This [[wind]] [[pressure]] must be resisted by the curtain wall system since it envelops and protects the building.  Wind loads vary greatly throughout the world, with the largest wind loads being near the coast in [[hurricane]]-prone regions. For each project location, [[building code]]s specify the required design wind loads. Often, a [[wind tunnel]] study is performed on large or unusually shaped buildings. A scale model of the building and the surrounding vicinity is built and placed in a wind tunnel to determine the wind pressures acting on the structure in question. These studies take into account [[vortex shedding]] around corners and the effects of surrounding area

;Seismic load
''Seismic loads'' need to be addressed in the design of curtain wall components and anchors. In most situations, the curtain wall is able to naturally withstand [[seismology|seismic]] and wind induced building sway because of the space provided between the glazing infill and the mullion. In tests, standard curtain wall systems are able to withstand three inches (75 mm) of relative floor movement without glass breakage or water leakage. Anchor design needs to be reviewed, however, since a large floor-to-floor displacement can place high forces on anchors. (Additional structure must be provided within the primary structure of the building to resist seismic forces from the building itself.) 

;Snow load
''Snow loads'' and [[dead and live loads|live loads]] are not typically an issue in curtain walls, since curtain walls are designed to be vertical or slightly inclined. If the slope of a wall exceeds 20 degrees or so, these loads may need to be considered.

;Thermal load
''Thermal loads'' are induced in a curtain wall system because [[aluminum]] has a relatively high [[coefficient of thermal expansion]]. This means that over the span of a couple of floors, the curtain wall will expand and contract some distance, relative to its length and the temperature differential. This expansion and contraction is accounted for by cutting horizontal mullions slightly short and allowing a space between the horizontal and vertical mullions.  In unitized curtain wall, a gap is left between units, which is sealed from air and water penetration by wiper [[gaskets]]. Vertically, anchors carrying wind load only (not dead load) are slotted to account for movement.  Incidentally, this slot also accounts for live load deflection and [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] in the floor slabs of the building structure.

;Blast load
Accidental explosions and terrorist threats have brought on increased concern for the fragility of a curtain wall system in relation to blast loads. The bombing of the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]] in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]], has spawned much of the current research and mandates in regards to building response to blast loads. Currently, all new federal buildings in the U.S. and all U.S. embassies built on foreign soil, must have some provision for resistance to bomb blasts.

Since the curtain wall is at the exterior of the building, it becomes the first line of defense in a bomb attack. As such, blast resistant curtain walls must be designed to withstand such forces without compromising the interior of the building to protect its occupants. Since blast loads are very high loads with short durations, the curtain wall response should be analyzed in a [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] load analysis, with full-scale [[mock-up]] testing performed prior to design completion and installation.

Blast resistant glazing consists of [[laminated glass]], which is meant to break but not separate from the mullions. Similar technology is used in [[hurricane]]-prone areas for the protection from wind-borne debris.

===Infiltration===
''Air infiltration'' is the air which passes through the curtain wall from the exterior to the interior of the building. The air is infiltrated through the gaskets, through imperfect joinery between the horizontal and vertical [[mullions]], through [[weep hole]]s, and through imperfect sealing.  The American Architectural Manufacturers Association (AAMA) is an industry trade group in the U.S. that has developed voluntary specifications regarding acceptable levels of air infiltration through a curtain wall .  This limit is expressed (in America) in cubic feet per minute per square foot of wall area at a given test pressure. (Currently, most standards cite less than 0.6 CFM/sq ft as acceptable.) Testing is typically conducted by an independent third party agency using the ASTM E-783 standard.

''Water penetration'' is defined as any water passing from the exterior of the building through to the interior of the curtain wall system. Sometimes, depending on the building [[specifications]], a small amount of controlled water on the interior is deemed acceptable. AAMA Voluntary Specifications allow for water on the interior, while the underlying ASTM E - 1105 test standard would disqualify a test subject if any water is seen inside. To test the ability of a curtain wall to withstand water penetration, a water rack is placed in front a mock-up of the wall with a positive air pressure applied to the wall. This represents a wind driven heavy rain on the wall.  Field quality control checks are also performed on installed curtain walls, in which a calibrated spray nozzle is used to spray water on the curtain wall for a specified time in order to investigate known leaks or leading up to a validation test like the ASTM E-1105.

===Deflection===
One of the disadvantages of using aluminum for mullions is that its [[modulus of elasticity]] is about one-third that of steel. This translates to three times more [[deflection]] in an aluminum mullion compared to the same steel section under a given a load. Building specifications set deflection limits for perpendicular (wind-induced) and in-plane (dead load-induced) deflections. It is important to note that these deflection limits are not imposed due to strength capacities of the mullions.  Rather, they are designed to limit deflection of the glass (which may break under excessive deflection), and to ensure that the glass does not come out of its pocket in the mullion. Deflection limits are also necessary to control movement at the interior of the curtain wall. Building construction may be such that there is a wall located near the mullion, and excessive deflection can cause the mullion to contact the wall and cause damage. Also, if deflection of a wall is quite noticeable, public perception may raise undue concern that the wall is not strong enough.  

Deflection limits are typically expressed as the distance between anchor points divided by a constant number. A deflection limit of L/175 is common in curtain wall specifications, based on experience with deflection limits that are unlikely to cause damage to the glass held by the mullion. Say a given curtain wall is anchored at 12 foot (144 in) floor heights.  The allowable deflection would then be 144/175 = 0.823 inches, which means the wall is allowed to deflect inward or outward a maximum of 0.823 inches at the maximum wind pressure.  HOWEVER, some panels require stricter movement restrictions, or certainly those that prohibit a torque-like motion.

Deflection in mullions is controlled by different shapes and depths of curtain wall members. The depth of a given curtain wall system is usually controlled by the [[second moment of area|area moment of inertia]] required to keep deflection limits under the specification. Another way to limit deflections in a given section is to add steel reinforcement to the inside tube of the mullion. Since steel deflects at 1/3 the rate of aluminum, the steel will resist much of the load at a lower cost or smaller depth.

===Strength===
Strength (or maximum usable [[Stress (physics)|stress]]) available to a particular material is not related to its material stiffness (the material property governing [[deflection]]); it is a separate criterion in curtain wall [[structural design|design]] and [[structural analysis|analysis]].  This often affects the selection of materials and sizes for design of the system.  For instance, a particular shape in aluminum will deflect almost three times as much as the same steel shape for an equivalent load (see above), though its strength (i.e. the maximum load it can sustain) may be equivalent or even slightly higher, depending on the grade of [[aluminum]].  Because aluminum is often the material of choice, given its lower [[unit weight]] and better [[weathering]] capability as compared with steel, deflection is usually the governing criteria in curtain wall design.

===Thermal criteria===
Relative to other building components, aluminum has a high heat transfer coefficient, meaning that aluminum is a very good [[heat conduction|conductor]] of heat. This translates into high heat loss through aluminum curtain wall mullions.
There are several ways to compensate for this heat loss, the most common way being the addition of thermal breaks. ''[[Thermal break]]s'' are barriers between exterior metal and interior metal, usually made of [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC). These breaks provide a significant decrease in the thermal conductivity of the curtain wall. However, since the thermal break interrupts the aluminum mullion, the overall moment of inertia of the mullion is reduced and must be accounted for in the structural analysis of the system.

Thermal conductivity of the curtain wall system is important because of heat loss through the wall, which affects the heating and cooling costs of the building. On a poorly performing curtain wall, [[condensation]] may form on the interior of the mullions. This could cause damage to adjacent interior trim and walls.

Rigid [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] is provided in [[spandrel]] areas to provide a higher [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] at these locations.

==Infills==
''Infill'' refers to the large panels that are inserted into the curtain wall between mullions. Infills are typically glass but may be made up of nearly any exterior building element.

Regardless of the material, infills are typically referred to as ''glazing'', and the installer of the infill is referred to as a ''[[glazier]]''.  More commonly this trade is now known as Fenestration.

===Glass===
[[Image:Serre cactees JdP.jpg|thumb|left|The French [[greenhouse|hothouse]] at the [[Jardin des Plantes]], built by [[Charles Rohault de Fleury]] from 1834 to 1836, is an early example of metal and glass curtain wall architecture.]]
By far the most common glazing type, [[float glass|glass]] can be of an almost infinite combination of color, thickness, and [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]]. 
For commercial construction, the two most common thicknesses are 1/4 inch (6 mm) monolithic and 1 inch (25 mm) [[Insulated glazing|insulating glass]]. Presently, 1/4 inch glass is typically used only in [[spandrel]] areas, while insulating glass is used for the rest of the building (sometimes spandrel glass is specified as insulating glass as well). The 1 inch insulation glass is typically made up of two 1/4-inch lites of glass with a 1/2 inch (12 mm) airspace. The air inside is usually atmospheric air, but some [[inert gas]]es, such as argon, may be used to offer better [[thermal transmittance]] values. In residential construction, thicknesses commonly used are 1/8 inch (3 mm) monolithic and 5/8 inch (16 mm) insulating glass. Larger thicknesses are typically employed for buildings or areas with higher thermal, [[relative humidity]], or [[Acoustic transmission|sound transmission]] requirements, such as laboratory areas or [[recording studio]]s.

Glass may be used which is [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]], [[translucent]], or opaque, or in varying degrees thereof. ''Transparent'' glass usually refers to ''vision'' glass in a curtain wall. Spandrel or vision glass may also contain translucent glass, which could be for security or aesthetic purposes.  ''Opaque'' glass is used in areas to hide a column or spandrel beam or shear wall behind the curtain wall. Another method of hiding spandrel areas is through ''shadow box'' construction (providing a dark enclosed space behind the transparent or translucent glass). Shadow box construction creates a perception of depth behind the glass that is sometimes desired.

===Fabric veneer===
Fabric is another type of material which is common for curtain walls. Fabric is often times much less expensive and serves as a less permanent solution. Unlike glass or stone, fabric is much faster to install, less expensive, and often times much easier to modify after it is installed. 

===Stone veneer===
Thin blocks (3 to 4 inches (75-100 mm)) of stone can be inset within a curtain wall system to provide architectural flavor. The type of stone used is limited only by the strength of the stone and the ability to manufacture it in the proper shape and size. Common stone types used are: [http://www.arriscraft.com Arriscraft](calcium silicate);[[granite]]; [[marble]]; [[travertine]]; and [[limestone]].

===Panels===
Metal panels can take various forms including aluminum plate; thin composite panels consisting of two thin aluminum sheets sandwiching a thin plastic interlayer; and panels consisting of metal sheets bonded to rigid insulation, with or without an inner metal sheet to create a sandwich panel. Other opaque panel materials include [[fiber-reinforced plastic]] (FRP), stainless steel, and [[terracotta]]. Terracotta curtain wall panels were first used in Europe, but only a few manufacturers produce high quality modern terracotta curtain wall panels.

===Louvers===
A [[louver]] is provided in an area where mechanical equipment located inside the building requires ventilation or fresh air to operate. They can also serve as a means of allowing outside air to filter into the building to take advantage of favorable climatic conditions and minimize the usage of energy-consuming [[HVAC]] systems. Curtain wall systems can be adapted to accept most types of louver systems to maintain the same architectural sightlines and style while providing the necessary functionality.

===Windows and vents===
Most curtain wall glazing is fixed, meaning there is no access to the exterior of the building except through doors. However, windows or vents can be glazed into the curtain wall system as well, to provide required ventilation or operable windows. Nearly any window type can be made to fit into a curtain wall system.

==Fire safety==
[[Image:Curtain wall backpan styrofoam.jpg|thumb|right|Combustible [[Polystyrene]] insulation in point contact with [[sheet metal]] backban. Incomplete [[firestop]] in the [[Joint (building)|perimeter slab edge]], made of [[Mineral wool|rockwool]] without topcaulking.]]
[[Firestop]]ping at the [[Joint (building)|"perimeter slab edge"]], which is a gap between the floor and the backpan of the curtain wall is essential to slow the passage of fire and combustion gases between floors. Spandrel areas must have non-combustible insulation at the interior face of the curtain wall. Some building codes require the mullion to be wrapped in heat-retarding insulation near the ceiling to prevent the mullions from melting and spreading the fire to the floor above. It is important to note that the firestop at the perimeter slab edge is considered a continuation of the [[fire-resistance rating]] of the floor slab. The curtain wall itself, however, is not ordinarily required to have a rating. This causes a quandary as [[Compartmentalization (fire protection)]] is typically based upon ''closed'' compartments to avoid fire and smoke migrations beyond each engaged compartment. A curtain wall by its very nature prevents the completion of the compartment (or envelope). The use of fire sprinklers has been shown to mitigate this matter. As such, unless the building is sprinklered, fire may still travel up the curtain wall, if the glass on the exposed floor is shattered due to fire influence, causing flames to lick up the outside of the building. Falling glass can endanger pedestrians, firefighters and firehoses below. An example of this is the [[First Interstate Tower fire]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The fire here leapfrogged up the tower by shattering the glass and then consuming the [[aluminium]] skeleton holding the glass. Aluminium's melting temperature is 660°C, whereas building fires can reach 1,100°C. The melting point of aluminium is typically reached within minutes of the start of a [[fire]]. Firestops for such building joints can be qualified to [http://www.ul.com/fire/joint.html UL 2079 -- Tests for Fire Resistance of Building Joint Systems]. [[Fire sprinkler system|Sprinklering]] of each floor has a profoundly positive effect on the fire safety of buildings with curtain walls. In the case of the aforementioned fire, it was specifically the activation of the newly installed sprinkler system, which halted the advance of the fire and allowed effective suppression. Had this not occurred, the tower would have collapsed onto fire crews and into an adjacent building, while on fire. Exceptionally sound cementitious spray [[fireproofing]] also helped to delay and ultimately to avoid the possible collapse of the building, due to having the [[structural steel]] skeleton of the building reach the critical temperature, as the post-mortem fire investigation report indicated. This fire proved the positive collective effect of both [[active fire protection]] (sprinklers) and [[passive fire protection]] (fireproofing).

Fireman knock-out glazing panels are often required for venting and emergency access from the exterior. Knock-out panels are generally fully [[Architectural Glass|tempered]] glass to allow full fracturing of the panel into small pieces and relatively safe removal from the opening.

==Maintenance and repair==
Curtain walls and perimeter sealants require maintenance to maximize service life. Perimeter sealants, properly designed and installed, have a typical service life of 10 to 15 years. Removal and replacement of perimeter sealants require meticulous surface preparation and proper detailing.

Aluminum frames are generally painted or [[anodising|anodized]]. Factory applied fluoropolymer thermoset coatings have good resistance to environmental degradation and require only periodic cleaning. Recoating with an air-dry fluoropolymer coating is possible but requires special surface preparation and is not as durable as the baked-on original coating.

Anodized aluminum frames cannot be "re-anodized" in place, but can be cleaned and protected by proprietary clear coatings to improve appearance and durability.

Exposed glazing seals and gaskets require inspection and maintenance to minimize water penetration, and to limit exposure of frame seals and insulating glass seals to wetting.
