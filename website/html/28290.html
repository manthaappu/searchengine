Page Hunt <ref>http://pagehunt.msrlivelabs.com/PlayPageHunt.aspx</ref> is a [[game]] developed by [[Bing (search engine)| Bing]] for investigating human research behavior. It is a so-called "[[game with a purpose]]", as it pursues additional goals: not only to provide entertainment but also to harness human computation for some specific research task.
The term "games with a purpose" was coined by Luis von Ahn, inventor of CAPTCHA, co-organizer of reCAPTCHA project, and inventor of a famous [[ESP Game]]<ref>L. von Ahn: “Games with a purpose”. Computer, vol. 29(6), pp. 92–94, 2006.</ref>.

==Game rules==

Page Hunt is only accessible through [[Internet Explorer]], and requires [[Silverlight]] (freely downloadable from the Page Hunt website). 

Unlike the games of Luis von Ahn, Page Hunt is a single-player game. It doesn't support [[user registration]] (and hence doesn't rank players). 

Shown a webpage, the player must find the best [[Index term|keyword]] or keywords which would bring this page to the list of top 5 search results by Bing. The higher is the rank of the page within 5 first results, the more points the player gets. Achieving this without frequent queries earns a bonus. The game lasts for 3 minutes.

==Scientific results==

The data gained using Page Hunt has several applications:

# providing metadata for pages, 
# providing query alterations for use in query refinement,
# identifying ranking issues.

On testing a game internally, the following results were gathered (as described in “Page Hunt: Improving search engines using human computation games”<ref>H. Ma, R. Chandrasekar, C. Quirk, A. Gupta: “Page Hunt: Improving search engines using human computation games”. Proceedings of the 32nd international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval, 2009.</ref>):
about 27% of the pages in test database had 100% findability (it means that all the person who were shown this page could bring it to the 5 best results), while almost the same number of pages (26%) was found by nobody. Thereby, a relation between the length URL and a webpage findability could be postulated: The longer is an URL of the webpage, the harder was to "hunt" it.
Also the winning search queries were analyzed and classified. The queries that contain:

# Spelling or punctuation alterations
# Sitename to site alterations
# Acronym/Initialism-Expansion alterations
# Conceptual alterations
