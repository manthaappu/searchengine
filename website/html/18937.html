The '''''International Code of Botanical Nomenclature''''' (''ICBN'') is the set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal [[botanical name]]s  that are given to plants, fungi and a few other groups of organisms. Its intent is that each taxonomic group ("[[taxon]]", plural "taxa") of plants has only one [[correct name (botany)| correct name]] that is accepted worldwide.  The value of a scientific name is that it is an [[identifier]]; it is not necessarily of descriptive value, or even accurate.

* The guiding principle in [[botanical nomenclature]] is priority. The ''ICBN'' sets the formal starting date of nomenclature at 1 May 1753, the publication of ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] (or at later dates for specified groups and ranks). 

* A botanical name is fixed to a taxon by a [[type (botany)|type]]. This is almost invariably dried plant material and is usually deposited and preserved in a [[herbarium]], though it may also be an image. Some type collections can be viewed online at the websites of the herbaria in question.

Both these principles are regulated and limited. To avoid undesirable effects of priority, [[conservation (botany)|conservation]] of a name is possible. Above the [[taxonomic rank]] of family very few hard rules apply (e.g. see [[descriptive botanical names]]).

The ''ICBN'' can only be changed by an [[International Botanical Congress]] (IBC), with the [[International Association for Plant Taxonomy]] providing the supporting infrastructure. The present edition is the ''Vienna Code'' (2006), based on the decisions of the XVII IBC at Vienna [[2005]]. This was preceded by the ''St Louis Code'' (2000) and the ''Tokyo Code'' (1994), both available online. The next IBC will be held in [[Melbourne, Australia]] in July, 2011. Each new edition supersedes the earlier editions and is [[retroactive]] back to 1753, except where expressly limited.

Botanical nomenclature is independent of zoological and bacteriological nomenclature, which are governed by their own Codes (see [[Nomenclature Codes]]).

The ''ICBN'' applies not only to plants, as they are now defined, but also to other organisms traditionally studied by botanists and mycologists. This includes blue-green algae ([[Cyanobacteria]]); [[fungi]], including [[chytrid]]s, [[oomycete]]s, and [[slime mould]]s; [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[protists]] and [[alpha taxonomy|taxonomically]] related non-photosynthetic groups. There are special provisions in the ''ICBN'' for some of these groups, as there are for [[fossil]]s. 

For the naming of cultivated plants there is a separate code, the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]]''. This  gives supplementary rules and recommendations.
