'''GameFAQs''' is a [[website]] that hosts [[FAQ]]s and [[walkthrough]]s for [[video game]]s. It was created in November 1995 by Jeff "CJayC" Veasey and was bought by [[CNET Networks]] in May 2003. It is currently owned by [[CBS Interactive]]. The site has a database of video game information, [[cheat code]]s, [[review]]s, [[saved game|game saves]], and [[screenshot]]s, almost all of which is submitted by volunteer contributors. The [[video game console|systems]] covered include the 8-bit [[Atari 2600|Atari]] platform through [[history of video game consoles (seventh generation)|modern consoles]], as well as [[personal computer game|computer games]]. Submissions made to the site are reviewed by the site's current editor, Allen "SBAllen" Tyner.

GameFAQs hosts an active [[Internet forum|message board]] community, which has a separate discussion board for each game in the site's database, along with a variety of other boards. Since 2004, most of the game-specific boards have been shared between GameFAQs and [[GameSpot]], another CNET/CBS website. The site also runs a daily [[opinion poll]] and tournament contests.

GameFAQs has been positively reviewed by ''[[The Guardian]]''<ref>{{cite news | first=Jack | last=Schofield | title=Games watch | url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2000/may/11/onlinesupplement11 | work=[[The Guardian]] | id={{ISSN|0261-3077}} | page=11 | date=2000-05-11 | accessdate=2007-08-06 | quote=SPOnG, the Super Players Online Gamesbase, would like to become to games what the Internet Movie Database is to films.

==History==
GameFAQs was started as the ''Video Game FAQ Archive'' on November 5, 1995,<ref name="about">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/help/?cat=42|title=About the Site|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2006-09-30}}</ref> by gamer and programmer Jeff Veasey, who says he wanted to collect the numerous online guides and FAQs into one centralized location.<ref name="faqwriters">{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1521550/20070131/index.jhtml | accessdate=2009-01-17 | last=Totilo | first=Stephen | date=2006-01-24 | title=Meet The Man Who'll Make You A Smooth Criminal In San Andreas | publisher=MTV}}</ref>  Hosted on [[AOL|America Online]], it originally served as a [[mirror (computing)|mirror]] of [[Andy Eddy]]'s [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] FAQ archive.<ref>Andy Eddy's archive was formerly located at ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/vi/vidgames/faqs</ref><ref name="qa">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=6&topic=20696917|title=The Great GameFAQs Q&A|author=Veasey, Jeff|date=2005-04-29|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=11&topic=24408683|title=10 Years. Wow.|author=Veasey, Jeff|date=2005-11-05|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2009-12-20}}</ref> The initial version of the site had approximately 10 pages and 100 FAQs.<ref name="radio">"Interview with Jeff Veasey" (2002-03-02). ''[http://web.archive.org/web/20020607073548/http://wxbh.net/gaming_files1.htm The Gaming Files]''. WXBH AM-1190 (Cobleskill, New York).</ref> In 1996, the site moved to its current domain at gamefaqs.com and changed its name to ''GameFAQs''.<ref name="about"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flex.net/~cjayc/|title=VGFA on flex.net|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2006-09-21| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010723115459/http://www.flex.net/~cjayc/| archivedate=2001-07-23}}</ref> At this time, GameFAQs listed fewer than 1000 FAQs and guides and was updated on an irregular basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/|title=Video Game FAQ Archive|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2007-04-09| archiveurl=http://www.gamefaqsarchive.com/index.php?pg=1216|archivedate=1996-12-23}}</ref>

During the following months, the site grew in content and in design; two different styles were introduced in early 1997 to accommodate the support of [[HTML element#Tables|tables]] in [[web browser]]s (or the lack thereof).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/home.html|title=GameFAQs (tables)|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2006-09-19| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19970218070909/www.gamefaqs.com/home.html| archivedate=1997-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/thome.html|title=GameFAQs (no tables)|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2006-09-19| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19970218070917/www.gamefaqs.com/thome.html| archivedate=1997-02-18}}</ref> Two key features of the site—the game search engine and the contributor recognition pages—were planned at this time.

===IGN affiliation===
In 1997, GameFAQs became an independent affiliate of the [[IGN|Imagine Games Network]] (IGN), leading to the placement of affiliate links on the [[home page]].<ref name="pink">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/|title=GameFAQs home page|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2006-10-27| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19981212025143/http://www.gamefaqs.com/| archivedate=1998-12-12}}</ref> User contests were introduced during this period; the first monthly contest, which was held in 1998, received 253 entries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/contest/c9810|title=October 1998: Select Fighter|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref> GameFAQs went through several design changes, including a pink color scheme,<ref name="pink"/> before arriving at the blue-colored layout that was used until 2004.

In November 1999, several changes occurred in rapid succession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gamefaqs.com/index.html|title=GameFAQs home page|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2006-09-19| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19991128113006/http://gamefaqs.com/index.html| archivedate=1999-11-28}}</ref> On November 5, a search box was added to every page, at which time the site was celebrating its fourth [[anniversary]]. On November 7, the message boards opened in a [[software release life cycle#Beta|beta]] testing mode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chris.insder.com/index.php?pg=426|title=Second Anniversary Karma Bonus|author=Veasey, Jeff|date=2001-11-07|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2006-09-19| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041012075244/chris.insder.com/index.php?pg=426| archivedate=2004-10-12}}</ref> The "Poll of the Day" was introduced at the end of the month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/poll/index.html?poll=1|title=Poll of the Day #1|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2006-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/poll/index.html?list=74|title=Poll of the Day|publisher=GameFAQs|quote=11/30/99|accessdate=2009-12-20}}</ref> These changes marked Veasey's increased concentration on the site, and it was around this time that GameFAQs became his full-time job.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gamefaqs.com/announce.html|title=The Big Announcement|author=Veasey, Jeff|year=1999|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2007-05-26| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19991013083526/http://gamefaqs.com/announce.html| archivedate=1999-10-13}}</ref><ref name="davidson">{{cite news | first=Neil | last=Davidson | title=Stumped by a video game?

===2001–2003===
On January 9, 2001, GameFAQs ended its association with IGN.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gamefaqs.com/|title=GameFAQs home page|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2006-09-19| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010118211300/http://gamefaqs.com/| archivedate=2001-01-18}}</ref> To continue generating revenue, an advertising banner sold to non-profit organizations was placed on the top of each page. This lasted until [[CNET Networks]] became an official affiliate of GameFAQs; CNET ads ran on the top of the page and links to news articles from [[GameSpot]] were shown on the home page.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/|title=GameFAQs home page|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2006-09-19| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010418154308/http://www.gamefaqs.com/| archivedate=2001-04-18}}</ref> In September 2002, the ad was moved from the horizontal [[page header|header]] to the vertical [[sidebar (publishing)|sidebar]]. This led to changes to the links on the side, as well as the creation of navigational links at the top of the screen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gamefaqs.com/|title=GameFAQs home page|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2006-09-20| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020922025120/http://gamefaqs.com/| archivedate=2002-09-22}}</ref> Contributions to GameFAQs continued to increase, and Veasey, as sole operator and administrator of the site, dedicated significant portions of his time to ensure that GameFAQs remained updated and successful.

On April 1, 2002, Veasey changed GameFAQs to "GameFAX" as an [[April Fools' Day|April Fools']] joke.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gamefaqs.com/|title=GameFAX|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2006-09-19| archiveurl=http://www.ksot.com/GameFAX.htm| archivedate=2002-04-01}}</ref> The site's colors were changed to green and black to imitate those of the [[Xbox]], with the intention of making users believe that GameFAQs was now dedicated solely to the Xbox, "the only system that matters." After clicking on any link on the main page, users were directed to the real GameFAQs home page. Nevertheless, Veasey reported receiving hate mail from users.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=11&topic=27283817|title= An important notice about the future of GameFAQs|author=Veasey, Jeff|date=2006-04-01|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref>

===CNET acquisition===
[[File:CNETNetworksSanFran.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A building with a glass and brick facade. Tall buildings are visible in the background.|[[CNET Networks]] headquarters in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]]]]
On May 6, 2003, [[CNET Networks]] (the site's long-standing affiliate and sponsor) [[mergers and acquisitions|acquired]] GameFAQs. The amount paid for GameFAQs and two other unrelated websites was [[United States dollar|US$]]2.2 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccbn.10kwizard.com/xml/download.php?repo=tenk&ipage=2269604&format=PDF|title=CNET Networks SEC Quarterly Report|date=2003-08-05|format=PDF|publisher=CNET Networks|accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref> On June 3, 2003, Veasey announced the merger to the users of the site.<ref name="cnet"/> He clarified that the user-submitted content (i.e. FAQs, reviews) remained under the ownership of the authors and was not (nor could be) sold to CNET; however, CNET acquired GameFAQs' rights to host them on the site. He assured users that GameFAQs would undergo no major administrative change and said, "The GameFAQs you see today is the one you'll see tomorrow."<ref name="cnet"/> This was true to a certain extent, as the only visible change over the next few months was the addition of a CNET [[page footer|footer]] to the bottom of every page. Additional changes included moving the site to [[server (computing)|servers]] in [[California]].

From 2004 to 2006, GameFAQs witnessed further changes. On April 28, GameFAQs implemented a large visual redesign,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chris.insder.com/newlayout/|title=New Layout/Boards Merger|publisher=GameFAQs Archive|accessdate=2006-09-20| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041009125141/http://chris.insder.com/newlayout/| archivedate=2004-10-09}}</ref> and the boards merged with the GameSpot boards to allow both communities to share the same game-specific boards (to the dismay of many GameFAQs users). To facilitate this, GameFAQs converted its board code from [[Active Server Pages|ASP]] to [[PHP]], and GameSpot dropped its [[Lithium Technologies|Lithium]] code. On April 11, 2006, a new design was implemented and the GameSpot [[logo]] was added to the GameFAQs logo on the header of every page. This change was initially greeted with general disapproval by users on the message boards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=11&topic=27814467|title=Survey says...|author=Veasey, Jeff|date=2006-04-28|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref> To satisfy those who prefer the earlier layout, the old board pages have been preserved for certain users.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=11&topic=29712507|title=The v9 End of Life project|author=Veasey, Jeff|date=2006-08-03|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref> Shortly after the redesign, the site began using the [[Smarty]] [[template engine (web)|template engine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=11&topic=29230067|title=The first major code change is live... Whew!|author=Veasey, Jeff|date=2006-07-12|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref>

===Veasey's departure===
On July 19, 2007, Veasey announced that he would eventually be leaving the site. According to his announcement, Allen Tyner, who has been employed with the site since 2004, would take over as editor and administrator of GameFAQs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=11&topic=36893099|title=The Long, Slow Goodbye|author=Veasey, Jeff|date=2007-07-19|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2007/07/the-founder-of-gamefaqs-to-step-down-its-time-to-show-some-respect.ars|title=The founder of GameFaqs to step down; it's time to show some respect|author=Kuchera, Ben |date=2007-07-20|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=2009-12-20}}</ref>

==Message boards==
The custom-made GameFAQs Message Boards, coded by Veasey, began operation on November 7, 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cgi.gamefaqs.com/boards/faq.asp|title=GameFAQs: Message Board Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=2006-12-21| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20000510142945/http://cgi.gamefaqs.com/boards/faq.asp| archivedate=2000-05-10}}</ref> Although the original purpose of the board system was to facilitate game discussion, other board categories have been added since the boards opened. Every day, approximately 20,000 [[Threaded discussion|topics]] and 200,000 messages are posted on GameFAQs' 60,000+ individual boards,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=11&topic=44064783|title=Ask GameFAQs: We Have Explosive|author=Tyner, Allen|date=2008-07-04|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref> and as of November 7, 2006, there were more than 100,000 accounts actively in use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=11&topic=31607751|title=Happy Birthday to Us... and to you!|author=Veasey, Jeff|date=2006-11-07|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref> During October 2009, there was an average of 84,853 unique logins a day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=11&topic=51910546|title=Ask GameFAQs: I like to move it, move it|author=Tyner, Allen|date=2009-10-24|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2008-12-22}}</ref>

Every game listed on GameFAQs has its own message board where both novice and experienced gamers can discuss game strategies and other game-related topics.<ref>{{cite book | last=Carless | first=Simon | authorlink=Simon Carless | title=Gaming Hacks | year=2004 | month=October | publisher=[[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] | isbn=0-596-00714-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference | first=Nick | last=Flor | year=2004 | month=July | title=The Architecture of the Symbol Engine in a Programmable Autonomous Business | booktitle=Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on E-Commerce Technology | publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] | pages=119–126 | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/9218/29236/01319725.pdf?arnumber=1319725 | format=PDF | accessdate=2007-01-25 | doi=10.1109/ICECT.2004.1319725 | id=ISBN 0-7695-2098-7}}</ref> Since the redesign of May 2004, the game boards with enforced [[on-topic|topicality]] have been shared with the GameSpot community. Certain popular games may have additional boards for social discussion. Game-specific boards for certain older consoles do not have topicality rules and are often claimed for social discussion—these are referred to as "secret" or "dead" boards. Every system also has a general board for discussing [[hardware]] and upcoming games.<ref name="boards">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/|title=GameFAQs - Message Boards|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2008-08-05}}</ref>

GameFAQs has boards made purely for the purpose of socializing, some that cater to special interests (such as [[Anime]], [[TV]], [[Music]], and [[Wrestling]]), and some purely for users from a particular region (e.g. [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]]/[[New Zealand]]). GameFAQs also has boards for official announcements, contributor discussion, contest discussion, suggestions, and site help.<ref name="boards"/>

===Features===
Posts made on the message boards are mostly [[plain text]]. Some [[HTML element|HTML mark-up]] is used on the boards, including bold and italics tags.<ref name="boardhelp">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/help/?cat=18|title=Board Basics|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref> Unlike many message boards, GameFAQs does not allow tags for images, [[hyperlink]]s, or underlining. [[avatar (computing)|Avatars]] are not used, [[signature block|signatures]] are limited to two lines of text (160 characters total), and posts cannot be edited. Additionally, the forums use a [[wordfilter]] to prevent the use of certain vulgar words.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/tou.html|title=Message Board Terms of Use|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref> On some boards, topics are removed permanently after a having no new posts for a period of time. On other boards, they are locked and archived (a feature which was added in 2008). The length of time that a topic can remain inactive without being removed or archived depends on the number of posts on its board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/help/?cat=19|title=Rules and Standards|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=6&topic=41276959|title=Game Board Archiving Active|author=Tyner, Allen|date=2008-02-07|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref>

GameFAQs users gain one "karma" for every day they visit the boards while logged in. As karma increases, new features become available, such as the ability to post more messages per day, visit high-level social boards, and view a post history page.<ref name="boardhelp"/> Registered users can choose between various stylesheets, search topics, and message display options.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/user/manage.html|title=GameFAQs: Manage Account (login required)|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2006-12-29}}</ref> Users can add favorite boards to a personalized list on the main boards page and can track specific topics (a feature added in 2006).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/help/?cat=20|title=Additional Features|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2006-09-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=6&topic=32250342|title=Topic Tracking|author=Veasey, Jeff|date=2006-12-06|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref>

On June 20, 2007, advertisements on message list pages were moved from the top of the page to the middle of the message lists.<ref name="ad_changes">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=6&topic=36197238|title=Ad Changes|author=Veasey, Jeff|date=2007-06-20|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, the ads were moved to the bottom of the message lists.<ref name="ad_changes"/> On October 8, 2007, an "ignore user" system was launched for users above a certain level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=6&topic=38747194|title=Beta Ignore User System|author=Tyner, Allen|date=2007-10-08|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref>

===Moderators===
The message boards are managed by the site's administrators and [[forum moderator|moderators]]. Initially, Veasey was the only administrator and therefore had full control over the boards; however, more administrators have since been appointed. Tyner, who uses the username "SBAllen" (formerly "Sailor Bacon"), is an administrator on the boards.<ref name="about"/>

GameFAQs' moderators are volunteer users selected by the administrator and are responsible for keeping order within the message board community. Because of the size of the boards, the moderators do not patrol every board and topic. Instead, messages that break the site's [[Terms of Service]] can be "[[moderation system|marked]]" by regular users, which brings the message to the attention of the moderators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/help/?cat=19|title=Rules and Standards|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref>

==FAQs==
All of the guides and walkthroughs on GameFAQs are contributed by volunteers.<ref>Mary-Kate and Ashley: Winner's Circle; ''[[The Times]]'' ([[London]]); July 1, 2001; Stuart Andrews; p. Doors.2 "Guides to completing thousands of video games, compiled by gamers worldwide"</ref> Most of the FAQs are not actually lists of [[FAQ|frequently asked questions]]; instead, they cover aspects of gameplay in the same way as [[strategy guide]]s, with walkthroughs, item lists, maps, and puzzle solutions. Nearly all of the FAQs hosted on the site are in [[plain text]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/help/?cat=28|title=Composing Your Guide|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2006-10-26}}</ref> though GameFAQs does also accept stand-alone images, such as maps, diagrams and puzzle solutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/help/?cat=11|title=Images (Maps and other graphics)|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2007-01-01}}</ref> From December 2009, formatted guides which allow authors to use mark-up loosely based on [[Wiki markup]] in the document were being accepted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=11&topic=52525167|title=Ask GameFAQs: A new approach to FAQs|publisher=GameFAQs|author=Tyner, Allen|date=2009-12-04|accessdate=2009-12-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/help/?cat=53|title=GameFAQs Help: Formatted FAQs|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref> In addition to FAQs, contributors can also submit reader reviews, cheat codes, developer credits, game release data, game saves, [[screenshot]]s, and images of [[video game packaging|game boxes]]. As of February 2009, over 49,000 guides are hosted on the site and over 113,194 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=11&topic=48243761|title=Ask GameFAQs: Double Stuf'd|author=Veasey, Jeff|date=2009-02-20|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2009-12-20}}</ref>

When an author submits something to GameFAQs, it is screened by an administrator before being posted on the site.<ref name="submitted">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/help/?cat=31|title=After You've Submitted|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2006-10-26}}</ref> The author retains the [[copyright]] on the submitted material,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/help/?cat=29|title=Copyrights, Trademarks, and Plagiarism|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2006-10-26}}</ref> and his name is added to the site's "Contributor Recognition" section. GameFAQs agrees to host the guide only on their servers but does allow other affiliates to link directly to the guides (including [[GameSpot]], [[Yahoo! Games]], [[AOL]], and [[GameFly]]).<ref name="submitted"/>

GameFAQs features several ongoing contributor contests, including FAQ of the Month, Review of the Month, and numerous "FAQ [[bounty (reward)|Bounties]]", which reward contributors who submit FAQs for uncovered, high-demand games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/contest/faqbounty|title=FAQ Bounty|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref> The FOTM and ROTM contests are generally picked from comprehensive, complete guides or reviews for new games. Winners are sent a [[Scrip#Gift certificates|gift certificate]] for an [[online shop|online retailer]], or can opt for a mailed [[Scrip#Gift certificates|gift card]] upon contest entry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/contest/fotm|title=FAQ of the Month|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/contest/rotm|title=Review of the Month|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref><ref name="mtvgta">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1521550/20070131/index.jhtml|title=Meet The Man Who'll Make You A Smooth Criminal In San Andreas|publisher=MTV.com|author= Totilo, Stephen|date=2006-01-24|accessdate=2009-12-20}}</ref>

In 2004, [[Future US|Future Network USA]] published two commercial strategy guides with material from GameFAQs: ''The Ultimate [[Xbox]] Strategy Guide'' and ''The Ultimate [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] Strategy Guide''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Ultimate Xbox Strategy Guide|author=Cohen, Corey (ed.)|publisher=[[Future US|Future Network USA]]|year=2004|oclc=60827530|id={{ASIN|B000E7URBQ}}}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Ultimate PS2 Strategy Guide|author=Amrich, Dan (ed.)|publisher=[[Future US|Future Network USA]]|year=2004|oclc=60579744|id={{ASIN|B000E7URPM}}}}</ref> These guides were composed of FAQs written by contributors on GameFAQs.

Since 2002, GameFAQs has hosted [[wikt:annual|annual]] (or [[semiannual]]) [[tournament]] contests consisting of daily [[Opinion poll|polls]] in which visitors to the site choose between competing [[Character (arts)|characters]], games, or series, with the character contests being known as "Character Battles". Registered users can submit prediction [[bracket (tournament)|brackets]], and [[prize]]s are awarded to those who score the highest. The contest polls are shown in place of or in addition to the regular Poll of the Day and have always been accompanied by an image depicting the entrants in the match. The entrants of the Character Battles change from year to year, with some characters being added and some being removed. In some years, previous winners were removed from the main bracket and competed in a separate contest (i.e., "Tournament of Champions", "Battle Royale").

The annual Character Battle has been the subject of two [[webcomic]]s—''[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]]'' featured the Character Battle in their comic on August 23, 2002,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2002/8/23/|title=Penny Arcade! - Heat|publisher=Penny Arcade|date=2002-08-23|accessdate=2009-03-29}}</ref> and Creative Uncut's ''Inside the Gamers Studio'' strip mentioned the Character Battle in their ninth comic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creativeuncut.com/comic/whit009.html|title=''Inside the Gamers Studio'' comic|publisher=Creative Uncut|year=2003|accessdate=2006-12-17}}</ref>

===10 Best Games Ever===
During the 10-Year Anniversary Contest in 2005, GameFAQs users voted on the 10 best games of all time (and tried to predict what the top 10 would be). ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' was selected as the best game ever, followed by ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'', ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', ''[[GoldenEye 007]]'', ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', and ''[[Final Fantasy VI|Final Fantasy III/VI]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/contest/top10|title=Fall 2005: 10-Year Anniversary Contest - The 10 Best Games Ever|publisher=GameFAQs|accessdate=2007-09-23}}</ref>
