The '''External Bus Interface''', usually shortened to '''EBI''', is a [[computer bus]] for interfacing small [[peripheral device]]s like [[flash memory]] with the [[processor]]. It is used to expand the internal bus of the processor to enable connection with external [[Computer memory|memories]] or other [[peripheral]]s.
