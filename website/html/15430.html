A '''glue language''' is a [[programming language]] (usually a [[scripting language]]) used for connecting [[software component]]s together. 

Examples of glue languages: 
* [[Unix]] [[Shell script]]s ([[ksh]], [[csh]], [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], [[Bourne shell|sh]] and others)
* [[Windows NT]] type Shell scripts ([[CMD.exe]])
* Windows [[PowerShell]]
* MS-DOS and Windows 95 type [[Batch files]] ([[Command.com]])]; usefulness as glue language enhanced by [[QBasic]] and [[DOSKey]]
* OS/2 batch files and shell scripts
* [[Kixtart]]
* [[4NT]]
* [[4DOS]]
* [[4OS/2]]
* [[Take Command (command line interpreter)|Take Command]]
* [[Norton Utilities]] [[NDOS]] (a [[4DOS]] variant)
* [[DCL]] 
* [[JCL]]
* [[m4 (computer language)|m4]]
* [[VBScript]]
* [[JScript]] and [[JavaScript]]
* [[AppleScript]]
* [[Python (programming language)|Python]]
* [[Ruby programming language|Ruby]]
* [[Lua programming language|Lua]]
* [[Tcl]]
* [[Perl]]
* [[PHP]]
* [[Pure (programming language)|Pure]]
* [[REXX]]
* [[XSLT]]
* Operating system desktop macro languages such as the Windows 3.11 Macro Recorder and various tools for Windows CE versions and implementations.

Extended [[macro]] languages which are exposed to operating system components and those of other programmes including [[Visual Basic for Applications]], [[WordBasic]], [[LotusScript]], [[CorelScript]], [[PerfectScript]], Hummingbird Basic and QuickScript, [[SaxBasic]] and [[WinWrap Basic]] as well as other tools like [[awk]] can also be considered glue languages, as can any language implemented by an [[ActiveX]] WSH engine (VBScript, JScript and VBA by default in Windows and third-party engines including implementations of Rexx, Perl, Tcl, Python, XSLT, Ruby, Delphi, &c)  A majority of applications can access and use operating system components via the [[object model]]s or its own functions.

Other devices like programmable calculators may also have glue languages; for example the [[TI-92]] by factory default can be programmed by a Command Script language and a Basic variant known as [[TI-Basic]], and the [[HP-48]] series as well as all other HP calculators can be programmed in multiple on-board languages.  Most scientific and other advanced calculators can be programmed, with keystroke macros and derivatives of Basic predominating and others inlcluding languages based on [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[assembly language]]; some programmers are working to implement some of the above glue languages such as Perl, Rexx, WInNT shell, Unix shell, DOS-Win95-OS/2 batch and others.
