A '''written language''' is the representation of a [[language]] by means of a [[writing system]]. Written language is an [[invention]] in that it must be taught to children, who will instinctively learn or create [[spoken language|spoken]] or [[sign language|gestural]] languages.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

A written language exists only as a complement to a specific spoken or gestural language, and no [[natural language]] is purely written. However, [[extinct language]]s may be in effect purely written when only their writings survive.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

== Written language vs. spoken language ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}
Written languages change more slowly than corresponding spoken languages.  When one or more [[register (linguistics)|registers]] of a language come to be strongly divergent from spoken language, the resulting situation is called [[diglossia]].  However, such diglossia is often considered as one language, between [[literary language]] and other registers, especially if the [[writing system]] reflects its [[pronunciation]].

Native readers and writers of [[English language|English]] are often unaware that the complexities of [[English spelling]] make written English a somewhat artificial construct.  The traditional spelling of English, at least for inherited words, preserves a late [[Middle English]] [[phonology]] that is no one's speech dialect.  The artificial preservation of this much earlier form of the language in writing might make much of what we write intelligible to [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] (1343–1400), even if we could not understand his speech.
