<html> <head> <title>Immunocomputing</title></head><body>Immunocomputing explores the principles of [[information processing]] that '''[[proteins]]''' and '''immune networks''' utilize in order to solve specific complex problems while protected from viruses, noise, errors and intrusions.

It intends to establish:

* A proper mathematical framework
* A new kind of [[computing]]
* A new kind of hardware

The main difference with other kinds of computing lay on the function of its ''basic element'', the '''formal protein''', defined according with its biological prototype and its [[mathematical model]]. 

The main [[biophysics|biophysical issues]] considered in immunocomputing are:

* Free [[Protein folding|'''folding''']] to a stable state (inspiration for the Formal Protein)
* Free '''binding''' with other elements dependent on their reciprocal states (inspiration for the [[Immune network theory|Formal Immune Networks]])

'''Formal immune networks''' (FINs) have as closest model the ''idiotypic network'' of ''[[Niels Kaj Jerne|N. Jerne]]'' but they consider specific mechanisms of [[Protein-protein interaction|interactions between proteins]]. FINs are able to learn, recognize and solve problems.
