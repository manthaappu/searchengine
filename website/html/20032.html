== Biography ==
John Krogstie received a [[MSc]] in 1991 and a [[PhD]] in 1995 both in information systems from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.<ref>[http://www.igi-global.com/reference/authors.asp?id=705&pub_id=4379 John Krogstie, About The Author/Editor]. Accessed 02 Feb 2009.</ref>
From 1991 to 2000 he was employed as a manager in [[Accenture]]. In 2000-2005 he was a senior researcher in SINTEF. He is a professor in information systems at NTNU in Trondheim, Norway.<ref>[http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~krogstie/CV-John-Krogstie-academic-full-eng-latest.pdf CURRICULUM VITAE 24/7/2008]. Accessed 02 Feb 2009.</ref> 

John Krogstie is the Norwegian representative for [[IFIP TC8]] and Chair (2010–2012) of [[IFIP WG 8.1]] on information systems design and evaluation, where he is the initiator and leader of the task group for Mobile Information Systems.

== Work ==
Krogstie's research interests include information systems, conceptual modeling, mobile information systems, eGovernment and [[enterprise modelling]].

=== The SEQUAL framework ===
[[Image:Modelframework.JPG|thumb|240px|Illustration of the SEQUAL framework]]
The [[SEQUAL framework]] is a reference model for evaluating the quality of models, the semiotic quality framework (SEQUAL) developed by John Krogstie.<ref name="Kro06">John Krogstie et al. (2006). [http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ejis/journal/v15/n1/pdf/3000598a.pdf "Process models representing knowledge for action: a revised quality framework"]. In: ''[[European Journal of Information Systems]]'' (2006) 15, pp.91–102.</ref> The SEQUAL framework is grounded in [[semiotics]], particularly the semiotic theory of [[Charles W. Morris]]. It builds on semiotic theory and defines several quality aspects based on relationships between a model, a body of knowledge, a domain, a modeling language, and the activities of learning, taking action, and modeling.<ref name="Men06">Jan Mendlin et al. (2006) [http://crpit.com/confpapers/CRPITV83Mendling.pdf "On the Correlation between Process Model Metrics and Errors"] Conference paper.</ref>
Its usefulness was confirmed in an 2002 experiment.<ref>D.L. Moody, et al. (2002). "Evaluating the quality of process models: Empirical testing of a quality framework". In: Stefano Spaccapietra et al. (ed.) ''Conceptual Modeling - ER 2002, Proceedings, LNCS 2503'', pp. 380-396.</ref> 

The basic idea behind the SEQUAL framework is, that [[conceptual model]]s can be considered as sets of
statements in a [[language]], and therefore can be evaluated in semiotic/linguistic terms. A first semiotic framework for evaluating conceptual models was originally proposed by Lindland et al. in the 1994 article "Understanding quality in conceptual modeling".<ref>O.I. Lindland, G. Sindre and [[Arne Sølvberg]] (1994) "Understanding quality in conceptual modeling". In: ''IEEE Software'' 11(2), 42–49.</ref> In its initial version, it considered three quality levels: 
* syntactic,
* semantic, and
* pragmatic quality

The framework was later extended, and called the SEQUAL framework by Krogstie et al. in the 1995 article "Defining quality aspects for conceptual models".<ref>KROGSTIE J, LINDLAND OI and SINDRE G (1995) "Defining quality aspects for conceptual models". In:  ''Proceedings of the IFIP8.1 Working Conference on Information Systems Concepts (ISCO3): Towards a Consolidation of Views, 28–30 March, Marburg, Germany'' (FALKENBERG E, HESS W and OLIVE E, Eds), Chapman & Hall: London, UK.</ref> In the 2002 article "Quality of interactive models"<ref>KROGSTIE J and JøRGENSEN HD (2002) "Quality of interactive models". In: ''First International Workshop on Conceptual Modelling Quality (IWCMQ’02), 11 October 2002''. (OLIVE A, YOSHIKAWA M and YU E, Eds), Springer Verlag: Berlin, Germany.</ref> Krogstie & Jørgensen extended the initial framework adding
more levels of Stamper’s semiotic ladder.<ref>STAMPER R (1996) "Signs, norms, and information systems". In: ''Signs at Work''. B. Holmqvist et al. (Eds). Walter de Gruyter: Berlin, Germany. pp 349–397.</ref>
