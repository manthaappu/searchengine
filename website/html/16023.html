The '''HITAC S-810''' is a [[Vector processor|vector]] [[supercomputer]] developed, manufactured and marketed by [[Hitachi]]. The first models, the S-810/10 and S-810/20, were announced in August 1982, making the S-810 was the second of the first three Japanese supercomputers, following the [[Fujitsu VP|Fujitsu VP-200]], which was announced July 1982, but predating the [[NEC SX architecture|NEC SX-2]], which was announced in April 1983. The S-810 was Hitachi's first supercomputer, although the company had previously built a [[vector processor]], the IAP. The first system shipped was a top-end S-810/20 model, which was delivered to the [[University of Tokyo]]'s Large Computer Center in October 1983. The S-810 was succeeded as Hitachi's top-end supercomputer by the [[HITAC S-820]] announced in July 1987.

There were three models, the low-end S-810/5, the mid-range S-810/10, and the top-end S-810/20. They differ in the number of vector pipelines installed, the number of scalar registers, the number vector registers, and the amount of memory supported. Hitachi claimed that the S-810/5's peak performance was 160 [[MFLOPS]], the S-810/10's was 315 MFLOPS, and the S-810/20's was 630 MFLOPS.

The S-810 implements a Hitachi-designed extension of the [[IBM]] [[System/370]] [[instruction set architecture]] with 83 vector instructions (80 in the S-810/5 and S-810/10). The vector instructions are ''register-to-register'', meaning that they do not directly reference memory. The [[scalar processor]] is a Hitachi HITAC M-280H [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] with a 28 [[nanosecond]] (ns) [[cycle time]] ([[clock rate]] of approximately 35.71 [[Megahertz|MHz]]). In the S-810/20, there are 32 scalar registers, whereas the other models have 16. In all models, the scalar processor has a large 256 [[kilobyte]] [[CPU cache|cache]].

The vector processor has a 14 ns cycle time (clock rate of approximately 71.43 MHz). The vector registers are 256 elements wide, and each element is 64 bits wide. The S-810/20 has 32 of these registers, whereas the other models have 16. These registers are implemented with 1 [[kilobit]] (Kbit) [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]] RAM [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) with a 4.5 ns [[access time]]. All models have eight 256-bit vector mask registers and 48 vector address registers. All models have three load pipelines and one load/store pipeline for accessing the main memory. The S-810/20 has two lanes, each with two add, one multiply followed by add, and one multiply or divide followed by add [[floating point]] pipelines, for a total of twelve. The S-810/10 has one lane with the same configuration as the S-810/20 and therefore a total of six pipelines. CPU logic is implemented with two [[emitter-coupled logic]] [[gate array]] IC types, a 550-[[Logic gate|gate]] part with a 250 [[picosecond]] (ps) [[gate delay]] and a 1,500-gate part with a 450 ps gate delay.

The [[main memory]] is implemented with 16 Kbit [[complementary metal&ndash;oxide&ndash;semiconductor]] [[static random access memory]] ICs with an access time of 40 ns. The S-810/20 supports 64 to 256 [[megabyte]] (MB) of main memory, whereas the other models support 32 to 128 MB.
