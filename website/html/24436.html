'''Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer''' ('''MBSA''') is a software tool released by [[Microsoft]] to determine [[computer security|security]] state by assessing missing security updates and less-secure security settings within Microsoft Windows, Windows components such as [[Internet Explorer]], [[Internet Information Services|IIS]] [[web server]], and products [[Microsoft SQL Server]], and [[Microsoft Office]] macro settings. Security updates are determined by the current version of MBSA using the [[Microsoft Update|Windows Update Agent]] present on Windows computers since Windows 2000 Service Pack 3.  The less-secure settings, often called Vulnerability Assessment (VA) checks, are assessed based on a hard-coded set of registry and file checks. An example of a VA might be that permissions for one of the directories in the wwwroot folder of IIS could be set at too low a level, allowing unwanted modification of files from outsiders.

Versions 1.2.1 and below run on NT4, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, provide support for IIS versions 5 through 6, SQL Server 7 and 2000, [[Internet Explorer]] 5.01 and 6.0 only, and Microsoft Office 2000 through 2003. Security update assessment is provided by an integrated version of [[Shavlik|Shavlik's]] HFNetChk 3.8 scan tool.  MBSA 1.2.1 was localized into English, German, French and Japanese versions and supported security assessment for any locale.

Version 2.0 retained the hard-coded VA checks, but replaced the Shavlik security assessment engine with Microsoft Update technologies which adds dynamic support for all Microsoft products supported by [[Windows Update|Microsoft Update]].   MBSA 2.0.1 was released to support the revised Windows Update (WU) offline scan file (WSUSSCN2.CAB). MBSA 2.1 added Vista and Windows Server 2008 support, a new Vista-styled GUI interface, support for the latest Windows Update Agent (3.0), a new Remote Directory (/rd) feature and extended the VA checks to x64 platforms.
