'''Neville Lovett Community School''' is a mid-sized comprehensive (ages 11 - 16) mixed-sex school of 800 pupils, located in [[Fareham]], [[Hampshire]]. It was the first school in Hampshire designated as a Specialist [[Maths and Computing College]] in September 2003. The school is named after the first [[Bishop]] of [[Portsmouth]], [[Neville Lovett]].

==Academics==
As with all [[comprehensive schools]] in the [[town]], it does not provide a [[sixth form]], and instead, pupils looking to take their education to [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Level]] standard and beyond go to one of the several [[post-secondary education|tertiary colleges]] in the area. In 2007 the school made a technological advance by putting touch sensitive "Smart Boards" in almost all the rooms.
