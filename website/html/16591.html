In [[radio]] and [[signal processing]], '''heterodyning''' is the generation of new frequencies by [[frequency mixer|mixing]] ([[analog multiplier|multiplying]]), two [[oscillating]] waveforms. It is useful for placing information of interest into a useful [[frequency range]] following [[modulation]] or prior to [[demodulation]].  The two frequencies are mixed in a [[vacuum tube]], [[transistor]], [[diode]], or other signal processing device. Mixing two frequencies creates two new frequencies, according to the [[List_of_trigonometric_identities#Angle_sum_and_difference_identities|properties of the sine function]]; one is the sum of the two frequencies mixed, the other is their difference.  These new frequencies are called ''heterodynes''.  Typically only one of the new frequencies is desired—the higher one after modulation and the lower one after demodulation. The other signal is [[filter (signal processing)|filtered]] out of the output of the mixer.

== History ==
The word ''heterodyne'' is derived from the Greek roots ''hetero-'' "different", and ''dyn-'' "power" (cf. [[dynamis]]). The original heterodyne technique was pioneered by Canadian inventor-engineer [[Reginald Fessenden]] in 1901, but was not pursued very far because local oscillators were not very stable at the time.<ref name=nahin1>Nahin, Paul. ''The Science of Radio.'' Page 91. Figure 7.10. Chapter 7.  ISBN 0-387-95150-4.</ref>  Heterodyning was invented by Fessenden as a technique to make the [[Morse code]] radiotelegraph ([[Continuous wave|CW]]) signals used during the [[wireless telegraphy]] era audible.<ref>{{cite book

This produced a musical tone in the speaker, so the "dots" and "dashes" of Morse code were audible as beeping sounds. This technique is still used in [[radio telegraphy]]; the oscillator is now called a [[beat frequency oscillator]].

Later, the [[superheterodyne receiver]] (superhet) was invented by [[Edwin Howard Armstrong]] in 1918, converting the incoming [[Radio Frequency]] (RF) to a fixed [[Intermediate Frequency]] (IF), using the heterodyne technique.  The difference between the superhet and the original heterodyne is the use of a "sloppy" but tunable RF filter on the front end, a [[Frequency mixer|mixer]] circuit, a stable [[local oscillator]] (LO) and a fixed frequency high-gain [[Band pass filter|band-pass]] [[amplifier]].<ref name=nahin2>Nahin, Paul. ''The Science of Radio.'' Page 285. Chapter 21.  ISBN 0-387-95150-4.</ref> The original heterodyne technique tried to accomplish all of this in one stage thus producing an unstable amplifier.

== How it works ==
[[Image:Superhet2.png|center]]
In a superheterodyne receiver, the incoming radio signal of interest at frequency ''f<sub>IN</sub>''  is mixed (that is, multiplied) with a second signal ''f<sub>LO</sub>'' produced by an [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]] circuit in the receiver, called the [[local oscillator]] (LO).  This mixing produces two new frequencies, at the sum (''f<sub>IN</sub>'' + ''f<sub>LO</sub>'') and difference (''f<sub>IN</sub>'' - ''f<sub>LO</sub>'') of the original frequencies.  One of these two new frequencies is discarded, usually the higher one (''f<sub>IN</sub>'' + ''f<sub>LO</sub>''), by [[Electronic filter|filtering]] it out of the mixer output.  The remaining difference frequency is called the [[intermediate frequency]] (IF), and it is passed to a high gain amplifier, and signal processing that eventually extracts the desired [[modulation]] carried by the signal.  Common choices for the IF frequency are 455 [[Hertz|kHz]] in some [[AM radio]]s and 10.7 MHz in [[FM radio]]s.  This process of shifting the RF signal down to a lower IF frequency is called "[[downconverter|down conversion]]".

== Mathematical principle ==
Heterodyning is based on the [[trigonometric identity]]:

:<math>\sin \theta \sin \varphi = \frac{1}{2}\cos(\theta - \varphi) - \frac{1}{2}\cos(\theta + \varphi)</math>

The product on the left hand side represents the multiplication ("mixing") of a [[sine wave]] with another [[sine wave]]. The right hand side shows that the resulting signal is the difference of two [[sinusoidal]] terms, one at the sum of the two original frequencies, and one at the difference, which can be considered to be separate signals.

Using this trigonometric identity, the result of multiplying two sine wave signals, <math>\sin (2 \pi f_1 t)\,</math> and <math>\sin (2 \pi f_2 t)\,</math> can be calculated:

:<math>\sin (2 \pi f_1 t)\sin (2 \pi f_2 t) = \frac{1}{2}\cos [2 \pi (f_1 - f_2) t] - \frac{1}{2}\cos [2 \pi (f_1 + f_2) t] \,</math>

The result is the sum of two sinusoidal signals, one at the sum ''f<sub>1</sub>'' + ''f<sub>2</sub>'' and one at the difference  ''f<sub>1</sub>'' - ''f<sub>2</sub>'' of the original frequencies

== Mixer ==
The two signals are multiplied in a device called a [[Frequency mixer|mixer]].  In order to multiply the signals, the mixer must be a [[nonlinear]] component, that is, its output current or voltage must be a nonlinear function of its input.  Most circuit elements in communications circuits are designed to be [[Linear circuit|linear]].  This means they obey the [[superposition principle]]; if ''F(v)'' is the output of a linear element with an input of ''v'':

:<math>F(v_1 + v_2) = F(v_1) + F(v_2)  \,</math>

So if two sine wave signals are applied to a linear device, the output is simply the sum of the outputs when the two signals are applied separately, with no product terms.  So the function ''F'' must be nonlinear.  Examples of nonlinear components that are used as mixers are [[vacuum tube]]s and [[transistor]]s biased near cutoff ([[class C amplifier|class C]]), and [[diode]]s.  For lower frequencies, IC [[analog multiplier]]s can be used which multiply signals precisely.   [[Magnetic core|Ferromagnetic core]] [[inductor]]s driven into [[saturation (magnetic)|saturation]] can also be used.  In [[nonlinear optics]], crystals that have nonlinear characteristics are used to mix [[laser]] light beams to create heterodynes at optical frequencies.

== Output of a mixer ==
To demonstrate mathematically how a nonlinear component can multiply signals and generate heterodyne frequencies, the nonlinear function ''F'' can be expanded in a [[power series]] ([[MacLaurin series]]):

:<math>F(v) = \alpha_1 v + \alpha_2 v^2 + \alpha_3 v^3 + \ldots    \,</math>

To simplify the math, the higher order terms above ''α<sub>2</sub>'' will be indicated by an ellipsis (". . .") and only the first terms will be shown.  Applying the two sine waves at frequencies ''ω<sub>1</sub>'' = 2π''f<sub>1</sub>'' and ''ω<sub>2</sub>'' = 2π''f<sub>2</sub>'' to this device:

:<math>v_{out} = F(A_1 \sin \omega_1 t + A_2 \sin \omega_2 t)\,</math>

:<math>v_{out} = \alpha_1 (A_1 \sin \omega_1 t + A_2 \sin  \omega_2 t) +  \alpha_2(A_1 \sin \omega_1 t + A_2 \sin  \omega_2 t)^2 + \ldots     \,</math>

:<math>v_{out} = \alpha_1 (A_1 \sin \omega_1 t + A_2 \sin  \omega_2 t) +  \alpha_2(A_1^2 \sin^2 \omega_1 t + 2 A_1 A_2 \sin \omega_1 t \sin  \omega_2 t +  A_2^2 \sin^2  \omega_2 t) + \ldots       \,</math>

It can be seen that the second term above contains a product of the two sine waves.  Simplifying with [[trigonometric identity|trigonometric identities]]:

:<math>v_{out} = \alpha_1 (A_1 \sin \omega_1 t + A_2 \sin  \omega_2 t) +  \alpha_2(\frac{A_1^2}{2} [1 - \cos 2 \omega_1 t] +  A_1 A_2 [\cos (\omega_1 t - \omega_2 t) - \cos (\omega_1 t + \omega_2 t) ] +  \frac{A_2^2}{2} [1 - \cos 2 \omega_2 t] ) + \ldots      \,</math>

:<math>v_{out} =      \alpha_2 A_1 A_2 \cos (\omega_1  - \omega_2 )t  -  \alpha_2 A_1 A_2 \cos (\omega_1  + \omega_2 ) t +  \ldots   \,</math>

So the output contains sinusoidal terms with frequencies at the sum ''ω<sub>1</sub>'' + ''ω<sub>2</sub>'' and difference ''ω<sub>1</sub>'' - ''ω<sub>2</sub>'' of the two original frequencies.  It also contains terms at the original frequencies and at multiples of the original frequencies 2''ω<sub>1</sub>'', 2''ω<sub>2</sub>'', 3''ω<sub>1</sub>'', 3''ω<sub>2</sub>'', etc.; the latter are called [[harmonics]].  These unwanted frequencies, along with the unwanted heterodyne frequency, must be filtered out of the mixer output to leave the desired heterodyne.

== Applications ==
Heterodyning is used very widely in [[communications engineering]] to generate new frequencies and move information from one frequency channel to another.  Besides its use in the superheterodyne circuit which is found in almost all radio and television receivers, it is used in [[radio transmitter]]s, [[modem]]s, [[satellite]] communications and set-top boxes, [[radar]], [[radio telescope]]s, [[telemetry]] systems, [[cell phone]]s, [[cable television]] converter boxes and [[Cable television headend|headends]], [[microwave relay]]s, [[metal detector]]s, [[atomic clock]]s, and military [[electronic countermeasures]] (jamming) systems.

===Up and down converters===
In digital communications signals can be transmitted in [[baseband]] or [[passband]]. On receiver side usually a downconverter is used to transform the signal from the [[passband]] back to the [[baseband]] for further processing.
The local oscillator frequency is <math>\sqrt{2} e^{j2 \Pi f_c t}</math>, with <math>f_c</math> being the carrier frequency. This results in a scaling of the received signal by <math>\sqrt{2}</math> and a phase shifting by <math>f_c</math> to the left, so that the resulting signal is located in the baseband.

A '''radio frequency upconverter''' is a device that takes an input of [[radio frequency]] energy of a specific [[frequency]] range and outputs it on a higher frequency.  Likewise, downconverters take an input frequency and reduce it to a lower output frequency. Both converters are commonly used in [[transverter]]s and satellite communications.  Upconverters achieve this frequency conversion via heterodyning, the same principle as modern receivers and transmitters to offset the frequency.

=== Analog videotape recording ===
Many analog [[videotape]] systems rely on a downconverted color subcarrier in order to record color information in their limited bandwidth. These systems are referred to as "heterodyne systems" or "color-under systems". For instance, for [[NTSC]] video systems, the [[VHS]] (and [[S-VHS]]) recording system converts the color subcarrier from the NTSC standard 3.58 MHz to ~629 kHz.<ref name = lionlamb>[http://www.lionlmb.org/quad/format.html#12incomposite Videotape formats using {{convert|1/2|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} tape] ; Retrieved 2007-01-01</ref> [[PAL]] VHS color subcarrier is similarly downconverted (but from 4.43 MHz). The now-obsolete 3/4" [[U-matic]] systems use a heterodyned ~688 kHz subcarrier for NTSC recordings (as does [[Sony]]'s [[Betamax]], which is at its basis a 1/2" consumer version of U-matic), while PAL U-matic decks came in two mutually incompatible varieties, with different subcarrier frequencies, known as Hi-Band and Low-Band. Other videotape formats with heterodyne color systems include [[Video-8]] and [[Hi8]].<ref name = poynton>Poynton, Charles. ''Digital Video and HDTV:  Algorithms and Interfaces'' San Francisco: Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, 2003 PP 582, 583 ISBN 1-55860-792-7</ref>

The heterodyne system in these cases is used to convert quadrature phase-encoded and amplitude modulated sine waves from the broadcast frequencies to frequencies recordable in less than 1 MHz bandwidth. On playback, the recorded color information is heterodyned back to the standard subcarrier frequencies for display on televisions and for interchange with other standard video equipment.

Some U-matic (3/4") decks feature 7-pin mini-[[DIN connector]]s to allow dubbing of tapes without a heterodyne up-conversion and down-conversion, as do some industrial VHS, S-VHS, and Hi8 recorders.

=== Music synthesis ===
The [[theremin]], an [[electronic musical instrument]], uses the heterodyne principle to produce a variable [[audio frequency]] in response to the movement of the [[musician]]'s hands in the vicinity of some [[antenna (radio)|antennas]].  The output of a fixed radio frequency oscillator is mixed with that of an oscillator whose frequency is affected by the [[variable capacitor|variable capacitance]] between the antenna and the thereminist as that person moves her or his hand near the pitch control antenna.  The difference between the two oscillator frequencies produces a tone in the audio range.

The [[Ring modulator]] is a type of heterodyne incorporated into some [[synthesizers]] or used as a stand-alone audio effect.

=== Optical heterodyning ===
[[Optical heterodyne detection]] is a current active area of research is extension of the heterodyning technique to higher frequencies, particularly to [[light]] frequencies, which are above radio frequencies in the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].  This technique could greatly improve [[optical modulator]]s, increasing the density of information carried by [[optical fiber]]s.  It is also being applied in the creation of more accurate [[atomic clock]]s based on directly measuring the frequency of a laser beam.<ref>http://tsapps.nist.gov/ts_sbir/abstracts/08abst1.htm see NIST subtopic 9.07.9-4.R for a description of research on one system to do this.</ref>

Since optical frequencies are far beyond any feasible electronic circuit all photon detectors are inherently energy detectors not oscillating electric field detectors. However since energy detection is inherently "square-law" detection, it intrinsically mixes any optical frequencies present on the detector.  Thus sensitive detection of specific optical frequencies is possible by [[optical heterodyne detection]] when two different (close-by) wavelengths of light illuminate the detector so that the oscillating electrical output corresponds to their difference frequency.  This allows extremely narrow band detection (much narrower band than any possible color filter can achieve) as well as precision measurements of phase and frequency of a signal light relative to a reference light source, as in [[Laser Doppler Vibrometry]].

This phase sensitive detection has been applied for Doppler measurements of wind speed, and imaging through dense media.  The high sensitivity against background light is especially useful for [[LIDAR]].
