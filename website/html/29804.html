'''Precision Graphics Markup Language''' ('''PGML''') is an [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]]-based language for representing [[vector graphics]]. It was a [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) submission by [[Adobe Systems]], [[IBM]], [[Netscape]], and [[Sun Microsystems]], that was not adopted as a [[W3C recommendation|recommendation]].

PGML and [[Vector Markup Language]], another XML-based vector graphics language W3C submission supported by [[Autodesk]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Macromedia]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Visio Corporation]], were later joined and improved upon to create [[Scalable Vector Graphics]] (SVG).

==Applications==
The [[ArgoUML]] [[Computer-aided_software_engineering|CASE]] tool is able to export [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] diagrams in PGML.
