<html> <head> <title>Richard Bornat</title></head><body>'''Richard Bornat''' (born 1944), is a noted [[United Kingdom|British]] [[author]] and [[research]]er in the field of [[computer science]]. He is also [[professor]] of [[Computer programming]] at [[Middlesex University]]. Previously he was at [[Queen Mary, University of London]].

== Research ==

Bornat's research interests includes ''program proving'' in [[separation logic]]. His focus is on the [[Proof theory|proof]]s themselves; as opposed to any logical underpinnings. Much of the work involves discovering ways to state the properties of independent modules, in a manner that makes their composition into useful systems conducive.

Bornat (in conjunction with [[Bernard Sufrin]] of the [[Oxford University Computing Laboratory]]) developed [[Jape_(software)|Jape]], a [[proof calculator]]; he is involved in research on the usability of this tool for exploration of novel proofs.

Richard Bornat's PhD students have included [[Samson Abramsky]] in the early 1980s.

In 2004, one of Bornat's students developed an aptitude test to ''"divide people up into programmers and non-programmers before they ever come into contact with programming."'' The test was first given to a group of students in 2005 during an experiment on the use of mental models in programming. At the end of the experiment, Bornat delivered a talk entitled ''"Dividing the Sheep from the Goats"''. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/news/2006/RBornat/ |title=Dividing the Sheep from the Goats|publisher=Computing at Kent|author=Brown, Maggie|date=February 20, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite paper|url=http://www.cs.mdx.ac.uk/research/PhDArea/saeed/paper1.pdf |title=The camel has two humps|publisher=School of Computing, Middlesex University, UK|author=Dehnadi,Saeed & Bornat, Richard|date=February 20, 2006}}</ref>

== Publications ==

Bornat published a book entitled ''"Understanding and Writing Compilers: A Do It Yourself Guide"'', which is regarded as one of the most extensive resources on [[compiler]] development. Although it has been out of print for some time, he has now made it available as an [http://www.cs.mdx.ac.uk/staffpages/r_bornat/books/compiling.pdf online edition].
