The '''information ladder''' is a diagram created by [[education]] professor [[Norman Longworth]] to describe the stages in human [[learning]]. According to the ladder, a learner moves through the following progression to construct "wisdom" at the highest level from "data" at the lowest level:

: '''[[Data]] → [[Information]] → [[Knowledge]] → [[Understanding]] → [[Insight]] → [[Wisdom]]'''

Whereas the first two steps can be scientifically exactly defined, the upper parts belong to the domain of psychology and philosophy.

The related model in [[information science]] is referred to as [[DIKW|DIKW Hierarchy]].
