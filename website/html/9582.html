Levy was born in London. He won the London Junior Chess Championship in 1965 and 1966.<ref name="Golombek p. 180">[[Harry Golombek]], ''Golombek's Encyclopedia of Chess'', Crown Publishers, New York, p. 180. ISBN 0-517-53146-1.</ref> He won the [[Scottish Chess Championship]] in 1968. He tied for fifth place at the 1969 [[Praia da Rocha]] [[Zonal]] [[tournament]], scoring over two-thirds and thereby obtaining the title of International Master.<ref name="Golombek p. 180" /> He played on Board One for the Scottish team at the 1972 [[Chess Olympiad]] in [[Skopje]], [[Yugoslavia]], scoring six wins, five draws, and seven losses (47.2%).<ref>Ray Keene and David Levy, ''Chess Olympiad 1972'', Doubleday, 1973, p. 212. ISBN 0-385-06925-1.</ref>

Levy became a professional chess writer in 1971, and has been prolific.<ref name="Golombek p. 180" /> Several of his books were co-written with English Grandmaster and prolific chess author [[Raymond Keene]].<ref>E.g., R. D. Keene and D. N. L. Levy, ''Siegen Chess Olympiad'', CHESS Ltd., 1970; Ray Keene and David Levy, ''Chess Olympiad 1972'', Doubleday, 1973, ISBN 0-385-06925-1.</ref> Levy also married Keene's sister.  He has functioned as literary agent for the escaped [[Great Train Robbery (1963)|Great Train robber]], [[Ronald Biggs]].

In the late 1970s, Levy consulted with Texas Instruments on the development of the Chess module for the TI-99/4A Home Computer Project.

In 1997, he led the team that won the [[Loebner Prize]] for the program called "CONVERSE".
The prize competition rewards the program that is best able to simulate human communication. Levy entered the contest again in 2009, and won.<ref name=guardian9916>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/sep/16/sex-robots-david-levy-loebner Let's talk about sex ... with robots], ''The Guardian'', 16 September 2009</ref>

Since 1999, he has been the president of the [[International Computer Games Association]].
He was Chairman of the Rules and Arbitration Committee for the [[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]] vs [[Deep Junior]] chess match in [[New York City|New York]] in 2003.

Levy once started a business called Tiger Computer Security with a famous computer hacker, [[Mathew Bevan]]. Now he is the [[Chief Executive Officer]] of [[Intelligent Toys Ltd]], a London-based company that develops toys that incorporate AI.

Levy also wrote ''[[Love and Sex With Robots]]'', published in the United States in 2007 by [[HarperCollins]], and forthcoming from [[Gerald Duckworth and Company Ltd|Duckworth]] in the UK. It is the commercial edition of his Ph.D. thesis, which he defended successfully on 11 October 2007, at [[Maastricht University]], The Netherlands. On 17 January 2008, he appeared on the late night television show ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' to promote his book. In September 2009, Levy predicted that sex robots would hit the market within a couple of years.<ref name=guardian9916/>

==Computer chess bet==
<!-- If changing this title, note that "Human-computer chess matches" links here -->

Beginning in 1968, Levy made a famous bet with four [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) luminaries, ultimately totaling 1,250 [[British pounds]], that no computer program would win a chess match against him within ten years.<ref>David Levy, "Man Beats Machine!", ''[[Chess Life & Review]]'', November 1978, pp. 600-03, at pp. 600-01.</ref><ref>David Levy and Monroe Newborn, ''More Chess and Computers: The [[Microcomputer]] Revolution, The Challenge Match'', Computer Science Press, Potomac, Maryland, and Batsford, London, 1980, p. 1. ISBN 0-914894-07-2.</ref>    In 1973, he wrote:<ref>David Levy, "Computer Chess—Past, Present and Future", ''Chess Life & Review'', December 1973, pp. 723-26, at 726.</ref><blockquote>Clearly, I shall win my ... bet in 1978, and I would still win if the period were to be extended for another ten years. Prompted by the lack of conceptual progress over more than two decades, I am tempted to speculate that a computer program will not gain the title of International Master before the turn of the century and that the idea of an electronic [[World Chess Championship|world champion]] belongs only in the pages of a [[science fiction]] book.</blockquote>

Until 1977, no computer program was good enough to pose a serious threat to Levy.<ref name="Monroe Newborn 1980, p. 2">David Levy and Monroe Newborn, ''More Chess and Computers: The [[Microcomputer]] Revolution, The Challenge Match'', Computer Science Press, Potomac, Maryland, and Batsford, London, 1980, p. 2. ISBN 0-914894-07-2.</ref>    In April 1977, he played a two-game match against [[Chess (Northwestern University)|Chess 4.5]], a program written by David Slate and Larry Atkin of [[Northwestern University]] that had done well in human events, including winning the 1977 Minnesota Open.<ref name="Monroe Newborn 1980, p. 2" />    After Levy won the first game, the second was not played since Levy could not possibly lose the match.<ref>David Levy and Monroe Newborn, ''More Chess and Computers: The [[Microcomputer]] Revolution, The Challenge Match'', Computer Science Press, Potomac, Maryland, and Batsford, London, 1980, pp. 2-5. ISBN 0-914894-07-2.</ref>   On 17 December, Levy played a two-game match against KAISSA; once again Levy won the first game and the match was terminated.<ref>David Levy and Monroe Newborn, ''More Chess and Computers: The [[Microcomputer]] Revolution, The Challenge Match'', Computer Science Press, Potomac, Maryland, and Batsford, London, 1980, pp. 6-8. ISBN 0-914894-07-2.</ref>    In August 1978, Levy played a two-game match against MacHack; this time both games were played, Levy winning 2-0.<ref>David Levy, "Man Beats Machine!", ''[[Chess Life & Review]]'', November 1978, pp. 600-03, at pp. 601.</ref><ref>David Levy and Monroe Newborn, ''More Chess and Computers: The [[Microcomputer]] Revolution, The Challenge Match'', Computer Science Press, Potomac, Maryland, and Batsford, London, 1980, pp. 8-10. ISBN 0-914894-07-2.</ref>

The final match necessary for Levy to win the bet also was played in late August 1978, this time against [[Chess (Northwestern University)|Chess 4.7]], the successor to Chess 4.5. In 1978 Levy won the bet, defeating the Chess 4.7 in a six-game match by a score of 4.5-1.5.<ref>David Levy, "Man Beats Machine!", ''[[Chess Life & Review]]'', November 1978, pp. 600-03, at pp. 601-03.</ref><ref>David Levy and Monroe Newborn, ''More Chess and Computers: The [[Microcomputer]] Revolution, The Challenge Match'', Computer Science Press, Potomac, Maryland, and Batsford, London, 1980, pp. 10-30. ISBN 0-914894-07-2.</ref>    The computer scored a draw in game two (after getting a completely winning position but being outplayed by Levy in the [[chess endgame|endgame]]) and a win in game four, when Levy essayed the very sharp, dubious [[Latvian Gambit]].<ref>David Levy, "Man Beats Machine!", ''[[Chess Life & Review]]'', November 1978, pp. 600-03, at pp. 602-03.</ref>    Levy wrote, "I had proved that my 1968 assessment had been correct, but on the other hand my opponent in this match was very, very much stronger than I had thought possible when I started the bet."<ref name="Monroe Newborn 1980, p. 30">David Levy and Monroe Newborn, ''More Chess and Computers: The [[Microcomputer]] Revolution, The Challenge Match'', Computer Science Press, Potomac, Maryland, and Batsford, London, 1980, p. 30. ISBN 0-914894-07-2.</ref>    He observed that, "Now nothing would surprise me (very much)."<ref>David Levy and Monroe Newborn, ''More Chess and Computers: The [[Microcomputer]] Revolution, The Challenge Match'', Computer Science Press, Potomac, Maryland, and Batsford, London, 1980, Preface. ISBN 0-914894-07-2.</ref>

In order to further stimulate the growth of computer chess, Levy offered $1,000 to the authors of the first chess program to defeat him in a four- or six-game match; ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni magazine]]'' added $4,000 to this, for a total of $5,000.<ref name="Monroe Newborn 1980, p. 30" />    In 1989, the authors of the [[Deep Thought (chess computer)|Deep Thought]] program won the prize when their program beat Levy.

In 1996, [[Popular Science]] asked Levy about [[Garry Kasparov]]'s impending match against [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]]. Levy confidently stated that "...Kasparov can take the match 6 to 0 if he wants to. 'I'm positive, I'd stake my life on it.'"<ref name="confidence">{{Citation | last = Antonoff | first = Michael | title = Curtains for Kasparov? | magazine = Popular Science | pages = 42–46 |date=March 1996}}</ref>    In fact, Kasparov [[Deep Blue - Kasparov, 1996, Game 1|lost the first game]], and [[Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov|won the match]] by a score of only 4-2. The following year, he [[Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov|lost their historic rematch]] 2.5-3.5.
