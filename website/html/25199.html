The '''Mozilla application framework''' is a collection of [[cross-platform]] [[software componentry|software component]]s that make up the [[Mozilla]] [[application software|application]]s. It was originally known as '''XPFE''', an [[abbreviation]] of cross-platform front end. It was also known as '''XPToolkit'''. To avoid confusion, it is now best referred to as the Mozilla application framework.

While similar to generic cross-platform [[application framework]]s like [[GTK+]], [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] and [[wxWidgets]], the intent is to provide a subset of cross-platform functionality suitable for building network applications like [[web browser]]s, leveraging the cross-platform functionality already built into the Gecko layout engine.

The following are the various components of the framework:

; Gecko : [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]] is a standard-based [[layout engine]] designed for performance and portability.
; Necko : Necko provides an extensible API for several layers of networking from transport to presentation layers.
; XUL : [[XUL]] is the basis of [[user interface]]. It is an application of [[XML]] that defines various user interfaces elements, mostly [[GUI widget|widgets]], control elements, template, etc. It is similar in many ways to [[HTML]].
; XBL : [[XBL]] allows one to define his/her own widget for use in XUL.
; XPCOM : [[XPCOM]] is an object interface that allows interfacing between any programming language for which a binding has been developed
; XPConnect : [[XPConnect]] is the binding between XPCOM and [[JavaScript]].
; XPInstall : [[XPInstall]] is a technology for installing small packages like [[Add-on (Mozilla)|extension]]s and themes into Mozilla applications in form of installation archives known as [[XPI]].
; Web services : Mozilla includes built-in support for popular [[web service]]s standards [[XML-RPC]], [[SOAP]] (dropped since Gran Paradiso Alpha 7<ref>[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=332174 Bug 332174 – Drop SOAP support]</ref>), and [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]] as well as a simple [[XMLHttpRequest]] object similar to the one in [[Internet Explorer]].
; Others : The framework supports a number of open or common standards, including [[Document Type Definition|DTD]], [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]], [[XSL Transformations|XSLT]]/[[XPath]], [[MathML]], [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]], [[JavaScript]], [[SQL]], [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]], etc.
