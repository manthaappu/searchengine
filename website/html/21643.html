'''Light transport theory''' deals with the mathematics behind calculating the energy transfers between media that affect visibility. This article is currently specific to light transport in rendering processes such as [[global illumination]] and [[High dynamic range imaging|HDRI]].

=== Light Transport ===
The amount of light transported is measured by flux density, that is flux per unit area.

====Radiometry====
==== Energy Transfer ====

===Hemisphere===
Given a surface S, a hemisphere H can be projected on to S to calculate the amount of incoming and outgoing light  . If a point P is selected at random on the surface S, the amount of light incoming and outgoing can be calculated by its projection onto the hemisphere.

===Hemicube===
The hemicube model works in a similar way that the hemisphere model works, with the exception that a hemicube is projected as opposed to a hemisphere. The similarity is only in concept, the actual calculation done by integration has a different form factor.

Rendering converts a model into an image either by simulating light transport to get physically-based photorealistic images, or by applying some kind of style as in [[non-photorealistic rendering]].  The two basic operations in realistic rendering are transport (how much light gets from one place to another) and scattering (how surfaces interact with light).
