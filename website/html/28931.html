'''Persuasive writing''', could be referred to as a creative writing or an [[argument]], in which the speaker uses words to convince the reader of a writer’s view(s) regarding an issue. Persuasive writing involves convincing the reader to perform an action, or it may simply consist of an argument(s) convincing the reader of the writer’s point of view. Persuasive writing is one of the most used writing types in the world. Persuasive writers employ many techniques to improve their argument and show support for their claim. Another definition is "an essay that offers and supports an opinion".

==Early rhetoric and persuasive writing==
Early rhetoricians dealt with persuasive writing and oration. [[Cicero]] most notably defined persuasive writing as the grand style in his work ''[[Orator]]''.

Cicero stated, ''“This eloquence has power to sway man’s mind and move them in every possible way”''.

He also stated, however, that the most effective orator, or in this case, writer, uses a combination of the plain, middle, and this grand style to suit the context.

==Ethos, logos, and pathos in persuasive writing==
By appealing to credibility, writers can make their claims more believable. This is called an appeal  to [[ethos]], as defined by Aristotle. The writer builds on his or her ethos by writing with clarity (an important element of style) and eliminating contradictions within the text itself. The writer will be more credible to the target audience if there are no internal errors in [[syntax]] and mechanics as well as no factual errors in the subject matter.

Writers can appeal to logic when writing to persuade using the appeal known as [[logos]]. This appeal is manifested in the supporting statements for the writer’s claim. In most cases, a successful appeal to logos requires tangible evidence, e.g., a quote from acknowledged written material. The writer will appeal to the rationality of the audience.

Possibly the most important appeal for persuasive writers is the appeal to emotions or [[pathos]]. “A successful pathetic appeal will put the audience in a suitable mood by addressing their knowledge of or feelings about the subject” (Mendelson). This can be a very effective way to win over an audience!

Most persuasive writing techniques use an effective combination of all three appeals.

==Traditional structure==
Here are the traditional parts of persuasive writing that can be used to strengthen an argument.  While these do not have to be followed exactly or in this order, they are helpful in forming the structure in persuasive writing.

* [[Exordium (rhetoric)|Exordium]], or introduction
* Narration, or background statement of the facts
* Partition, or forecast of the topics to be presented
* Conformation, or the confirmation of the piece.  In contemporary English classes, this would be called the body of the text.
* Refutation, or discussion of alternatives
* Peroration, or a conclusion.  It’s often helpful to tie the conclusion back to the introduction in order to strengthen your claim.
* Rhetorical Questions, to get the reader thinking.

==You attitude==

"You attitude" is a technique in persuasive writing. especially in business writing, which produces goodwill and influences people favourably. It emphasises the reader's interest. It is an attitude of mind involving developing the view on a topic from the reader's point of view ('you') instead of the writer's ('me').

To use 'You attitude' in persuasive writing, the author should focus on what they want the reader to perceive from their content, minimise their own feelings, refer to the readers' requests, and use active voice.
