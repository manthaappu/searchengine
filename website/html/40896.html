<html> <head> <title>Yellow Pages (UDDI)</title></head><body>Yellow Pages are one of the three main components of [[UDDI]] (the protocol for discovering Web Services on the internet).  The other components are [[White Pages (UDDI)|White Pages]] for describing the business, and [[Green Pages (UDDI)|Green Pages]] for describing how to access the service.

Yellow pages provide a classification of the service or business, based on standard taxonomies.  These include the [[Standard Industrial Classification]] (SIC), the [[North American Industry Classification System]] (NAICS) <ref>Taylor, Ian J. From P2P to Web Services and Grids - Peers in a Client/Server World. Springer, 2005</ref>, or the [[United Nations Standard Products and Services Code]] (UNSPCS) .

Because a single business may provide a number of services, there may be several Yellow Pages (each describing a service) associated with one White Page (giving general information about the business).
