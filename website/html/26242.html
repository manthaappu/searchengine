'''Neural Workflow''' is a concept for a [[workflow]] system to be used in [[Computer software|software]], which is based upon the [[neuron|neural]] function of a [[human brain]] as opposed to a more traditional workflow system. In a neural workflow system, the following holds true:
# There are no sources or sinks. 
# All nodes or gates may have the ability to action or be actioned by any other gate or node.
# Actions or stimuli which cause flows to be unresolved are placed in a 'too hard' status until the system or an administrator creates a series of nodes to resolve these stimuli.
# The system tracks which stratagems or node pathways most successfully resolve a stimuli with a given or partially given set of characteristics.
