<html> <head> <title>List of algebraic structures</title></head><body>In [[universal algebra]], a branch of pure [[mathematics]], an [[algebraic structure]] is a [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]] or [[quasivariety]]. [[Abstract algebra]] is primarily the study of algebraic structures and their properties. Some [[axiom]]atic [[formal system]]s that are neither varieties nor quasivarieties, called ''nonvarieties'' below, are included among the algebraic structures by tradition.
 
Other web lists of algebraic structures, organized more or less alphabetically, include [http://math.chapman.edu/cgi-bin/structures/ Jipsen] and [http://planetmath.org/browse/objects/ PlanetMath.] These lists mention many structures not included below, and may present more information about some structures than is presented here. 

==Generalities==
An algebraic structure consists of one or two [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] closed under some [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]], [[function (mathematics)|functions]], and [[relation (mathematics)|relations]], satisfying a number of [[axiom]]s, including none. This definition of an algebraic structure should not be taken as restrictive. Anything that satisfies the axioms defining a structure is an instance of that structure, regardless of how many other axioms that instance happens to satisfy. For example, all [[group (mathematics)|groups]] are also [[semigroup]]s and [[magma (algebra)|magmas]]. 

Structures are listed below in approximate order of increasing complexity as follows:
*Structures that are [[variety (universal algebra)|varieties]] precede those that are not;
*'''Simple''' structures built on one underlying set ''S'' precede '''composite''' structures built on two;
* If ''A'' and ''B'' are the two underlying sets making up a composite structure, that structure may include [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of the form ''A''x''A''→''B'' or ''A''x''B''→''A''.
*Structures are then ordered by the number and [[arity|arities]] of the operations they contain. The [[heap (mathematics)|heap]], a group-like structure, is the only structure mentioned in this entry requiring an operation whose [[arity]] exceeds 2.

If structure ''B'' is under structure ''A'' and more indented, then ''A'' is [[interpretability|interpretable]] in ''B'', meaning that all [[theorem]]s of ''A'' are theorems of ''B''. The [[inverse relation|converse]] is usually not the case.

A structure is [[trivial (mathematics)|trivial]] if the [[cardinality]] of ''S'' is less than 2, and is otherwise nontrivial.

==Varieties==
[[identity (mathematics)|Identities]] are equations formulated using only the operations the structure allows, and variables that are tacitly [[universal quantifier|universally quantified]] over a set that is part of the definition of the structure. Hence identities contain no sentential [[connective]]s, [[quantification|existentially quantified variables]], or [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]] of any kind other than equality and the operations the structure allows. 

If the axioms defining an algebraic structure are all identities--or can be recast as [[identity (mathematics)|identities]]--the structure is a [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]] (not to be confused with [[algebraic variety]] in the sense of [[algebraic geometry]]). Nonidentities can often be recast as identities. For example, any  [[lattice (order)|lattice inequality]] of the form α≤β can always be recast as the identity α∧β=α.

An important result is that given any variety '''C''' and any underlying set ''X'', the [[free object]] ''F''(''X'')∈'''C''' exists.

===Simple structures===
'''No''' [[binary operation]].
* [[Set (mathematics)|Set]]: a degenerate algebraic structure having no operations.
* [[Pointed set]]: ''S'' has one or more distinguished elements. While pointed sets are near-trivial, they lead to [[discrete space]]s, which are not.
**[[Bipointed set]]: ''S'' has exactly two distinguished elements. 
* Unary system: ''S'' and a single [[unary operation]] over ''S''.
* Pointed unary system: a unary system with ''S'' a pointed set.

===Group-like structures===
{{Group-like structures}}
See [[Magma (algebra)|magma]] for a list of the many properties that a group-like structures may possess. The diagram to the right summarizes the defining properties of:
* The better-known group-like structures, from the least (magmas) to the most restrictive (groups);
* The related notions of [[category (mathematics)|category]] and [[groupoid]].

All group-like structures feature a primary (and often unique) [[binary operation|binary]] or [[ternary operation]], which usually (e.g., for [[semigroup]]s and hoops) [[associativity|associates]]. This operation will nearly always be denoted here by concatenation, and when it is binary, will be called "group product." If group product associates, brackets are not required to resolve the order of operation. When group product does not associate (e.g., [[quasigroup]]s, [[heap (mathematics)|semiheaps]], [[quasigroup|loops]], implication algebras), an embedded period indicates the grouping. Examples: ''xy''.''z'', ''x''.''yz''.

For [[Steiner system|Steiner magmas]], [[abelian group]]s, [[logic algebra]]s, [[Band (mathematics)|bands]], equivalence algebras, and [[hoop (mathematics)|hoops]], group product also commutes. [[Commutativity]] may be added to any group-like structure for which it is not already the case.

[[Group (mathematics)|Groups]], [[logic algebra]]s, [[lattice (order)|lattices]], and [[loop (algebra)|loops]] feature a [[unary operation]], denoted here by enclosure in parentheses.

For [[monoid]]s, [[loop (algebra)|loops]], and sloops, ''S'' is a [[pointed set]].

'''Two''' [[binary operation]]s.
* [[hoop (mathematics)|Hoop]]: a commutative [[monoid]] with a second [[binary operation]], denoted by [[infix]] →, satisfying the axioms ''x''→.''y''→''z'' = ''xy''.→''z'', ''x''→''x'' = 1, and ''x''→''y''.''x'' = ''y''→''x''.''y''.

===Lattice-like structures===
The [[binary operations]] [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] and [[join (mathematics)|join]], which characterize nearly all structures in this section, are [[idempotent]], by assumption or proof. Latticoids are the only lattice-like structure that do not associate. N.B. "Lattice" is also employed in a number of [[lattice (group)|group-theoretic contexts]], including to refer to a [[discrete subgroup]] of the [[real vector space]] '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> that spans '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.

Some concepts from [[order theory]] that recur in lattice theory:
*[[Strict partial order]]: A set ''S'' with a relation that is [[transitive relation|transitive]] and [[irreflexive relation|irreflexive]].
**[[Preordered set]]: A strict partial order that is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]].
***[[Directed set]]: A preordered set such that every pair of elements has an [[upper bound]].
***[[Partially ordered set]]: A preordered set with the [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetry]] property.
****[[Totally ordered set]]: A partially ordered set with [[total relation|totality]] replacing [[reflexive relation|reflexivity]].

'''One''' [[binary operation]], one of [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] or [[join (mathematics)|join]], and denoted by [[concatenation]]. The two structures below are also [[magma (algebra)|magmas]]; see the preceding section.
*[[Semilattice]]: the [[binary operation]] commutes and associates. Also a [[partially ordered set]] closed under one of pairwise [[greatest lower bound]] or [[least upper bound]].
**[[Lattice (order)|Lattice]]: a semilattice with a unary operation, dualization, denoted by enclosure within a pair of brackets. If ''xy'' denotes meet, (''xy'') denotes join, and vice versa. The binary and unary operations interact via a form of the [[absorption law]], ''x''(''xy'') = ''x'' = (''x''(''xy'')). 

'''Two''' [[binary operations]], [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] ([[infix]] ∧) and [[join (mathematics)|join]] (infix ∨). [[Duality]] means that interchanging all meets and joins preserves truth.

*[[Latticoid]]: meet and join [[Commutativity|commute]] but do not [[associate]].
*[[Skew lattice]]: meet and join associate but do not commute.
*[[Lattice (order)|Lattice]]: a [[commutative]] skew lattice, an [[associative]] latticoid, and both a [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] and [[join]] [[semilattice]]. Meet and join interact via the [[absorption law]]: ''x''∧(''x''∨''y'') = ''x''. Also a [[partially ordered set]] closed under pairwise [[greatest lower bound]] and [[least upper bound]].
** [[Bounded lattice]]: a lattice with two distinguished elements, the [[greatest element|greatest]] (1) and the [[greatest element|least element]] (0), such that ''x''∨1=1 and ''x''∨0=''x''. [[duality|Dualizing]] requires interchanging 0 and 1. A bounded lattice is a [[pointed set]].
***[[Complete lattice]]:
****[[Algebraic lattice]]:
**[[Involutive lattice]]: a lattice with a unary operation, denoted by postfix ', and satisfying ''x''"=''x'' and (''x''∨''y'')' = ''x' ''∧''y' ''.
**[[Relatively complemented lattice]]:
** [[Complemented lattice]]: a lattice with a unary operation, [[complemented lattice|complementation]], denoted by [[reverse Polish notation|postfix]] ', such that ''x''∧''x' '' = 0 and 1=0'. 0 and 1 bound ''S''.
*** [[Orthocomplemented lattice]]: a complemented lattice satisfying ''x''" = ''x'' and ''x''∨''y''=''y'' ↔ ''y' ''∨''x' ''= ''x' '' (complementation is [[monotonic function|order reversing]]).
****[[Orthomodular lattice]]: an ortholattice such that (''x'' ≤ ''y'') → (''x'' ∨ (''x''<sup>⊥</sup> ∧ ''y'') = ''y'') holds.

*** [[Metric lattice]]:
***[[Projective lattice]]:
*** [[Arguesian lattice]]: a modular lattice satisfying the identity .
*** [[Distributive lattice]]: a lattice in which each of meet and join [[distributive lattice|distributes]] over the other. Distributive lattices are modular, but the converse need not hold.
**** [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]: a complemented distributive lattice. Either of meet or join can be defined in terms of the other and complementation.
*****[[Boolean algebra with operators]]: a Boolean algebra with one or more added operations, usually unary. Let a postfix * denote any added unary operation. Then 0* = 0 and (''x''∨''y'')* = ''x''*∨''y''*. More generally, all added operations (a) evaluate to 0 if any argument is 0, and (b) are [[lattice (order)|join preserving]], i.e., distribute over join. 
******[[Modal logic|Modal algebra]]: a Boolean algebra with a single added operator, the [[modal operator]].
*******[[Derivative algebra (abstract algebra)|Derivative algebra]]: a modal algebra whose added unary operation, the [[derivative operator]], satisfies ''x''**∨''x''*∨''x'' = ''x''*∨''x''.
******* [[Interior algebra]]: a modal algebra whose added unary operation, the [[interior operator]], satisfies ''x''*∨''x'' = ''x'' and ''x''** = ''x''*. The dual is a [[closure algebra]].
******** [[Monadic Boolean algebra]]: a closure algebra whose added unary operation, the [[existential quantifier]], denoted by prefix ∃, satisfies the axiom ∃(∃''x'')' = (∃''x'')'. The dual operator, ∀''x'' := (∃''x' '')' is the [[universal quantifier]].
::::Three structures whose intended interpretations are [[first order logic]]:
::::*[[Polyadic algebra]]: a [[monadic Boolean algebra]] with a second unary operation, denoted by prefixed '''S'''. ''I'' is an [[index set]], ''J'',''K''&sub;''I''. &exist; maps each ''J'' into the [[quantifier]] &exist;(''J''). '''S''' maps ''I''&rarr;''I'' [[Transformation (geometry)|transformations]] into Boolean [[endomorphism]]s on ''S''. &sigma;, &tau; range over possible transformations; &delta; is the [[identity transformation]]. The axioms are: &exist;(&empty;)''a''=''a'', &exist;(''J''&cup;''K'') = &exist;(''J'')&exist;(''K''), '''S'''(&delta;)''a'' = ''a'', '''S'''(&sigma;)'''S'''(&tau;) = '''S'''(&sigma;&tau;), '''S'''(&sigma;)&exist;(''J'') = '''S'''(&tau;)&exist;(''J'') (&forall;''i''&isin;''I''-''J'', such that &sigma;''i''=&tau;''i''), and &exist;(''J'')'''S'''(&tau;) = '''S'''(&tau;)&exist;(&tau;<sup>-1</sup>''J'') (&tau; [[injective]]).<ref>Pp. 26-28, 251, of [[Paul Halmos]] (1962) ''Algebraic Logic''. Chelsea.</ref>
::::* [[Relation algebra]]: ''S'', the [[Cartesian square]] of some set, is a:
:::::* [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] under join and complementation;
:::::* [[Monoid]] under binary [[relation composition|composition]] (infix •) and the [[identity element]] '''I''' such that 1='''I''' '∨'''I''';
:::::*[[Residuated Boolean algebra]] by virtue of a second unary operation, [[inverse function|converse]] (postfix <sup><math>\breve{\ }</math></sup>) and the axiom (''A''<sup><math>\breve{\ }</math></sup>•(''A''•''B'')')∨''B'' ' = ''B'' '.
:::::Converse is an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] and distributes over composition so that (''A''•''B'')<sup><math>\breve{\ }</math></sup> = ''B''<sup><math>\breve{\ }</math></sup>•''A''<sup><math>\breve{\ }</math></sup>. Converse and composition each [[distributive law|distribute]] over join.<ref>Givant, Steven, 2006, "The calculus of relations as a foundation for mathematics," ''[[Journal of Automated Reasoning]]'' 37: 277-322.</ref>
::::*[[Cylindric algebra]]: Boolean algebra augmented by unary cylindrification operations.

'''Three''' binary operations:
:::*[[Boolean semigroup]]: a Boolean algebra with an added binary operation that associates, distributes over join, and is annihilated by 0.
::*[[Implicative lattice]]: a distributive lattice with a third binary operation, implication, that distributes left and right over each of meet and join.
::*[[Brouwerian algebra]]: a distributive lattice with a [[greatest element]] and a third binary operation, denoted by infix " ' ", satisfying ((''x''∧''y'')≤''z'')∧(''y''≤''x'')' ''z''.
:::*[[Heyting algebra]]: a Brouwerian algebra with a [[least element]], whose third binary operation, now called [[relative pseudo-complement]], satisfies the identities ''x'x''=1, ''x''(''x'y'') = ''xy'', ''x' ''(''yz'') = (''x'y'')(''x'z''), and (''xy'')'''z'' = (''x'z'')(''y'z''). In [[pointless topology]], a Heyting algebra is called a '''frame'''.

'''Four''' or more binary operations:
*[[Residuated semilattice]]: a semilattice under meet or join, a monoid under product, and two further binary operations, residuation, satisfying the axioms .
**[[Action algebra]]: a [[residuated semilattice]] that is also [[Kleene algebra|Kleene lattice]]. Hence combines a 〈∨, •, 1, ←, →〉 algebra with a 〈∨, 0, •, 1, *〉 algebra.
**[[Residuated lattice]]: a Brouwerian algebra with a least element and a fourth binary operation, denoted by infix ⊗, such that (⊗,1) is a commutative [[monoid]] obeying the adjointness property ((''x''≤''y'')' ''z'') ↔ (''x''⊗''y''≤''z'').
***[[Residuated Boolean algebra]]: a [[residuated lattice]] whose lattice part is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]].
**** [[Relation algebra]]: a [[residuated Boolean algebra]] with an added unary operation, [[inverse relation|converse]]. ''S'', the [[Cartesian square]] of some set, is a [[monoid]] under an added [[residuated lattice|residuated]] binary operation, [[relation composition|composition]] with identity element '''I''', such that 1='''I''' '∨'''I'''. Composition and converse distribute over join. ''A<math>\oplus</math>B'' = (''A'' '⊗''B'' ')' defines a 4th binary operation, relational addition. 


The following [[Hasse diagram]] illustrates some pathways from a very general concept, [[partially ordered set]]s, to the oldest and most researched lattice, [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]. This diagram reveals some of the hierarchical structure linking a number of important types of lattices, not all discussed above because some are not varieties. This diagram consists of a number of links of the form ''A''→''B'', each meaning that structure ''A'' is included in structure ''B''.

[[Image:Lattice v4.png|800px]]

====Lattice ordered structures====
''S'' includes distinguished elements and is closed under additional operations, so that the axioms for a [[semigroup]], [[monoid]], [[group (mathematics)|group]], or a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] are satisfied.

===Ring-like structures===
'''Two''' [[binary operations]], addition and multiplication. That multiplication has a 0 is either an axiom or a theorem.
*[[shell (mathematics)|Shell]]: [[Multiplication]] has left/right [[identity element]] of 1, and a [[zero element]], 0, which is also the left/right [[identity element]] for [[addition]].
*[[Ringoid]]: multiplication distributes over addition.
**[[Nonassociative ring]]: a ringoid that is an abelian group under addition.
***[[Lie ring]]: a nonassociative ring whose multiplication [[anticommutative|anticommutes]] and satisfies the [[Jacobi identity]].
***[[Jordan ring]]: a nonassociative ring whose multiplication commutes and satisfies the [[Jordan identity]].
**Newman algebra: a ringoid that is also a shell. There is a unary operation, [[inverse]], denoted by a postfix "'", such that x+x'=1 and xx'=0. The following are provable: inverse is unique, ''x''"=''x'', addition commutes and associates, and multiplication commutes and is idempotent.
** [[Semiring]]: a ringoid that is also a shell. Addition and multiplication associate, addition commutes.
*** Commutative [[semiring]]: a semiring whose multiplication commutes.
** [[Rng (algebra)|Rng]]: a ringoid that is an [[Abelian group]] under addition and 0, and a semigroup under multiplication. 
*** [[Ring (mathematics)|Ring]]: a rng that is a monoid under multiplication and 1.
**** [[Commutative ring]]: a ring with commutative multiplication.
***** [[Boolean ring]]: a commutative ring with [[idempotent]] multiplication, [[isomorphic]] to [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]].
****[[differential algebra|Differential ring]]: A ring with an added [[unary operation]], [[differential algebra|derivation]], denoted by [[Suffix|prefix]] ∂ and satisfying the [[product rule]], ∂(''xy'') = ∂''xy''+''x''∂''y''.

N.B. The above definitions of ''rng'', ''ring'', and ''semiring'' do not command universal assent:
*Some employ "ring" to denote what is here called a [[Rng (algebra)|rng]], and call a ring in the above sense a "ring with identity";
*Some define a semiring as having no identity elements.

===Modules and algebras===
These structures feature a set ''R'' whose elements are [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]], denoted by Greek letters, and a set ''S'' whose members are denoted by Latin letters. For every ring ''R'', there is a corresponding [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]] of ''R''-modules. 

*[[Monoid ring]]: ''R'' is a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] and ''S'' is a [[monoid]].
**[[Group ring]]: a monoid ring such that ''S'' is a group.
***[[Group algebra]]: a group ring whose group product commutes.
*[[Module (mathematics)|Module]]: ''S'' is an abelian [[group with operators]], each unary operator indexed by ''R''. The operators are [[scalar multiplication]] ''R''x''S''→''S'', which commutes, associates, is [[unital algebra|unital]], and distributes over module and scalar addition. If only the pre(post)multiplication of module elements by scalars is defined, the result is a ''left'' (''right'') ''module''. 
**[[Comodule]]: the [[dual (category theory)|dual]] of a module.
**[[Vector space]]: A module such that ''R'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]].
** [[Algebra over a ring]] (also ''R-algebra''): a module where ''R'' is a [[commutative ring]]. There is a second binary operation over ''S'', called multiplication and denoted by concatenation, which distributes over module addition and is [[bilinear]]: α(''xy'') = (α''x'')''y'' = ''x''(α''y'').
***[[Algebra over a field]]: An algebra over a ring whose ''R'' is a field.
**** [[Associative algebra]]: an algebra over a field or ring, whose vector multiplication associates.
*****[[Coalgebra]]: the [[dual (category theory)|dual]] of a unital associative algebra.
*****[[Commutative algebra]]: an associative algebra whose vector multiplication commutes.
*****[[Incidence algebra]]: an associative algebra such that the elements of ''S'' are the functions ''f'' [''a,b'']: [''a,b'']→''R'', where [''a,b''] is an arbitrary closed interval of a locally finite [[poset]]. Vector multiplication is defined as a [[convolution]] of functions.
****[[Jordan algebra]]: an algebra over a field whose vector multiplication commutes, may or may not associate, and satisfies the [[Jordan identity]].
****[[Lie algebra]]: an algebra over a field satisfying the [[Jacobi identity]]. The vector multiplication, the [[Lie bracket]] denoted [''u,v''], [[anticommute]]s, usually does not associate, and is [[nilpotent]].
*****[[Kac-Moody algebra]]: a Lie algebra, usually infinite-dimensional, definable by [[generating set|generators]] and relations through a [[generalized Cartan matrix]].
******[[Generalized Kac-Moody algebra]]: a Kac-Moody algebra whose [[simple root]]s may be [[imaginary]].
******[[Affine Lie algebra]]: a Kac-Moody algebra whose [[generalized Cartan matrix]] is [[positive semi-definite]] and has corank 1.

==Quasivarieties==
A [[quasivariety]] is a variety with one or more axioms that are [[quasiidentity|quasiidentities]]. Let Greek letters be metavariables denoting [[identity (mathematics)|identities]]. A quasiidentity then takes the form (α<sub>1</sub>∧,...,∧α<sub>n</sub>) → β.

===Magmas===
====Cancellative ====
*[[Cancellation property|Semigroup]]: a semigroup satisfying the added axioms ''xa''=''ya''→''x''=''y'', and ''bx''=''by''→''x''=''y''.
*[[Cancellation property|Monoid]]: a [[unital algebra|unital]] cancellative semigroup.

====Combinatory logic====
The elements of ''S'' are [[higher order function]]s, and concatenation denotes the binary operation of [[function composition]].
*[[BCI algebra]]: a magma with distinguished element 0, satisfying the identities (''xy.xz'')''zy'' = 0, (''x.xy'')''y'' = 0, ''xx''=0, ''xy''=''yx''=0 → ''x''=''y'', and ''x''0 = 0 → ''x''=0. 
**[[BCK algebra]]: a BCI algebra satisfying the identity ''x''0 = ''x''. ''x''≤''y'', defined as ''xy''=0, induces a [[partial order]] with 0 as least element.
*[[SKI combinator calculus|Combinatory logic]]: A [[combinator]] [[concatenate]]s upper case letters. [[Term (mathematics)|Terms]] concatenate combinators and lower case letters. Concatenation is left and right [[cancellation property|cancellative]]. '=' is an [[equivalence relation]] over terms. The axioms are '''S'''''xyz'' = ''xz''.''yz'' and '''K'''''xy'' = ''x''; these implicitly define the primitive combinators '''S''' and '''K'''. The distinguished elements '''I''' and '''1''', defined as '''I'''='''SK'''.'''K''' and '''1'''='''S'''.'''KI''', have the provable properties '''I'''''x''=''x'' and '''1'''''xy''=''xy''. Combinatory logic has the expressive power of [[set theory]].<ref>[[Raymond Smullyan]] (1994) ''Diagonalization and Self-Reference''. Oxford Univ. Press: chpt. 18.</ref>
**[[combinatory logic|Extensional combinatory logic]]: Combinatory logic with the added quasiidentity (''Wx''=''Vx'')→(''W''=''V''), with ''W'', ''V'' containing no instance of ''x''.

===Graphs===
'''One set''', ''V'' a [[finite set]] of [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]], and a [[binary relation]] ''E''⊆''V''<sup>2</sup>, [[adjacency relation|adjacency]], consisting of [[edge (graph theory)|edges]]. No operations.
*[[Directed graph]]: ''E'' is [[irreflexive]].
**[[Directed acyclic graph]]: A directed graph with no [[path (graph theory)|path]] whose endpoints are the same element of ''V''.
**[[Graph (mathematics)|Graph]]: A directed graph such that ''E'' is [[symmetric]]. Dropping the requirement that ''E'' be [[irreflexive]] makes [[loop (graph theory)|loops]] possible.
***[[Connected graph]]: A graph such that a [[path (graph theory)|path]] connects any two vertices.
****[[Tree (graph theory)|Tree]]: a connected graph with no [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]].
****[[Cycle graph]]: a connected graph consisting of a single [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]].
****[[Complete graph]]: a connected graph such that the path between any two vertices includes no other vertex. Hence for any two vertices ''x'' and ''y'', (''x'',''y'') and (''y'',''x'') are both elements of ''E''.
*****[[Tournament (graph theory)|Tournament]]: A complete graph such that only one of (''x'',''y'') and (''y'',''x'') is an element of ''E''.

===Lattices===
*[[Semimodular lattice]]:
* [[Kleene algebra|Kleene lattice]]: a bounded distributive lattice with a unary involution, denoted by postfix ', satisfying the axioms (x∨y)' = x'∨y', x" = x, and (x∧x')∨(y∨y') = y∨y'.
*[[Semidistributive lattice]]: a lattice satisfying the axiom (''x''∧''y'' = ''x''∧''z'')→(''x''∧''y''=''x''∧(''y''∨''z'')), and dually.

===Ring-like===
* [[Kleene algebra]]: a semiring with [[idempotent]] addition and a unary operation, the [[Kleene star]], denoted by [[reverse Polish notation|postfix]] * and satisfying (1+x*x)x*=x*=(1+xx*)x*.

==Universal classes==

*Quasitrivial [[groupoid]]: a [[magma]] such that ''xy'' = ''x'' or ''y''.

*[[Integral domain]]: A commutative ring such that (''xy''=0)→((''x''=0)∨(''y''=0)). Also a [[domain (ring theory)|domain]] whose multiplication commutes. 
*Integral relation algebra: a [[relation algebra]] such that (''xy''=0)→((''x''=0)∨(''y''=0)).

===Partial order for nonlattices===
If the [[partial order]] relation ≤ is added to a structure other than a lattice, the result is a ''partially ordered'' structure. These are discussed in Birkhoff (1967: chpts. 13-15, 17) using a differing terminology. Examples include:
* Ordered [[magma (algebra)|magma]], [[semigroup]], [[monoid]], [[ordered group|group]], and [[ordered vector space|vector space]]: In each case, ''S'' is partially ordered;
* [[Linearly ordered group]] and [[ordered ring]]: ''S'' is [[linear order|linearly ordered]];
** [[Archimedean group]]: a [[linearly ordered group]] for which the [[Archimedean property]] holds.
*[[Ordered field]]: a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] whose ''S'' is [[linear order|totally ordered]] by '≤,' so that (''a''≤''b'')→(''a''+''c''≤''b''+''c'') and (0≤''a'',''b'')→ (0≤''ab'').

==Nonvarieties==
Nonvarieties cannot be [[axiom]]atized solely with [[identity (mathematics)|identities]] and [[quasiidentity|quasiidentities]]. Many nonidentities are of three very simple kinds:
#The requirement that ''S'' (or ''R'' or ''K'') be a "nontrivial" [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], namely one such that ''S''≠{0}, 0 being the additive [[identity element]]. The nearest thing to an identity implying ''S''≠{0} is the nonidentity 0≠1, which requires that the additive and multiplicative identities be distinct.
#Axioms involving multiplication, holding for all members of ''S'' (or ''R'' or ''K'') except 0. In order for an algebraic structure to be a variety, the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of each operation must be an entire underlying set; there can be no [[partial operation]]s. 
#"0 is not the [[successor function|successor]] of anything," included in nearly all arithmetics. 
Most of the classic results of [[universal algebra]] do not hold for nonvarieties. For example, neither the [[free object|free field]] over any set nor the [[direct product]] of [[integral domain]]s exists. Nevertheless, nonvarieties often retain an undoubted algebraic flavor.

There are whole classes of [[axiom]]atic [[formal system]]s not included in this section, e.g., [[logic]]s, [[topological space]]s, and this exclusion is in some sense arbitrary. Many of the nonvarieties below were included because of their intrinsic interest and importance, either by virtue of their foundational nature ([[Peano arithmetic]]), ubiquity (the [[real field]]), or richness (e.g., [[field (mathematics)|fields]], [[normed vector spaces]]). Also, a great deal of theoretical physics can be recast using the nonvarieties called [[multilinear algebra]]s. 

'''No''' operations. Functions or relations may be present:
*[[Multiset]]: ''S'' is a multiset and '''N''' is the set of [[natural number]]s. There is a [[multiset|multifunction]] ''m'': ''S''→'''N''' such that ''m''(''x'') is the [[multiplicity]] of ''x''∈''S''.

===Arithmetics===
If the name of a structure in this section includes the word "arithmetic," the structure features one or both of the [[binary operation]]s [[addition]] and [[multiplication]]. If both operations are included, the recursive identity defining multiplication usually links them. Arithmetics necessarily have [[infinite set|infinite]] [[model theory|models]].
*Cegielski arithmetic<ref>Smorynski (1991).</ref>: A commutative [[cancellative]] [[monoid]] under multiplication. 0 annihilates multiplication, and ''xy''=1 [[if and only if]] ''x'' and ''y'' are both 1. Other axioms and one axiom schema govern order, [[exponentiation]], [[divisibility]], and [[primality]]; consult Smorynski. Adding the [[successor function]] and its axioms as per Dedekind algebra render addition recursively definable, resulting in a system with the expressive power of [[Robinson arithmetic]].
In the structures below, addition and multiplication, if present, are [[recursive]]ly defined by means of an [[injective]] operation called [[successor function|successor]], denoted by [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] σ. 0 is the axiomatic [[identity element]] for addition, and annihilates multiplication. Both axioms hold for [[semiring]]s.
*Dedekind algebra<ref>Potter (2004: 90).</ref>, also called a ''Peano algebra'': A pointed unary system by virtue of 0, the unique element of ''S'' not included in the [[range (mathematics)|range]] of [[successor function|successor]]. Dedekind algebras are fragments of Skolem arithmetic.
** [[Peano axioms|Dedekind-Peano structure]]: A Dedekind algebra with an [[axiom schema]] of [[mathematical induction|induction]].
***[[Presburger arithmetic]]: A Dedekind-Peano structure with [[recursive]] [[addition]].
'''Arithmetics above this line are [[decidability (logic)|decidable]]. Those below are [[Godel's incompleteness theorem|incompletable]].'''
::*[[Robinson arithmetic]]: Presburger arithmetic with [[recursive]] [[multiplication]].
:::* [[Peano arithmetic]]: Robinson arithmetic with an [[axiom schema]] of [[mathematical induction|induction]]. The semiring axioms for '''N''' (other than ''x''+0=''x'' and ''x''0=0, included in the recursive definitions of addition and multiplication) are now theorems. 
::::*[[Heyting arithmetic]]: Peano arithmetic with [[intuitionist logic]] as the background logic.

**[[Primitive recursive arithmetic]]: A Dedekind algebra with recursively defined addition, multiplication, exponentiation, and other [[primitive recursive]] operations as desired. A rule of induction replaces the [[axiom of induction]]. The background logic lacks [[quantification]] and thus is not [[first-order logic]]. 
**[[Primitive recursion|Skolem arithmetic]] (Boolos and Jeffrey 2002: 73-76): Not an algebraic structure because there is no fixed set of operations of fixed [[Arity|adicity]]. Skolem arithmetic is a Dedekind algebra with [[projection (mathematics)|projection functions]], indexed by ''n'', whose arguments are functions and that return the ''n''th  argument of a function. The [[identity function]] is the projection function whose arguments are all unary operations. Composite operations of any [[adicity]], including addition and multiplication, may be constructed using [[function composition]] and [[primitive recursion]]. [[Mathematical induction]] becomes a theorem.
***[[László Kalmár|Kalmar]] arithmetic: Skolem arithmetic with different primitive functions.

The following arithmetics lack a connection between addition and multiplication. They are the simplest arithmetics capable of expressing all [[primitive recursive function]]s.
*Baby Arithmetic<ref>Machover, M., 1996. ''Sets, Logic, and their Limitations''. Cambridge Univ. Press: 10.9.</ref>: Because there is no [[universal quantification]], there are [[axiom schema|axiom schemes]] but no axioms. [''n''] denotes ''n'' consecutive applications of [[successor function|successor]] to 0. Addition and multiplication are defined by the schemes [''n'']+[''p''] = [''n''+''p''] and [''n''][''p''] = [''np''].  
**''R''<ref>[[Alfred Tarski]], [[Andrej Mostowski]], and [[Raphael Robinson]], 1953. ''Undecidable Theories''. North-Holland: 53.</ref>: Baby arithmetic plus the [[binary relation]]s "=" and "≤". These relations are governed by the schemes [''n'']=[''p''] ↔ ''n''=''p'', (''x''≤[''n''])→(''x''=0)∨,...,∨(''x''=[''n'']), and (''x''≤[''n''])∨([''n'']≤''x'').

===Lattices that are not varieties===
*[[mereology|Part algebra]]: a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] with no least element 0, so that the complement of 1 is not defined.
Two sets, Φ and ''D''.
*[[Information algebra]]: ''D'' is a lattice, and Φ is a commutative [[monoid]] under combination, an [[idempotent]] operation. The operation of focussing, ''f'': Φx''D''→Φ satisfies the axiom ''f''(''f''(φ,''x''),''y'')=''f''(φ,''x''∧''y'') and distributes over combination. Every element of Φ has an identity element in ''D'' under focussing.

===Field-like structures===
'''Two''' [[binary operation]]s, addition and multiplication. ''S'' is nontrivial, i.e., ''S''≠{0}. ''S''-0 is ''S'' with 0 removed.
* [[domain (ring theory)|Domain]]: a [[ring (algebra)|ring]] whose sole [[zero divisor]] is 0.
**[[Integral domain]]: a [[commutative ring]], 0 ≠ 1, and having the [[zero-product property]]: (''x''≠0∧''y''≠0) → ''xy''≠0. Hence there are no [[zero divisor]]s.
*** [[Euclidean domain]]: an [[integral domain]] with a function ''f'': ''S''→'''N''' satisfying the [[Euclidean domain|division with remainder property]].
* [[Division ring]] (also ''skew field'', ''sfield''): a [[ring (algebra)|ring]] such that ''S''-0 is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under multiplication.
** [[Field (mathematics)|Field]]: a division ring whose multiplication commutes. Recapitulating: addition and multiplication commute, associate, and are [[unital algebra|unital]]. ''S'' is closed under a two-sided [[additive inverse]], ''S''-0 under a two-sided [[multiplicative inverse]]. Multiplication has a [[zero element]] and [[distributivity|distributes]] over addition.
***[[Ordered field]]: a field whose ''S'' is [[linear order|totally ordered]] by '≤', so that (''a''≤''b'')→(''a''+''c''≤''b''+''c'') and (0≤''a'',''b'')→ (0≤''ab'').
****[[Real closed field]]: an ordered real field such that for every element ''x'' of ''S'', there exists a ''y'' such that ''x'' = ''y''<sup>2</sup> or -''y''<sup>2</sup>. All [[polynomial equation]]s of odd degree and whose coefficients are elements of ''S'', have at least one [[root of a function|root]] that in ''S''.
**** [[Real field]]: a [[Dedekind complete]] ordered field.
*****[[Differential field]]: A real field with an added [[unary operation]], [[differential algebra|derivation]], denoted by prefix ∂, distributing over [[addition]], ∂(''x''+''y'') = ∂''x''+ ∂''y'', and satisfying the [[product rule]], ∂(''xy'') = ∂''xy'' + ''x''∂''y''.
***[[Algebraically closed field]]: a field such that all [[polynomial equation]]s whose coefficients are elements of ''S'' have all [[root of a function|roots]] in ''S''.

The following field-like structures are not varieties for reasons in addition to ''S''≠{0}: 
* [[Simple ring]]: a ring having no [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] other than 0 and ''S''.
**[[Weyl algebra]]: 
* [[Artinian ring]]: a ring whose [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] satisfy the [[descending chain condition]].

===Vector spaces that are not varieties===
The following composite structures are extensions of [[vector space]]s that are not varieties. Two sets: ''M'' is a set of [[vector (geometric)|vectors]] and ''R'' is a set of [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s.

'''Three''' binary operations.
*[[Normed vector space]]: a vector space with a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], namely a function ''M''→''R'' that is [[symmetric]], [[linear]], and [[positive definite]].
**[[Inner product space]] (also ''Euclidian'' vector space): a normed vector space such that ''R'' is the [[real field]], whose norm is the square root of the [[inner product]], ''M''×''M''→''R''. Let ''i'',''j'', and ''n'' be positive integers such that 1≤''i'',''j''≤''n''. Then ''M'' has an [[orthonormal basis]] such that ''e''<sub>i</sub>•''e''<sub>j</sub> = 1 if ''i''=''j'' and 0 otherwise. See [[free module]].
**[[inner product space|Unitary space]]: Differs from inner product spaces in that ''R'' is the [[complex field]], and the inner product has a different name, the [[inner product|hermitian inner product]], with different properties: [[Conjugate (algebra)|conjugate]] symmetric, [[bilinear]], and [[positive definite]].<ref>Birkhoff and MacLane (1979: 369).</ref>
*[[Graded vector space]]: a vector space such that the members of ''M'' have a [[direct sum of vector spaces|direct sum]] decomposition. See [[graded algebra]] below.

Structures that build on the notion of vector space:
*[[Matroid]]:
*[[Antimatroid]]:

===Multilinear algebras===
'''Four''' [[binary operation]]s. Two sets, ''V'' and ''K'':
# The members of ''V'' are [[multivector]]s (including [[vector space|vectors]]), denoted by lower case Latin letters. ''V'' is an [[abelian group]] under [[multivector]] addition, and a [[monoid]] under [[outer product]]. The outer product goes under various names, and is [[tensor (intrinsic definition)|multilinear]] in principle but usually [[bilinear]]. The outer product defines the multivectors recursively starting from the vectors. Thus the members of ''V'' have a "degree" (see [[graded algebra]] below). Multivectors may have an [[inner product]] as well, denoted ''u''•''v'': ''V''×''V''→''K'', that is [[symmetric]], [[linear]], and [[positive definite]]; see [[inner product space]] above.
# The properties and notation of ''K'' are the same as those of ''R'' above, except that ''K'' may have -1 as a distinguished member. ''K'' is usually the [[real field]], as multilinear algebras are designed to describe physical phenomena without [[complex number]]s.
# The [[scalar multiplication]] of scalars and multivectors, ''V''×''K''→''V'', has the same properties as [[Module (mathematics)|module]] scalar multiplication.
*[[Symmetric algebra]]: a [[unital algebra|unital]] commutative algebra with vector multiplication.
* [[Universal enveloping algebra]]: Given a [[Lie algebra]] ''L'' over ''K'', the "most general" [[unital algebra|unital]] [[associative algebra|associative ''K''-algebra]] ''A'', such that the Lie algebra ''A<sub>L</sub>'' contains ''L''.
**[[Hopf algebra]]:
***[[Group Hopf algebra]]:
* [[Graded algebra]]: an associative algebra with [[unital algebra|unital]] outer product. The members of ''V'' have a [[directram]] decomposition resulting in their having a "degree," with vectors having degree 1. If ''u'' and ''v'' have degree ''i'' and ''j'', respectively, the outer product of ''u'' and ''v'' is of degree ''i+j''. ''V'' also has a distinguished member '''0''' for each possible degree. Hence all members of ''V'' having the same degree form an [[Abelian group]] under addition.
** [[Tensor algebra]]: A graded algebra such that ''V'' includes all finite iterations of a binary operation over ''V'', called the [[tensor product]]. All multilinear algebras can be seen as special cases of tensor algebra.
*** [[Exterior algebra]] (also ''Grassmann algebra''): a graded algebra whose [[anticommutative]] outer product, denoted by infix ∧, is called the [[exterior product]]. ''V'' has an [[orthonormal basis]]. ''v''<sub>1</sub> ∧ ''v''<sub>2</sub> ∧ ... ∧ ''v''<sub>k</sub> = 0 if and only if ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>k</sub> are [[linearly dependent]]. Multivectors also have an [[inner product]].
**** [[Clifford algebra]]: an exterior algebra with a symmetric [[bilinear form]] ''Q'': ''V''×''V''→''K''. The special case ''Q''=0 yields an exterior algebra. The exterior product is written 〈''u'',''v''〉. Usually, 〈''e''<sub>i</sub>,''e''<sub>i</sub>〉 = -1 (usually) or 1 (otherwise).
**** [[Geometric algebra]]: an exterior algebra whose exterior (called ''geometric'') product is denoted by concatenation. The geometric product of parallel multivectors commutes, that of orthogonal vectors anticommutes. The product of a scalar with a multivector commutes. ''vv'' yields a scalar.
*****[[Grassmann-Cayley algebra]]: a geometric algebra without an inner product.

===Structures with topologies or manifolds===
These algebraic structures are not varieties, because the underlying set either has a [[topology]] or is a [[manifold]], characteristics that are not algebraic in nature. This added structure must be compatible in some sense, however, with the algebraic structure. The case of when the added structure is [[partial order]] is discussed above, under varieties.

[[Topology]]:
* [[Topological group]]: a group whose ''S'' has a [[topology]];
**[[Discrete group]]: a topological group whose topology is [[discrete topology|discrete]]. Also a 0-dimensional [[Lie group]].
* [[Topological vector space]]: a [[normed vector space]] whose ''R'' has a [[topology]].
[[Manifold]]:
* [[Lie group]]: a group whose ''S'' has a smooth [[manifold]] structure.

===Categories===
Let there be two [[class (mathematics)|classes]]:
*''O'' whose elements are [[category theory|objects]], and
*''M'' whose elements are [[morphism]]s defined over ''O''.
Let ''x'' and ''y'' be any two elements of ''M''. Then there exist:
*Two [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], ''c'', ''d'' : ''M''→''O''. ''d''(''x'') is the [[domain (mathematics)#3|domain]] of ''x'', and ''c''(''x'') is its [[codomain]]. 
*A binary [[partial function|partial operation]] over ''M'', called [[function composition|composition]] and denoted by [[concatenation]]. ''xy'' is defined [[iff]] ''c''(''x'')=''d''(''y''). If ''xy'' is defined, ''d''(''xy'') = ''d''(''x'') and ''c''(''xy'') = ''c''(''y''). 
[[category theory|Category]]: [[function composition|Composition]] associates (if defined), and ''x'' has [[identity element|left]] and [[identity element|right identity]] elements, the domain and codomain of ''x'', respectively, so that ''d''(''x'')''x'' = ''x'' = ''xc''(''x''). Letting φ stand for one of ''c'' or ''d'', and γ stand for the other, then φ(γ(''x'')) = γ(''x'').
If ''O'' has but one element, the associated category is a [[monoid]].
*[[Groupoid]]: Two equivalent definitions.
**''Category theory'': A [[small category]] in which every morphism is an [[isomorphism]]. Equivalently, a category such that every element ''x'' of ''M'', ''x''(''a'',''b''), has an inverse ''x''(''b'',''a''); see diagram in section 2.2.
**''Algebraic definition'': A group whose product is a [[partial function]]. Group product associates in that if ''ab'' and ''bc'' are both defined, then ''ab.c''=''a.bc''. (''a'')''a'' and ''a''(''a'') are always defined. Also, ''ab''.(''b'') = ''a'', and (''a'').''ab'' = ''b''.

==Examples==
Recurring underlying sets: '''N'''=[[natural numbers]]; '''Z'''=[[integers]]; '''Q'''=[[rational numbers]]; '''R'''=[[real number]]s; '''C'''=[[complex number]]s.

===Arithmetics===
*'''N''' is a pointed unary system, and the standard interpretation of [[Peano arithmetic]].
* A Dedekind algebra is a [[free algebra|free S-algebra]] on zero [[generating set|generators]] of type 〈1,0〉. Freeness implies that no two terms are equal. Very general results from the theory of free algebras, e.g., definition by recursion, and uniqueness up to isomorphism, are now applicable.<ref>[[Paul Cohn|Cohn, Paul]], 1965. ''Universal Algebra'', chpt. VII.1.</ref>
*A [[Peano axioms|Dedekind-Peano structure]] is a [[free object]] with one [[generating set|generator]].
*The [[universe (mathematics)|universe]] of [[singleton]]s forms a [[Peano axioms|Dedekind-Peano structure]] if  {''x''} interprets the [[successor function|successor]] of ''x'', and the [[null set]] interprets 0.<ref>Lewis (1991).</ref>

===Group-like structures===
*Nonzero '''N''' under [[addition]] is a [[magma (algebra)|magma]].
* '''Z''' under [[subtraction]] (&minus;) is a [[quasigroup]].
* Nonzero '''Q'''  under [[division (mathematics)|division]] (÷) is a [[quasigroup]].
* '''Z''' under addition (+) is an [[abelian group]].
* Nonzero '''Q'''  under [[multiplication]] (&times;) is an [[abelian group]].
*Every [[cyclic group]] ''G'' is abelian, because if ''x'', ''y'' are in ''G'', then ''xy'' = ''a''<sup>m</sup>''a''<sup>n</sup> = ''a''<sup>m+n</sup> = ''a''<sup>n+m</sup> = ''a''<sup>n</sup>''a''<sup>m</sup> = ''yx''. In particular, '''Z''' is an abelian group under addition, as are the [[modular arithmetic|integers modulo ''n'']], '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''.
* Every group is a [[loop (mathematics)|loop]], because ''a''*''x'' = ''b'' [[if and only if]] ''x'' = ''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>*''b'', and ''y''*''a'' = ''b'' if and only if ''y'' = ''b''*''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>.
* [[matrix inversion|Invertible]] 2x2 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] form a group under [[matrix multiplication]].
*The [[permutation]]s preserving the [[partition of a set]] induced by an [[equivalence relation]] form a group under [[function composition]] and [[inverse function|inverse]].
* [[MV-algebra]]s characterize [[multi-valued logic|multi-valued]] and [[fuzzy logic]]s.

*The set of all [[function (mathematics)|functions]] ''X''→''X'', ''X'' any nonempty set, is a [[monoid]] under [[function composition]] and the [[identity function]].
*In [[category theory]], the set of all [[endomorphism]]s of [[Object (category theory)|object]] ''X'' in [[category theory|category]] ''C'' is a [[monoid]] under [[function composition|composition of morphisms]] and the [[identity morphism]].

Also see [[examples of groups]], [[list of small groups]], and [[list of finite simple groups]].

===Lattices===
* The following structures, if ordered by [[set inclusion]], all form [[modular lattice]]s. The:
**[[Subgroup]]s of a [[Group (mathematics)|group]], [[normal subgroups|normal]] or not;
**[[Subring]]s and [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]];
**[[Submodules]] of a [[module (mathematics)|module]] and the [[subspace]]s of a [[vector space]];
**[[Equivalence relation]]s on any set;
**[[Lattice (order)|Sublattices]] of any lattice including the [[empty set]].
* The [[closed set]]s of a [[topological space]] form a lattice under finite [[Union (set theory)|unions]] and [[intersection]]s. The [[open set]]s, ordered by [[inclusion]], form a lattice under arbitrary unions.
*A [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] (BA) is also an [[ortholattice]], a [[Boolean ring]], a [[commutative]] [[monoid]], and a Newman algebra. The BA '''[[two-element Boolean algebra|2]]''' is a [[laws of form|boundary algebra]]. A BA would be an [[abelian group]] if (''b'')''ba'' = ''a'' were a BA identity.
* Any [[field of sets]], and the [[connective]]s of [[first-order logic]], are models of Boolean algebra. See [[Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra]].
* The connectives of [[intuitionistic logic]] form a model of [[Heyting algebra]].
* The [[modal logic]]s [[normal modal logic|K]], [[normal modal logic|S4]], [[S5 (modal logic)|S5]], and wK4 are models of [[modal logic|modal algebra]], [[interior algebra]], [[monadic Boolean algebra]], and [[derivative algebra (abstract algebra)|derivative algebra]], respectively.
* Any [[first-order theory]] whose [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] can be written in such a way that the [[quantifier]]s do not nest more than three deep, can be recast as a model of [[relation algebra]]. Such models include [[Peano arithmetic]] and most [[axiomatic set theory|axiomatic set theories]], including [[ZFC]], [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]], and [[New Foundations]].

===Ring-like structures===
* '''N''' is a commutative [[semiring]] under addition and multiplication. 
* The set ''R''[X] of all [[polynomial]]s over some coefficient ring ''R'' is a ring.
* 2x2 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] under matrix addition and multiplication form a ring.
* If ''n'' is a positive integer, then the set '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub> = '''Z'''/n'''Z''' of integers modulo ''n'' (the additive [[cyclic group]] of order ''n'' ) forms a ring having ''n'' elements (see [[modular arithmetic]]).

===Field-like structures===
* '''Z''' is an [[integral domain]] under addition and multiplication.
* Each of '''Q''', '''R''', '''C''', and the [[p-adic number|p-adic integers]] is a [[field (algebra)|field]] under addition and multiplication.
*'''Q''' and '''R''' are [[ordered field]]s, [[linear order|totally ordered]] by '≤'.
*'''R''' is the:
**Only [[Dedekind complete]] [[ordered field]], as the axioms for such a field are [[categorical]];
**[[Real field]] grounding [[real analysis|real]] and [[functional analysis]];
**Filed whose subfields include the [[algebraic number|algebraic]], the [[computable number|computable]], and the [[definable number]]s.
*'''C''' is an [[algebraically closed field]].
*Some facts about [[finite field]]s:
**There exists a complete classification thereof.
**An [[algebraic number field]] in [[number theory]] is a [[finite field]] extension of '''Q''', that is, a field containing '''Q''' which has finite dimension as a [[vector space]] over '''Q'''.
**If ''q'' > 1 is a power of a [[prime number]], then there exists ([[up to]] [[isomorphism]]) exactly one [[finite field]] with ''q'' elements, usually denoted '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>, or in the case that ''q'' is itself prime, by '''Z'''/''q'''''Z'''. Such fields are called [[Galois field]]s, whence the alternative notation GF(''q''). All finite fields are isomorphic to some Galois field.
**Given some [[prime number]] ''p'', the set '''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub> = '''Z'''/''p'''''Z''' of integers modulo ''p'' is the [[finite field]] with ''p'' elements: '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub> = {0, 1, ..., ''p'' &minus; 1} where the operations are defined by performing the operation in '''Z''', dividing by ''p'' and taking the remainder; see [[modular arithmetic]].
