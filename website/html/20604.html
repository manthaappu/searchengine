A '''key fob''' is a generally decorative and at times useful item many people often carry with their [[Key (lock)|keys]], on a ring or a chain,  for ease of tactile identification, to provide a better grip, or to make a personal statement.  Key fobs are often called "[[key ring]]s" or "[[key chain]]s" in colloquial usage. The word ''fob'' may be linked to the low German dialect for the word ''Fuppe'', meaning "pocket", however, the real origin of the word is uncertain.   Fob pockets (meaning 'sneak proof' from the German word Foppen) were pockets meant to deter thieves and a chain was used (called a Fob Chain) to attach to items, like a pocket watch, that you would place in them. (See: http://www.alphadictionary.com/goodword/word/fob)

Fobs vary considerably in size, style and functionality.  Most commonly they are simple discs of smooth metal or plastic, typically with a message or symbol such as that of a [[logo]] (as with conference [[tchotchke]]) or a sign of an important group affiliation.  A fob may be symbolic or strictly aesthetic, but it can also be a small tool. Many fobs are small [[flashlight]]s, [[compasses]], [[calculators]], [[penknives]], [[discount card]]s, [[bottle openers]], [[security token]]s and [[USB flash drives]].  As electronic technology continues to become smaller and cheaper, miniature key-fob versions of (previously) larger devices are becoming common, such as [[digital photo frame]]s, [[remote control]] units for [[garage door opener]]s and simple [[video game]]s (e.g. [[Tamagotchi]]) or other [[gadget]]s such as [[Breathalyzer]]s.[[Image:SundryKeyFobs2154.jpg|thumb|left|width200|A [[carabiner]], [[USB flash drive]], [[keyless entry system]] and [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] membership token serving as key fobs.]]

==Access control uses==
[[Electronics|Electronic]] key fobs are used for activating such things as [[Keyless entry systems|remote keyless entry systems]] on [[motor vehicles]]. Early electric key fobs operated using [[infrared]] and required a clear [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] to function.  These could be copied using a programmable [[remote control]]. More recent models use [[challenge-response authentication]] over [[radio frequency]], so these are harder to copy and do not need line-of-sight to operate. Programming these remotes sometimes requires the automotive dealership to connect a diagnostic tool, but many of them can be self-programmed by following a sequence of steps in the vehicle and usually requires at least one working key. 

Key fobs are increasingly used in [[apartment buildings]] and [[condominium]] buildings for access to common areas (ie. lobby doors, storage areas, fitness room, pool). These usually contain a [[Radio-frequency identification|passive RFID]] tag.  The fob operates in much the same manner as a [[proximity card]] to communicate (via a reader pad) with a central server for the building, which can be programmed to allow access only to those areas in which the tenant or owner is permitted to access, or only within certain time frames.

[[Telecommuters]] may also use an electronic device known as a key fob that provides one part of a three way match to log in over an [[secure|unsecure]] [[computer network|network]] connection to a secure network.  This kind of key fob may have a keypad on which the user must enter a [[Personal identification number|PIN]] to retrieve an access code, or it could be a display-only device such as a [[virtual private network|VPN]] token that algorithmically generates security codes as part of a [[challenge-response authentication|challenge/response]] authentication system.
