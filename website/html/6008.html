'''Checkstyle'''<ref>{{cite web | url = http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/ | title = Checkstyle Home Page | year = 2010 | accessdate = 2010-11-02}}</ref> is a [[static code analysis]] tool used in [[software development]] for checking if [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[source code]] complies with [[Programming style|coding rules]].

== Advantages and limits ==

The [[programming style]] adopted by a software development project can help to comply with good programming practices which improve the code quality, readability, re-usability, and reduce the cost of development. The performed checks mainly limit themselves to the presentation and don't analyze content, and do not confirm the correctness or completeness of the program.  In practice, it can be fastidious to comply with all the style constraints, some of which could possibly harm the programming stages' dynamic; so, it may be useful to determine which level of check is needed for a certain type of program.

== Examples of available modules ==

'''Checkstyle''' defines a set of available modules, each of which provides rules checking with a configurable level of strictness (mandatory, optional...).  Each rule can raise notifications, warnings, and errors.

It permits to check for instance:
* [[Javadoc]] comments for classes, attributes and methods;
* Naming conventions of attributes and methods;
* Limit of the number of function parameters, line lengths;
* Presence of mandatory headers;
* The use of packets imports, of classes, of scope modifiers and of instructions blocks;
* The spaces between some [[Character (computing)|characters]];
* The good practices of class construction;
* [[Duplicate code|Duplicated code sections]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config_duplicates.html | title = Checkstyle Duplicate Code Check | year = 2010 | accessdate = 2010-11-02}}</ref>;
* Multiple [[Software metrics|complexity measurements]], among which expressions.

== Usage ==

'''Checkstyle''' is built in a [[JAR (file format)|JAR file]] which can run inside a [[Java VM]] or as an [[Apache Ant]] task. It can also integrate into an [[Integrated development environment|IDE]] or other tools.

A Checkstyle plug-in can provide new functionalities, like:
* overload [[syntax coloring]] or decorations in code editor;
* decorate the project explorer to highlight problem-posing resources;
* add warnings and errors outputs to the outputs.

Thus, the developer can directly access to the code parts highlighted by Checkstyle.

== History ==

'''Checkstyle''', originally developed by Oliver Burn back in 2001, is maintained by a team of several developers around the world.

The current stable release is version 5.3<ref>{{cite web | url = http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/releasenotes.html | title = Checkstyle Release Notes | year = 2010 | accessdate = 2010-11-02}}</ref> which is targeted towards the [[Java 5]] language.
