<html> <head> <title>Microsoft BizTalk Server</title></head><body>'''Microsoft BizTalk Server''', often referred to as simply "BizTalk", is an [[Enterprise_service_bus|Enterprise Service Bus]]. Through the use of "adapters" which are tailored to communicate with different software systems used in a large enterprise, it enables companies to automate business processes. Offered by [[Microsoft]], it provides the following functions: [[Enterprise Application Integration]], [[Business Process Automation]], [[Business-to-business]] Communication, [[Message broker]], and [[Business Activity Monitoring]].

In a common scenario, BizTalk enables companies to integrate and manage automated business processes by exchanging business documents such as purchase orders and invoices between disparate applications, within or across organizational boundaries. 
Human-centric processes cannot be implemented directly with BizTalk Server and need additional solutions like [[Microsoft SharePoint]] server.

Development for BizTalk Server is done through [[Microsoft Visual Studio]]. A developer can create transformation maps transforming one message type to another (for example an XML file can be transformed to SAP [[IDoc]]s, etc.). Maps are created visually using a graphical builder provided within Microsoft Visual Studio. The additional functionality can be delivered by .Net assemblies that can be called from existing modules including for instance maps or adapters. Data transformations (maps) and even processing is organised in orchestrations that provide the visual view of processing (it is a program written in a graphical language).

==Features==
The following is an incomplete list of some of the technical features in the BizTalk Server:
*The use of adapters to simplify integration to Line of Business Applications (eg.  Siebel, [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[Industrial and Financial Systems|IFS Applications]], JD Edwards, Oracle, Dynamics CRM), Databases ([[Microsoft SQL Server]], Oracle, [[IBM DB2|DB2]]) and other Technologies ([[Tibco]], [[Java EE]], etc)
*An engine for modelling Business Rules in a pseudo-English format.  This is a [[forward chaining]] [[rule engine]].
*[[Business Activity Monitoring]] (BAM), which allows a dashboard, graphical view on how the modelled Business Processes are doing.
*A unified Administration [[Dashboard]] for monitoring deployments of solutions, etc on BizTalk servers in your environment.
*Built-in EDI ([[Electronic Data Interchange]]) functionality supporting [[ASC X12|X12]] and [[EDIFACT]].(BizTalk 2006 R2)
*Accelerators which offer support for standards like [[RosettaNet]], [[HL7]], [[SWIFT]], etc.
*Ability to do graphical modelling of business processes in visual studio,  graphically mapping (with the assistance of [[functoid]]s) between different message formats, and building pipelines to decrypt, verify, parse messages as they enter the system via adapters.
*Users can automate business management processes via [[Orchestration (computers)|Orchestrations]].
*BizTalk integrates with other Microsoft products like [[Microsoft Office|Office]], [[InfoPath]] and [[SharePoint]] to allow interaction with a user participating in a workflow process.
*Extensive support for [[Webservices]] (consuming and exposing)
*[[RFID]] support as of BizTalk 2006 R2

==Architecture==

The BizTalk Server runtime is built on a [[publish/subscribe]] architecture, sometimes called "content-based publish/subscribe". Messages are published into the system, and then received by one or more active subscribers.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Runtime architecture|url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa562161.aspx|publisher=''[[Microsoft Developer Network]]''|accessdate=2008-11-30}}</ref>

BizTalk makes processing safe by serializing (called dehydration in Biztalk's terminology) messages into database while waiting for external events, thus preventing data loss. This architecture binds BizTalk with [[Microsoft SQL Server]]. Processing flow can be tracked by administrators using a graphical UI.

==Adapters==

BizTalk uses adapters for communications with different protocols, and specific software products such as [[SharePoint]]. Some of the adapters that were included in Server 2006 product included the Base [[Electronic_Data_Interchange|EDI]] (Covast), File, [[HTTP]], [[FTP]], [[SMTP]], [[POP3]], [[SOAP]], [[SQL]], [[MSMQT]], [[Web Services Enhancements]] (WSE) 2.0, and the [[Windows SharePoint Services]] (WSS) adapters. [[Windows Communication Foundation|WCF]] adapter was added with 2006 R2. Microsoft also ships [[BizTalk Adapter Pack]] that includes WCF based adapters for Line of Business systems. Currently, this includes adapters for [[SAP ERP|SAP]], [[Oracle Database|Oracle]] database, [[Oracle E-Business Suite]], [[SQL]], and [[Siebel]].
