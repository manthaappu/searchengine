<html> <head> <title>R-SMLT</title></head><body>'''Routed-SMLT (R-SMLT)''' is a computer networking [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] designed by Nortel (now acquired by [[Avaya]]) as an enhancement to [[SMLT]] enabling the exchange of Layer 3 information between peer nodes in a Switch Cluster for unparalleled resiliency and simplicity for both L3 and L2.

In many cases, core network convergence-times after a failure is dependent on the length of time a routing protocol requires to successfully converge (change or re-route traffic around the fault). Depending on the specific routing protocol, this convergence time can cause network interruptions ranging from seconds to minutes.  The [[Avaya]] R-SMLT feature works with [[SMLT]], and [[DSMLT]] technologies to provide sub-second failover (normally less than 100 millisecond<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tolly.com/ts/2007/Nortel/ERSswitches/Tolly207171NortelERSwitchSMLT.pdf | title=Evaluation of Resilient Routing Switches for Real-Time Multimedia Traffic with Microsoft Live Communications Server 2005 and Nortel MCS 5100 | publisher=The Tolly Group}}</ref> so no outage is noticed by end users. This high speed recovery is required by many critical networks where outages can cause loss of life or very large monetary losses in critical networks.

RSMLT routing topologies providing an active-active router concept to core [[SMLT]] networks. The protocol supports networks designed with [[SMLT]] or [[DSMLT]] triangles, squares, and [[SMLT]] or [[DSMLT]] full mesh topologies, with routing enabled on the core VLANs.  R-SMLT takes care of packet forwarding in core router failures and works with any of the following protocol types: IP Unicast Static Routes, RIP1, RIP2, OSPF, BGP and IPX RIP.
