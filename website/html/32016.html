Four of the most common rhetorical modes and their purpose are [[Expository writing|exposition]], [[argumentation]], [[description]], and [[narrative|narration]].

==Exposition==

The purpose of [[Exposition (literary technique)| exposition]] (or expository writing) is to explain and analyze information by presenting an idea, relevant evidence, and appropriate discussion.  Examples include:
*[[Business letter]]s
*[[How-to|How-to essays, such as recipes and other instructions]]
*[[Article (publishing)|News stories]]
*[[Personal letter]]s
*[[News release|Press releases]]
*[[Research report|Reports]]
*[[Scientific report]]s
*[[Term paper]]s
*[[Textbook]]s
*[[Will (law)|Wills]]
*[[Encyclopedia|Encyclopedia articles]]

==Argumentation==
The purpose of argumentation (also called ''[[persuasive writing]]'') is to prove the validity of an idea, or point of view, by presenting sound reasoning, discussion, and argument that thoroughly convince the reader. Persuasive writing is a type of argumentation with the additional aim to urge the reader to take some form of action.  Examples include:
*[[Copywriting|Advertising Copy]] 
*[[review|Critical review]]
*[[Editorial]]s
*[[Job evaluation]]
*[[Job application]] letter
*[[Letter of recommendation]]
*[[Letter to the editor|Letters to the editor]]
*[[Résumé]]s

==Description==
The  purpose of description is to re-create, invent, or visually present a person, place, event, or action so that the reader can picture that which is being described. Descriptive writing can be found in the other rhetorical modes.  Examples include:
*[[Personal journal|Journal writing]]
*[[Poetry]]

==Narration==
The purpose of narration is to tell a story or narrate an event or series of events. This writing mode frequently uses the tools of descriptive writing. Narration is an especially useful tool for sequencing or putting details and information into some kind of logical order, usually chronological. Working with narration helps us see clear sequences separate from all other mental functions.  Examples include:
*[[Anecdote]]s
*[[Autobiography]]
*[[Biography]]
*[[Novel]]s
*[[Oral history]]
*[[Short story]]

===Fiction-writing modes===
Each [[fiction-writing mode]] has its own purposes and conventions.  Agent and author Evan Marshall identifies five fiction-writing modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background {{Harvard citation | Marshall | 1988 | pp = 143–165}}.  Author and writing-instructor [[Jessica Page Morrell]] lists six delivery modes for fiction-writing: action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition {{Harvard citation | Morrell | 2006 | p = 127}}.  Author [[Peter Selgin]] refers to ''methods'', including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, and description {{Harvard citation | Selgin | 2007 | p = 38}}.  Currently, there is no consensus within the writing community regarding the number and composition of fiction-writing modes and their uses.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.helium.com/items/197336-fiction-writing-modes-and-how-to-use-them | title = Fiction-writing modes and how to use them  | last = Klaassen | first = M | accessdate = 2009-04-30 | publisher = [[Helium.com]] }}</ref>
