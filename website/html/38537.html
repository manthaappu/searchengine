'''U-Prove''' is an [[identity management]] framework originally developed by [[Credentica]], which was later acquired by [[Microsoft]].<ref>[http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2010/03/microsoft-open-sources-clever-u-prove-identity-framework.ars Microsoft open-sources clever U-Prove identity framework]</ref> It aims to offer greater [[privacy]] compared to existing public-key identity management frameworks, and allows for implementation within [[smart card]]s.

In March 2010, Microsoft announced the release of a cryptographic specification and [[open source]] API implementation code for part of the U-Prove technologies as a [[Community Technology Preview]] under Microsoft's [[Open Specification Promise]].<ref>[http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2010/03/03/microsoft-releases-preview-of-uprove.aspx RSA Conference: Microsoft Releases Preview of U-Prove]</ref>
