'''Resourcesat-2''' is a follow on mission to Resourcesat-1, by [[ISRO]]. Compared to Resourcesat-1, LISS-4 multispectral swath has been enhanced from 23 km to 70 km based on user needs. Suitable changes including miniaturization in payload electronics have been incorporated in Resourcesat-2. Resourcesat-2 is slated for launch in February 2011.

==Current status==
As of 2008, the engineering model structure after refurbishment has been delivered for assembly, integration and test. Flight model development activities have started.<ref>http://www.isro.org/rep2009/citizens.htm</ref>
