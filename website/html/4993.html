<html> <head> <title>CDS ISIS</title></head><body>'''CDS/ISIS''' is a [[software]] package for generalised ''Information Storage and Retrieval systems'' developed, maintained and disseminated by [[UNESCO]]. It was first released in 1985 and since then over 20,000 [[license|licences]] have been issued by UNESCO and a worldwide network of distributors. It is particularly suited to bibliographical applications and is used for the [[library catalog|catalogues]] of many small and medium-sized [[library|libraries]]. Versions have been produced in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish amongst other languages. UNESCO makes the software available free for non-commercial purposes, though distributors are allowed to charge for their expenses.

CDS/ISIS is an acronym which stands for Computerised Documentation Service / Integrated Set of Information Systems. In 2003 it was stated that "This package is accepted by libraries in the developing countries as a standard software for information system development". <ref> National Science Foundation of Sri Lanka. "CDS ISIS Library Software" [Last Update 10th January 2003.] http://www.nsf.ac.lk/slstic/isis.htm  Accessed June 20, 2007.</ref>

The original CDS/ISIS ran on an [[IBM]] [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] and was designed in the mid 1970s under Mr Giampaolo Del Bigio for UNESCO's Computerized Documentation System (CDS). It was based on the internal ISIS (Integrated Set of Information Systems) at the [[International Labour Organization]] in Geneva.

In 1985 a version was produced for mini- and microcomputers programmed in Pascal. It ran on an [[IBM PC]] under [[MS-DOS]]<ref>Buxton, Andrew and Hopkinson, Alan. ''The CDS/ISIS handbook''. London: Library Association, 1994</ref>
. ''Winisis'', the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version,  first demonstrated in 1995, may run on a single [[computer]] or in a [[local area network]]. The ''JavaISIS'' client/server components allow remote [[database management system|database management]] over the [[Internet]] and are available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]]. Furthermore, ''GenISIS'' allows the user to produce [[HTML]] Web forms for CDS/ISIS database searching. The ''ISIS_DLL'' provides an [[API]] for developing CDS/ISIS based applications. [[OpenIsis]] library provides another [[API]] for developing CDS/ISIS based applications with some improvements.
