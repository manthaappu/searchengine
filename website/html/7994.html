'''Continuous modelling''' is the [[mathematical]] practice of applying a [[mathematical model|model]] to [[continuous function|continuous]] data (data which has a potentially infinite number, and divisibility, of attributes). They often use [[differential equation]]s and are converse to [[discrete modelling]].

Modelling is generally broken down into several steps:

* Making assumptions about the data: The modeller decides what is influencing the data and what can be safely ignored.
* Making equations to fit the assumptions.
* Solving the equations.
* Verifying the results: Various statistical tests are applied to the data and the model and compared.
* If the model passes the verification progress it is put into practice.
