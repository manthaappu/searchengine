}}The '''DNA Data Bank of Japan''' (DDBJ) is a DNA data bank.<ref name="pmid11752245">{{cite journal| author=Tateno Y, Imanishi T, Miyazaki S, Fukami-Kobayashi K, Saitou N, Sugawara H et al.| title=DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) for genome scale research in life science. | journal=Nucleic Acids Res | year= 2002 | volume= 30 | issue= 1 | pages= 27â€“30 | pmid=11752245 | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=clinical.uthscsa.edu/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=11752245 | pmc=PMC99140 }} </ref> It is located at the [[National Institute of Genetics]] (NIG) in the [[Shizuoka prefecture]] of Japan. It is also a member of the [[International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration]] or [[INSDC]]. It exchanges its data with [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] at the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]] and with [[GenBank]] at the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] on a daily basis. Thus these three databanks contents the same data at any given time. <br />

DDBJ began data bank activities since 1986 at NIG and it boasts to be the only nucleotide sequence data bank in Asia. Although DDBJ mainly receives its data from Japanese researchers, however it can accept data from a contributor belonging to any other country. DDBJ is primarily funded by the Japanese [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT). DDBJ has an international advisory committee which consists of nine members, 3 members each from Europe, US, and Japan. This committee advices DDBJ about its maintenance, management and future plans once a year. Apart from this DDBJ also has an international collaborative committee which advises on various technical issues related to international collaboration and consists of working-level participants.
