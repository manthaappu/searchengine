In the [[Mathematics|mathematical]] subject of [[group theory]], the '''rank of a group''' ''G'', denoted rank(''G''), can refer to the smallest [[cardinality]] of a [[Generating set of a group|generating]] set for ''G'', that is

:<math> \operatorname{rank}(G)=\min\{ |X|: X\subseteq G, \langle X\rangle =G\}.</math>

If ''G'' is a [[finitely generated group]], then the rank of ''G'' is a nonnegative integer. The notion of rank of a group is a group-theoretic analog of the notion of [[dimension of a vector space]]. Indeed, for [[p-group|''p''-groups]], the rank of the group ''P'' is the dimension of the vector space ''P''/Φ(''P''), where Φ(''P'') is the [[Frattini subgroup]].

The rank of a group is also often defined in such a way as to ensure subgroups have rank less than or equal to the whole group, which is automatically the case for dimensions of vector spaces, but not for groups such as [[affine group]]s.  To distinguish these different definitions, one sometimes calls this rank the '''subgroup rank'''.  Explicitly, the subgroup rank of a group ''G'' is the maximum of the ranks of its subgroups:

:<math> \operatorname{sr}(G)=\max_{H \leq G} \min\{ |X|: X \subseteq H, \langle X \rangle = H \}.</math>

Sometimes the subgroup rank is restricted to abelian subgroups.

==Known facts and examples==
*For a nontrivial group ''G'', we have rank(''G'')=1 if and only if ''G'' is a [[cyclic group]].
*For a [[free abelian group]] <math>\mathbb Z^n</math> we have <math> {\rm rank}(\mathbb Z^n)=n.</math>
*If ''X'' is a set and ''G'' = ''F''(''X'') is the [[free group]] with free basis ''X'' then rank(''G'') = |''X''|.
*If a group ''H'' is a [[group homomorphism|homomorphic image]] (or a [[quotient group]]) of a group ''G'' then rank(''H'') ≤ rank(''G'').
*If ''G'' is a finite non-abelian [[simple group]] (e.g. ''G = A<sub>n</sub>'', the [[alternating group]], for ''n'' > 4) then rank(''G'') = 2. This fact is a consequence of the [[Classification of finite simple groups]].
*If ''G'' is a finitely generated group and Φ(''G'') ≤ ''G'' is the [[Frattini subgroup]] of ''G'' (which is always normal in ''G'' so that the quotient group ''G''/Φ(''G'') is defined) then rank(''G'') = rank(''G''/Φ(''G'')).<ref name="Robinson">D.

*If ''G'' is the [[fundamental group]] of a closed (that is [[compact space|compact]] and without boundary) connected [[3-manifold]] ''M'' then rank(''G'')≤''g''(''M''), where ''g''(''M'') is the [[Heegaard genus]] of ''M''.<ref>Friedhelm Waldhausen.

*If ''H'',''K'' ≤ ''F''(''X'') are [[finitely generated group|finitely generated]] subgroups of a [[free group]] ''F''(''X'') such that the intersection <math>L=H\cap K</math> is nontrivial, then ''L'' is finitely generated and
:rank(''L'') &minus; 1 ≤ 2(rank(''K'') &minus; 1)(rank(''H'') &minus; 1).

*According to the classic [[Grushko theorem]], rank behaves additively with respect to taking [[free product]]s, that is, for any groups ''A'' and ''B'' we have
:rank(''A''<math>\ast</math>''B'') = rank(''A'') + rank(''B'').

==The rank problem==
There is an algorithmic problem studied in [[group theory]], known as the '''rank problem'''. The problem asks, for a particular class of [[finitely presented group]]s if there exists an algorithm that, given a finite presentation of a group from the class, computes the rank of that group. The rank problem is one of the harder algorithmic problems studied in group theory and relatively little is known about it. Known results include:

*The rank problem is algorithmically undecidable for the class of all [[finitely presented group]]s. Indeed, by a classical result of Adian-Rabin, there is no algorithm to decide if a finitely presented group is trivial, so even the question of whether rank(''G'')=0 is undecidable for finitely presented groups.<ref>W. W. Boone.

*The rank problem is decidable for finite groups and for finitely generated [[abelian group]]s.
*The rank problem is decidable for finitely generated [[nilpotent group]]s. The reason is that for such a group ''G'', the [[Frattini subgroup]] of ''G'' contains the [[commutator subgroup]] of ''G'' and hence the rank of ''G'' is equal to the rank of the [[abelianization]] of ''G''. <ref>John Lennox, and Derek J.

*The rank problem is open for finitely generated virtually abelian groups (that is containing an abelian subgroup of finite [[index of a subgroup|index]]), for virtually free groups, and for [[3-manifold]] groups.

==Generalizations and related notions==
The rank of a [[finitely generated group]] ''G'' can be equivalently defined as the smallest cardinality of a set ''X'' such that there exists an onto [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] ''F''(''X'') → ''G'', where ''F''(''X'') is the [[free group]] with free basis ''X''. There is a dual notion of '''co-rank''' of a [[finitely generated group]] ''G'' defined as the ''largest'' [[cardinality]] of ''X'' such that there exists an onto [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] ''G'' → ''F''(''X''). Unlike rank, co-rank is always algorithmically computable for [[finitely presented group]]s<ref>John R. Stallings.
