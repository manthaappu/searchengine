'''Knowledge Plaza''', also referred to as '''KP''', is an [[Enterprise 2.0]] and [[Knowledge_management|knowledge management tool]] which provides a balance between social bookmarking, document management, wikis and an internal social network. It was initially designed as an information management tool for [[knowledge worker]]s and is often used for collaborative research projects, [[market intelligence]], information brokerage, etc.

The vendor's company, [http://www.whatever-company.com Whatever S.A.], is based in [[Louvain-la-Neuve|Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park]] (Belgium), has offices in Paris (France) and partners in Italy, Spain, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

Knowledge Plaza is used as the reference tool for the "Social KM" part of the [[Enterprise Social Software]] landscape in USEO's analysis of the market. <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.slideshare.net/adebuche/useo-etude-rse-tome2-v1-100126 |title= Useo Etude Rse Tome2 V1 |publisher= Useo |accessdate= 2010-01-26 }}</ref> Their analysis concludes that Knowledge Plaza strikes a balance between a traditional [[Document management system]] and more community-orientated environments such as [[Jive SBS]].

== Features ==

Knowledge Plaza appears to be the first [[Enterprise bookmarking]] tool that applies such a collective classification mechanism to all information formats: not only websites (like [[Delicious (website)|Delicious]]), but also documents, contacts, e-mails, book references and wikis – as underlined by the [[Comparison_of_enterprise_bookmarking_platforms|comparison of enterprise bookmarking platforms]].

Feature set: <ref>http://www.knowledgeplaza.net/tour</ref>
* Combined full-text [[social search]] and [[faceted navigation]]
* Bookmarklet for adding/sharing/organizing websites
* Pipelines for adding/sharing/organizing emails and their attachments
* Workspaces and communities for various security/visibility settings
* Collaborative content creation (wiki pages)
* Full export and summary of information packages
* Custom e-mail digests and alerts
* Custom vertical search engines based on shared bookmarks
* [[Tag management]] abilities that mix a company-defined [[taxonomy]] and user-generated [[folksonomy]]. KP's approach was described by [[Thomas Vander Wal]] as "working wonderfully". <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.personalinfocloud.com/2009/01/optimizing-tagging-ui-for-people-search.html |title= Optimize tagging UI for people search |publisher= Thomas Vander Wal |accessdate= 2009-01-24 }}</ref>
