'''Gaston H. Gonnet''' is a [[Uruguay]]an [[computer scientist]] and entrepreneur.  He is best known for his contributions to the [[Maple computer algebra system]] and the creation of an electronic version of the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].

== Education and professional life ==
Gonnet received his doctorate in computer science from the [[University of Waterloo]] in 1977.  His thesis was entitled ''Interpolation and Interpolation Hash Searching''.  His advisor was [[J. Alan George]].

In 1980 Gonnet co-founded the Symbolic Computation Group at the University of Waterloo.  The work of SCG on a general-purpose [[computer algebra system]] later formed the core of the [[Maple (software)|Maple]] system.  In 1988, Gonnet co-founded (with [[Keith Geddes]]) the private company [[Waterloo Maple]] Inc., to sell Maple commercially.  In the mid 90's the company ran into trouble and a disagreement between his colleagues caused him to withdraw from managerial involvement. 

In 1984 Gonnet co-founded the New Oxford English Dictionary project at UW, which sought to create a searchable electronic version of the OED. This project later culminated in another successful commercial venture, the [[Open Text Corporation]].

Gonnet is presently a professor at [[ETH Zurich]] in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]].
