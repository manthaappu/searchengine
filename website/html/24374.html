The '''microSPARC''' (code-named "Tsunami") is a [[microprocessor]] implementing the [[SPARC|SPARC V8]] [[instruction set architecture]] (ISA) developed by [[Sun Microsystems]]. It was a low-end microprocessor intended for low-end [[workstation]]s and [[embedded system]]s. The microprocessor was developed by Sun, but the [[floating-point unit]] (FPU) was licensed from [[Meiko Scientific]]. It contained 800,000 transistors.

There were two derivatives of the microSPARC: the microSPARC-II and microSPARC-IIep. The microSPARC-IIep was a 100 MHz microSPARC-II with an integrated [[Conventional PCI|PCI]] controller for [[embedded system]]s. It was developed and fabricated by [[LSI Logic]] for Sun. The microprocessor was used by Sun in their [[JavaStation]] [[Network Computer]].
