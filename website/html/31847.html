<html> <head> <title>Report Definition Language</title></head><body>'''Report Definition Language (RDL) ''' is a standard proposed by [[Microsoft]] for defining reports. 

RDL is an [[XML]] application primarily used with Microsoft [[SQL Server Reporting Services]]. RDL is usually written using [[Visual Studio]], although there are also third-party tools; it may also be created or edited by hand in a text editor. [[SQL Server Reporting Services]] or other 3rd party reporting frameworks use RDL to define charts, graphs, calculations, text, images (through links) and other report objects and render them in a variety of formats.

There are three high-level sections in a typical RDL file:
* Page style - The objects to display including fields, images, graphs, tables.
* Field definitions - The extended attributes of fields which are populated with formulas, dynamic data, or Database derived data.
* Parameters and Database connections - Parameters that may be furnished by the user or passed in from another application; and database connections and queries for pulling data into the report.
