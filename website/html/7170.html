<html> <head> <title>Comparison of VMware Fusion and Parallels Desktop</title></head><body>{{POV|date=November 2009}}

Represented by their respective products, [[VMware]] and [[Parallels, Inc.|Parallels]] are the two major commercial competitors in the [[Macintosh|Mac]] consumer [[Platform virtualization|virtualization]] market. Both products are based on [[hypervisor]] technology and allow users to run an additional 32- or 64-bit [[x86]] [[operating system]] in a [[virtual machine]] alongside [[Mac OS X]] on an [[Intel]]-powered Mac.  The similarity in features and functionality between '''[[VMware Fusion]]''' and '''[[Parallels Desktop for Mac]]''' has given occasion for much comparison.

==2007 Benchmark tests==
On August 16, 2007, [[CNET]] published the results of several benchmarks<ref name=cnet_benchmarks>{{cite web |last=Begun |first=Daniel |title=Inside CNET Labs: Windows virtual machine performance on the Mac |url=http://crave.cnet.com/8301-1_105-9760910-1.html |publisher=CNET |date=2007-08-17 |accessdate=2007-10-04}}</ref> in which Fusion demonstrated better performance than Parallels Desktop for Mac in SMP-aware applications, which Fusion supports while Parallels does not.  It should also be noted that Boot Camp is a tool for natively booting Windows XP on Intel Macintosh and is not a virtualization product. This comparison is of limited value today, as both products have had 2 major upgrades since then.

[[Image:Fusion chart01.png]] [[Image:Fusion chart02.png]]

This comparison was tested on an eight-core, 2.66 GHz MacPro running [[Mac OS X v10.4|Mac OS X 10.4.10]], Parallels Desktop 3.0 for Mac (build 4560) and VMware Fusion 1.0 (build 51348). Fusion and Parallels were both set to 1,024 MB of system memory and a 32 GB hard disk.  Fusion was set to 128 MB of graphics memory, and Parallels Desktop for Mac was set to 64 MB of graphics memory (the maximum for each at that time)<ref name=cnet_benchmarks/>.

==2008 Benchmark tests==
In Volume 24, Issue 02 of [[MacTech]], the editors published the results of one-step and task tests between VMware Fusion 1.0, Parallels Desktop 3.0 and Boot Camp and used a PC running Windows XP as a baseline comparison in a native PC environment.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ticktin |first=Neil |title=Virtualization Benchmarking How do Boot Camp, Parallels Desktop, and VMware Fusion stack up? |accessdate=February 2008 |url=http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.24/24.02/VirtualizationBenchmark/ |publisher=MacTech}}</ref>
*One-step Test: After clicking the mouse or pressing a key, this test requires no further human action.
* Task Test: This tests the interaction between Mac OS X and the virtual environment and requires multiple tests throughout the process.

MacTech found that the faster the physical host computer, the more similarly Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion performed. MacTech did not test multiple processor performance. The following graphs displays the results in seconds.  Shorter bars indicate faster performance.

[[Image:Mactech---cross-platform.pngâ€Ž]] [[Image:mactech---network---file-io.png]]

Each test was run on a [[MacBook]] (2 GB RAM; 1.83 GHz Core Duo processor), a [[MacBook Pro]] (4GB RAM; 2.16 GHz Core 2 Duo processor) and a [[Mac Pro]] (4GB RAM; Quad Core configuration with two 2.66 GHz Dual-Core Intel Xeon processors).  MacTech tested Parallels Desktop 3.0 for Mac Build 5160 and VMware Fusion 1.0 Build 51348.
All tests were done on clean host systems with new installations of Mac OS X 10.4.10 and Office installations and included all of the most up-to-date patches.  No third party software was installed other than Mac OS X, VMware Fusion, Parallels Desktop, [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]], [[Adobe Acrobat|Adobe Reader]] and [[Microsoft Office]].

==2009 Benchmark tests==
In March, 2009, Volume 25, Issue 04, [[MacTech]] <ref>{{cite web |last=Ticktin |first=Neil |title= Head-to-Head: Parallels Desktop for Mac vs. VMware Fusion |accessdate=March 2009 |url=http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.25/25.04/VMBenchmarks/|publisher=MacTech}}</ref> published the results of a new series of [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] tests that compared the performance between VMware Fusion 2.0.1 and Parallels Desktop 4.0 for Mac (build 3540), both running [[Mac OS X]] 10.5.5.

In most of MacTechâ€™s tests, Parallels Desktop performed 14-20% faster than Fusion; however, Fusion ran 10% faster than Parallels Desktop when running Windows XP 32-bit on 2 virtual processors.<ref>http://www.mactech.com:16080/articles/mactech/Vol.25/25.04/VMBenchmarks/index-001.html</ref>

|-

|}
The tests were performed on the White [[MacBook]], [[MacBook Pro]], [[iMac]] and [[MacPro]].  Both Fusion and Parallels Desktop were optimized for virtual machine performance.  MacTechâ€™s test included launch and [[CPU]] tests, File and Network IO, Footprint, Application Launch, Application Performance and 3D and HD Graphics.  In many cases, tests were performed after both Adam and Successful launches and were timed using a stopwatch.

|}

'''<sup>1</sup>''' 3D Games tested were [[Civilization IV]]: Colonization and [[Portal (video game)|Portal]].  In Civilization, Parallels Desktop has faster [[Frame rate|FPS]] (Frames Per Second) and performed better on slower machines while Fusion has better, more detailed graphics.  Fusion has difficulty showing the startup video, but Parallels Desktop's graphics are not as rich.  When running Portal, Fusion is faster but its graphics are visibly lighter, while Parallels Desktop has better graphics and visual details.<ref>http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.25/25.04/VMBenchmarks/index-003.html</ref>

===Cross-platform task tests===
MacTechâ€™s cross platform tests timed how long it took users to perform multi-step tasks that moved data between Mac OS X and Windows.  VMware Fusion, which is designed for increased isolation from the host, requires more manual steps to move data between the host and the virtual environment.  Parallels Desktop, which is designed to run transparently with the Mac OS X host, requires fewer steps to perform the same tasks.  Therefore, Parallels Desktop was faster.

===Networking and file I/O tests===
Parallels Desktop occasionally displayed lag anomalies while VMware Fusion's virtual drive performance was very close to that of a physical drive.  VMware Fusion preferred a bridged connection for reliable performance, and Parallels Desktop was consistent regardless of the type of virtual network adaptor used.
===Simultaneous use of VM and host OS===
Parallel Desktop 5 always uses wired memory for hosted OS, while VMWare Fusion 3.0 uses active memory that can be swapped. Giving better performance to hosted VM, this leaves less memory to host OS programs and causes more swapping if you use VM and host OS programs at the same time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}{{Clarify|date=May 2010}}

==2010 Benchmark tests==
In 2010 [[MacTech]]<ref>{{cite web |last=Ticktin |first=Neil |title= Head-to-Head: Parallels Desktop for Mac vs. VMware Fusion |accessdate=March 2010 |url=http://www.mactech.com/articles/special/1002-VirtualizationHeadToHead/index-001.html|publisher=MacTech}}</ref>, Volume 26, Issue 01, published the results of a new series of [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] tests showing a performance advantage for Parallels Desktop 5 across all subcategories, with an average of 30% faster.
