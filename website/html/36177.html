<html> <head> <title>Super robot chogokin</title></head><body>{{nihongo|'''Super Robot Chogokin'''|スーパーロボット超合金|Sūpā Robotto Chōgōkin}}, is Bandai's new line-up diverse from the popular Soul of Chogokin franchise. Despite under the Soul of Chogokin family, the major difference is the size, only scaling around 140mm (14 cm). Aside from the size, the other main selling point for the line-up is the flexible articulation of the robots, and added weapons set(s) (sold separately) to revoke some of the effects, memorable moves, and attacks seen in each of the robots respective series. The line-up is going to be mainly focused on Super Robot series as well as [[Super Sentai]] series as well. Just like the Soul of Chogokin the robots are in die-cast and plastic. Extra accessories such as bases and laboratory (such as Mazinger Z's lab) are also in the works. Super Robot Chogokin is also targeted to a mature demographic, but the prices are a lot cheaper compared to the Soul of Chogokin line-up.
