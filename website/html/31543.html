<html> <head> <title>Recursive set</title></head><body>In [[computability theory]], a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[natural number]]s is called '''recursive''', '''computable''' or '''decidable''' if there is an [[algorithm]] which terminates after a finite amount of time and correctly decides whether or not a given number belongs to the set.

A more general class of sets consists of the [[recursively enumerable set]]s, also called '''semidecidable''' sets.  For these sets, it is only required that there is an algorithm that correctly decides when a number ''is'' in the set; the algorithm may give no answer (but not the wrong answer) for numbers not in the set.

A set which is not computable is called '''noncomputable''' or '''undecidable'''.

==Formal definition==

A subset {{math|<var>S</var>}} of the [[natural number]]s is called '''recursive''' if there exists a [[total function|total]] [[computable function]] {{math|''f'' }} such that 
{{math|''f''(<var>x</var>) {{=}} 1 }} if {{math|<var>x</var> &isin; <var>S</var> }} and {{math|''f''(<var>x</var>) {{=}} 0 }} if {{math|<var>x</var> &notin; <var>S</var> }}.  In other words, the set {{math|<var>S</var>}} is recursive [[if and only if]] the [[indicator function]] {{math|1<sub><var>S</var></sub>}} is [[computable function|computable]].

==Examples==

*Every finite or [[cofinite]] subset of the natural numbers is computable. This includes these special cases:
**The [[empty set]] is computable.
**The entire set of natural numbers is computable.
**Each natural number ([[Set-theoretic_definition_of_natural_numbers#The_contemporary_standard|as defined in standard set theory]]) is computable; that is, the set of natural numbers less than a given natural number is computable.
*The set of [[prime number]]s is computable.
*A [[recursive language]] is a recursive subset of a [[formal language]].
*The set of Gödel numbers of arithmetic proofs described in Kurt Gödel's paper "On formally undecidable propositions of Principia Mathematica and related systems I"; see [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]].

==Properties==

If ''A'' is a recursive set then the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of ''A'' is a recursive set. If ''A'' and ''B'' are recursive sets then ''A'' ∩ ''B'', ''A'' ∪ ''B'' and the image of ''A'' &times; ''B'' under the [[Cantor pairing function]] are recursive sets.

A set ''A'' is a recursive set [[if and only if]] ''A'' and the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of ''A'' are both [[recursively enumerable set]]s. The [[preimage]] of a recursive set under a [[total function|total]] [[computable function]] is a recursive set. The image of a computable set under a total computable [[bijection]] is computable.

A set is recursive if and only if it is at level {{math| &Delta;{{su|p=0|b=1}} }} of the [[arithmetical hierarchy]].

A set is recursive if and only if it is either the range of a nondecreasing total computable function or the empty set. The image of a computable set under a nondecreasing total computable function is computable.
