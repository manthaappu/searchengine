In [[circuit theory]], a '''super-node''' is a theoretical construct that can be used to solve a circuit.  This is done by viewing a [[voltage]] source on a wire as a point source voltage in relation to other point voltages located at various nodes in the circuit, relative to a [[ground (electricity)|ground]] node assigned a zero or negative charge.

Each super-node contains two nodes, one a non-reference node and another node that may be a second non-reference node or the reference node. Super-nodes containing the reference node have one node voltage variable. For Nodal circuit analysis, the super-node construct is only required between two non-reference nodes.
