'''TFI-5''' is a standardized [[TDM Fabric to Framer Interface]] by the [[Optical Internetworking Forum|OIF]] that allow framer and switch components from multiple vendors to inter-operate facilitating the development of  add/drop multiplexers, TDM cross connect and grooming switches.  the standard includes link integrity monitoring, connection management and mapping mechanisms for both SONET/SDH and non-SONET/SDH clients such as [[Ethernet]] and [[Fibre Channel]].<ref name=light>[http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=41290 OIF Approves TFI-5 Interface], retrieved 2007</ref>

The main application of TFI-5 is for [[Time-division multiplexing]] (TDM).  this contrast with other  OFI standards such SPI-5 which target packet/cell applications.<ref name=light/>

OFI level 5 standards that covered interfaces of 40 Gbit/s.<ref name=light/>
