<html> <head> <title>PDB (Palm OS)</title></head><body>'''Definition 1''': '''PDB''' is a container format for record [[database]]s in [[Palm OS]], [[Garnet OS]] and [[Access Linux Platform]]. Its structure is similar to [[PRC (Palm OS)|PRC]] resource databases<ref name = "rhodes">N. Rhodes, J. McKeehan. Palm OS Programming, Second Edition, O'Reilly, 2001, ISBN 1-56592-856-3</ref>. The PalmDOC [[eBook]] format is a special version of the PDB format<ref>MobileRead Wiki: [http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/PalmDOC Specification of the PalmDOC format]</ref>.
'''Definition 2''': '''PDB''' is the abbreviation of protein 3D structure database "[[Protein Data bank]]". It also refer to the file format of record of the data base.

== Structure of PDB file ==
A PDB file contains a PDB header, PDB record headers and [[Record (computer science)|records]]<ref name = "hotpaw">Paul J.

=== PDB Header ===
The PDB header is located at the beginning of the file and contains meta-information on the file <ref name = "hotpaw"/>:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Offset
! Name
! Type
! Size
|-
| 0x00
| name
| char
| 32 Bytes
|-
| 0x20
| file attributes
| integer
| 2 Bytes
|-
| 0x22
| version
| integer
| 2 Bytes
|-
| 0x24
| creation time
| Macintosh time
| 4 Bytes
|-
| 0x28
| modification time
| Macintosh time
| 4 Bytes
|-
| 0x2c
| backup time
| Macintosh time
| 4 Bytes
|-
| 0x30
| modification number
| integer
| 4 Bytes
|-
| 0x34
| app_info
| integer
| 4 Bytes
|-
| 0x38
| sort_info
| integer
| 4 Bytes
|-
| 0x3c
| type
| integer
| 4 Bytes
|-
| 0x40
| creator
| integer
| 4 Bytes
|-
| 0x44
| unique_id_seed
| integer
| 4 Bytes
|-
| 0x48
| next_record_list
| integer
| 4 Bytes
|-
| 0x4c
| num_records
| integer
| 2 Bytes
|}

=== PDB Record Header ===
For every record, there is an eight byte record header, containing<ref name = "hotpaw"/>:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! name
! type
! size
! notes
|-
| offset
| integer
| 4 bytes
| Byte number in the PDB file (counting from zero), where the record is located
|-
| attributes
| byte
| 1 byte
| Attributes of the record (delete/dirty/busy/secret/category)
|-
| UniqueID
| integer
| 3 bytes
| Always 0
|}

=== PDB Records ===
Now the records themselves follow. The usual order is AppInfoArea, SortInfoArea and records, sequentially<ref name = "microfirst"/>.
