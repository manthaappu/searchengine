'''Treasure hunting''' is the search for real [[treasure]] which has been a notable human activity for [[millennia]]. <!-- It would be good to give an example from history, but I can't off the top of my head think of one; the looting of the tombs in the Valley of the Kings doesn't quite count. -->

==In modern times==

In recent times, the early stages of the development of [[archaeology]] included a significant aspect of treasure hunt; [[Heinrich Schliemann]]'s excavations at [[Troy]], and later at [[Mycenae]], both turned up significant finds of [[gold]]en artifacts. Early work in [[Egyptology]] also included a similar motive.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

More recently, most serious treasure hunters have started working underwater,{{Fact|date=October 2008}} where modern technology allows access to wrecks containing valuables which were previously inaccessible. Starting with the [[Standard diving dress|diving suit]], and moving on through [[Scuba diving|Scuba]] and later to [[Remotely operated vehicle#Submersible ROVs|ROVs]], each new generation of technology has made more wrecks accessible. Many of these wrecks have resulted in the [[treasure salvage]] of many fascinating artifacts from Spanish treasure fleets as well as many others.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}
