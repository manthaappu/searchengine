==Background==
Parker was born in [[Norfolk, Virginia]],<ref name="NPI">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1676649/|title=Nate Parker|accessdate=2008-11-07|publisher=IMDb.com, Inc.|work=[[IMDb.com]]}}</ref> to Carolyn, a 17 year-old mother at the time.<ref name="FHRtH"/>  His mother never married his biological father, but did wed the man who gave Parker his last name.  Parker has four younger sisters.<ref name="NPMT">{{cite web|url=http://www.movietome.com/people/284622/nate-parker/trivia.html|title=Nate Parker|accessdate=2008-11-07|publisher=CNET Networks, Inc.|worl=MovieTome}}</ref> During Parker's time in middle school, Carolyn fell in love with Walter Whitfield, who was stationed in [[Bath, Maine]] in the [[United States Air Force]].  Although his mother married Whitfield and moved to Maine, Parker, despite the physical distance after the move, remained close to his biological father emotionally.  His father died when Parker was eleven, however.  Parker became involved in classroom fights and home power struggles with his stepfather, Whitfield.  Parker moved to [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]] to stay with his maternal uncle Jay Combs, a former wrestler, at age 14.  Nate's great-grandmother got sick and his mother moved back to [[Hampton Roads, Virginia]] and lived in the [[Churchland High School]] zone, where Nate joined her.<ref name="FHRtH">{{cite web|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2007/12/hampton-roads-hollywood|title=From Hampton Roads to Hollywood|accessdate=2008-11-08|date=2007-12-23|publisher=HamptonRoads.com|work=[[The Virginian-Pilot]] online|author=Tucker, Kyle}}</ref>

As a sophomore at [[Pennsylvania State University]] in 1999, he and a teammate were accused of having had [[non-consensual sex]] with a woman who had passed out, but when she admitted during the trial to having had [[consensual sex]] with Parker the day before the alleged rape, Parker was acquitted in 2001.<ref name="FHRtH" />  Parker married [[Erie, Pennsylvania]]-native Sarah DiSanto, whom he met while they were attending Penn State, in Erie's Frontier Park during the summer of 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goerie.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?Date=20071124&Category=NEWS02&ArtNo=711240381&SectionCat=SHOWCASE&Template=printart|title=Actor with Erie ties to appear on 'Oprah'|accessdate=2008-11-08|date=2007-11-24|publisher=goerie.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://registry.weddingchannel.com/coupledir/20077/D/O567511676/SARAH_DISANTO_AND_NATE_PARKER.htm|title=SARAH DISANTO and NATE PARKER Wedding|accessdate=2008-11-08|publisher=WeddingChannel.com|work=Wedding Couples Directory}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  He is a University of Oklahoma alumnus.<ref name="NPNHiB">{{cite web|url=http://www.essence.com/news_entertainment/entertainment/articles/nateparkernewcomerhitsitbig|title=Nate Parker: Newcomer Hits it Big|accessdate=2008-11-07|date=2007|publisher=Essence Communications Inc.|work=[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]|author=Robertson, Regina R.}}</ref>

After Parker denied both, he asked Parker to read a [[monologue]] from ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and The Furious]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/dec/24/entertainment/et-nate24|title=No argument, his goal is to be a star|accessdate=2008-11-08|date=2007-12-24|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Welkos, Robert W.}}</ref>   He then asked Parker to videotape himself doing lines from ''[[Antwone Fisher]]'' and Parker delivered a video within a week.

He quickly landed a part in a [[Television advertisement|television commercial]].  Bit parts and guest appearances followed.
