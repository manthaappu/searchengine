The set of deterministic context-free languages are a proper subset of the set of [[context-free language]]s that possess an unambiguous [[context free grammar]].  For example, the language of even-length [[palindrome]]s on the alphabet of 0 and 1 has the simple, unambiguous grammar S → 0S0 | 1S1 | ε, but it cannot be [[parser|parsed]] by a deterministic push down automaton.<ref>{{cite book | last = [[John Hopcroft|Hopcroft]] | first = John | coauthors = [[Rajeev Motwani]] & [[Jeffrey Ullman]] | title = [[Introduction to automata theory, languages, and computation]] 2nd edition | year = 2001 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | pages = 249–253 }}</ref>

The languages of this class have practical importance in computer science.  The complexity of the program and execution of a deterministic pushdown automaton is vastly less than that of a nondeterministic one. In the naive implementation, it must make copies of the stack every time a nondeterministic step occurs. The best known algorithm to test membership in any context-free language is [[CYK_algorithm#Extensions|Valiant's algorithm]], taking O(''n''<sup>2.378</sup>) time, whereas membership in a deterministic context-free language can be tested in O(''n'') time,<ref>{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=Michael A.|title=Introduction to Formal Language Theory|year=1978|publisher=Addison-Wesley|page=135}}</ref> where n is the length of the string.

In an early result of [[computational complexity theory]], [[Stephen Cook]] showed in 1979 that deterministic context-free languages can be recognized by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in polynomial time and [[Big-O notation|O]](log<sup>2</sup> ''n'') space; as a corollary, '''DCFL''' is a subset of the complexity class '''[[SC (complexity)|SC]]'''.<ref>S.
