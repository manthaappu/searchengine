Through his work with CSC's Strike Force,<ref>{{ cite web | title = First Hand Interview with Johnny Long | url = http://assets1.csc.com/cscworld/downloads/CSCWORLD_0908_JohnnyLong.pdf | publisher = CSC | format = [[PDF]]}}</ref> Johnny was an early pioneer in the field of Google hacking.<ref>{{ cite web | title = Google hacking | url = http://www.networkworld.com/news/2005/090505-google-hacking.html | publisher = [[Network World]]}}</ref> Through specially crafted search queries it was possible to locate servers on the Internet running vulnerable software. It was equally possible to locate servers that held no security and were openly sharing personal identifiable information such as [[Social Security number]]s and [[credit card]] numbers. These efforts grew into the creation of the [http://johnny.ihackstuff.com/ghdb/ Google Hacking Database], through which hundreds of Google hacking search terms are stored. The field of Google hacking has evolved over time to not just using Google to passively search for vulnerable servers, but to actually use Google search queries to attack servers.

== Hackers for Charity ==

In his latest endeavor, Johnny has created the [http://www.hackersforcharity.org/ Hackers for Charity] non-profit organization.<ref>{{ cite web | title = Interview: SANS Pen Test Summit Part 2 - Johnny Long | url = http://www.ethicalhacker.net/content/view/193/24/ | publisher = EthicalHacker.net }}</ref> Known by its byline, "I Hack Charities", the organization collects computer and office equipment to donate to underdeveloped countries. The movement was realized after a viewing of ''[[Invisible Children]]'', a documentary movie that showcases many brutalities committed in northern [[Uganda]] that have remained invisible to the global media. Along with coordinating the donation of goods and supplies, Johnny traveled to areas of Africa to personally setup computer networks and help build village infrastructures.

== Personal life ==

Long is known to publicly pronounce his faith in [[Christianity]]. He begins and ends each of his presentations with information regarding humanitarian efforts for Invisible Children Inc. and regularly donates proceeds from his books to help such efforts.
