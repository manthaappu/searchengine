'''Ivar Hjalmar Jacobson''' (born 1939) is a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[computer scientist]], known as major contributor to UML, Objectory, RUP and aspect-oriented software development.

== Biography ==
Ivar Jacobson was born in [[Ystad]], [[Sweden]] on 2 September 1939. He got his [[Masters degree|Master]] of [[Electrical Engineering]] degree at [[Chalmers University of Technology|Chalmers Institute of Technology]] in [[Gothenburg]] in 1962 and a [[Ph.D.]] at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]] in 1985 on a thesis on Language Constructs for Large Real Time Systems.

After university Jacobson started working at Ericsson until April 1987, when he started Objective Systems. A majority stake of the company was acquired by Ericsson in 1991, and the company was renamed [[Objectory AB]]. Jacobson developed the software process OOSE at Objectory circa 1992.

In October 1995 Ericsson divested Objectory to [[Rational Software]]<ref>[http://www.dbmsmag.com/9610d11.html DBMS Interview - October 1996]</ref> and Jacobson started working with [[Grady Booch]] and [[James Rumbaugh]], known collectively as the Three Amigos. 

Rational was bought by [[IBM]] in 2003 and Jacobson decided to quit, but he stayed on until May 2004 as an executive technical consultant.

In mid 2003 Jacobson formed Ivar Jacobson International (IJI) which is an umbrella company for Ivar Jacobson Consulting (IJC)<ref>[http://www.ivarjacobson.com Ivar Jacobson Consulting (IJC)]</ref> which operates across 4 continents with offices in the UK, US (West and East Coast), Europe, Scandinavia, China, Korea, Singapore and Australia.

== Work ==
=== Ericsson ===
In 1967 at Ericsson Jacobson proposed the use of [[software component]]s in the new generation of [[software]] controlled [[telephone switch]]es [[Ericsson]] was developing. In doing this he invented [[sequence diagram]]s, and developed collaboration diagrams. He also used state transition diagrams to describe the message flows between components.

Jacobson saw a need for ''blueprints'' for software development. He was one of the original developers of the [[Specification and Design Language]] (SDL). In 1967, SDL became a standard in the [[telecoms industry]]. 

At Ericsson he also invented [[use case]]s as a way to specify functional software requirements.

=== Rational Software ===
At Rational, Jacobson and his friends, [[Grady Booch]] and [[James Rumbaugh]], first designed the [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]], later developing the [[Rational Unified Process]].

=== Essential Unified Process ===
In November 2005, Jacobson announced the [[Essential Unified Process]] or “EssUP” for short. EssUP is a new “Practice” centric software development process that stands on the shoulders of modern but established software development best practice. It is a fresh new start, integrating successful practices sourced from the three leading process camps: the unified process camp, the [[agile software development]] camp and the [[process improvement]] camp. Each one of them contributes different capabilities: structure, agility and process improvement. 

Ivar has  described EssUP as a "super light and agile" RUP, and IJI have integrated EssUP into [[Microsoft]] [[Visual Studio Team System]] and [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]].

=== SEMAT ===
In November 2009, Jacobson, [[Bertrand Meyer]] and [[Richard Soley]] ("the Troika") started an initiative called [[SEMAT]] (Software Engineering Method and Theory) to seek to develop a rigorous, theoretically sound basis for software engineering practice, and its wide adoption by industry and academia.
