''Prestressing'' means the intentional creation of permanent stresses in a structure for the purpose of improving its performance under various service conditions<ref name=PrestressedConcreteDesign>{{cite book|title= Design of Prestressed Concrete|author=Nilson, Arthur H.|date=1987|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=0471830720}}</ref>.[[Image:Roman Colosseum With Moon.jpg|thumb|1,600 x 1,200 px|right|Naturally precompressed exterior wall of [[Colosseum]], Rome]] 

There are the following basic types of prestressing:
*Precompression (mostly, with the own weight of a structure)   
*[[Prestressed concrete|Pretensioning]] with high-strength embedded tendons 
*[[Prestressed concrete|Post-tensioning]] with high-strength bonded or unbonded tendons

The idea of ''prestressing'' was, apparently, familiar to the ancient Rome architects; the tall attic wall of the [[Colosseum]] works as a [[press]] for the wall piers beneath. 

Tensional prestress appears to be a common property of biological structures, such as cells and the musculoskeletal system, as a natural (law-based) solution that provides form, mechanical stability, and emergence and flow of stimuli/information. [[Tensegrity]] is a possible biological architecture in which pretension is a key property.
