<html> <head> <title>Siri Personal Assistant</title></head><body>'''Siri''' is a [[personal assistant]] application for the [[iPhone OS]]. The application uses [[natural language processing]] to answer questions, make recommendations, and perform actions by delegating requests to an expanding set of [[web services]]. The iPhone app is the first public product by its makers, who are focused on [[artificial intelligence]] applications. 

Siri's marketing claims include that Siri adapts to the user's individual preferences over time and personalizes results, as well as accomplishing tasks such as making dinner reservations and reserving a cab. <ref>[http://www.siri.com/about/ Siri homepage]</ref>

Siri was founded in December 2007 by Dag Kittlaus (CEO), Adam Cheyer (VP Engineering), and Tom Gruber (CTO/VP Design), together with Norman Winarsky from SRI's venture group.  On October 13, 2008, Siri announced it had raised an $8.5 million Series A financing round, led by [[Menlo Ventures]] and [[Morgenthaler Ventures]]. <ref>[http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/semantic_stealth_startup_siric.php Semantic Stealth Startup Siri Raises $8.5 Million]</ref> In November 2009, Siri raised a $15.5 million Series B financing round from the same investors as in their previous round, but led by Hong-Kong billionaire [[Li Ka-shing]] <ref>[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/05/a-personal-assistant-on-your-iphone/ A Personal Assistant on Your iPhone]</ref>
