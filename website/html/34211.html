{{IPA notice}}
A '''shibboleth''' ({{pron-en|ˈʃɪbəlɛθ}}<ref name=OED>{{cite encyclopedia|ency=Oxford English Dictionary|edition=second|year=1989|article=shibboleth}}</ref> or {{IPA-en|ˈʃɪbələθ|}}<ref name=Merriam-Webster>{{cite web|work=[[Merriam-Webster]] Online Dictionary |title=shibboleth |url=http://m-w.com/dictionary/shibboleth}}</ref>) is any distinguishing practice that is indicative of one's social or regional origin.
It usually refers to features of language, and particularly to a word whose pronunciation identifies its speaker as being a member or not a member of a particular group.

==Origin==

The term originates from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word "shibbóleth" ({{lang|he|שִׁבֹּלֶת}}), which literally means the part of a plant containing grains, such as an [[Ear (botany)|ear of corn]] or a stalk of [[grain]]<ref>[[Gerhard Wahrig|Wahrig Deutsches Wörterbuch]], Sixth Edition and {{cite web|work=Meyers Lexikon online |title=Schibboleth |url=http://lexikon.meyers.de/meyers/Schibboleth}}</ref> or, in different contexts, "stream, torrent".<ref>{{cite web|work=[[American Heritage Dictionary]], also sometimes rye, Fourth Edition |title=shibboleth |url=http://www.tfd.com/shibboleth}} {{cite web|work=[[Merriam-Webster]] Online Dictionary |title=shibboleth |url=http://m-w.com/dictionary/shibboleth}} (this latter meaning is not in use in [[Modern Hebrew]])</ref><ref>Cf. Isaiah 27:12.</ref> It derives from an account in the [[Hebrew Bible]], in which pronunciation of this word was used to distinguish [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraimites]], whose [[dialect]] lacked a {{IPA|/ʃ/}} sound (as in '''''[[voiceless postalveolar fricative|sh]]'''oe''), from [[Gilead]]ites whose dialect did include such a sound. 

In the [[Book of Judges]], chapter 12, after the inhabitants of [[Gilead]] inflicted a military defeat upon the tribe of [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]] (around [[1370 BC|1370]]&ndash;[[1070 BC]]), the surviving Ephraimites tried to cross the Jordan River back into their home territory and the Gileadites secured the river's fords to stop them.  In order to identify and kill these refugees, the Gileadites put each refugee to a simple test:

{{cquote|Gilead then cut Ephraim off from the fords of the Jordan, and whenever Ephraimite fugitives said, 'Let me cross,' the men of Gilead would ask, 'Are you an Ephraimite?' If he said, 'No,' they then said, 'Very well, say "Shibboleth" (שיבולת).' If anyone said, "Sibboleth" (סיבולת), because he could not pronounce it, then they would seize him and kill him by the fords of the Jordan. Forty-two thousand Ephraimites fell on this occasion.|20px||[[Book of Judges|Judges]] 12:5-6, [[New Jerusalem Bible|NJB]]}}

==Modern usage==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}

In numerous cases of conflict between groups speaking different languages or dialects, one side used shibboleths in a way similar to the above-mentioned Biblical use, i.e., to discover hiding members of the opposing group. Modern researchers use the term "Shibboleth" for all such usages, whether or not the people involved were using it themselves.  

Today, in the English language, a shibboleth also has a wider meaning, referring to any "in-crowd" word or phrase that can be used to distinguish members of a group from outsiders - even when not used by a hostile other group. The word is also sometimes used in a broader sense to mean [[jargon]], the proper use of which identifies speakers as members of a particular group or subculture. 

Paul Krugman in his New York Times Blog http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/06/bernanke-and-the-shibboleths/#more-14227 on November 6, 2010, 11:42 am run an article titled 
"Bernanke And The '''Shibboleths'''" in which he refers to shibboleths as follows:
"[...] But what we’re seeing worldwide right now is an inability to think clearly about economics. In particular, the unconventional nature of our situation is making it clear how many people rely not on any model of how the economy works but rather on what the late Paul Samuelson called '''shibboleths''' — by which he meant slogans that take the place of hard thinking. [...]"

Shibboleths can also be customs or practices, such as [[male circumcision]], or a signifier, such as a [[semiotic]].

Cultural [[touchstone]]s and shared experience can also be shibboleths of a sort. For example, people about the same age who are from the same nation tend to have [[Collective memory|the same memories]] of popular songs, television shows, and events from their formative years. [[One-hit wonder]]s prove particularly effective. Much the same is true of alumni of a particular school, veterans of military service, and other groups. Discussing such memories is a common way of [[Human bonding|bonding]]. [[In-jokes]] can be a similar type of shared-experience shibboleth.

Yet another more pejorative usage involves underlining the fact that the original meaning of a symbol has in effect been lost and that the symbol now serves merely to identify allegiance, being described as nothing more than a "shibboleth."

==Notable shibboleths==

{{Main|List of shibboleths}}

Shibboleths have been used by different subcultures throughout the world at different times.  Regional differences, level of expertise and computer coding techniques are several forms that shibboleths have taken.  For example, during the [[Battle of the Bulge]], American soldiers used knowledge of [[baseball]] to determine if others were fellow Americans or if they were German [[spy|infiltrators]] in American uniform.  The Dutch famously used the name of the port town [[Scheveningen]] as a shibboleth to tell Germans from the Dutch (the Dutch pronounce the ''S'' separately from the ''ch'').

During World War II, some United States soldiers in the Pacific theater used the word "[[Wiktionary:lollapalooza|lollapalooza]]" as a shibboleth to verbally test people who were hiding and unidentified, on the premise that Japanese people often pronounce the letter [[Engrish|L as R]], and that the word is an American colloquialism  that even a foreign person fairly well-versed in American English would probably mispronounce and/or be unfamiliar with.<ref>US Army & Navy, 1942. [http://www.ep.tc/howtospotajap/howto06.html HOW TO SPOT A JAP Educational Comic Strip], (from US govt's POCKET GUIDE TO CHINA, 1st edition). Retrieved 10-10-2007</ref> In George Stimpson's ''A Book about a Thousand Things,'' the author notes that, in the war, Japanese spies would often approach checkpoints posing as American or [[Filipino people|Filipino]] military personnel. A shibboleth such as "lollapalooza" would be used by the sentry, who, if the first two syllables come back as ''rorra,'' would "open fire without waiting to hear the remainder".<ref>{{cite book|year=1946|title=A Book about a Thousand Things|author=Stimpson, George W.|publisher=Harper & Brothers|pages=51}}</ref>

Prior to the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs|Guldensporenslag]], the Flemish [[Bruges Matins (history)|slaughtered]] every Frenchman they could find in the city of Bruges. They are said to have identified Frenchmen based on their inability to pronounce the Dutch phrase "Schild ende Vriend" ("Shield and Friend"), or possibly "'s Gilden vriend" ("Friend of the Guilds").

''Bûter, brea, en griene tsiis; wa't dat net sizze kin, is gjin oprjochte Fries'' ({{audio|Schibbolet-fries.ogg|example}}) means "Butter, rye bread and green cheese, who cannot say that is not a genuine Frisian" was used by the [[Frisians|Frisian]] [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]] during a [[Frisian rebellion]] ([[1515]]-[[1523]]). Ships whose crew could not pronounce this properly were usually plundered and soldiers who could not were beheaded by Donia himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wunseradiel.nl/index.php?simaction=content&pagid=289&mediumid=1|publisher=Gemeente Wûnseradiel|title=Greate Pier fan Wûnseradiel|language=West Frisian|accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref>
