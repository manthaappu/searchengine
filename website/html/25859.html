<html> <head> <title>National LIDAR Dataset</title></head><body>A '''National LIDAR Dataset''' refers to a high-resolution [[LIDAR]] dataset comprising most – and ideally all - of a nation’s terrain. Datasets of this type typically meet specified quality standards and are publicly available for free (or at nominal cost) in one or more uniform formats from government or academic sources. National LiDAR datasets are used primarily in [[LIDAR Contour Mapping]], and also for forestry, urban and rural planning, recreational, environmental, engineering, and geological studies and planning, among others.

Countries with '''National LIDAR Dataset'''s either completed or in progress include, in alphabetical order:
