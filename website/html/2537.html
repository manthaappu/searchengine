The '''Assessment''' [[Open Service Interface Definition]] ('''OSID''')  is an [[O.K.I.]] [[specification]] which supports creating, organizing, administrating, evaluating, storing and retrieving [[assessment]]{{dn}} information. '''OSIDs''' are programmatic interfaces which comprise a [[Service Oriented Architecture]] for designing and building [[software reusability|reusable]] and [[interoperable]] [[software]].

Assessments are organized into ''Sections'' and each Section contains one or more ''Items''.   Each Assessment, Section, or Item taken by an [[Agent Open Service Interface Definition|Agent]] can also include an ''Evaluation''.

There may be relationships between this '''OSID''' and other '''OSIDs'''. For example, an implementation might manage an Assessment's content and questions using the [[Repository Open Service Interface Definition|Repository OSID]]. An Assessment may include optional references to the [[CourseManagement Open Service Interface Definition|Course Management]] and [[Grading Open Service Interface Definition|Grading]] OSIDs.
