The '''American Revolution''' was the political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century in which [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen colonies]] in [[North America]] joined together to break free from the [[British Empire]], combining to become the [[United States|United States of America]]. They first rejected the authority of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] to govern them from overseas without representation, and then expelled all royal officials. By 1774 each colony had established a [[Provincial Congress]], or an equivalent governmental institution, to form individual self-governing [[State (polity)|states]]. The British responded by sending combat troops to re-impose direct rule. Through representatives sent in 1775 to the [[Second Continental Congress]], the new states joined together at first to defend their respective [[self-governance]] and manage the armed conflict against the British known as the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–83, also ''American War of Independence''). Ultimately, the states collectively determined that the British monarchy, by acts of [[tyrant|tyranny]], could no longer [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimately]] claim their [[allegiance]]. They then severed ties with the British Empire in July 1776, when the Congress issued the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], rejecting the monarchy on behalf of the new [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] nation. The war ended with effective American victory in October 1781, followed by formal British abandonment of any claims to the United States with the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783.

The American Revolution was the result of a series of social, political, and intellectual transformations in early American society and government, collectively referred to as the ''[[American Enlightenment]]''. Americans rejected the [[Oligarchy|oligarchies]] common in [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] Europe at the time, championing instead the development of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] based on the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] understanding of [[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]]. Among the significant results of the revolution was the creation of a democratically-elected representative government [[Consent of the governed|responsible to the will of the people]]. However, sharp political debates erupted over the appropriate level of [[democracy]] desirable in the new government, with a number of [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founders]] fearing [[Ochlocracy|mob rule]].

Many fundamental issues of national governance were settled with the ratification of the [[United States Constitution]] in 1788, which replaced the relatively weaker first attempt at a national government adopted in 1781, the ''[[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]]''. In contrast to the loose [[confederation]], the Constitution established a strong [[Federation|federated]] government. The [[United States Bill of Rights]] (1791), comprising the first 10 constitutional amendments, quickly followed. It guaranteed many "[[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]]" that were influential in justifying the revolution, and attempted to balance a strong national government with relatively broad [[Liberty|personal liberties]]. The American shift to liberal republicanism, and the gradually increasing democracy, caused an upheaval of traditional social hierarchy and gave birth to the ethic that has formed a core of political values in the United States.<ref name="Wood, 1992">Wood, ''The Radicalism of the American Revolution'' (1992)</ref><ref>Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 70</ref>

==Origins==
[[File:British colonies 1763-76 shepherd1923.jpg|thumb|alt=Before the revolution: the thirteen colonies are in pink|Before the Revolution: The [[Thirteen Colonies]] are in pink]]
The American Revolution was predicated by a number of ideas and events that, combined, led to a political and social separation of colonial possessions from the home nation and a coalescing of those former individual colonies into an independent nation.

===Summary===
The American revolutionary era began in 1763, after a series of victories by British forces at the conclusion of the [[French and Indian War]] ended the French military threat to British North American colonies. Adopting the policy that the colonies should pay an increased proportion of the costs associated with keeping them in the Empire, Britain imposed a [[Stamp Act 1765|series of direct taxes]] followed by [[Intolerable Acts|other laws]] intended to demonstrate British authority, all of which proved extremely unpopular in America. Because [[No taxation without representation|the colonies lacked elected representation]] in the governing British Parliament, [[Sons of Liberty|many colonists]] considered the laws to be illegitimate and a violation of their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]]. In 1772, groups of colonists began to create ''[[Committee of correspondence|Committees of Correspondence]]'', which would lead to their own Provincial Congresses in most of the colonies. In the course of two years, the Provincial Congresses or their equivalents rejected the Parliament and effectively replaced the British ruling apparatus in the former colonies, culminating in 1774 with the coordinating [[First Continental Congress]].<ref>Brinkley, ''The Sparck of Rebellion'' (2010)</ref> In response to protests in [[Boston]] over Parliament's attempts to assert authority, the British sent combat troops, [[Dissolution (law)|dissolved]] local governments, and imposed direct rule by Royal officials. Consequently, the Colonies mobilized their [[Militia (United States)|militias]], and fighting broke out in 1775. First ostensibly loyal to [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], the repeated [[Olive Branch Petition|pleas]] by the First Continental Congress for royal intervention on their behalf with Parliament resulted in the [[Proclamation of Rebellion|declaration by the King]] that the states were "in rebellion", and the members of Congress were [[Treason|traitors]]. In 1776, representatives from each of the original thirteen states voted unanimously in the Second Continental Congress to adopt a Declaration of Independence, which now rejected the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarchy]] in addition to its Parliament. The Declaration established the United States, which was originally governed as a loose confederation through a [[representative democracy]] selected by state legislatures (see ''[[Second Continental Congress]]'' and ''[[Congress of the Confederation]]'').

====Ideology behind the Revolution====

The ideological movement known as the American Enlightenment was a critical precursor to the American Revolution. Chief among the ideas of the American Enlightenment were the concepts of liberalism, democracy, republicanism, and [[Freedom of religion in the United States|religious tolerance]]. Collectively, the belief in these concepts by a growing number of American colonists began to foster an intellectual environment which would lead to a new sense of political and social identity.

[[John Locke]]'s (1632–1704) ideas on liberty greatly influenced the political thinking behind the revolution. John Locke's [[Two Treatises of Government]], published in 1689, influenced the thinking of later philosophers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712–1778), as reflected in Rousseau's 1762 treatise entitled ''[[The Social Contract|Du contrat social]]''. The theory of the "[[social contract]]" influenced the belief among many of the Founders that among the "natural rights" of man was the [[Right of revolution|right of the people to overthrow their leaders]], should those leaders betray the historic [[rights of Englishmen]].<ref>Wraight, ''Rousseau's The Social Contract'' (2008)</ref><ref name=Toth1989>Charles W. Toth, ''Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite: The American Revolution and the European Response.'' (1989) p. 26.</ref><ref name=Cohen2008>page 101, Philosophical Tales, by Martin Cohen, (Blackwell 2008)</ref> In terms of writing state and national constitutions, the Americans used [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]]'s analysis of the "balanced" British Constitution.

A motivating force behind the revolution was the American embrace of a political ideology called "republicanism", which was dominant in the colonies by 1775. The republicanism was inspired by the "[[Whig (British political party)|country party]]" in Britain, whose critique of British government emphasized that [[political corruption|corruption]] was a terrible reality in Britain.<ref>name= Weintraub2005>Stanley Weintraub, ''Iron Tears: America's Battle for Freedom, Britain's Quagmire, 1775-1783'' (2005) chapter 1</ref> Americans feared the corruption was crossing the Atlantic; the commitment of most Americans to republican values and to their rights, energized the revolution, as Britain was increasingly seen as hopelessly corrupt and hostile to American interests. Britain seemed to threaten the established liberties that Americans enjoyed.<ref>Bailyn, '' The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution'' (1992) pp. 125-37</ref> The greatest threat to liberty was depicted as corruption—not just in [[London]] but at home as well. The colonists associated it with luxury and, especially, inherited aristocracy, which they condemned.<ref>Wood, ''The Radicalism of the American Revolution'' (1992) pp. 35, 174-5</ref>

The Founding Fathers were strong advocates of republican values, particularly [[Samuel Adams]], [[Patrick Henry]], [[George Washington]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[John Adams]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]],<ref>Shalhope, ''Toward a Republican Synthesis'' (1972) pp.49-80</ref> which required men to put civic duty ahead of their personal desires. Men had a civic duty to be prepared and willing to fight for the rights and liberties of their countrymen and countrywomen. John Adams, writing to [[Mercy Otis Warren]] in 1776, agreed with some [[Classical antiquity|classical]] Greek and Roman thinkers in that "Public Virtue cannot exist without private, and public Virtue is the only Foundation of Republics." He continued: <blockquote>
"There must be a positive Passion for the public good, the public Interest, Honour, Power, and Glory, established in the Minds of the People, or there can be no Republican Government, nor any real Liberty. And this public Passion must be Superior to all private Passions. Men must be ready, they must pride themselves, and be happy to sacrifice their private Pleasures, Passions, and Interests, nay their private Friendships and dearest connections, when they Stand in Competition with the Rights of society."<ref name=Rahe1994>Adams quoted in Paul A. Rahe, ''Republics Ancient and Modern: Classical Republicanism and the American Revolution. Volume: 2'' (1994) P. 23.</ref>
</blockquote> For women, "[[republican motherhood]]" became the ideal, exemplified by [[Abigail Adams]] and [[Mercy Otis Warren]]; the first duty of the republican woman was to instill republican values in her children and to avoid luxury and ostentation.

Thomas Paine's best-seller pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' appeared in January 1776, after the Revolution had started. It was widely distributed and loaned, and often read aloud in taverns, contributing significantly to spreading the ideas of republicanism and liberalism, bolstering enthusiasm for separation from Britain, and encouraging recruitment for the Continental Army. Paine provided a new and widely accepted argument for independence, by advocating a complete break with history. ''Common Sense'' is oriented to the future in a way that compels the reader to make an immediate choice. It offered a solution for Americans disgusted and alarmed at the threat of tyranny.<ref>Ferguson, ''The Commonalities of Common Sense'' (2000) pp. 465–504</ref>

[[Dissenter|Dissenting]] (i.e. Protestant, non-[[Church of England]]) churches of the day were the "school of democracy”<ref name=Bonomi>Bonomi, p. 186, Chapter 7 “Religion and the American Revolution</ref> President [[John Witherspoon]] of the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]) wrote widely circulated sermons linking the American Revolution to the teachings of the Hebrew Bible. Throughout the colonies dissenting Protestant congregations ([[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], [[Baptists|Baptist]], and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]) preached Revolutionary themes in their sermons, while most Church of England ministers preached loyalty to the King.<ref name=Nelson1961>William H. Nelson, ''The American Tory'' (1961) p. 186</ref> Religious motivation for fighting tyranny reached across socioeconomic lines to encompass rich and poor, men and women, frontiersmen and townsmen, farmers and merchants.<ref name=Bonomi/>

The classical authors read in the Enlightenment period taught an abstract ideal of republican government that included hierarchical social orders of king, aristocracy and commoners. It was widely believed that British liberties relied on the balance of power between these three social orders, maintaining the hierarchical deference to the privileged class.<ref>Bailyn,''The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution'' (1992) pp. 273-4, 299–300</ref> Historian [[Bernard Bailyn]] wrote that: {{quote|"Puritanism … and the epidemic evangelism of the mid-eighteenth century, had created challenges to the traditional notions of social stratification” by preaching that the Bible taught all men are equal, that the true value of a man lies in his moral behavior, not his class, and that all can be saved.".<ref>Bailyn,''The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution'' (1992) p. 303</ref>}}

===Controversial British legislation===
The Revolution was in some ways incited by a number of pieces of legislation originating from the British Parliament that, for Americans, were illegitimate acts of a government that had no right to pass laws on Englishmen in the Americas who did not have elected representation in that government. For the British, policy makers saw these laws as necessary to rein in colonial subjects who, in the name of economic development that was designed to benefit the home nation, had been allowed near-autonomy for too long.

{{See|Parson's Cause}}

The British Empire at the time operated under the [[Mercantilism|mercantile system]], where all trade was concentrated inside the Empire, and trade with other empires was usually illegal. That is,  American merchants were not allowed to trade with the French, Dutch or Spanish empires. Britain implemented mercantilism through the [[Navigation Acts]], which Americans avoided as often as they could. The royal officials responded to smuggling with open-ended search warrants ([[Writ of assistance|Writs of Assistance]]). In 1761, Boston lawyer [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]] argued that the writs violated the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitutional rights]] of the colonists. He lost the case, but John Adams later wrote, "Then and there the child Independence was born."<ref name=Stephens2006>Stephens, ''Unreasonable Searches and Seizures'' (2006) p. 306</ref>

In 1762, Patrick Henry argued the [[Parson's Cause]] in the [[Colony of Virginia]], where the legislature had passed a law and it was vetoed by the king. Henry argued, "that a King, by disallowing Acts of this salutary nature, from being the father of his people, degenerated into a Tyrant and forfeits all right to his subjects' obedience".<ref name = "Miller1943">Miller (1943)</ref>

Following their victory in the [[French and Indian War]] in 1763, Great Britain took control of the French holdings in North America, outside the Caribbean. The British sought to maintain peaceful relations with those Indian tribes that had allied with the French, and keep them separated from the American frontiersmen. To this end, the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] restricted settlement west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] as this was designated an [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]].<ref>Colin G. Calloway, ''The Scratch of a Pen: 1763 and the Transformation of North America'' (2006), pp 92-98 </ref> Disregarding the proclamation, some groups of settlers continued to move west and establish farms.<ref>W.

ISBN 0742511898</ref> The proclamation was soon modified and was no longer a hindrance to settlement, but the fact that it had been promulgated without their prior consultation angered the colonists.<ref>Woody Holton, "The Ohio Indians and the coming of the American revolution in Virginia," ''Journal of Southern History,'' Aug 1994, Vol. 60 Issue 3, pp 453-78</ref>

====1764–1766: More provocative legislation====
{{Main|Sugar Act|Currency Act|Quartering Acts|Stamp Act 1765|Declaratory Act}}
{{See|No taxation without representation|Virtual representation}}

Britain did not expect the colonies to contribute to the interest or the retirement of debt incurred during its wars, but they did expect a portion of the expenses for colonial defense to be paid by the Americans. Estimating the expenses of defending the continental colonies and the [[British West Indies]] to be approximately £200,000 annually, the British goal after the end of this war was that the colonies would be taxed for £78,000 of this amount. The colonists objected chiefly on the grounds not that the taxes were high (they were low)<ref>Englishmen paid on average twenty-five shillings annually in taxes whereas Americans paid only sixpence. Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' (1943) p. 89</ref> but that they had no representation in the Parliament. Parliament insisted it had the right to levy any tax without colonial approval, to demonstrate that it had authority over the colonies.<ref>Middlekauff p. 62</ref>

The colonists did not object to the principle of contributing to the cost of their defense (colonial legislatures spent large sums raising and outfitting militias during the French and Indian War), but they disputed the need for the Crown to station regular British troops in North America. In the absence of a French threat, colonists believed the colonial militias (which were funded by taxes raised by colonial legislatures) to be sufficient. Officer positions were in high demand among the British aristocracy—the rank of captain or major sold for thousands of pounds, and could be resold once an officer purchased an even higher rank.<ref name="Shy, Toward Lexington 2008">Shy, ''Toward Lexington'' (2008) pp 69-73</ref> The British wanted all the commissions for themselves, and were unwilling to commission colonial officers who would pay nothing for their commissions, nor would they recognize colonial commissions, effectively negating the will or the legal authority of the colonies to contribute to defense in that sort of way. With some 1,500 well-connected British officers who would have become redundant in the aftermath of the Seven Years War, London would have had to discharge them if they did not assign them to North America.<ref>Shy, ''Toward Lexington'' 73-78</ref> Therefore the main reason for Parliament imposing taxes was to prove its supremacy, and the main use of the tax funds would be patronage for ambitious British officers.<ref>Bernhard Knollenberg, ''Origin of the American Revolution: 1759-1766'' (1960) pp 76-87</ref> The slogan "[[No taxation without representation]]" summed up the American position. London responded that [[virtual representation|the colonists were "virtually represented"]]; but most Americans rejected this.<ref>William S. Carpenter, "Taxation Without Representation" in ''Dictionary of American History, Volume 7'' (1976); Miller (1943)</ref>

In 1764, Parliament enacted the [[Sugar Act]] and the [[Currency Act]], further vexing the colonists. Protests led to a powerful new weapon, the systematic [[boycott]] of British goods. The following year, the British enacted the [[Quartering Acts]], which required British soldiers to be quartered at the expense of residents in certain areas. Colonists objected to this, as well.

In 1765 the Stamp Act was the first [[direct tax]] levied on the colonies by British Prime Minister [[George Grenville]] and the Parliament. All official documents, newspapers, almanacs, and pamphlets— decks of playing cards—were required to have the stamps. The colonists still considered themselves loyal subjects of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Crown]], with the same historic rights and obligations as subjects in Britain.<ref>Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 11</ref>
Nevertheless, representatives of all 13 colonies protested vehemently, as popular leaders such as Patrick Henry in Virginia and James Otis in Massachusetts, rallied the people in opposition. A secret group, the "[[Sons of Liberty]]" formed in many towns and threatened violence if anyone sold the stamps, and no one did.<ref>Maier, ''From Resistance to Revolution'' (1991) pp. 77-112</ref> In Boston, the Sons of Liberty burned the records of the vice-admiralty court and looted the home of the chief justice, [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]]. Several legislatures called for united action, and nine colonies sent delegates to the [[Stamp Act Congress]] in [[New York City]] in October 1765. Moderates led by [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] drew up a "[[Declaration of Rights and Grievances]]" stating that taxes passed without representation violated their [[Rights of Englishmen]]. Colonists emphasized their determination by boycotting imports of British merchandise. In London, the [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Rockingham]] government came to power and Parliament debated whether to repeal the stamp tax or send an army to enforce it. Benjamin Franklin made the case for repeal, explaining the colonies had spent heavily in manpower, money, and blood in defense of the empire in a series of wars against the French and Indians, and that further taxes to pay for those wars were unjust and might bring about a rebellion. Parliament agreed and repealed the tax, but in the [[Declaratory Act]] of March 1766 insisted that parliament retained full power to make laws for the colonies "in all cases whatsoever".<ref name = "Miller1943"/>

====1767–1773: Townshend Acts and the Tea Act====
{{Main|Townshend Acts|Tea Act}}
{{See|Massachusetts Circular Letter|Boston Massacre|Boston Tea Party}}
[[File:Gaspee Affair.jpg|thumb|alt=Burning of the Gaspée|Burning of the ''[[Gaspée Affair|Gaspée]]'']]

In 1767, the Parliament passed the [[Townshend Acts]], which placed a tax on a number of essential goods including paper, glass, and tea. Angered at the tax increases, colonists organized a boycott of British goods. In Boston on March 5, 1770, a large mob gathered around a group of British soldiers. The mob grew more and more threatening, throwing snowballs, rocks and debris at the soldiers. One soldier was clubbed and fell. All but one of the soldiers fired into the crowd. Eleven people were hit; three civilians were killed at the scene of the shooting, and two died after the incident. The event quickly came to be called the [[Boston Massacre]]. Although the soldiers were tried and acquitted (defended by John Adams), the widespread descriptions soon became propaganda to turn colonial sentiment against the British. This in turn began a downward spiral in the relationship between Britain and the Province of Massachusetts.<ref>Hiller B. Zobel, ''The Boston Massacre'' (1996)</ref>[[File:Boston Tea Party Currier colored.jpg|thumb|alt=Two ships in a harbor, one in the distance.

In June 1772, in what became known as the [[Gaspée Affair|''Gaspée'' Affair]], a British warship that had been vigorously enforcing unpopular trade regulations was burned by American [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriots]]. Soon afterward, Governor Thomas Hutchinson of Massachusetts reported that he and the royal judges would be paid directly from London, thus bypassing the colonial legislature.

On December 16, 1773, a group of men, led by Samuel Adams and dressed to evoke [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], boarded the ships of the government-favored [[East India Company|British East India Company]] and dumped an estimated £10,000 worth of tea from its holds (approximately £636,000 in 2008) into the harbor. This event became known as the [[Boston Tea Party]] and remains a significant part of American patriotic lore.<ref>Benjamin L.

{{Main|Quebec Act|Intolerable Acts}}

The [[Quebec Act]] of 1774 extended [[Quebec]]'s boundaries to the [[Ohio River]], shutting out the claims of the thirteen colonies. By then, however, the Americans had little regard for new laws from London; they were drilling militia and organizing for war.<ref>Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 15</ref>

The British government responded by passing several Acts which came to be known as the [[Intolerable Acts]], which further darkened colonial opinion towards the British. They consisted of four laws enacted by the British parliament.<ref>Miller (1943) pp. 353–76</ref> The first was the [[Massachusetts Government Act]], which altered the Massachusetts charter and restricted town meetings. The second Act, the [[Administration of Justice Act 1774|Administration of Justice Act]], ordered that all British soldiers to be tried were to be arraigned in Britain, not in the colonies. The third Act was the [[Boston Port Act]], which closed the port of Boston until the British had been compensated for the tea lost in the Boston Tea Party (the British never received such a payment). The fourth Act was the Quartering Acts of 1774, which allowed royal governors to house British troops in the homes of citizens without requiring permission of the owner.

[[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] argued in 1775 for the British position that Englishmen paid on average twenty-five shillings annually in taxes whereas Americans paid only sixpence.<ref>Miller, p.89</ref> The colonists countered that North's argument failed to take into consideration the taxes collected by colonial governments. The colonists believed, especially considering the economic restraints the British were keen to enforce in the colonies, that any additional tax burden from London was excessive.

===American political opposition===
{{See|Suffolk Resolves|Declaration of Rights and Grievances|Continental Association|Petition to the King (1774)|Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress|Conciliatory Resolution|Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms|Olive Branch Petition|Hutchinson Letters Affair}}

American political opposition was initially through the colonial assemblies such as the Stamp Act Congress, which included representatives from across the colonies. In 1765, the [[Sons of Liberty]] were formed which used public demonstrations, violence and threats of violence to ensure that the British tax laws were unenforceable. While openly hostile to what they considered an oppressive Parliament acting illegally, colonists persisted in numerous petitions and pleas for intervention from a monarch to whom they still claimed loyalty. In late 1772, after the [[Gaspée Affair|''Gaspée'' Affair]], Samuel Adams in Boston set about creating new Committees of Correspondence, which linked Patriots in all thirteen colonies and eventually provided the framework for a rebel government. In early 1773 Virginia, the largest colony, set up its Committee of Correspondence, on which Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson served.<ref>Greene and Pole (1994) chapters 22–24</ref>

A total of about 7000 to 8000 Patriots served on Committees Correspondence at the colonial and local levels, comprising most of the leadership in their communities—the Loyalists were excluded. The committees became the leaders of the American resistance to British actions, and largely determined the war effort at the state and local level. When the First Continental Congress decided to boycott British products, the colonial and local Committees took charge, examining merchant records and publishing the names of merchants who attempted to defy the boycott by importing British good. They promoted patriotism and home manufacturing, advising Americans to avoid luxuries, and lead a more simple life. The committees gradually extended their power over many aspects of American public life. They set up espionage networks to identify disloyal elements, displaced the royal officials, and helped topple the entire Imperial system in each colony. In late 1774 in early 1775, they supervised the elections of provincial conventions, which took over the actual operation of colonial government.<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation'' (6th ed. 2001) vol 1 pp 144-145</ref>

In response to the ''Massachusetts Government Act'', Massachusetts and other colonies formed local governments called [[Provincial Congress]]es. In 1774, the [[First Continental Congress]] convened, consisting of representatives from each of the Provincial Congresses or their equivalents, to serve as a vehicle for deliberation and collective action. Standing [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committees of Safety]] were created by each Provincial Congress or equivalent for the enforcement of the resolutions by the Committee of Correspondence, Provincial Congress, and the Continental Congress. British colonies in North America that did not have government responsible to its people did not join the Continental Congress, but remained loyal to the Crown. These colonies included [[Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[History of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], [[Bermuda]], [[West Florida]] and [[East Florida]].

The population of the Thirteen Colonies was far from homogeneous, particularly in their political views and attitudes. Loyalties and allegiances varied widely not only within regions and communities, but also within families and sometimes shifted during the course of the Revolution.

===King George III===
The war became a personal issue for the king, fueled by his growing belief that British leniency would be taken as weakness by the Americans. The king also sincerely believed he was defending Britain's constitution against usurpers, rather than opposing patriots fighting for their natural rights.<ref>Andrew Jackson O'Shaughnessy, "'If Others Will Not Be Active, I must Drive': George III and the American Revolution." ''Early American Studies'' 2004 2(1): pp 1-46. P. D. G. Thomas, "George III and the American Revolution." ''History'' 1985 70(228): 16-31, says the king played a minor role before 1775.</ref>

===Patriots===
{{Main|Patriot (American Revolution)}}
{{See|Sons of Liberty}}
At the time, revolutionaries were called "Patriots", "Whigs", "Congress-men", or "Americans". They included a full range of social and economic classes, but were unanimous regarding the need to defend the rights of Americans and uphold the principles of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] in terms of rejecting monarchy and aristocracy, while emphasizing civic virtue on the part of the citizens.

====Role of women====

{{Main|Women in the American Revolution}}

Women contributed to the American Revolution in many ways, and were involved on both sides. While formal Revolutionary politics did not include women, ordinary domestic behaviors became charged with political significance as Patriot women confronted a war that permeated all aspects of political, civil, and domestic life. They participated by boycotting British goods, spying on the British, following armies as they marched, washing, cooking, and tending for soldiers, delivering secret messages, and in a few cases like [[Deborah Samson]] fighting disguised as men. Above all, they continued the agricultural work at home to feed the armies and their families.<ref name="Berkin, 2006 p. 59-60">Berkin, ''Revolutionary Mothers'' (2006) p. 59-60</ref>

The boycott of British goods required the willing participation of American women.<ref>Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 41</ref> the boycotted items were largely household items such as tea and cloth. Women had to return to spinning and weaving—skills that had fallen into disuse. In 1769, the women of Boston produced 40,000 skeins of yarn, and 180 women in [[Middletown, Massachusetts]] wove {{convert|20522|yd|m|0}} of cloth.<ref name="Berkin, 2006 p. 59-60"/>

A crisis of political loyalties could also disrupt the fabric of colonial America women’s social worlds: whether a man did or did not renounce his allegiance to the King could dissolve ties of class, family, and friendship, isolating women from former connections. A woman’s loyalty to her husband, once a private commitment, could become a political act, especially for women in America committed to men who remained loyal to the King. Legal divorce, usually rare, was granted to Patriot women whose husbands supported the King.<ref>Kerber, ''Women of the Republic'' (1997) chapters 4 and 6</ref><ref>Mary Beth Norton, ''Liberty's Daughters: The Revolutionary Experience of American Women'' (1980)</ref>

====Psychology and class ====
Looking back, John Adams concluded in 1818:
:"The Revolution was effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people....This radical change in the principles, opinions, sentiments, and affections of the people was the real American Revolution."<ref>John Ferling, ''Setting the World Ablaze: Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and the American Revolution'' (2002) p. 281</ref>

To understand the Patriots historians have examined their hearts and minds, comparing their psychology with that of the [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]]. Historian [[Leonard Woods Labaree]] has identified eight characteristics of the Loyalists that made them essentially conservative; opposite traits characterized the Patriots.<ref name="Labaree, 1948 pp. 164-5">Labaree, ''Conservatism in Early American History'' (1948) pp. 164-5</ref> Loyalists were older, better established, and resisted innovation. They thought resistance to the Crown—which they insisted was the only legitimate government—was morally wrong, while the Patriots thought morality was on their side. Loyalists were alienated when the Patriots resorted to violence, such as burning houses and [[tarring and feathering]]. Loyalists wanted to take a centrist position and became angry when pressured by the Patriots to declare their opposition to the Crown. Many Loyalists, especially merchants in the port cities, maintained strong and long-standing relations with Britain (often with business and family links to other parts of the British Empire). Many Loyalists realized that independence was bound to come eventually but wanted to delay the inevitable, fearful that revolution might lead to anarchy, tyranny or mob rule. In contrast, the prevailing attitude among Patriots, who made systematic efforts to use mob violence in a controlled manner, was a desire to seize the initiative.<ref>Hull et al, ''Choosing Sides'' (1978) pp. 344–66</ref><ref>Burrows and Wallace, ''The American Revolution'' (1972) pp. 167–305</ref> Labaree also writes that Loyalists were pessimists who lacked the confidence in the future displayed by the Patriots.<ref name="Labaree, 1948 pp. 164-5"/>

Historians, such as [[J. Franklin Jameson]] in the early 20th century, examined the class composition of the Patriot cause, looking for evidence that there was a class war inside the revolution.<ref>J. Franklin Jameson, ''The American Revolution Considered as a Social Movement'' (1926); other historians pursuing the same line of thought included [[Charles Beard]], [[Carl Becker]] and [[Arthur Schlesinger, Sr.]].</ref> In the last 50 years, historians have largely abandoned that interpretation, emphasizing instead the high level of ideological unity.<ref>Wood, "Rhetoric and Reality in the American Revolution" (1966) pp. 3–32</ref> Just as there were rich and poor Loyalists, the Patriots were a 'mixed lot', with the richer and better educated more likely to become officers in the Army. Ideological demands always came first: the Patriots viewed independence as a means of freeing themselves from British oppression and taxation and, above all, reasserting what they considered to be their rights. Most yeomen farmers, craftsmen, and small merchants joined the Patriot cause as well, demanding more political equality. They were especially successful in the Pennsylvania but less so in New England, where John Adams attacked Thomas Paine's ''Common Sense'' for the "absurd democratical notions" it proposed.<ref>Nash (2005)</ref><ref>Resch (2006)</ref>

===Loyalists===
{{Main|Loyalist (American Revolution)}}

While there is no way of knowing the actual numbers, historians have estimated that about 15–20% of the population remained loyal to the British Crown; these were known at the time as "Loyalists", "Tories", or "King's men". The Loyalists never controlled territory unless the British Army occupied it.<ref name="Calhoon, 1992 p. 235">Calhoon, ''Loyalism and Neutrality'' (1992) p. 235</ref> Loyalists were typically older, less willing to break with old loyalties, often connected to the [[Church of England]], and included many established merchants with business connections across the Empire, as well as royal officials such as Thomas Hutchinson of Boston. The revolution sometimes divided families; for example, the Franklins. [[William Franklin]], son of Benjamin Franklin and governor of the [[Province of New Jersey]] remained Loyal to the Crown throughout the war and never spoke to his father again. Recent immigrants who had not been fully Americanized were also inclined to support the King, such as recent Scottish settlers in the back country; among the more striking examples of this, see [[Flora MacDonald (Scottish Jacobite)|Flora MacDonald]].<ref name="Calhoon, 1992 p. 235"/>

After the war, the great majority of the 450,000–500,000 Loyalists remained in America and resumed normal lives. Some, such as [[Samuel Seabury (1729–1796)|Samuel Seabury]], became prominent American leaders. Estimates vary, but about 62,000 Loyalists relocated to Canada, and others to Britain (7,000) or to Florida or the [[West Indies]] (9,000). This made up approximately 2% of the total population of the colonies.<ref name="Pole 1994">Greene and Pole (1994) chapters 20–22</ref> When Loyalists left the [[Southern United States|South]] in 1783, they took thousands of blacks with them as slaves to the British West Indies.<ref name="Pole 1994"/>

===Neutrals===
A minority of uncertain size tried to stay neutral in the war. Most kept a low profile. However, the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], especially in Pennsylvania, were the most important group that was outspoken for neutrality. As Patriots declared independence, the Quakers, who continued to do business with the British, were attacked as supporters of British rule, "contrivers and authors of seditious publications" critical of the revolutionary cause.<ref>Gottlieb 2005</ref>

==Other participants==
===Spain===
Spain did not officially recognize the U.S. but became an informal ally when it declared war on Britain on June 21, 1779. [[Bernardo de Gálvez y Madrid]], general of the Spanish forces in [[New Spain]] who also served as governor of Louisiana was sent to Florida at the head of an expedition of colonial troops to aid the American colonists in their rebellion against Britain <ref>Edward F. Butler, "Spain's Involvement in the American Revolutionary War" ''The SAR Magazine'' Vol. 104 No. 1</ref> The importance of Galvez's campaign from the American perspective was that he denied the British the opportunity of encircling the American rebels from the south, and kept open a vital conduit for supplies.<ref>Thompson, Buchanan Parker, ''Spain: Forgotten Ally of the American Revolution'' North Quincy, Mass.: Christopher Publishing House, 1976.</ref>

===France===
In early 1776, France set up a major program of aid to the Americans, and the Spanish secretly added funds. Each country spent one million "livres tournaises" to buy munitions. A [[dummy corporation]] run by [[Pierre Beaumarchais]] concealed their activities. Americans obtained some munitions through [[Holland]] as well as French and Spanish ports in the [[West Indies]].<ref>Jonathan Dull, ''A Diplomatic History of the American Revolution'' (1985) pp. 57–65</ref>

===Native Americans===
Most [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]] rejected pleas that they remain neutral and supported the King. The tribes that depended most heavily upon colonial trade tended to side with the revolutionaries, though political factors were important as well. The most prominent Native American leader siding with the King was [[Joseph Brant]] of the [[Mohawk nation]], who led frontier raids on isolated settlements in Pennsylvania and [[Province of New York|New York]] until an American army under [[John Sullivan]] secured New York in 1779, forcing the Loyalist Indians into Canada.<ref>Colin G. Calloway, ''The American Revolution in Indian Country: Crisis and Diversity in Native American Communities'' (1995)</ref>

The great majority of the 200,000 Native Americans east of the Mississippi distrusted the colonists and supported the British cause.<ref>Greene and Pole (2004) chapters 19, 46 and 51; Colin G. Calloway, ''The American Revolution in Indian Country: Crisis and Diversity in Native American Communities'' (1995)</ref> Even though there was no major Native American participation during the war, the British provided funding and weapons to attack American outposts. Some Indians tried to remain neutral, seeing little value in participating yet again in a European conflict. A few supported the American cause.<ref>Joseph T. Glatthaar and James Kirby Martin, ''Forgotten Allies: The Oneida Indians and the American Revolution'' (2007)</ref>

The British provided arms for the Indians, under Loyalist leadership, to raid frontier settlements from the [[Province of Carolina|Carolinas]] to New York, threatening to massacre the settlers, especially in Pennsylvania. The most prominent was Mohawk chief Joseph Brant, who led a band of 300 Indian warriors and 100 white loyalists in 1778 and 1780 multiple attacks on small frontier settlements in New York and Pennsylvania.<ref>see Barbara Graymont, "Thayendanegea", [http://www.biographi.ca/EN/ShowBio.asp?BioId=36808&query=joseph%20AND%20brant ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online'']</ref> In 1776 Cherokee war parties attacked all along the southern frontier.<ref>Tom Hatley, ''The Dividing Paths: Cherokees and South Carolinians through the Era of Revolution'' (1993); James H. O'Donnell, III, ''Southern Indians in the American Revolution'' (1973)</ref>

While the Cherokee could launch raids numbering a couple hundred warriors, as seen in the [[Chickamauga Wars]], they could not mobilize enough forces to fight a major invasion without allies. In 1779 Washington sent General John Sullivan with four brigades of Continental soldiers to drive the Iroquois out of upstate western New York. There was little combat but Sullivan systematically burned 40 (empty) Indian villages and, most important, destroyed about 160,000 bushels of corn that comprised the winter food supply. Facing starvation the Iroquois permanently fled to the Niagara Falls area and to Canada, where the British fed them.<ref>Joseph R. Fischer, ''A Well-Executed Failure: The Sullivan Campaign against the Iroquois, July–September 1779'' (1997).</ref>

At the peace conference the British abandoned their Indian allies, and the Americans took possession of all the land east of the Mississippi and north of Florida. Calloway concludes:
:Burned villages and crops, murdered chiefs, divided councils and civil wars, migrations, towns and forts choked with refugees, economic disruption, breaking of ancient traditions, losses in battle and to disease and hunger, betrayal to their enemies, all made the American Revolution one of the darkest periods in American Indian history.<ref>Calloway (1995) p. 290</ref>

The British, however, did not give up their forts in the west until 1796 and kept alive the dream of one day forming a satellite Indian nation in what is now the Ohio to Wisconsin part of the Midwest. That goal was one of the causes of the [[War of 1812]].<ref>Dwight L. Smith, "A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea" ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'' 1989 61(2–4): 46–63</ref><ref>Francis M. Carroll, [http://books.google.com/books?id=1AjlS20Q5J8C&pg=PA24 ''A Good and Wise Measure: The Search for the Canadian-American Boundary, 1783–1842''] (2001) p. 23</ref>

===Slaves===
Some African-American slaves became politically active and supported the King, especially in Virginia where the royal governor actively recruited black men into the British forces in return for [[manumission]], protection for their families, and the promise of land grants. Following the war, many of these "[[Black Loyalist]]s" settled in [[Nova Scotia]], [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada]], and many then moved to [[History of Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone]], where the descendants of some remain today.<ref>Hill (2007), see also [http://www.blackloyalist.com/ blackloyalist.com]</ref>

Some slaves understood Revolutionary rhetoric as promising freedom and equality. Both British and American governments made promises of freedom for service and some slaves fought in one or the other armies. Starting in 1777 abolition occurred in the North, usually on a gradual schedule with no payments to the owners, but slavery persisted in the South and took on new life after 1790.<ref>Benjamin Quarles, ''The Negro in the American Revolution'' (1961)</ref>

During the Revolution, efforts were made by the British to turn slavery against the Americans,<ref name="Revolutionary War: The Home Front">[http://memory.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/amrev/homefrnt/homefrnt.html Revolutionary War: The Home Front], The Library of Congress</ref> but historian David Brion Davis explains the difficulties with a policy of wholesale arming of the slaves: {{quote|But England greatly feared the effects of any such move on its own West Indies, where Americans had already aroused alarm over a possible threat to incite slave insurrections. The British elites also understood that an all-out attack on one form of property could easily lead to an assault on all boundaries of privilege and social order, as envisioned by radical religious sects in Britain’s seventeenth-century civil wars.<ref>Davis p. 148</ref>}}

Davis underscored the British dilemma: "Britain, when confronted by the rebellious American colonists, hoped to exploit their fear of [[Slave rebellion|slave revolts]] while also reassuring the large number of slave-holding Loyalists and wealthy Caribbean planters and merchants that their slave property would be secure".<ref>Davis p. 149</ref> The colonists accused the British of encouraging slave revolts.<ref>Schama p.28-30 p. 78-90</ref>

American advocates of independence were commonly lampooned in Britain for their hypocritical calls for freedom, while many of their leaders were slave-holders. [[Samuel Johnson]] snapped, "how is it we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the [slave] drivers of the Negroes?"<ref>Stanley Weintraub, ''Iron Tears: America's Battle for Freedom, Britain's Quagmire, 1775-1783'' (2005) p. 7</ref> Benjamin Franklin countered by criticizing the British self-congratulation about "the freeing of one Negro" ([[Somersett's Case|Somersett]]) while they continued to permit the [[Slave Trade]].<ref>Schama p.75</ref>

[[Phyllis Wheatley]], a black poet who popularized the image of [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] to represent America, came to public attention when her ''Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral'' appeared in 1773<ref name="Hochschild p.50-51">Hochschild p.50-51</ref>

==Military hostilities begin==

{{See|Shot heard round the world|Boston campaign|Invasion of Canada (1775)}}

The [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Battle of Lexington and Concord]] took place April 19, 1775, when the British sent a force of roughly 1000 troops to confiscate arms and arrest revolutionaries in Concord, Massachusetts.<ref>Morrisey p.35</ref> They clashed with the local militia, marking the first fighting of the American Revolutionary War. The news aroused the 13 colonies to call out their militias and send troops to [[Siege of Boston|besiege Boston]]. The [[Battle of Bunker Hill]] followed on June 17, 1775. While a British victory, it was at a great cost; about 1,000 British casualties from a garrison of about 6,000, as compared to 500 American casualties from a much larger force.<ref>Harvey. ''"A few bloody noses"'' (2002) pp. 208-210</ref><ref>Urban p.74</ref>

The Second Continental Congress convened in 1775, after the war had started. The Congress created the [[Continental Army]] and extended the [[Olive Branch Petition]] to the crown as an attempt at reconciliation. King George III refused to receive it, issuing instead the [[Proclamation of Rebellion]], requiring action against the "traitors".

In the winter of 1775, the Americans [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invaded Canada]]. General [[Richard Montgomery]] captured [[Montreal]] but a joint [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|attack on Quebec]] with the help of [[Benedict Arnold]] failed.

In March 1776, with George Washington as the commander of the new army, the Continental Army forced the British to [[Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)|evacuate Boston]]. The revolutionaries were now in full control of all 13 colonies and were ready to declare independence. While there still were many Loyalists, they were no longer in control anywhere by July 1776, and all of the Royal officials had fled.<ref>Miller (1948) p. 87</ref>

===Prisoners===
{{Main|Prisoners in the American Revolutionary War}}
In August 1775, George III declared Americans in arms against royal authority to be traitors to the Crown. The British government at first started treating captured rebel combatants as common criminals and preparations were made to bring them to trial for treason. American Secretary [[Lord Germain]] and First Lord of the Admiralty [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]] were especially eager to do so, with a particular emphasis on those who had previously served in British units (and thereby sworn an oath of allegiance to the crown).

Many of the prisoners taken by the British at Bunker Hill apparently expected to be hanged, but British authorities declined to take the next step: treason trials and executions. The dilemma was that tens of thousands of Loyalists were under American control and American retaliation would have been easy. The British built much of their strategy around using these Loyalists. After the surrender at Saratoga in October 1777, furthermore, there were thousands of British and Hessian soldiers in American hands. Therefore no Americans were put on trial for treason. The British maltreated the prisoners they held, resulting in more deaths to American sailors and soldiers than combat operations.<ref>Larry G. Bowman, ''Captive Americans: Prisoners During the American Revolution'' (1976)</ref> At the end of the war, both sides released their surviving prisoners.<ref>John C. Miller, ''Triumph of Freedom, 1775–1783'' (1948) p. 166.</ref>

==Finance==
Britain's war against the Americans, French and Spanish cost about £100 million. The Treasury borrowed 40% of the money it needed.<ref>Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'' (1987) pp. 81, 119</ref> Heavy spending brought France to the [[Causes of the French Revolution#Economics and finances|verge of bankruptcy and revolution]], while the British had relatively little difficulty financing their war, keeping their suppliers and soldiers paid, and hiring tens of thousands of German soldiers. Britain had a sophisticated financial system based on the wealth of thousands of landowners, who supported the government, together with banks and financiers in London The efficient British tax system collected about 12 percent of the GDP in taxes during the 1770s.<ref>John Brewer, ''The sinews of power: war, money, and the English state, 1688-1783'' (1990) p 91</ref>

In sharp contrast, Congress and the American states had no end of difficulty financing the war.<ref>Curtis P. Nettels, ''The Emergence of a National Economy, 1775-1815'' (1962) pp 23-44</ref> In 1775 there was at most 12 million dollars in gold in the colonies, not nearly enough to cover current transactions, let alone on a major war. The British made the situation much worse by imposing a tight blockade on every American port, which cut off almost all imports and exports. One partial solution was to rely on volunteer support from militiamen, and donations from patriotic citizens. Another was to delay actual payments, pay soldiers and suppliers in depreciated currency, and promise it would be made good after the war. Indeed, in 1783 the soldiers and officers were given land grants to cover the wages they had earned but had not been paid during the war. Not until 1781, when [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] was named [[Superintendent of Finance of the United States]], did the national government have a strong leader in financial matters. Morris used a French loan in 1782 to set up the private Bank of North America to finance the war. Seeking greater efficiency, Morris reduced the civil list, saved money by using competitive bidding for contracts, tightened accounting procedures, and demanded the federal government's full share of money and supplies from the states.<ref>Charles Rappleye, ''Robert Morris: Financier of the American Revolution'' (2010) pp 225-52</ref>

Congress used four main methods to cover the cost of the war, which cost about 66 million dollars in specie (gold and silver).<ref>Oliver Harry Chitwood, ''A History of Colonial America'' (1961) pp 586-589</ref> Congress made two issues of paper money, in 1775-1780, and in 1780-81. The first issue amounted to 242 million dollars. This paper money would supposedly be redeemed for state taxes, but the holders were eventually paid off in 1791 at the rate of one cent on the dollar. By 1780, the paper money was "not worth a Continental", as people said, and a second issue of new currency was attempted. The second issue quickly became nearly worthless—but it was redeemed by the new federal government in 1791 at 100 cents on the dollar. At the same time the states, especially Virginia and the Carolinas, issued over 200 million dollars of their own currency. In effect, the paper money was a hidden tax on the people, and indeed was the only method of taxation that was possible at the time. The skyrocketing inflation was a hardship on the few people who had fixed incomes—but 90 percent of the people were farmers, and were not directly affected by that inflation. Debtors benefited by paying off their debts with depreciated paper.<ref>Ralph Volney Harlow, "Aspects of Revolutionary Finance, 1775-1783," ''American Historical Review'' Vol. 35, No. 1 (Oct., 1929), pp. 46-68 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1838471 in JSTOR]</ref> The greatest burden was borne by the soldiers of the Continental Army, whose wages—usually in arrears—declined in value every month, weakening their morale and adding to the hardships suffered by their families.

Beginning in 1777, Congress repeatedly asked the states to provide money. But the states had no system of taxation either, and were little help. By 1780 Congress was making requisitions for specific supplies of corn, beef, pork and other necessities—an inefficient system that kept the army barely alive.<ref>Erna Risch, ''Supplying Washington's Army'' (1982)</ref><ref>E. Wayne Carp, ''To Starve the Army at Pleasure: Continental Army Administration and American Political Culture, 1775-1783'' (1990)</ref>

Starting in 1776, the Congress sought to raise money by loans from wealthy individuals, promising to redeem the bonds after the war. The bonds were in fact redeemed and 1791 at face value, but the scheme raised little money because Americans had little specie, and many of the rich merchants were supporters of the Crown. Starting in 1776, the French secretly supplied the Americans with money, gunpowder, and munitions in order to weaken its arch enemy, Great Britain. When France officially entered the war in 1778, the subsidies continued, and the French government, as well as bankers in Paris and Amsterdam loaned large sums to the American war effort. These loans were repaid in full in the 1790s.<ref>E. James Ferguson, ''The power of the purse: A history of American public finance, 1776-1790'' (1961)</ref>

==Creating new state constitutions==
Following the Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775, the Patriots had control of most of Massachusetts; the Loyalists suddenly found themselves on the defensive. In all thirteen colonies, Patriots had overthrown their existing governments, closing courts and driving British governors, agents and supporters from their homes. They had elected conventions and "legislatures" that existed outside of any legal framework; new constitutions were used in each state to supersede royal charters. They declared they were states now, not colonies.<ref name = "Pole-ch29">Nevins (1927); Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 29</ref>

On January 5, 1776, [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] ratified the first state constitution, six months before the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Then, in May 1776, Congress voted to suppress all forms of crown authority, to be replaced by locally created authority. Virginia, [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]], and New Jersey created their constitutions before July 4. [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] and [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] simply took their existing [[royal charter]]s and deleted all references to the crown.<ref>Nevins (1927)</ref>

The new states had to decide not only what form of government to create, they first had to decide how to select those who would craft the constitutions and how the resulting document would be ratified. In states where the wealthy exerted firm control over the process, such as [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], Virginia, [[Delaware Colony|Delaware]], New York and Massachusetts, the results were constitutions that featured:
* Substantial property qualifications for voting and even more substantial requirements for elected positions (though New York and Maryland lowered property qualifications);<ref name = "Pole-ch29"/>
* [[Bicameral legislature]]s, with the upper house as a check on the lower;
* Strong [[governor]]s, with veto power over the legislature and substantial appointment authority;
* Few or no restraints on individuals holding multiple positions in government;
* The continuation of [[Established church|state-established religion]].
 [[File:Benjamin Rush Painting by Peale 1783.jpg|thumb|alt=Benjamin Rush, 1783|[[Benjamin Rush]], 1783]]
In states where the less affluent had organized sufficiently to have significant power—especially Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New Hampshire—the resulting constitutions embodied
* universal white manhood suffrage, or minimal property requirements for voting or holding office (New Jersey enfranchised some property owning widows, a step that it retracted 25 years later);
* strong, [[Unicameralism|unicameral legislatures]];
* relatively weak governors, without veto powers, and little appointing authority;
* prohibition against individuals holding multiple government posts;

Whether conservatives or radicals held sway in a state did not mean that the side with less power accepted the result quietly. The radical provisions of Pennsylvania's constitution lasted only fourteen years. In 1790, conservatives gained power in the state legislature, called a new constitutional convention, and rewrote the constitution. The new constitution substantially reduced universal white-male suffrage, gave the governor veto power and patronage appointment authority, and added an upper house with substantial wealth qualifications to the unicameral legislature. Thomas Paine called it a constitution unworthy of America.<ref name="Wood, 1992"/>

==Independence and Union==

{{See|Lee Resolution|Articles of Confederation|Committee of Five|United States Declaration of Independence}}

In May Congress called on all the states to write constitutions, and eliminate the last remnants of royal rule. In April the [[North Carolina Provincial Congress]] issued the [[Halifax Resolves]], explicitly authorized its delegates to vote for independence.<ref>Jensen, ''The Founding of a Nation'' (1968) pp. 678-9</ref>

By June nine colonies were ready for independence; one by one the last four—Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and New York—fell into line. [[Richard Henry Lee]] was instructed by the Virginia legislature to propose independence, and he did so on June 7, 1776.  On the 11th a committee was created to draft a document explaining the justifications for separation from Britain.  After securing enough votes for passage, independence was voted for on July 2. The  [[Declaration of Independence]], drafted largely by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and presented by the committee, was slightly revised and unanimously adopted by the entire Congress on July 4, marking the formation of a new nation, which called itself the [[United States of America]].<ref>Maier, ''American Scripture'' (1997) pp. 41-46</ref>

The Second Continental Congress approved a new constitution, the "Articles of Confederation," for ratification by the states on November 15, 1777, and immediately began operating under their terms. The Articles were formally ratified on March 1, 1781. At that point, the Continental Congress was dissolved and on the following day a new government of the [[Congress of the Confederation|United States in Congress Assembled]] took its place, with [[Samuel Huntington (statesman)|Samuel Huntington]] as presiding officer.<ref>Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 30</ref><ref>Klos, ''President Who?

===British return: 1776–1777===
{{See|New York and New Jersey campaign|Staten Island Peace Conference|Saratoga campaign|Philadelphia campaign}}

After Washington forced the British out of Boston in spring 1776, neither the British nor the Loyalists controlled any significant areas. The British, however, were massing forces at their naval base at [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. They returned in force in July 1776, landing in New York and defeating Washington's Continental Army at the [[Battle of Brooklyn]] in August, one of the largest engagements of the war. After the Battle of Brooklyn, the British requested a meeting with representatives from Congress to negotiate an end to hostilities. A delegation including John Adams and Benjamin Franklin met Howe on [[Staten Island]] in New York Harbor on September 11, in what became known as the [[Staten Island Peace Conference]]. Howe demanded a retraction of the Declaration of Independence, which was refused, and negotiations ended until 1781. The British then [[Battle of Kip's Bay|quickly seized New York City]] and nearly captured General Washington. They made the city their main political and military base of operations in North America, [[Evacuation Day (New York)|holding it until November 1783]]. New York City consequently became the destination for Loyalist refugees, and a focal point of Washington's [[Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War|intelligence network]].<ref>Schecter, Barnet. ''The Battle for New York: The City at the Heart of the American Revolution''. (2002)</ref><ref>McCullough, ''1776'' (2005)</ref> The British also took New Jersey, pushing the Continental Army into Pennsylvania, but in a surprise attack in late December 1776 Washington [[Washington's crossing of the Delaware|crossed the Delaware River]] back into New Jersey and defeated Hessian and British armies at [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]], thereby regaining New Jersey. The victories gave an important boost to pro-independence supporters at a time when morale was flagging, and have become iconic events of the war.[[File:Washington Praying 1928 Issue-2c.jpg|thumb|185px|Washington at Valley Forge, issue of 1928]]

In 1777, as part of a grand strategy to end the war, the British sent an invasion force from Canada to seal off New England, which the British perceived as the primary source of agitators. In a major case of mis-coordination, the British army in New York City went to Philadelphia which it captured from Washington. The invasion army under [[John Burgoyne|Burgoyne]] waited in vain for reinforcements from New York, and became trapped in northern New York state. It surrendered after the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in October 1777. From early October 1777 until November 15 a pivotal [[siege]] at [[Fort Mifflin]], Philadelphia, Pennsylvania distracted British troops and allowed Washington time to preserve the Continental Army by safely leading his troops to harsh winter quarters at [[Valley Forge]].

===American alliances after 1778===
{{See|France in the American Revolutionary War|Spain in the American Revolutionary War}}

The capture of a British army at Saratoga encouraged the French to formally enter the war in support of Congress, as Benjamin Franklin negotiated a permanent military alliance in early 1778, significantly becoming the first country to officially recognize the Declaration of Independence. On February 6, 1778, a [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (USA–France)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] and a [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]] were signed between the United States and France.<ref name="Hamilton, 1974 p. 28">Hamilton, ''The Papers of Alexander Hamilton'' (1974) p. 28</ref> [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] spoke out in parliament urging Britain to make peace in America, and unite with America against France, while other British politicians who had previously sympathised with colonial grievances now turned against the American rebels for allying with British international rival and enemy.<ref>Stanley Weintraub, ''Iron Tears: America's Battle for Freedom, Britain's Quagmire, 1775-1783'' (2005) p. 151</ref>

Later Spain (in 1779) and the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] (1780) became allies of the French, leaving the British Empire to fight a global war alone without major allies, and requiring it to slip through a combined blockade of the Atlantic. The American theater thus became only one front in Britain's war.<ref>Mackesy, ''The War for America'' (1993) p. 568</ref> The British were forced to withdraw troops from continental America to reinforce the valuable sugar-producing Caribbean colonies, which were considered more valuable.

Because of the alliance with France and the deteriorating military situation, [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Sir Henry Clinton]], the British commander, evacuated Philadelphia to reinforce New York City. General Washington attempted to intercept the retreating column, resulting in the [[Battle of Monmouth|Battle of Monmouth Court House]], the last major battle fought in the north. After an inconclusive engagement, the British successfully retreated to New York City. The northern war subsequently became a stalemate, as the focus of attention shifted to the smaller southern theater.<ref name="Higginbotham, 1983 p. 83">Higginbotham, ''The War of American Independence'' (1983) p. 83</ref>

===The British move South, 1778–1783===
{{See|Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|Naval operations in the American Revolutionary War}}

The British strategy in America now concentrated on a campaign in the southern colonies. With fewer regular troops at their disposal, the British commanders saw the "southern strategy" as a more viable plan, as the south was perceived as being more strongly Loyalist, with a large population of recent immigrants as well as large numbers of slaves who might be captured or run away to join the British.<ref>Crow and Tise, ''The Southern Experience in the American Revolution'' (1978) p. 157-9</ref>

Beginning in late December 1778, the British captured [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] and controlled the [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] coastline. In 1780 they launched a fresh invasion and [[Siege of Charleston|took Charleston]] as well. A significant victory at the [[Battle of Camden]] meant that royal forces soon controlled most of Georgia and South Carolina. The British set up a network of forts inland, hoping the Loyalists would rally to the flag. Not enough Loyalists turned out, however, and the British had to fight their way north into North Carolina and Virginia, with a severely weakened army. Behind them much of the territory they had already captured dissolved into a chaotic [[guerrilla war]], fought predominantly between bands of Loyalist and American militia, which negated many of the gains the British had previously made.<ref>Henry Lumpkin, ''From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South'' (2000)</ref>

====Yorktown 1781====
[[File:Yorktown80.JPG|thumb|alt=The siege of Yorktown ended with the surrender of a second British army, paving the way for the end of the American Revolutionary War|The siege of Yorktown ended with the surrender of a second British army, marking effective British defeat]]
{{Main|Siege of Yorktown}}

The southern British army marched to [[Yorktown, Virginia]] where they expected to be rescued by a British fleet which would take them back to New York.<ref>Harvey p.493-95</ref> When that fleet was defeated by a French fleet at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]], the southern British army became trapped at Yorktown.<ref>Harvey p.502-06</ref> In October 1781 under a combined siege by the French and Continental armies under Washington, the British, under the command of General Cornwallis, surrendered their second army of the war.  Cornwallis refused to attend the surrender ceremonies and sent a subordinate.<ref>Harvey p.515</ref>

====The war winds down====
Support for the conflict had never been strong in Britain, where many sympathized with the rebels, but now it reached a new low.<ref>Harvey p.528</ref> Although King George III personally wanted to fight on, his supporters lost control of Parliament, and no further major land offensives were launched in the American Theater.<ref name="Higginbotham, 1983 p. 83"/><ref>A final naval battle was fought on March 10, 1783 by Captain [[John Barry (naval officer)|John Barry]] and the crew of the [[USS Alliance (1778)|USS ''Alliance'']], who defeated three British warships led by HMS ''Sybille''. Martin I. J. Griffin, ''The Story of Commodore John Barry'' (2010) pp 218-23</ref>

Washington could not know that after Yorktown the British would not reopen hostilities. They still had 26,000 troops occupying New York City, Charleston and Savannah, together with a powerful fleet. The French army and navy departed, so the Americans were on their own in 1782-83.<ref>Jonathan R. Dull, ''The French Navy and American Independence'' (1975) p. 248</ref> The treasury was empty, and the unpaid soldiers were growing restive, almost to the point of mutiny or possible ''coup d'état''. The unrest among officers of the [[Newburgh Conspiracy]] was personally dispelled by Washington in 1783, and Congress subsequently created the promise of a five years bonus for all officers.<ref>Richard H. Kohn, ''Eagle and Sword: The Federalists and the Creation of the Military Establishment in America, 1783-1802'' (1975) pp 17-39</ref>

==Peace treaty==
{{Main|Treaty of Paris (1783)}}

The peace treaty with Britain, known as the Treaty of Paris, gave the U.S. all land east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes, though not including Florida (On September 3, 1783, Britain entered into a separate agreement with Spain under which Britain ceded Florida back to Spain.) The British abandoned the Indian allies living in this region; they were not a party to this treaty and did not recognize it until they were defeated militarily by the United States. Issues regarding boundaries and debts were not resolved until the [[Jay Treaty]] of 1795.<ref>Miller (1948), pp. 616–48</ref> Since the blockade was lifted and the old imperial restrictions were gone, American merchants were free to trade with any nation anywhere in the world, and their business flourished.

===Impact on Britain===
Losing the war and the 13 colonies was a shock to the British system. The war revealed the limitations of Britain's fiscal-military state when it discovered it suddenly faced powerful enemies, with no allies, and dependent on extended and vulnerable transatlantic lines of communication. The defeat heightened dissension and escalated political antagonism to the King's ministers. Inside parliament, the primary concern changed from fears of an over-mighty monarch to the issues of representation, parliamentary reform, and government retrenchment. Reformers sought to destroy what they saw as widespread institutional corruption. The result was a powerful crisis, 1776-1783. The peace in 1783 left France financially prostrate, while the British economy boomed thanks to the return of American business. The crisis ended after 1784 thanks to the King's shrewdness in outwitting [[Charles James Fox]] (the leader of the [[Fox-North Coalition]]), and renewed confidence in the system engendered by the leadership of the new Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]]. Historians conclude that loss of the American colonies enabled Britain to deal with the [[French Revolution]] with more unity and better organization than would otherwise have been the case.<ref>William Hague, ''William Pitt the Younger'' (2004)</ref><ref>Jeremy Black, ''George III: America’s Last King''(2006)</ref>

==Immediate aftermath==
After the war finally ended in 1783, there was a period of prosperity, with the entire world at peace. The national government, still operating under the Articles of Confederation was able to settle the issue of the western territories, which were ceded by the states to Congress. American settlers moved rapidly into the new lands, and Vermont, Kentucky and Tennessee became states in the 1790s.<ref>Greene and Pole, eds. ''Companion to the American Revolution,'' pp. 557-624</ref> However, that Congress had no money to pay either the war debts owed to European nations and bankers, or to Americans who had been given billions of dollars of promissory notes for supplies during the war. Nationalists, led by Washington, Alexander Hamilton and other veterans, feared that the new nation was too fragile to withstand an international war, or even internal revolts such as the [[Shays' Rebellion]] of 1786 in Massachusetts. Calling themselves "Federalists," the nationalists convinced Congress to call the [[Philadelphia Convention]] in 1787.<ref>Richard B. Morris, ''The Forging of the Union: 1781-1789'' (1987) pp 245-266</ref> It drafted a new [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] that provided for a much stronger federal government, with a powerful president and was ratified in 1788.<ref>Morris, ''The Forging of the Union: 1781-1789'' pp 300-13</ref> The new government under President George Washington took office in New York in March 1789.<ref>Morris, ''The Forging of the Union, 1781-1789'' pp 300-22</ref>

===Interpretations===
Interpretations about the effect of the Revolution vary. Though contemporary participants referred to the events as "the revolution",<ref>David McCullough, ''John Adams'' (2001)</ref> at one end of the spectrum is the view that the American Revolution was not "revolutionary" at all, contending that it did not radically transform colonial society but simply replaced a distant government with a local one.<ref>Greene, ''The American Revolution'' (2000) pp. 93-102</ref> More recent scholarship pioneered by historians such as [[Bernard Bailyn]], [[Gordon S. Wood|Gordon Wood]], and [[Edmund Morgan]] accepts the contemporary view of the participants that the American Revolution was a unique and radical event that produced deep changes and had a profound impact on world affairs, based on an increasing belief in the principles of the Enlightenment as reflected in how liberalism was understood during the period, and republicanism. These were demonstrated by a leadership and government that espoused protection of natural rights, and a system of laws chosen by the people.<ref>Wood, ''The American Revolution: A History'' (2003)</ref>

===Loyalist expatriation===
About 60,000 to 70,000 Loyalists left the newly founded republic; some left for Britain and the remainder, called [[United Empire Loyalists]] received British subsidies to resettle in British colonies in North America, especially [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Quebec]] (concentrating in the [[Eastern Townships]]), [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Nova Scotia]].<ref>W. Stewart Wallace, '';The United Empire Loyalists: A Chronicle of the Great Migration'' (Toronto, 1914) [http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/1/1/9/7/11977/11977.htm online edition]</ref> The new colonies of Upper Canada (now [[Ontario]]) and [[New Brunswick]] were created by Britain for their benefit. However, about 80% of the Loyalists stayed and became loyal citizens of the United States, and some of the exiles later returned to the U.S.<ref>Van Tine, ''American Loyalists'' (1902) p 307</ref>

===As an example or inspiration===
{{See|Atlantic Revolutions}}

After the Revolution, genuinely democratic politics became possible.<ref>Wood, ''The Radicalism of the American Revolution'' (1992) pp. 278-9</ref> The rights of the people were incorporated into state constitutions. Thus came the widespread assertion of liberty, individual rights, equality and hostility toward corruption which would prove core values of liberal republicanism to Americans. The greatest challenge to the old order in Europe was the challenge to inherited political power and the democratic idea that government rests on the [[consent of the governed]]. The example of the first successful revolution against a European empire, and the first successful establishment of a republican form of [[democracy|democratically]] elected government, provided a model for many other colonial peoples who realized that they too could break away and become self-governing nations with [[Direct election|directly elected]] representative government.<ref>Palmer, (1959)</ref>

The Dutch Republic, also at war with Britain at that time, was the next country after France to sign a treaty with the United States, on October 8, 1782.<ref name="Hamilton, 1974 p. 28"/> On April 3, 1783, Ambassador Extraordinary [[Gustaf Philip Creutz]], representing King [[Gustav III of Sweden]], and Benjamin Franklin, [[United States Ambassador to France|Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States of America]], signed a [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (USA–Sweden)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] with the U.S.<ref name="Hamilton, 1974 p. 28"/>

The American Revolution was the first wave of the [[Atlantic Revolutions]] that took hold in the French Revolution, the [[Haitian Revolution]], and the [[Latin American wars of independence]]. Aftershocks reached Ireland in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and in the Netherlands.<ref>Palmer, (1959); Greene and Pole (1994) ch 53–55</ref>

The Revolution had a strong, immediate impact in Great Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, and France. Many British and Irish [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] spoke in favor of the American cause. The Revolution, along with the [[Dutch Revolt]] (end of the 16th century) and the [[English Civil War]] (in the 17th century), was one of the first lessons in overthrowing an old regime for many Europeans who later were active during the era of the French Revolution, such as [[Marquis de Lafayette]]. The American Declaration of Independence had some impact on the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]] of 1789.<ref>Palmer, (1959); Greene and Pole (1994) chapters 49–52</ref><ref>Center for History and New Media, ''Liberty, equality, fraternity'' (2010)</ref>
The spirit of the Declaration of Independence led to laws ending slavery in all the Northern states and the Northwest Territory, with New Jersey the last in 1804—long before the British Parliament acted in 1833 to abolish slavery in its colonies.<ref>Greene and Pole p. 409, 453-54</ref>

===National debt===
{{See|United States public debt|Alexander Hamilton}}

The national debt after the American Revolution fell into three categories. The first was the $12 million owed to foreigners—mostly money borrowed from France. There was general agreement to pay the foreign debts at full value. The national government owed $40 million and state governments owed $25 million to Americans who had sold food, horses, and supplies to the revolutionary forces. There were also other debts that consisted of [[promissory note]]s issued during the Revolutionary War to soldiers, merchants, and farmers who accepted these payments on the premise that the new Constitution would create a government that would pay these debts eventually.

The war expenses of the individual states added up to $114 million compared to $37 million by the central government.<ref>Jensen, ''The New Nation'' (1950) p. 379</ref> In 1790, at the recommendation of first Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, Congress combined the remaining state debts with the foreign and domestic debts into one national debt totaling $80 million. Everyone received face value for wartime certificates, so that the national honor would be sustained and the national credit established.<ref>Joseph J. Ellis, ''His Excellency: George Washington'' (2004) p 204</ref>
