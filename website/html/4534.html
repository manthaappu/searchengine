==Overview==
Brightkite allows registered users to connect with their existing friends and also meet new people based on the places that they go. Once a user "checks in" at a place, they can post notes and photos to that location and other users can comment on these posts. Users control the privacy of their updates and can choose to share them with their [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] accounts, while also having the option to share their [[geotagged]] photo posts to [[Flickr]].

Brightkite is available worldwide.

Brightkite currently has applications for [[iPhone]], [[Android os|Android]], and [[Symbian]]<ref>http://brightkite.com/</ref>.

==iPhone App==
The Brightkite iPhone app uses the iPhone's geolocation features to automatically locate the user. From the app a user can check in, post a note or photo, send messages, browse their friend and nearby streams, and access their account settings.<ref>[http://mashable.com/2008/10/16/brightkite-iphone-app/ "Brightkiteâ€™s iPhone App Highlights the Potential of GPS"] October 16, 2008 Mashable</ref>
