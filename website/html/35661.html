'''Statistical semantics''' is the study of "how the statistical patterns of human word usage can be used to figure out what people mean, at least to a level sufficient for information access" ([[George Furnas|Furnas]], 2006). How can we figure out what words mean, simply by looking at patterns of words in huge collections of text? What are the limits to this approach to understanding words?

==History==

The term ''Statistical Semantics'' was first used by [[Warren Weaver|Weaver]] (1955) in his well-known paper on [[machine translation]]. He argued that [[word sense disambiguation]] for machine translation should be based on the [[co-occurrence]] frequency of the context words near a given target word. The underlying assumption that "a word is characterized by the company it keeps" was advocated by [[J. R. Firth|J.R. Firth]] (1957). This assumption is known in [[Linguistics]] as the [[Distributional hypothesis|Distributional Hypothesis]]. Delavenay (1960) defined ''Statistical Semantics'' as "Statistical study of meanings of words and their frequency and order of recurrence." [[George Furnas|Furnas]] et al. (1983) is frequently cited as a foundational contribution to Statistical Semantics.  An early success in the field was [[Latent semantic analysis|Latent Semantic Analysis]].

==Applications of statistical semantics==

Research in Statistical Semantics has resulted in a wide variety of algorithms that use the Distributional Hypothesis to discover many aspects of [[semantics]], by applying statistical techniques to [[Text corpus|large corpora]]:

* Measuring the [[Semantic similarity|similarity in word meanings]] (Lund et al., 1995; Landauer and Dumais, 1997; McDonald and Ramscar, 2001, Terra and Clarke, 2003)

* Measuring the similarity in word relations (Turney, 2006)

* Modeling [[similarity-based generalization]] (Yarlett, 2008)

* Discovering words with a given relation (Hearst, 1992)

* Classifying relations between words (Turney and Littman, 2005)

* Extracting keywords from documents (Frank et al., 1999; Turney, 2000)

* Measuring the cohesiveness of text (Turney, 2003)

* Discovering the different senses of words (Pantel and Lin, 2002)

* Distinguishing the different senses of words (Turney, 2004)

* Subcognitive aspects of words (Turney, 2001)

* Distinguishing praise from criticism (Turney and Littman, 2003)

==Related fields==

Statistical Semantics focuses on the meanings of common words and the relations between common words, unlike [[text mining]], which tends to focus on whole documents, document collections, or named entities (names of people, places, and organizations). Statistical Semantics is a subfield of [[computational semantics]], which is in turn a subfield of [[computational linguistics]] and [[natural language processing]].

Many of the applications of Statistical Semantics (listed above) can also be addressed by [[lexicon]]-based algorithms, instead of the [[text corpus|corpus]]-based algorithms of Statistical Semantics. One advantage of corpus-based algorithms is that they are typically not as labour-intensive as lexicon-based algorithms. Another advantage is that they are usually easier to adapt to new languages than lexicon-based algorithms. However, the best performance on an application is often achieved by combining the two approaches (Turney et al., 2003).
