'''SuperCalc''' was a [[spreadsheet]] application published by [[Sorcim]] in 1980, and originally bundled (along with [[WordStar]]) as part of the [[CP/M]] software package included with the [[Osborne 1]] [[portable computer]].

An improvement over [[VisiCalc]], SuperCalc was notable for being one of the first spreadsheet programs capable of iteratively solving [[circular reference]]s (cells that depend on each other's results).  It would be over 10 years after the introduction of SuperCalc before this feature was implemented in [[Microsoft Excel]], although in [[Lotus 1-2-3]], manual programming of iterative logic could also be used to solve this issue. According to the SuperCalc product manager, iterative calculations were added when Sorcim changed from BCD to Binary math. Since the precision of the two math packages was different, some IF statements resolved differently, and iterative calculations helped solve this problem{{Or|date=August 2010}}.

Versions of SuperCalc were later released for the [[Apple II family]], for [[IBM PC compatibles|PCs]] running [[MS-DOS|DOS]], and, after Sorcim was bought by [[Computer Associates]] (CA) in the mid-1980s, for [[Microsoft Windows|MS Windows]] (under the name '''CA-SuperCalc''').
