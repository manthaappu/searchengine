==Mission==
The mission of Judgepedia is to help readers find useful information about the court system and judiciary in the [[United States]]. <ref name="about">[http://judgepedia.org/index.php/Judgepedia:About Judgepedia:About]</ref>

==History==
Judgepedia was founded by the [[Sam Adams Alliance]] in 2007, along with [[Ballotpedia]] and [[Sunshine Review]]. In 2009 sponsorship of Judgepedia was transferred to the Lucy Burns Institute. <ref name="about" />

Work on Judgepedia started in 2007 with creating pages for all of the federal courts and judges in the United States. <ref>[http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20101126/NEWS01/11260321 ''Delaware Online'' "Web site examines state, federal judges, court systems", November 26, 2010]</ref> Once that project was complete, the focus shifted to state courts and judges, which includes in depth coverage of judicial elections since 2010. <ref>[http://judgepedia.org/index.php/Judicial_elections,_2010 Judgepedia:Judicial elections, 2010]</ref>

In the Spring of 2008, Judgepedia changed it's settings to require registration prior to editing the wiki. <ref>[http://judgepedia.org/index.php/Judgepedia:About#Anyone_may_contribute Judgepedia:About:Anyone may contribute]</ref>
