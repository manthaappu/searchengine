'''Wikia''' (formerly '''Wikicities''') is a [[free web hosting service]] for [[wiki]]s (or [[wiki farm]]). It is normally free of charge for readers and editors, deriving most of its income from advertising, and publishes all user-provided text under [[copyleft]] licenses.

Wikia hosts several thousand wikis using the open-source [[wiki software]] [[MediaWiki]]. Its operator, '''Wikia, Inc.''', is a [[for-profit]] [[Delaware corporation|Delaware company]] founded in late 2004<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.03/wiki.html|title=The Book Stops Here|author=Pink, Daniel H.|publisher=[[Wired News]]|accessdate=2007-08-01|date=2005-03-13}}</ref> by [[Jimmy Wales]] and [[Angela Beesley Starling|Angela Beesley]]—respectively Chairman Emeritus and Advisory Board member of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]—and headed by [[Gil Penchina]].

==History==
Wikia spent over a year as ''Wikicities'' (inviting comparisons to [[GeoCities]]),<ref>{{cite web|title=Global villages convene in wiki town halls|author=Gussow, Dave|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/04/04/Technology/Global_villages_conve.shtml|date=2005-04-04}}</ref> but changed its name on March 27, 2006, saying that "the name Wikicities has often caused confusion, with many people believing it was a site for city guides rather than wikis about any topic."<ref>{{cite web|title=Wikicities relaunches as Wikia|author=Beesley, Angela|work=Wikia|url=http://community.wikia.com/wiki/Community_Central:Press:_Wikicities_relaunches_as_Wikia|date=2006-03-27| accessdate = 2010-02-09}}</ref> In the month before the move, Wikia announced a [[United States dollar|US$]]4 million [[venture capital]] investment from [[Bessemer Venture Partners]] and [[First Round Capital]].<ref name="VentureCapital">{{cite web|title=Venture capitalists invest wiki-millions|author=Hinman, Michael|work=[[Tampa Bay Business Journal]]|url=http://tampabay.bizjournals.com/tampabay/stories/2006/03/13/story1.html|date=2006-03-10| accessdate = 2006-03-10}}</ref> Nine months later, [[Amazon.com]] invested US$10 million in Series B funding,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewnews.com/story.asp?sectioncode=44&storycode=41174|title=PE Week Wire|author=Primack, Dan|publisher=Private Equity Week|date=2007-01-03}}</ref> with senior VP of [[business development]] Jeff Blackburn joining the company board.<ref name="mercury faith">{{cite news|title=Amazon puts faith &ndash; and money &ndash; in Wikia|author=Blitstein, Ryan|publisher=Mercury News|date=2006-12-06|accessdate=2007-03-08}}</ref>

In November 2006, Wikia claimed to have spent only $5.74 on marketing, while generating 40 to 50 million [[page view]]s.<ref name="mercury faith" /> The company later spent $2 million to purchase [[ArmchairGM]], a sports forum and wiki, previously an independently hosted site.<ref name="mercury faith" />

Wikia announced the creation of its one hundredth wiki on February 3, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title=100 Wikicities|author=Beesley, Angela ''et al.''|date=2005-02-03| accessdate = 2010-02-09|url=http://community.wikia.com/wiki/Community_Central:Press:_100_Wikicities}}</ref>  As of July 2007, it had over 3,000 wikis in over 50 [[languages]].<ref name="technewsworld">{{cite web|url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/Vkg5Q8W8POblL7/Wikipedia-Founder-Staffs-For-Profit-Wikia-Spinoff.xhtml|title=Wikipedia Founder Staffs For Profit Wikia Spinoff|author=Shannon, Victoria|publisher=''[[International Herald Tribune]]''|date=2006-09-28|accessdate=2006-10-28}}{{Dead link|url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/Vkg5Q8W8POblL7/Wikipedia-Founder-Staffs-For-Profit-Wikia-Spinoff.xhtml|date=January 2009}}</ref> Wikia's growth stems not only from wikis founded on Wikia, but also from incorporating formerly independent wikis that joined Wikia over time, such as [[LyricWiki]], [[The Vault (wiki)|The Vault]], [[Uncyclopedia]] and [[WoWWiki]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lyrics.wikia.com/lyrics/LyricWiki:Wikia_Migration_FAQ|title=LyricWiki:Wikia Migration FAQ|author=Colombo, Sean|publisher=Wikia|date=2009-08-31|accessdate=2009-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://wikia.com/wiki/Uncyclopedia_joins_Wikia | title = Uncyclopedia joins Wikia | accessdate = 2006-07-18 | last = Beesley | first = Angela | authorlink = Angela Beesley |date=2005-05-26 | work = Wikia |format = Wiki}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Warschauer|first=Mark|coauthors=Grimes, Douglas|year=2007|title=Audience, Authorship, and Artifact: The emergent semiotics of Web 2.0|journal=Annual Review of Applied Linguistics|volume=27|pages=1–23|doi=10.1017/S0267190508070013}}</ref>

On April 7, 2010 Wikia announced the creation of its 100,000th wiki.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Sarah_Manley/100,000_wikis_on_Wikia|title=100,000 wikis on Wikia|author=Manley, Sarah|publisher=Wikia|date=2010-04-07|accessdate=2010-04-07|work=Wikia|format=Wiki}}</ref> In May 2010, the company offered the removal of external ads (though not internal promotions) for a fee, but only for wikis with fewer than 20,000 page-views per month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.wikia.com/wiki/Ad_free_wikis|title=Ad free wikis|publisher=Wikia|format=Wiki|date=2010-05-17|accessdate=2010-06-12}}</ref>

==Topics and wikis==
Wikia covers a broad range of topics; almost any project not founded on hate, libel, pornography or [[copyright infringement]] is allowed, as long as it does not duplicate Wikimedia Foundation projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.wikia.com/wiki/Community_Central:Creation_policy|title=Wikia:Creation policy|accessdate=2010-02-09}}</ref> Many hosted wikis follow the style of [[Wikipedia]], but offer detail beyond that considered appropriate for a general encyclopedia. For example, a minor character in a ''[[Star Wars]]'' film may have its own article on [[Wookieepedia]].<ref>{{cite news|title=With Wikia, a Wikipedia founder looks to strike it rich|author=McNichol, Tom|publisher=Business 2.0 Magazine|date=March 2007|accessdate=2008-06-24|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2007/03/01/8401010/index.htm}}</ref> Wikia also allows wikis to have a point-of-view, rather than the neutral POV on Wikipedia.

Wikia requires all user text content to be published under a free license;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.wikia.com/wiki/Community_Central:Licensing|title=Wikia:Licensing|accessdate=2010-02-09}}</ref> most use the [[Creative Commons]] [[Creative Commons licenses#Original licenses|Attribution-ShareAlike]] license, although [[Memory Alpha]] and [[Uncyclopedia]] use a noncommercial variant and some use the [[GNU Free Documentation License]].<ref group="nb" name="test">Most content on Wikia was licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License until June 19, 2009, at which point most wikis were [[GNU Free Documentation License#Compatibility with CC-BY-SA|relicensed to CC-BY-SA]].</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.wikia.com/wiki/Forum:Licensing_update_June_19,_2009|title=Licensing update June 19, 2009|author=Beesley, Angela|date=|accessdate=2010-02-09}}</ref>

===Significant wikis hosted===
{{expand section|date=January 2011}}

===Questions and answers site===
Wikia has struggled several times to open a question-and-answer site akin to [[Google Answers]] and similar ventures. In January 2009, the company relaunched this effort, which used the name "Wikianswers", which drew criticism from [[Answers.com]], which had a preexisting site called [[WikiAnswers]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Schonfeld |first=Erick |url=http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/31/jimmy-wales-quietly-launches-wikianswers/ |title=Jimmy Wales Quietly Launches Wikianswers |publisher=Techcrunch.com |date=2009-01-31 |accessdate=2009-07-17}}</ref> Answers.com CEO [[Bob Rosenschein]] stated, "Wikia is creating market confusion by associating its Q&A category with our market-leading WikiAnswers domain and site."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nostupidanswers.com/2009/02/03/wikianswers-setting-the-record-straight |title=WikiAnswers: setting the record straight |publisher=Nostupidanswers.com |date=2009-02-03 |accessdate=2009-07-17}}</ref>

In March 2010, Wikia re-launched "Answers from Wikia",<ref>[http://digital.venturebeat.com/2010/03/16/free-wiki-hosting-company-wikia-to-let-you-create-your-own-question-and-answer-sites/ ''Free wiki hosting company Wikia to let you create your own question and answer sites'']</ref> where users could create topic-specialized [[knowledge market]] wikis based upon Wikia's own Wikianswers subdomain.

===OpenServing===
'''OpenServing''' was a short-lived [[Web publishing]] project owned by Wikia, founded on December 12, 2006,<ref name="usatoday">{{cite news |title=Wikipedia founder remakes Web-publishing economics |url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/software/2006-12-12-wiki-free-tools_x.htm?csp=34

According to Wikia co-founder and chairman [[Jimmy Wales]], the OpenServing site received several thousand applications in January 2007.<ref name="journal">{{cite news |title=Wikis can succeed on newspaper sites, claims Wikipedia founder |url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/2/articles/53151.php |work= |publisher=Online Journalism News, Journalism.co.uk |date=2007-01-19 |accessdate=2007-10-04 }}</ref> However, after a year, no sites had been launched under the OpenServing banner. [[Angela Beesley]], a co-founder and vice president of Community at Wikia described OpenServing as "never very popular or successful", and said Wikia's efforts had been refocused on wikia.com, to which openserving.com redirects.<ref name="mars" />

==Software==
Wikia runs a modified version of [[MediaWiki]] on [[Linux]] ([[Red Hat]], [[Debian]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]) servers, and claims to provide both technical and [[social support]] for all aspects of running a wiki community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why use Wikia?|url=http://community.wikia.com/wiki/Help:Why_use_Wikia|author=Wikia, Inc.|accessdate=2010-02-09}}</ref>

==Search engines==
===Wikiasari===
Wikia Inc. initially proposed creating a [[copyleft]] [[search engine]]; the software (but not the site) was named "Wikiasari" by a November 2004 naming contest.<ref group="nb">The name was derived from the Hawaiian word for "quick" and asari, Japanese for "rummaging search".</ref> The proposal became inactive in 2005.

===Search Wikia===
{{Main|Wikia Search}}
The "public alpha" of '''Wikia Search''' web search engine was launched on January 7, 2008<ref>[http://alpha.search.wikia.com/ Public alpha of Wikia search project]</ref> from the USSHC underground data center.<ref>[http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2008/01/06/wikia-search-launches-from-iowa-data-bunker/ Wikia Search Launches From Iowa Data Bunker]</ref> This roll-out version of the search interface was roundly panned by reviewers in technology media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://machinist.salon.com/blog/2008/01/07/search_wikia/|title=Wikipedia founder's search engine gets bad reviews|author=Manjoo, Farhad|publisher=[[Salon.com]]|date=2008-01-07|accessdate=2008-01-07}}</ref>
The project was ended in March 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10207896-2.html |title=Wales giving up on Wikia Search |work=Webware |first=Rafe |last=Needleman |publisher=CNet |date=31 March 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-17}}</ref>

===Current search engine===
Late in 2009, a new search engine was established to index and display results from all sites hosted on Wikia.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Company==
Wikia, Inc. is based in [[San Francisco]] (500 Third Street, SOMA district), [[California]], [[United States|U.S.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconvalleywire.com/svw/2006/12/san_mateobased_.html|title=San Mateo-Based Wikia Lands Investment from Amazon.com|publisher=Silicon Valley Wire|date=2006-12-06|accessdate=2007-03-08}}; California Business Portal, [http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/corpdata/ShowAllList?QueryCorpNumber=C2935209 Agent for service of process address]; [[Go Daddy]], [http://who.godaddy.com/WhoIs.aspx?domain=wikia.com&prog_id=godaddy Registered domain address].</ref> The company was originally [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in [[Florida]] in December 2004 and re-incorporated in [[Delaware]] as Wikia, Inc. on January 10, 2006.

Angela Beesley has served since the beginning as Wikia's [[vice president|Vice-President]] of Community Relations.<ref name="Venture">{{cite web|title=Bessemer Venture Partners Funds Jimmy Wales' Startup Wikia|author=Wikia, Inc.|url=http://community.wikia.com/index.php?title=Community_Central:Press:_Bessemer_Venture_Partners_Funds_Jimmy_Wales%27_Startup_Wikia&oldid=28295|date=2006-03-30|accessdate=2010-02-09}}</ref> [[Gil Penchina]], a previous [[angel investor]]<ref name="Venture" /> and former vice president and [[general manager]] at [[eBay]], was hired as [[chief executive officer|CEO]] on June 5, 2006.<ref name="CEO">{{cite web|title=Wikia taps eBay exec as CEO|work=[[San Francisco Business Times]]|url=http://sanfrancisco.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2006/06/05/daily9.html|date=2006-06-05}}</ref> [[Michael E. Davis]], a former [[business partner]] of Wales who served for years as a founding member of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] board and was that organization's [[Treasurer]], was named Treasurer and [[Secretary]] of Wikia in January 2006.

Wikia has some technical staff in the USA, but also has an office in [[Poznań]], [[Poland]] in 2006. Explaining his choice of location, Wales commented "It's about reasonable salaries and high quality. You can find cheaper programmers in other parts of the world, but the quality's not there!"<ref name="technewsworld" />

Wikia derives income from advertising. The company initially used [[Google AdSense]],<ref name="Marketplace">{{cite news|url=http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2006/08/30/PM200608305.html|title=For-profit wiki|publisher=[[Marketplace (radio program)|Marketplace]]''|author=Lashinksy, Adam; Scott, Jagon|date=2006-08-30|accessdate=2009-06-19}}</ref> but moved on to [[Federated Media]] before bringing ad management in-house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.wikia.com/index.php?title=Community_Central:Advertising_on_Wikia&oldid=120627|title=Advertising on Wikia|date=2008-01-08|accessdate=2010-02-09}}</ref>

==Controversy==
===Advertising and use of free content===
Wikia has sometimes expanded by acquiring an existing wiki's domain name, user lists, and databases, from a founder or co-founder in return for money and [[stock option]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=GuildWiki: Wikia Move|url=http://guildwars.wikia.com/wiki/GuildWiki:Wikia_Move|work=GuildWiki|accessdate=2007-10-20}}</ref> The original wiki is then shut down without consulting its editors or wider community, and the domain redirected to Wikia's version of the project. In at least two cases<ref group="nb">The acquisition of [[uncyclopedia]].org from Jonathan Huang in July 2006 and gamewikis.org from Phil Nelson in October 2007</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/forum:Announcement:_Wikia_%26_Uncyclopedia|title=Announcement: Wikia & Uncyclopedia|work=[[Uncyclopedia]]|date=2006-07-10}}</ref> the content was under a non-commercial license, raising the question of whether the wikis could legitimately be sold to Wikia for commercial use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/09/15/0327236|title=How to Stop Commerial Use of Copyleft Materials?|publisher=Slashdot|date=2007-09-15}}</ref> In 2009, Wikia added an extension where users could create magazines of content pages, through partner [[MagCloud]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:KyleH/Introducing:_Magazine_Creator|title=Introducing: Magazine Creator|date=2009-10-14|accessdate=2010-02-09}}</ref> however, this was not disabled on wikis with a "Noncommercial" clause on their license, which would break the license.

Once on Wikia, wiki communities have complained of inappropriate advertisements, or advertising in the body text area.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/sep/25/wikipedia.internet|title=Read me first: Wikipedia isn't about human potential, whatever Wales says|author=Finkelstein, Seth|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=2008-09-25 | location=London}}</ref> There is no easy way for individual communities to switch to conventional paid hosting, as Wikia usually owns the relevant domain names. If a community leaves Wikia for new hosting, the company typically continues to operate the abandoned wiki using its original name and content, adversely affecting the new wiki's [[search engine|search]] rankings.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/jul/31/wikipedia|title=How will Wikia cope when the workers all quit the plantation?|author=Finkelstein, Seth|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=2008-07-31 | location=London}}</ref>

===Wikia and the Wikimedia Foundation===
Wikia has been accused of unduly profiting from a perceived association with [[Wikipedia]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Although Wikia has been referred to in the media as "the commercial counterpart to the non-profit Wikipedia",<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUST34811320070309 |title=Wikipedia founder says to challenge Google, Yahoo|date=2007-03-09|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6171399.stm |title=Community websites take wiki path|date=2006-12-12|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref> Wikimedia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Press_releases/Wikia,_Inc._is_not_the_commercial_counterpart_to_Wikipedia_or_the_Wikimedia_Foundation |title=Wikia, Inc. is not the commercial counterpart to Wikipedia or the Wikimedia Foundation |accessdate=2008-02-26|publisher=[[Wikimedia Foundation]]}}</ref> and Wikia staff<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.wikia.com/wiki/Help:Wikimedia|title=Wikimedia|accessdate=2010-02-09|publisher=Wikia, Inc.}}</ref> call this description inaccurate.

In 2006, the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] shared [[colocation centre|hosting and bandwidth]] costs with Wikia, and received some donated office space from Wikia during the [[fiscal year]] ending June 30, 2006. At the end of fiscal year 2007, Wikia owed the Foundation [[United States dollar|US$]]6,000. As of June 2007, two members of the Foundation's [[Board of directors|Board of Directors]] also served as employees, officers, or directors of Wikia.<ref>[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/4/49/Wikimedia_2007_fs.pdf Wikimedia Foundation 2006-2007 Audit] page 9 says "The Organization shared hosting and bandwidth costs with Wikia, Inc., a for-profit company founded by the same founder as Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.

The Organization received some donated office space from Wikia Inc. during the year ended June 30, 2006 valued at $6,000. No donation of the office space occurred in 2007. Through June 30, 2007, two members of the Organization’s board of directors also serve as employees, officers, or directors of Wikia, Inc."</ref> In January 2009, Wikia subleased two conference rooms to the Wikimedia Foundation for the [[m:Wikipedia Usability Initiative|Wikipedia Usability Initiative]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.wikimedia.org/2009/01/21/a-note-on-the-wikipedia-usability-initiative/ |title=A note on the Wikipedia Usability Initiative |publisher=Blog.wikimedia.org |date=2009-01-21 |accessdate=2009-07-17}}</ref> According to a 2009 email by Erik Möller, deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, [[bid averaging]] was used "as a way to arrive at a fair market rate".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2009-January/049360.html |title=Foundation-l: Wikia leasing office space to WMF |publisher=Lists.wikimedia.org |date=2009-01-23 |accessdate=2009-07-17}}</ref>

[[File:RedDeadWiki.png|thumb|right|An article as seen with Wikia's new skin.]]
Wikia has merged separately founded wikis, such as [[Uncyclopedia]], to [[subdomain]]s of ''wikia.com'' against contributors' wishes, citing a need to boost its attractiveness to advertisers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Forum:Uncyclopedia_domain_name|title=Forum:Uncyclopedia domain name|work=[[Uncyclopedia]]| format=Wiki |accessdate=2008-12-06}}</ref> The company intended to merge Memory Alpha, WoWWiki, and Zelda Wiki in a similar fashion;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wowwiki.com/WoWWiki:Domain_name|title=WoWWiki:Domain name|work=WoWWiki|format=Wiki|accessdate=2008-12-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/Forum:Domain_name_change|title=Forum:Domain name change|work=Memory Alpha|format=Wiki|accessdate=2009-07-15}}</ref> the proposal was successfully opposed by users of all three sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zeldawiki.org/News_2007|title=News 2007 (Look under 2nd Quarter)|work=ZeldaWiki.org|format=wiki|accessdate=2010-01-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wowwiki.com/WoWWiki_talk:Domain#Proposal_.26_Vote|title=WoWWiki_talk:Domain, Proposal & Vote section|work=WoWWiki.com|format=Wiki|accessdate=2009-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory-alpha.org/index.php?title=Forum%3AWikia_now_owns_memory-alpha.org&diff=935325&oldid=935131|title=Forum:Wikia now owns memory-alpha.org|work=Memory Alpha|format=Wiki|date=2009-02-27|accessdate=2009-07-15}}</ref> Zelda Wiki is still an independent wiki, while [[WoWWiki]] and Memory Alpha were merged but allowed to keep their domain names.

In June 2008, Wikia adopted a new skin, ''Monaco'', intending to implement it as the default on almost all hosted wikis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.wikia.com/wiki/Wikia%27s_New_Style|title=Wikia's New Style|author=Wikia, Inc.|date=2008-06-17|accessdate=2009-06-20}}</ref> The skin had an uneven reception, with issues over the prominent branding, in-content format-altering ads, and the mandatory nature of the change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.wikia.com/wiki/Forum:Wikia%27s_New_Style/Archive_1|title=Forum:Wikia's New Style - Archive 1|accessdate=2009-06-20}}</ref> Many wiki users felt the choice of skin default should remain their own. The switch went ahead, but some wikis retained ''Monobook'' as their default.  In September 2008, the Transformers Wikia moved their content to their own server, citing the format-altering ads and mandatory changes as reasons for their departure.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/jul/31/wikipedia "How will Wikia cope when the workers all quit the plantation?"] @ guardian.co.uk</ref><ref>[http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Press_Release:_Teletraan-1_Wikia_moves_to_TFWiki.net "Teletraan-1 Wikia moves to TFWiki.net" press release]</ref>

In May 2009, Wikia removed the ability of individual users to choose a skin other than ''Monaco'' or ''Monobook'', claiming a testing burden and relative lack of features. Soon after, Wikia removed the option to set the default skin to ''Monobook'', with an exemption of certain large wikis, namely, Uncyclopedia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.wikia.com/wiki/Forum:Changes_to_skin_preferences|title=Forum:Changes to skin preferences|date=2009-05-19|accessdate=2010-02-09}}</ref>

In August 2010, Wikia announced a new mandatory skin change, this time to a new look nicknamed "Oasis".<ref name="WikiaBlog1">{{cite web|url=http://community.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Sannse/Your_First_Look_at_the_New_Wikia|title=Your First Look at the New Wikia|work=Wikia|accessdate=5 September 2010}}</ref> The new skin omitted some features, such as the popular shoutbox.<ref name="WikiaNewSkinFAQ">{{cite web|url=http://community.wikia.com/wiki/Wikia%E2%80%99s_new_look_-_FAQ#What_features_are_being_phased_out_completely_with_the_new_skin.3F|title=Wikia’s new look - FAQ|work=Wikia|accessdate=5 September 2010}}</ref> On September 23, 2010, Wikia introduced the new skin in public beta with the option to be the default skin for certain wikis, like Muppet Wiki.<ref name="wikiapublicbeta">{{cite web|url=http://community.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Susan_Taylor/Experience_the_new_Wikia|title=Experience the new Wikia|work=Wikia|accessdate=23 September 2010}}</ref> Wikia also revealed the official name of the new skin, ''Wikia''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.wikia.com/wiki/The_new_look_2|title=The new look 2|date=2010-09-23|accessdate=2010-09-23}}</ref> The ''Wikia'' skin became the default skin on Wikia on November 3, 2010.
