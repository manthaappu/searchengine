<html> <head> <title>Mathematical puzzle</title></head><body>'''Mathematical puzzles''' make up an integral part of [[recreational mathematics]]. They have specific rules as do [[multiplayer game]]s, but they do not usually involve competition between two or more players. Instead, to solve such a [[puzzle]], the solver must find a solution that satisfies the given conditions. Mathematical puzzles require mathematics to solve them. [[Logic puzzle]]s are a common type of mathematical puzzle.

[[Conway's Game of Life]] and [[fractals]], as two examples, may also be considered mathematical puzzles even though the solver interacts with them only at the beginning by providing a set of initial conditions. After these conditions are set, the rules of the puzzle determine all subsequent changes and moves.
