The '''Xbox 360''' is the second [[video game console]] produced by [[Microsoft]], and the successor to the [[Xbox]]. The Xbox 360 competes with [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii]] as part of the [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh generation]] of video game consoles. As of January 2011, there are over 50 million Xbox 360 consoles worldwide.<ref name=Worldwidesales/> 

The Xbox 360 was officially unveiled on [[MTV]] on May 12, 2005, with detailed launch and game information divulged later that month at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3). The console sold out completely upon [[Xbox 360 launch|release]] in all regions except in [[Japan]].<ref name="Shortages spoil Xbox 360 launch">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4462744.stm|title=Shortages spoil Xbox 360 launch | work=BBC News | date=2005-11-23 | accessdate=2009-12-31}}</ref><ref name="Xbox 360 Launch Takes Europe by Storm">{{cite web|url=http://www.xbox365.com/news.cgi?id=GGPPLLiddi12060836|title= Xbox 360 Launch Takes Europe by Storm}}</ref><ref name="Retailers Sell Out of Initial Xbox 360 Shipments">{{cite web|url= http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/21759/ |title=Retailers Sell Out of Initial Xbox 360 Shipments|accessdate= 2008–10–14}}</ref> 

Some major features of the Xbox 360 are its integrated [[Xbox Live]] service that allows players to [[online game|compete online]], download arcade games, game demos, trailers, TV shows, music and movies and its [[Windows Media Center]] multimedia capabilities. The Xbox 360 also offers region specific access to third-party media streaming services such as [[Netflix]] and [[ESPN]] in the US or [[Sky Player]] in the UK.

Although available at launch in other regions, it was not available in Japan until November 2, 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/09/07/microsoft-to-launch-xbox-360-core-in-japan/ |title=Microsoft to launch Xbox 360 Core in Japan |accessdate=2008-07-26 |last=Kietzmann |first=Ludwig |date=2006-09-07 |publisher=Weblogs, Inc.}}</ref> The ''Core'' system came bundled with [[composite video]] cables, capable of only [[Standard-definition television|SDTV]] resolutions. It was however capable of the same [[High-definition television|HDTV]] resolutions (up to [[1080i]]) as the other models when connected to a separately sold Component cable.

It may also utilize a separately sold Xbox 360 hard drive. Unlike all other SKUs, it shipped with a wired version of the Xbox 360 controller, instead of the wireless version found in other SKUs.

This model also included a detachable Hard Disk Drive (initially 20 GB, while later models had 60 GB) to store downloaded content, provide compatibility with [[Xbox|original Xbox]] games, and store game data.

===Special editions===
[[File:Xbox 360 Halo 3 Special Edition.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Halo 3]]'' Special Edition]]
On a few occasions, Microsoft has produced [[special edition]]s of the console, usually to coincide with the release of a major product. These special editions are typically custom-colored Xbox 360 models, and are produced in limited numbers.

===Xbox 360 Launch Team Edition===
[[Image:specialeditionlaunchteamconsolexbox360.jpg|thumb|upright|The Launch Team Console with controller]]
A white console with green accents was released in 2005 only to the Launch Team as a gift from [[Microsoft]]. The consoles came complete with a 20 GB HDD also in green to match the top and bottom sections that are typically grey in color. The HDD plate was also personalized and engraved with the team member's [[gamertag]]. Few examples have been seen with simply the console release date November 22, 2005 engraved on the HDD plate. The consoles came with a limited issue controller to accompany the console. The difference with the controller again is the grey part on the controller is replaced with a green molded plastic, not painted contrary to popular belief, to match the console. Each console came with a plain white faceplate. However as an additional gift, each team member was given an additional packaged faceplate with one of a kind art with the caption "I Made This" on the USB door of the faceplate. Very few examples have been sold off from original team member's collection. [[Larry Hyrb]], better known as "Major Nelson", is known to own one which he displays pictures of on his website having been a member of the Launch Team. The special edition Launch Team console, hard drive, controller and the special faceplate were never sold in stores or meant for the general public. It is unknown as of now how many of these very rare consoles exist today.

===Holiday bundles===

Kinect is a "controller-free gaming and entertainment experience" for the Xbox 360. It was first announced on June 1, 2009 at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]], under the codename, ''Project Natal''. The add-on [[peripheral]] enables users to control and interact with the Xbox 360 without a [[game controller]] by using gestures, [[speech recognition|spoken commands]] and presented objects and images. The Kinect accessory is compatible with all Xbox 360 models,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wireninja.com/xbox-360-fat-slim-comparison/ |title=Xbox 360 Fat & Slim Comparison |publisher=Wireninja.com |date=2010-06-21 |accessdate=2010-11-11}}</ref> connecting to new models via a custom connector, and to older ones via a USB and mains power adapter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5520812/project-natal--its-instruction-manual-in-the-wild|title=Project Natal & Its Instruction Manual(!)

==Software==
===Dashboard===
{{See also|Xbox 360 System Software}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Achievmentsymbol.png|100px|thumb|Symbol used for notifications]] -->
The Xbox 360's original [[graphical user interface]] was the ''Xbox 360 Dashboard''; a [[Tab (GUI)|tabbed interface]] that featured five "Blades" (formerly four blades), and was designed by [[AKQA]] and [[Audiobrain]]. It could be launched automatically when the console [[booting|booted]] without a disc in it, or when the disc tray was ejected, but the user had the option to select what the console does if a game is in the tray on start up, or if inserted when already on. A simplified version of it was also accessible at any time via the Xbox Guide button on the gamepad. This simplified version showed the user's gamercard, Xbox Live messages and friends list. It also allowed for personal and music settings, in addition to voice or video chats, or returning to the Xbox Dashboard from the game.

On November 19, 2008, the Xbox 360's dashboard was changed from the "Blade" interface, to a dashboard reminiscent of that present on the Zune and Windows Media Center, known as the "New Xbox Experience" or NXE.

Since the console's release, Microsoft has released several updates for the Dashboard software. These updates have included adding new features to the console, enhancing Xbox Live functionality and multimedia playback capabilities, adding compatibility for new accessories, and fixing bugs in the software. The latest Dashboard update was made available on November 1, 2010. The update includes a specialized menu layout optimized for motion navigation as well as a significant visual refresh for the standard controller-navigated menus to match the style of the "Metro" interface used in Zune HD and [[Windows Phone 7]]. The update is compulsory; access to [[Xbox Live]] is disabled until the update is performed.

===New Xbox Experience===
{{further|[[New Xbox Experience|Xbox Live, section "New Xbox Experience"]]}}
At E3 2008, at Microsoft's Show, Microsoft's Aaron Greenberg and Marc Whitten announced the new Xbox 360 interface called the "New Xbox Experience" (NXE). The update was intended to ease console menu navigation. Its GUI uses the Twist UI, previously used in [[Windows Media Center]] and the [[Zune]]. Its new Xbox Guide retains all Dashboard functionality (including the Marketplace browser and disk ejection) and the original "Blade" interface.

The NXE also provides many new features. Users can now install games from disc to the hard drive to play them with reduced load time and less disc drive noise, but each game's disc must remain in the system in order to run. A new, built-in Community system allows the creation of digitized [[Avatar (Xbox 360)|Avatars]] that can be used for multiple activities, such as sharing photos or playing [[Xbox Live Arcade|Arcade]] games like ''[[1 vs 100 (Xbox 360)|1 vs. 100]]''. The update was released on November 19, 2008.<ref name=xbox2>{{cite web|url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/new-xbox-experience-dated|title= New Xbox Experience |date= October 9, 2008 |author=Tom Bramwell |publisher= Eurogamer|accessdate=2008-10-14}}</ref>

While previous system updates have been stored on internal memory, the NXE was the first to require a storage device—at least a 128 MB memory card or a [[hard disk drive|hard drive]].

===Multimedia===
The Xbox 360 supports videos in [[Windows Media Video]] (WMV) format (including [[High-definition television|high-definition]] and [[Microsoft PlaysForSure|PlaysForSure]] videos), as well as [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] and [[MPEG-4]] media. The December 2007 dashboard update added support for the playback of [[MPEG-4 Part 2|MPEG-4 ASP]] format videos.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/personality/elle/20071130-systemupdate.htm| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071202193403/http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/personality/elle/20071130-systemupdate.htm| archivedate=2007-12-02| title=Xbox 360 System Software - Fall  Update Summary| date=2007-11-30| publisher=Microsoft| accessdate=2008-07-26}}</ref> The console can also [[Avatar (computing)|display picture]]s and perform slideshows of photo collections with various transition effects, and supports audio playback, with [[Digital audio player|music player]] controls accessible through the Xbox 360 Guide button. Users may play back their own music while playing games or using the dashboard, and can play music with an interactive visual synthesizer.

Music, photos and videos can be played from standard USB [[Data storage device|mass storage devices]], Xbox 360 proprietary [[Data storage device|storage device]]s (such as memory cards or Xbox 360 hard drives), and servers or computers with [[Windows Media Center]] or [[Windows XP]] with [[Service pack|Service Pack]] 2 or higher within the local-area network in streaming mode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/pcsetup/MCEVista.htm| title=Enjoy Windows Media Center on your Xbox 360| publisher=Microsoft| accessdate=2008-01-01 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071223104154/http://www.xbox.com/en-US/pcsetup/MCEVista.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-12-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/networking/getstarted/windowsconnectnow.mspx| title=Windows Connect Now Technology| publisher=Microsoft|date=2004-12-21| accessdate=2008-07-26}}</ref> As the Xbox 360 uses a modified version of the [[Universal Plug and Play|UPnP]] AV protocol,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gxben.wordpress.com/2008/08/24/why-do-i-hate-dlna-protocol-so-much/|title=Why do I hate DLNA protocol so much ? « Ben’s Lost World - Diary of a GeeXboX developer|accessdate=2008-11-24}}</ref> some alternative UPnP servers such as uShare (part of the [[GeeXboX]] project) and [[MythTV]] can also stream media to the Xbox 360, allowing for similar functionality from non-Windows servers.

When the Xbox 360 was released, Microsoft's online gaming service Xbox Live was shut down for 24 hours and underwent a major upgrade, adding a basic non-subscription service called Xbox Live Silver (later renamed Xbox Live Free) to its already established premium subscription-based service (which was renamed Gold). Xbox Live Free is included with all [[Stock-keeping unit|SKU]]s of the console. It allows users to create a user profile, join on [[Internet forum|message boards]], and access Microsoft's [[Xbox Live Arcade]] and Marketplace and talk to other members.<ref name="XboxLiveFree" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xbox.com/NR/exeres/F925FE0C-E310-491A-82E0-7A604A353BFB.htm |title=Xbox Live The Silver Age |accessdate=2006-09-30 |last=Barker |first=Ben |date=2005-09-19  |publisher=Microsoft }}{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref> A Live Free account does not generally support multiplayer gaming; however, some games that have rather limited online functions already, (such as ''[[Viva Piñata]]'') or games that feature their own subscription service (e.g. [[EA Sports]] games) can be played with a Free account. Xbox Live also supports voice and video communication, the latter a feature possible with the [[Xbox Live Vision]]; an add-on USB web camera designed specifically for the Xbox 360.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xbox.com/en-AU/hardware/xbox360/morethangames.htm |title=More than Games |accessdate=2006-09-30 |last=Gettys |first=Jim W. |date=2005-09-17 |publisher=Microsoft |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060908092939/http://www.xbox.com/en-AU/hardware/xbox360/morethangames.htm |archivedate = September 8, 2006 |quote= }}</ref>

==Technical problems==

[[File:Xbox360-ringofdeath.jpg|thumb|Three red lights on the Xbox 360's ring indicator representing a "General Error" requiring service of the Console or Power Adapter, nicknamed the "Red Ring of Death", "Red Ring of Fire" or "Red Lights of Death."]]

The Xbox 360 has been subject to a number of technical problems. Since the console's release in 2005, users have reported concerns over its reliability and [[failure rate]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_6270000/newsid_6277700/6277716.stm|title=Microsoft admit Xbox problems|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-02-13 | date=2007-07-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/rings-of-red|title=Rings of Red|publisher=GamesIndustry.biz|accessdate=2008-07-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3160603|title= A Tale of 11 Broken Xbox 360s|accessdate= 2008-07-26|author= Philip Kollar|date= 2007-06-26|publisher= Ziff Davis Publishing Holdings Inc}}</ref>

To aid customers with defective consoles, Microsoft extended the Xbox 360's manufacturer's warranty to three years for hardware failure problems that generate a "General Hardware Failure" error report. A "General Hardware Failure" is recognized on all models released before the Xbox 360 S by three quadrants of the ring around the power button flashing red. This error is often known as the "[[Red Ring of Death]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/xbox360/hardware/warranty/warrantyupdate/WarrantyUpdate.aspx|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070605083902/http://www.xbox.com/en-US/support/systemuse/xbox360/resources/warrantyupdate.htm|archivedate=2007-06-05|title=Xbox 360 Warranty Coverage Expanded|accessdate= 2008-07-26|author=Microsoft|date= 2007-06-05}}</ref> In April 2009 the warranty was extended to also cover failures related to the E74 [[error code]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://majornelson.com/archive/2009/04/14/xbox-360-warranty-extended-for-e74.aspx|title=Xbox 360 Warranty extended for E74|publisher=majornelson.com|accessdate=2009-04-17}}</ref> The warranty extension is not granted for any other types of failures that do not generate these specific error codes.

Since these problems surfaced, Microsoft has attempted to modify the console to improve its reliability. Modifications include a reduction in the number, size, and placement of components, the addition of dabs of epoxy on the corners and edges of the CPU and GPU as glue to prevent movement relative to the board during heat expansion,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.llamma.com/xbox360/news/inside_the_xbox_360_elite.htm|title=Inside the Xbox 360 Elite|publisher=The Llamma's Adventures|date=2007-04-19|accessdate=2008-07-26}}</ref> and a second GPU heatsink to dissipate more heat.<ref name="repaired_hardware">{{cite web|url= http://www.xbox-scene.com/xbox1data/sep/EElEZukFEleqkRrcnN.php|title= New Pictures of 2nd GPU HeatSink on Xbox 360|accessdate= 2008-07-26|author= XanTium |date= 2007-06-13|publisher= Xbox-Scene}}</ref> With the release of the redesigned Xbox 360 S, the warranty for the newer models do not include the three-year extended coverage for "General Hardware Failures".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://support.xbox.com/en-us/pages/xbox-360/troubleshoot/warranty/xbox-360-new-warranty.aspx |title=Product Warranty and Software License: New Xbox 360 Console |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2011-01-10 |quote="Warranty Period" for Xbox 360 S, means 1 year from the date You purchased the Xbox 360 S from an authorized retailer}}{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref>The Xbox 360 S model indicates hardware failures by the console's power indicator light displaying a red dot, which replaces the red ring indicator on older models.<ref>{{cite web|last=Plunkett|first=Luke|title=The New Xbox 360 Won't "Red Ring"|url=http://kotaku.com/5566600/the-new-xbox-360-wont-red-ring|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=1 November 2010}}</ref>
