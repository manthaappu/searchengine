==Biography==
Goossens began his career in the magazine ''[[Pionniers]]''. After a short spell at ''[[Pilote]]'', he began contributing to the monthly magazine ''[[Fluide Glacial]]'' in 1977, and became one of its authors.  Later, his work also appeared in ''[[Le Petit Psikopat Illustré]]'' (ancestor of current ''[[Psikopat]]'') and ''[[Rigolo]]''.

Apart from his work with comic strips, Daniel Goossens is a lecturer and researcher in artificial intelligence at the [[University of Paris VIII]].

Goossens was awarded the [[Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoulême]] in 1997.

==Style==
Goossens's comics are built on a clash between semi-realistic art and surreal content. He relishes in regurgitating clichéd situations from literature, film and television, and introducing odd twists. (His classic ''Route vers l'enfer'' book is a war film pastiche starring Father Christmas). Particular attention is paid to dialogues, which often drag on past all logic, and include much stuttering, mumbling and other noises rendered phonetically. Most of his comic books are collections of short stories, with a loose common thread. Like his mentor [[Gotlib]], Goossens has also often used a mock-encyclopedic tone. Some of his works contain astonishing and disturbing scenes, such as a gang of children stoning Father Christmas, or a woman bringing her baby's skeleton to the doctor.
