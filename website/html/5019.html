The CCT Mark is based upon framework where vendors can make claims about the security attributes of their products and/or services, and independent testing laboratories can ''evaluate'' the products/services to determine if they actually meet the claims. In other words, the CCT Mark provides quality assurance approach to validate whether the implementation of a computer security product or services has been performed in an appropriate manner.

== History ==

The CCT Mark was developed under the auspices of the UK Government's '''Central Sponsor for Information Assurance'''<ref>[http://www.csia.gov.uk Central Sponsor for Information Assurance (CSIA)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (CSIA), which is part of the [[Cabinet Office|Cabinet Office's]] Intelligence, Security and Resilience (ISR) function.  The role of providing specialist input to the CCT Mark fell to [[GCHQ|CESG]] as the UK National Technical Authority (NTA) for Information Security, who assumed responsibility for the scheme as a whole on 7 April 2008.

== Operation ==

All Testing Laboratories must comply with [[ISO 17025]], with the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) carrying out the accreditation.

== Comparisons ==

The CCT Mark is often compared to the international [[Common Criteria]] (CC), which is simultaneously both correct and incorrect:

*Both provide methods for achieving a measure of assurance of computer security products and systems
*Neither can provide a guarantee that approval means that no exploitable flaws exist, but rather reduce the likelihood of such flaw being present 
*The Common Criteria is constructured in a layered manner, with multiple [[Evaluation Assurance Level]] (EAL) specifications being available with increasing complexity, timescale and costs as the EAL number rises
*Common Criteria is supported by a Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA), which, at the lower EAL numbers at least, means that products tested in one country will normally be accepted in other markets
*The CCT Mark is aimed at the same market as the lower CC EAL numbers (currently EAL1/2), and has been specifically designed for timescale and cost efficiency

== Future ==

As of September 2010, CESG have announced that the product assurance element of CCT Mark will be overtaken by the new [[Commercial Product Assurance]] (CPA) approach.  It is unclear as yet whether CCT Mark will remain in existence for assurance of [[Information Security]] services.
