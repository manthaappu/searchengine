In computer [[command-line interface]]s, a '''command-line argument''' is an [[Parameter (computer science)|argument]] sent to a program being called. In general, a program can take any number of command-line arguments, which may be necessary for the program to run, or may even be ignored, depending on the function of that program.

For example, in [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] environments, an example of a command-line argument is:

<source lang="bash">
rm file.s
</source>

"file.s" is a command-line argument which tells the program [[rm (Unix)|rm]] to remove the file "file.s".

Programming languages such as [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] allow a program to interpret the command-line arguments by handling them as string parameters in the [[Main function (programming)|main function]].

==Command-line switch==

A '''command line option''' or simply '''option''' (also known as a '''command line parameter''', '''flag''', or a '''switch''') is an indication by a user that a [[computer program]] should change its default output.

For example, in the [[OpenVMS]] [[operating system]], the [[command (computing)|command]] <tt>directory</tt> is used to list the [[computer file|file]]s inside a [[directory (file systems)|directory]].  By default&mdash;that is, when the user simply types <tt>directory</tt>&mdash;it will list only the names of the files.  By adding the ''option'' <tt>/owner</tt> (to form the command <tt>directory/owner</tt>), the user can instruct the <tt>directory</tt> command to also display the ownership of the files.

The format of switches varies widely between operating systems. 

===In OpenVMS===
Under the [[OpenVMS]] operating system, options (traditionally: switches) are entered in the form <tt>command/option_1/option_2/option_3=value</tt> ''etc.''  The form <tt>/option=value</tt> is used to provide an [[Parameter|argument]] to the option; for example, <tt>/user=john</tt> might specify that only files owned by the user "john" should be displayed.

===In Cisco IOS===
<tt>IP ADDRESS 123.232.232.222 255.255.0.0</tt>

The <tt>123.232.232.222</tt> and <tt>255.255.0.0</tt> parts are arguments.

===In UNIX and Linux===
In traditional UNIX, options typically consist of a single letter introduced by <tt>-</tt> and possibly followed by an argument.

This turned out to be a limiting factor in complex programs requiring many options, so in GNU software the concept of long options was added. Long options are introduced via <tt>--</tt>, and are typically whole words. For example, <tt>ls --long --classify --all</tt>.  Arguments to long options are provided with <tt>=</tt>, as <tt>ls --block-size=1024</tt>, or as a separate argument as <tt>ls --block-size 1024</tt>.  Some Unix programs use long options with single dashes, for example [[MPlayer]] as in <tt>mplayer -nosound</tt>.

GNU/Linux also uses <tt>--</tt> to terminate option lists. For example, an attempt to delete a file called <tt>-file1<tt> by using <code>[[Rm (Unix)|rm]] -file1</code> may produce an error, since <code>rm</code> may interpret <code>-file1</code> as a command line switch. Using <code>rm -- -file1</code> removes ambiguity.

Also note that some Linux command line options use no parameter prefix dashes at all, e.g. [[yum]].

===In MS-DOS===
[[MS-DOS]] and related operating systems typically use single-letter switches, for example <tt>[[dir (command)|dir]] /w /p /a:s</tt>.  In this case, the <tt>:</tt> character serves the same purpose as <tt>=</tt> above.

Traditionally, MS-DOS is similar to the [[Unix]] operating system; switches are single letters or digits, and introduced via a <tt>-</tt> (hyphen); ''e.g.'' <tt>ls -F -a -1</tt>. When options are given in this form (a dash and then a letter or word), they are more often called ''flags'' - as in '''compiler flags'''. Multiple flags may be combined into one, so the previous command could be rewritten <tt>ls -Fa1</tt>.  However, with the increasingly widespread use of software from the [[GNU Project]], particularly in the [[Linux]] operating system, GNU's '''long options''' are also widely used.
