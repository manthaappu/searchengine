A '''multimap''' (sometimes also '''multihash''') is a generalization of a [[associative array|map or associative array]] [[abstract data type]] in which more than one value may be associated with and returned for a given key. Both map and multimap are particular cases of [[container (data structure)|container]]s (see for example [[C++]] [[Standard Template Library]] [[Standard Template Library#Containers|containers]]). Often the multimap is implemented as a map with [[List (computing)|list]]s or [[Set (computer science)|set]]s as the map values.

==Examples==
* In a student enrollment system, where students may be enrolled in multiple classes simultaneously, there might be an association for each enrollment of a student in a course, where the key is the student ID and the value is the course ID. If a student is enrolled in three courses, there will be three associations containing the same key.
* The index of a book may report any number of references for a given index term, and thus may be coded as a multimap from index terms to any number of reference locations.
* [[Querystring|Querystrings]] may have multiple values associated with a single field. This is commonly generated when a [[web form]] allows multiple [[check box|check boxes]] or selections to be chosen in response to a single form element.

==Language support==
[[C++]]'s [[Standard Template Library]] provides the <code>multimap</code> [[Standard Template Library#Containers|container]] for the sorted multimap using a [[self-balancing binary search tree]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/Multimap.html | title = multimap<Key, Data, Compare, Alloc> | work = Standard Template Library Programmer's Guide | publisher = [[Silicon Graphics International]]}}</ref> and [[Silicon Graphics International|SGI]]'s STL extension provides the <code>hash_multimap</code> container, which implements a multimap using a [[hash table]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/hash_multiset.html | title = hash_multiset<Key, HashFcn, EqualKey, Alloc> | work = Standard Template Library Programmer's Guide | publisher = [[Silicon Graphics International]]}}</ref>

[[Apache Commons]] Collections provides a MultiMap interface for [[Java (programming language)|Java]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://commons.apache.org/collections/api-release/org/apache/commons/collections/MultiMap.html | title = Interface MultiMap | work = Commons Collections 3.2.1 API, [[Apache Commons]]}}</ref> It also provides a MultiValueMap implementing class that makes a MultiMap out of a Map object and a type of Collection.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://commons.apache.org/collections/api-release/org/apache/commons/collections/map/MultiValueMap.html | title = Class MultiValueMap | work = Commons Collections 3.2.1 API, [[Apache Commons]]}}</ref>

Google Collections also provides an interface Multimap and implementations.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://google-collections.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javadoc/com/google/common/collect/Multimap.html | title = Interface Multimap<K,V> | work = Google Collections Library 1.0}}</ref>
