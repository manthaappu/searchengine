<html> <head> <title>CVSS</title></head><body>'''Common Vulnerability Scoring System''' ('''CVSS''') is an [[Technical standard|industry standard]] for assessing the severity of [[computer security|computer system security]] [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]].  It attempts to establish a measure of how much concern a vulnerability warrants, compared to other vulnerabilities, so efforts can be prioritized.  The score is based on a series of measurements (called [[Software metric|metrics]]) based on expert assessment.

==Metrics==

The CVSS assessment measures three areas of concern: 
#Base Metrics for qualities intrinsic to a vulnerability.
#Temporal Metrics for characteristics that evolve over the lifetime of vulnerability.
#Environmental Metrics for characteristics of a vulnerability that depend on a particular implementation or environment.

===Base Metrics===

#Is the vulnerability exploitable remotely (as opposed to only locally).
#How complex must an [[attack (computer)|attack]] be to exploit the vulnerability?
#Is authentication required to attack?
#Does the vulnerability expose confidential data?
#Can attacking the vulnerability damage the integrity of the system?
#Does it impact availability of the system?

===Temporal Metrics===

#How complex (or how long will it take) to exploit the vulnerability.
#How hard (or how long) will it take to remediate the vulnerability.
#How certain is the vulnerability's existence.

===Environmental Metrics===

#Potential to cause [[collateral damage]].
#How many systems (or how much of a system) does the vulnerability impact.
#Security Requirement(CIA)
