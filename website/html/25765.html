'''Nanotomography''', much like its related modalities [[tomography]] and [[microtomography]], uses [[x-ray]]s to create cross-sections from a 3D-object that later can be used to recreate a virtual model without destroying the original model. The term nano is used to indicate that the pixel sizes of the cross-sections are in the nanometer range

Although a lot of research is done to create nano-CT scanners, currently there are only a few available commercially. The SkyScan-2011 [http://www.skyscan.be] has a range of about 150 to 250 nanometers per pixel with a resolution of 400 nm and a [[field of view]] (FOV) of 200 micrometers.  The Xradia nanoXCT [http://www.xradia.com] has a spatial resolution of better than 50 nm and a FOV of 16 micrometers<ref>Tkachuk et. al., 2007, pp. 650-655</ref>.

At the Ghent University, the UGCT team developed a nano-CT scanner based on commercially available components. The UGCT facility is an open nano-CT facility giving access to scientists from universities, institutes and industry. More information can be found at [http://www.ugct.ugent.be UGCT-website].
