The '''PUMA''' ('''''P'''rogrammable '''U'''niversal '''M'''achine for '''A'''ssembly'', or '''''P'''rogrammable '''U'''niversal '''M'''anipulation '''A'''rm'') is an industrial robot arm developed by [[Victor Scheinman]] at pioneering [[robot]] company [[Unimation]]. Initially developed for [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], the PUMA was based on earlier designs Scheinman invented while at [[Stanford University]].

Unimation produced PUMAs for years until being purchased by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] (ca. 1980), and later by Swiss company [[Stäubli]] (1988). [[Nokia]] Robotics manufactured about 1500 PUMA robots during the 1980s, the Puma-650 being their most popular model with customers. Nokia sold their Robotics division in 1990.

In 2002, General Motors Controls, Robotics and Welding (CRW) organization donated the original prototype PUMA robot to the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History.  It joins a distinguished collection of historically important robots that includes an early [[Unimate]] and the Odetics Odex 1.[http://www.roboticsonline.com/public/articles/details.cfm?id=729]
