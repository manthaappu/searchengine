<html> <head> <title>Malcon</title></head><body>'''MALCON''' is an annual information security conference focusing exclusively on [[malware]].  It aims in bringing together Malware and Information Security Researchers from across the globe to share key research insights into building and containment of the next generation malwares. Unlike most hacker conventions, MALCON is opposed to the much debated ‘[[Zero-day attack|zero day]]’ and ‘[[full disclosure]]’. The first MalCon conference took place in December 2010 at Mumbai and Pune, India.

Many of the attendees at MALCON include security professionals, Government employees, lawyers, researchers, journalists and [[Hacker (computing)|hackers]] with interest in malwares and its global impact on economy. The event promotes “[[proactive]]” research in malware coding and openly invites malcoders to come forward and demonstrate their creation.

== History ==
MalCon was founded in 2010 by Rajshekhar Murthy,<ref name="ThreatpostConference">{{cite web |url= http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/new-conference-wants-bring-malware-writers-out-shadows-082510 |title= New Conference Wants to Bring Malware Writers Out of the Shadows |author= Paul Roberts |date= August 25, 2010 |work= [[Kaspersky Lab]] Security News Service |accessdate= December 26, 2010 }}</ref><ref name="TechgossExploit">{{cite web |url= http://www.techgoss.com/Story/141S11-Terrorists-exploit-Mumbai-net-security.aspx |title= Terrorists exploit Mumbai net security |author= Pulkit Sharma |date= August 25, 2008 |work= Techgoss |accessdate= December 26, 2010 }}</ref><ref name="MidDayYoungest">{{cite web |url= http://www.mid-day.com/news/2009/mar/100309-News-Mumbai-youngest-ethical-hacker-computer-programmer-Wiz-kid-IT-firm-Hackers.htm |title= India's youngest ethical hacker |author= Vinod Kumar Menon |date= March 10, 2009 |work= [[MiD DAY]] |accessdate= December 26, 2010 }}</ref>  known as '''thebluegenius''',<ref name="PacketStormBluegenius">{{cite web |url= http://packetstormsecurity.org/files/author/7857/ |title= Files from thebluegenius |author= Rajshekhar Murthy |date= February 2010 |work= [[Packet Storm]] |accessdate= December 26, 2010 }}</ref><ref name="BlueGenius">{{cite web |url= http://www.thebluegenius.com |title= Rajshekhar Murthy's Official Blog |work= The Blue Genius |accessdate= M D, Y }}</ref>  is a science graduate and an ex-employee of [[Microsoft|Microsoft Corporation]], currently head of Information Security at an Indian telecommunications firm.  Since the inception of MalCon, it has been widely backed by numerous government organizations such as [[National Technical Research Organisation|NTRO]].<ref name="TechgossMaking">{{cite web |url= http://www.techgoss.com/Story/422S11-What-went-into-making-of-MalCon-.aspx |title= What went into making of Malcon? |author= Sameer and DJ |date= December 14, 2010 |work= Techgoss |accessdate= December 26, 2010 }}</ref>

== Philosophy ==
The event organizers have issued a '''FAQ'''<ref name="MalconFAQ">{{cite web |url= http://malcon.org/web/about/faq/ |title= FAQ |Author= MalCon |work= malcon.org |accessdate= December 26, 2010 }}</ref> that outlines their philosophy for MalCon, where they explain their objective as “Our Aim is to help the Security Industry as well as Software Industry, understand this fine ‘art’ of Malware Development (Which covers even exploits) so that they can build better and secure code, as well as work towards mitigating potential new attack vectors.”

In an interview to kerbsonsecurity,<ref name="KrebsCall">{{cite web |url= http://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/08/malcon-a-call-for-ethical-malcoding/ |title= MalCon: A Call for ‘Ethical Malcoding’ |author= [[Brian Krebs]] |date= August 24, 2010 |work= Krebs On Security |accessdate= December 26, 2010 }}</ref>  he quoted "''While a conference can be done by inviting the best / well known security experts who can share statistics, slides and ‘analysis’ of malwares, it is not of any benefit to the community today except that of awareness. The need of MalCon conference is bridge that ignored gap between security companies and malcoders. They have to get on a common platform and talk to each other. Just like the concept of  ‘ethical hacking’ has helped organizations to see that hackers are not all that bad, it is time to accept that ‘ethical malcoding’ is required to research, identify and mitigate newer malwares in a ‘proactive’ way".''

Rajshekhar Murthy coined new security term “'''ethical malcoding'''” to differentiate between malcoders who work in the background independently or with various security firms for research and those who do it for financial gain; and another term '''"GuuWare"'''<ref name="MalconGuuware">{{cite web |url= http://malcon.org/web/2010/guuware/ |title= GuuWare |date= December 1, 2010 |work= malcon.org |accessdate= December 26, 2010 }}</ref>  to describe software’s that may have similar attributes of a malware but are used for defensive purposes.

== Controversies ==
MalCon approach of openly inviting '''"ethical malcoders"''' gained a lot of International attention<ref name="TechgossMedia">{{cite web |url= http://www.techgoss.com/Story/2640S14-Mumbai-MalCon-gets-media.aspx |title= Mumbai MalCon gets media |author= Sameer |date= August 30, 2010 |work= Techgoss |accessdate= December 26, 2010 }}</ref>  and faced criticism<ref name="PCWorldSamson">{{cite web |url= http://www.pcworld.com/article/204411/malware_convention_not_a_good_idea.html?tk=hp_new |title= Malware Convention -- Not a Good Idea |author= Ted Samson |date= August 30, 2010 |work= [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |accessdate= December 26, 2010 }}</ref>  from notable security sites<ref name="Securitycurve">{{cite web |url= http://www.securitycurve.com/wordpress/archives/2650 |title= Introducing the “Malware Conference for Global Evil (and Mass Effect 2)” |author= Ed Moyle |date= September 2, 2010 |work= SecurityCurve |accessdate= December 26, 2010 }}</ref><ref name="AntivirusrantsLogic">{{cite web |url= http://anti-virus-rants.blogspot.com/2010/09/of-logic-and-malware.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+Anti-virusRants+%28anti-virus+rants%29 |title= Of logic and malware |author= Kurt Wismer |date= September 1, 2010 |work= anti-virus rants |accessdate= December 26, 2010 }}</ref>  and bloggers.<ref name="SunbeltBloggers">{{cite web |url= http://www.sunbeltsoftware.com/About/Security-News/?title=Bloggers-voice-concerns-about-new-malware-convention-19933070 |title= Bloggers voice concerns about new malware convention |author= Security News |date= August 30, 2010 |work= [[Sunbelt Software]] |accessdate= December 26, 2010 }}</ref>  On its part, MalCon on its FAQ<ref name="MalconFAQ"/> maintains that “It is not about rapid analysis but about detection. Technology or not, MalCon conference or not, there are new malwares out there constantly being created. Even if the available handful of security vendors have their own team of researchers for analysis, this is not enough. Active and open participation by ‘ethical malcoders’ will help advance the research and containment capability of our existing methods”

== Event Format ==
The MalCon convention has the following format:

* '''Technical Briefings''': The main content of the submitted [[Call for papers|CFP]], the 2010 MalCon revolved around "Malware creation in under two minutes" theme.<ref name="MalconBriefings">{{cite web |url= http://malcon.org/web/events/technical-briefings/ |title= MalCon 2010 Technical Briefings |date= November 12, 2010 |work= malcon.org |accessdate= December 26, 2010 }}</ref>
