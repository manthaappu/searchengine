== SOCs of the United States government ==

The [[Transportation Security Administration]] in the [[United States]] has implemented Security Operations Centers for most [[airport]]s that have federalized security.  The primary function of TSA Security Operations Centers are to act as a communication hub for security personnel, law enforcement, airport personnel and various other agencies involved in the daily operations of airports.  SOCs are manned 24-hours a day by SOC Watch Officers.  Security Operations Center Watch Officers are trained in all aspects of airport and aviation security and are often required to work abnormal shifts.  SOC Watch Officers also ensure that TSA personnel follow proper protocol in dealing with airport security operations.  The SOC is usually the first to be notified of incidents at airports such as the discovery of prohibited items/contraband, weapons, explosives, hazardous materials as well as incidents regarding flight delays, unruly passengers, injuries, damaged equipment and various other types of potential security threats.  The SOC in turn relays all information pertaining to these incidents to TSA federal security directors, law enforcement and TSA headquarters.
