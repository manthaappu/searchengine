'''History''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|''ἱστορία''}} - ''historia'', meaning "inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation"<ref name=JosephJanda/>) is the study of the human [[past]]. History can also mean the period of time after writing was invented. Scholars who write about history are called [[historian]]s. It is a field of research which uses a [[narrative]] to examine and analyse the sequence of events, and it sometimes attempts to investigate [[objectivity (science)|objectively]] the patterns of [[Causality|cause and effect]] that determine events.<ref name="evans1">{{cite web |url= http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Focus/Whatishistory/evans10.html|title= The Two Faces of E.H.

==Etymology==
[[File:History-Dielman-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|''History'' by [[Frederick Dielman]] (1896)]]
The word ''history'' comes from the [[Proto-Indo-European root|root]] ''*weid-'' "know" or "see".<ref name=JosephJanda>{{Cite book| last =Joseph | first =Brian (Ed.)| last2 =Janda | first2 =Richard (Ed.)| publication-date =30 December 2004| title =The Handbook of Historical Linguistics| publisher =Blackwell Publishing| page =163| isbn =978-1405127479| year =2008| postscript =<!--None-->}}</ref> 

[[Ancient Greek]] {{polytonic|{{LSJ|i(stori/a|ἱστορία}}}} means "inquiry" or "knowledge from inquiry", from {{polytonic|{{LSJ|i(/stwr|ἵστωρ}}}} (''hístōr'') "judge" (from the Proto-Indo-European [[agent noun]] ''*wid-tor'': "one who knows").<ref name="etym">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=history |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref> It was in that sense that [[Aristotle]] used the word in his {{polytonic|[[History of Animals|Περὶ Τὰ Ζῷα Ἱστορίαι]]}}<ref name="Ferrater-Mora">Ferrater-Mora, José. ''Diccionario de Filosofia''. Barcelona: Editorial Ariel, 1994.</ref> (''Perì Tà Zôa Ηistoríai'' "Inquiries about Animals"). The ancestor word {{polytonic|ἵστωρ}} is attested early on in [[Homeric Hymns]], [[Heraclitus]], the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[ephebos|ephebe]]s' oath, and in [[Boeotia|Boiotic]] inscriptions (in a legal sense, either "judge" or "witness", or similar).

It was still in the Greek sense that [[Francis Bacon]] used the term in the late 16th century, when he wrote about "[[Natural history|Natural History]]". For him, ''historia'' was "the knowledge of objects determined by space and time", that sort of knowledge provided by [[memory]] (while [[science]] was provided by [[reason]], and [[poetry]] was provided by [[fantasy]]).

The word entered the [[English language]] in 1390 with the meaning of "relation of incidents, story". In [[Middle English]], the meaning was "story" in general. The restriction to the meaning "record of past events" arises in the late 15th century. In German, French, and most Germanic and Romance languages, the same word is still used to mean both "history" and "story". The adjective ''historical'' is attested from 1661, and ''historic'' from 1669.<ref name="Whitney">Whitney, W. D. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]''. New York: The Century Co, 1889.</ref>

''Historian'' in the sense of a "researcher of history" is attested from 1531. In all [[European languages]], the substantive "history" is still used to mean both "what happened with men", and "the scholarly study of the happened", the latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter, "History", or the word ''[[historiography]]''.<ref name="Ferrater-Mora" />

==Description==
Historians write in the context of their own time, and with due regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past, and sometimes write to provide lessons for their own society. In the words of [[Benedetto Croce]], "All history is contemporary history". History is facilitated by the formation of a 'true discourse of past' through the production of narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race.<ref name="Whitney">Whitney, W. D. (1889). [http://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]. New York: The Century Co. Page [http://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover#PPA2842,M1 2842].</ref> The modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse.

All events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record.<ref name="wordnet">[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn WordNet Search – 3.0], "History".</ref> The task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past. Therefore, the constitution of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying their claims to represent the 'true past').

The study of history has sometimes been classified as part of the [[humanities]] and other times as part of the [[social sciences]].<ref>Scott Gordon and James Gordon Irving, ''The History and Philosophy of Social Science''. Routledge 1991. Page 1. ISBN 0415056829</ref> It can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas, incorporating methodologies from both. Some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification.<ref>Ritter, H. (1986). Dictionary of concepts in history. Reference sources for the social sciences and humanities, no. 3. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press. Page 416.</ref> In modern . In the 20th century, French [[historian]] [[Fernand Braudel]] revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside disciplines as [[economics]], [[anthropology]], and [[geography]] in the study of global history.

Traditionally, historians have recorded events of the past, either in writing or by passing on an oral tradition, and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts. For the beginning, historians have also used such sources as monuments, inscriptions, and pictures. In general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult all three.<ref>Michael C. Lemon (1995).The Discipline of History and the History of Thought. Routledge. Page 201. ISBN 0415123461</ref> But writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before.

[[Archaeology]] is a discipline that is especially helpful in dealing with buried sites and objects, which, once unearthed, contribute to the study of history. But archaeology rarely stands alone. It uses narrative sources to complement its discoveries. However, archaeology is constituted by a range of methodologies and approaches which are independent from history; that is to say, archaeology does not "fill the gaps" within textual sources. Indeed, Historical Archaeology is a specific branch of archaeology, often contrasting its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources. For example, Mark Leone, the excavator and interpreter of historical Annapolis, Maryland, USA has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents and the material record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth apparent via the study of the total historical environment, despite the ideology of "liberty" inherent in written documents at this time.

There are varieties of ways in which history can be organized, including chronologically, [[culture|culturally]], territorially, and thematically. These divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant overlaps are often present, as in "The International Women's Movement in an Age of Transition, 1830–1975." It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization. The area called [[Big History]] resists this specialization, and searches for universal patterns or trends. History has often been studied with some practical or [[theory|theoretical]] aim, but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity.<ref name="graham-ch1">{{cite book |title=The Shape of the Past |author=Graham, Gordon |publisher=[[Oxford University]] |year=1997 |chapter=Chapter 1}}</ref>

==History and prehistory==
{{Human history and prehistory|222}}
{{See|Protohistory}}

The [[history of the world]] is the memory of the past [[experience]] of ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' around the world, as that experience has been preserved, largely in written records. By "prehistory", historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood. [[Human history]] is marked both by a gradual [[List of discoveries|accretion of discoveries]] and [[Timeline of historic inventions|inventions]], as well as by [[quantum leap]]s — [[paradigm shift]]s, [[revolution]]s — that comprise epochs in the material and spiritual evolution of humankind. By studying painting, drawings, carvings, and other artifacts, some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record. Since the 20th century, the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history's implicit exclusion of certain civilizations, such as those of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[pre-Columbian]] America. Historians in the West have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the [[Western world]].<ref>[[Jack Goody]] (2007) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC&pg=RA2-PA1930&dq=Jack+Goody+2007&sig=g0N7ZF9nz_Uy8nrQTiGdsc0N3sI#PPA12,M1 The Theft of History]'' (from [[Google Books]])</ref> In 1961, British historian [[E. H. Carr]] wrote:
{{quote|The line of demarcation between prehistoric and historical times is crossed when people cease to live only in the present, and become consciously interested both in their past and in their future. History begins with the handing down of tradition; and tradition means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past into the future. Records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations.<ref>Carr, Edward H. (1961). ''What is History?'', p.108, ISBN 0140206523</ref>}}
This definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples, such as [[Australian Aboriginals]] and New Zealand [[Māori]] in the past, and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations, even before their contact with European civilization.

==Historiography==
{{Main|Historiography}}
Historiography has a number of related meanings. Firstly, it can refer to how history has been produced: the story of the development of [[Historical method|methodology]] and practices (for example, the move from short-term biographical narrative towards long-term thematic analysis). Secondly, it can refer to what has been produced: a specific body of historical writing (for example, "medieval historiography during the 1960s" means "Works of medieval history written during the 1960s"). Thirdly, it may refer to why history is produced: the [[Philosophy of history]]. As a [[meta-level]] analysis of descriptions of the past, this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives, [[Language interpretation|interpretation]]s, [[worldview]], use of [[evidence]], or method of presentation of other [[historian]]s. Professional historians also debate the question of whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives.

|}

{{Main|Philosophy of history}}
Philosophy of history is an area of [[philosophy]] concerning the eventual significance, if any, of [[human history]]. Furthermore, it speculates as to a possible [[teleology|teleological]] end to its development—that is, it asks if there is a design, purpose, directive principle, or finality in the processes of human history. Philosophy of history should not be confused with historiography, which is the study of history as an academic discipline, and thus concerns its methods and practices, and its development as a discipline over time. Nor should philosophy of history be confused with the [[history of philosophy]], which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas through time.

Professional historians debate the question of whether history is a science or a liberal art. The distinction is artificial, as many view the field from more than one perspective.<ref>Elizabeth Harris, In Defense of the Liberal-Arts Approach to Technical Writing. College English, Vol. 44, No. 6 (Oct., 1982), pp. 628-636</ref> Recent argument in support for the transformation of history into science have been made by [[Peter Turchin]] in an article titled "Arise [[Cliodynamics]]" in the journal ''Nature''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nature |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v454/n7200/full/454034a.html |title=Arise Cliodynamics.

<div style="background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;"> Historical method basics </div>

The following questions are used by historians in modern work.
# ''When was'' the source, written or unwritten, produced ([[Calendar date|date]])?
# Where was it produced ([[Internationalization and localization|localization]])?
# By whom was it produced ([[authorship]])?
# From what pre-existing material was it produced ([[wikt:analysis|analysis]])?
# In what original form was it produced ([[integrity]])?
# What is the evidential value of its contents ([[credibility]])?
The first four are known as [[higher criticism]]; the fifth, [[lower criticism]]; and, together, external criticism. ''The sixth and final inquiry'' about a source is called internal criticism.

The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which [[historian]]s use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]].

[[Herodotus]] of [[Halicarnassus]] (484 BC – ca.425 BC)<ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5">{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C.

However, his contemporary [[Thucydides]] (ca. 460 BC – ca. 400 BC) is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the [[History of the Peloponnesian War]]. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at cause and effect, rather than as the result of divine intervention.<ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5"/> In his historical method, Thucydides emphasized chronology, a neutral point of view, and that the human world was the result of the actions of human beings. Greek historians also viewed history as [[Historic recurrence|cyclical]], with events regularly recurring.<ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p6">{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C. C. and Jeremy A. Sabloff |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |year=1979 |page=6|isbn=0881338346}}</ref>

There were historical traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval [[China]]. The groundwork for professional historiography in [[East Asia]] was established by the [[Han Dynasty]] court historian known as [[Sima Qian]] (145–90 BC), author of the ''[[Shiji]]'' ([[Records of the Grand Historian]]). For the quality of his timeless written work, Sima Qian is posthumously known as the Father of [[Chinese Historiography]]. Chinese historians of subsequent dynastic periods in China used his ''Shiji'' as the official format for [[Twenty-Four Histories|historical texts]], as well as for biographical literature.

[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] was influential in [[Western Christianity|Christian]] and [[Western thought]] at the beginning of the medieval period. Through the Medieval and [[Renaissance]] periods, history was often studied through a [[sacred history|sacred]] or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher and historian [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] brought [[philosophy]] and a more [[secular]] approach in historical study.<ref name="graham-ch1"/>

In the preface to his book, the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), the [[Historiography of early Islam|Arab historian]] and [[Sociology in medieval Islam|early sociologist]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. The originality of Ibn Khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of the past. Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle [[superstition]] and uncritical acceptance of historical data." As a result, he introduced a [[scientific method]] to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his "new science".<ref>[[Ibn Khaldun]], Franz Rosenthal, N. J. Dawood (1967), ''The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History'', p. x, [[Princeton University Press]], ISBN 0691017549.</ref> His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of [[State (polity)|state]], [[communication]], [[propaganda]] and [[systematic bias]] in history,<ref name=Mowlana>H.

In the West historians developed modern methods of historiography in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany. The 19th century historian with greatest influence on methods was [[Leopold von Ranke]] in Germany.

In the 20th century, academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or individuals, to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a [[social science]] rather than as an [[art]], which traditionally had been the case. Some of the leading advocates of history as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included [[Fernand Braudel]], [[E. H. Carr]], [[Fritz Fischer]], [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], [[Bruce Trigger]], [[Marc Bloch]], [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], [[Peter Gay]], [[Robert Fogel]], [[Lucien Febvre]] and [[Lawrence Stone]]. Many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi-disciplinary approach. Braudel combined history with geography, Bracher history with political science, Fogel history with economics, Gay history with psychology, Trigger history with archeology while Wehler, Bloch, Fischer, Stone, Febvre and Le Roy Ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology, geography, anthropology, and economics. More recently, the field of [[digital history]] has begun to address ways of using computer technology to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship.

In opposition to the claims of history as a social science, historians such as [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], [[John Lukacs]], [[Donald Creighton]], [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]] and [[Gerhard Ritter]] argued that the key to the historians' work was the power of the [[imagination]], and hence contended that history should be understood as an art. French historians associated with the [[Annales School]] introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of [[cultural history]] (cf. ''[[histoire des mentalités]]''). Intellectual historians such as [[Herbert Butterfield]], [[Ernst Nolte]] and [[George Mosse]] have argued for the significance of ideas in history. American historians, motivated by the civil rights era, focused on formerly overlooked ethnic, racial, and socio-economic groups. Another genre of [[social history]] to emerge in the post-WWII era was ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' (History of Everyday Life). Scholars such as [[Martin Broszat]], [[Ian Kershaw]] and [[Detlev Peukert]] sought to examine what everyday life was like for ordinary people in 20th century Germany, especially in the [[Nazi]] period.

[[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]] such as [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Rodney Hilton]], [[Georges Lefebvre]], [[Eugene D. Genovese]], [[Isaac Deutscher]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Timothy Mason]], [[Herbert Aptheker]], [[Arno J. Mayer]] and [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] have sought to validate [[Karl Marx]]'s theories by analyzing history from a Marxist perspective. In response to the Marxist interpretation of history, historians such as [[François Furet]], [[Richard Pipes]], [[J. C. D. Clark]], [[Roland Mousnier]], [[Henry Ashby Turner]] and [[Robert Conquest]] have offered anti-Marxist interpretations of history. [[Feminism|Feminist]] historians such as [[Joan Wallach Scott]], [[Claudia Koonz]], [[Natalie Zemon Davis]], [[Sheila Rowbotham]], [[Gisela Bock]], [[Gerda Lerner]], [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]], and [[Lynn Hunt]] have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past. In recent years, [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources. In his 1997 book ''In Defence of History'', [[Richard J. Evans]], a professor of modern history at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], defended the worth of history. Another defence of history from post-modernist criticism was the Australian historian [[Keith Windschuttle]]'s 1994 book, ''The Killing of History''.

===Periods===
{{Main|Periodization}}
Historical study often focuses on events and developments that occur in particular blocks of time. Historians give these [[Periodization|periods of time]] names in order to allow "organising ideas and classificatory generalisations" to be used by historians.<ref name="Marwick-p169">{{cite book |title=The Nature of History |author=Marwick, Arthur|publisher=The Macmillian Press LTD |year=1970 |page=169}}</ref> The names given to a period can vary with geographical location, as can the dates of the start and end of a particular period. [[Centuries]] and [[decade]]s are commonly used periods and the time they represent depends on the [[Calendar era|dating system]] used. Most periods are constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past. The way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they are viewed and studied.<ref name="Tosh-p168-169">{{cite book |title=The Pursuit of History|author=Tosh, John|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|year=2006 |pages=168–169}}</ref>

===Geographical locations===
Particular [[geographical]] locations can form the basis of historical study, for example, [[continent]]s, [[countries]] and [[cities]]. Understanding why historic events took place is important. To do this, historians often turn to [[geography]]. Weather patterns, the water supply, and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there. For example, to explain why the ancient Egyptians developed a successful civilization, studying the [[geography of Egypt]] is essential. Egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the Nile River, which flooded each year, depositing soil on its banks. The rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities. That meant everyone did not have to farm, so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization.

World history is the study of major civilizations over the last 3000 years or so. It has led to highly controversial interpretations by [[Oswald Spengler]] and [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], among others. World history is especially important as a teaching field. It has increasingly entered the university curriculum in the U.S., in many cases replacing courses in Western Civilization, that had a focus on Europe and the U.S. World history adds extensive new material on Asia, Africa and Latin America.

===Military history===
{{Main|Military history}}

[[Military history]] studies [[War|conflicts]] within [[human society]], usually concentrating on historical [[war]]s and [[warfare]], including [[battles]], [[Military strategy|military strategies]] and [[weapon]]ry.<ref name=Pavkovic>{{Cite book | last =Pavkovic
 | first =Michael | last2 =Morillo | first2 =Stephen | publication-date =31 July 2006 | title =What is Military History? | publication-place =Oxford | publisher =Polity Press | pages =3–4 | isbn =9780745633909 | year =2006 | postscript =<!--None-->}}</ref> However, the subject may range from a melee between two [[tribe]]s to conflicts between proper [[military|militaries]] to a [[world war]] affecting the majority of the [[human population]]. Military historians record the events of military history.

===Social history===
{{Main|Social history}}
[[Social history (social science)|Social history]] is the study of how societies adapt and change over periods of time. Social history is an area of historical study considered by some to be a [[social science]] that attempts to view historical evidence from the point of view of developing social trends. In this view, it may include areas of [[economic history]], [[legal history]] and the analysis of other aspects of [[civil society]] that show the evolution of social norms, behaviors and more.

===Cultural history===
{{Main|Cultural history}}
Cultural history replaced [[social history]] as the dominant form in the 1980s and 1990s. It typically combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language, popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a group of people. How peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic.

===Diplomatic history===
{{Main|Diplomatic history}}
[[Diplomatic history]], sometimes referred to as "''Rankian History''"<ref>Burke, P. (1998). New perspectives on historical writing. University Park, Pa: [[Pennsylvania State University Press]]. Page 3.</ref> in honor of [[Leopold von Ranke]], focuses on [[politics]], politicians and other high rulers and views them as being the driving force of continuity and change in history. This type of ''political history'' is the study of the conduct of [[International relations#History|international relations]] between states or across state boundaries over time. This is the most common form of history and is often the classical and popular belief of what history should be.

===People's history===
{{Main|People's history}}
A [[people's history]] is a type of historical work which attempts to account for historical events from the [[Populism|perspective of common people]]. A people's history is the history of the world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders. Individuals not included in the past in other type of writing about history are part of this theory's primary focus, which includes the [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], the [[oppression|oppressed]], the [[poverty|poor]], the [[Nonconformism|nonconformists]], and the otherwise forgotten people. This theory also usually focuses on events occurring in the fullness of time, or when an overwhelming wave of smaller events cause certain developments to occur.

===Gender history===
{{Main|Gender history}}
[[Gender history]] is a sub-field of History and [[Gender studies]], which looks at the past from the perspective of [[gender]]. It is in many ways, an outgrowth of [[women's history]]. Despite its relatively short life, Gender History (and its forerunner Women's History) has had a rather significant effect on the general study of history. Since the 1960s, when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance, it has gone through a number of different phases, each with its own challenges and outcomes. Although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious, such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession, other influences are more subtle.

===Public history===
{{Main|Public history}}
[[Public history]] is a term that describes the broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history practice has quite deep roots in the areas of historic preservation, archival science, oral history, museum curatorship, and other related fields. The term itself began to be used in the U.S. and Canada in the late 1970s, and the field has become increasingly professionalized since that time. Some of the most common settings for public history are museums, historic homes and historic sites, parks, battlefields, archives, film and television companies, and all levels of government.

==Pseudohistory==
{{Main|Pseudohistory}}

''[[Pseudohistory]]'' is a term applied to texts which purport to be historical in nature but which depart from standard [[Historical method|historiographical conventions]] in a way which undermines their conclusions.
Works which draw controversial conclusions from new, speculative or disputed historical evidence, particularly in the fields of national, political, military and religious affairs, are often rejected as pseudohistory.

In many countries, such as [[Japan]], [[Russia]], and the [[United States]], the subject taught in the [[primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]]s under the name "history" has at times been censored for political reasons. To give just a few of many examples: in Japan, mention of the [[Nanking Massacre]] has been removed from textbooks; in Russia under [[Stalin]], history was rewritten to conform with [[communist]] party doctrine; and in the United States the history of the [[American Civil War]] had been censored to avoid giving offense to white Southerners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-2346.2008.00708.x?cookieSet=1 |title=Blackwell-Synergy.com |publisher=Blackwell-Synergy.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref><ref>{{jp icon}} [http://www.iwanami.co.jp/jpworld/text/textbook01.html Iwanami.co.jp]</ref><ref>James W. Loewen, ''Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong'', Touchstone, 1996, ISBN 978-0684818863.</ref> This practice goes back to the earliest recorded times. In Book Three of ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', [[Plato]] recommends that citizens be taught lies in order to instill patriotism.<ref>Plato, ''The Republic'', in ''The Portable Plato'', Penguin, 1977, ISBN 0140150404.
