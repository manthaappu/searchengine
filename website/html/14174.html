'''FreeBSD''' is a [[free software|free]] [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]] descended from [[American Telephone & Telegraph|AT&T]] [[Unix|UNIX]] via [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD UNIX]].{{nbsp}} Although for legal reasons FreeBSD cannot be called &ldquo;UNIX,&rdquo;<ref>''[[USL v.

==History==
FreeBSD's [[software development|development]] began in 1993 with a quickly growing, unofficial ''[[patch (software)|patchkit]]'' maintained by users of the [[386BSD]] operating system. This patchkit [[Fork (software development)|forked]] from 386BSD and grew into an operating system taken from U.C. Berkeley's 4.3BSD-Lite (Net/2) tape with many 386BSD components and code from the [[Free Software Foundation]]. After two public beta releases via FTP (1.0-GAMMA on September 2, 1993, and 1.0-EPSILON on October 3, 1993), the first official release was FreeBSD 1.0, available via FTP on November 1, 1993 and on CDROM on December 30, 1993. This official release was coordinated by [[Jordan Hubbard]], Nate Williams and Rodney W. Grimes with a name thought up by David Greenman. [[Walnut Creek CDROM]] agreed to distribute FreeBSD on CD and gave the project a machine to work on along with a fast Internet connection, which Hubbard later said helped stir FreeBSD's rapid growth. A "highly successful" FreeBSD 1.1 release followed in May 1994.<ref name=history>

</ref>

However, there were legal concerns about the BSD Net/2 release source code used in 386BSD. After a [[USL v. BSDi|lawsuit]] between UNIX copyright owner at the time [[Unix System Laboratories]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the FreeBSD project re-engineered most of the system using the 4.4BSD-Lite release from Berkeley, which, owing to this lawsuit, had none of the [[AT&T]] source code earlier BSD versions had depended upon, making it an unbootable operating system. Following much work, the outcome was released as FreeBSD 2.0 in January 1995.<ref name=history />

FreeBSD 2.0 featured a revamp of the original [[Carnegie Mellon University]] [[Mach (kernel)|Mach]] virtual memory system, which was optimized for performance under high loads. This release also introduced the [[FreeBSD Ports]] system, which made downloading, building and installing third party software very easy. By 1996 FreeBSD had become popular among commercial and ISP users, powering extremely successful sites like [[Simtel|Walnut Creek CD-ROM]] (a huge repository of software that broke several throughput records on the Internet), [[Yahoo!]] and [[Hotmail]]. The last release along the 2-STABLE branch was 2.2.8 in November 1998.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hubbard|first=Jordan|url=http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/history.html|title=A Brief History of FreeBSD|publisher=freebsd.org|accessdate=2007-12-16}}</ref> FreeBSD 3.0 brought many more changes, including the switch to the [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF binary]] format. Support for [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]] systems and the 64-bit Alpha platform were also added. The 3-STABLE branch ended with 3.5.1 in June 2000.<ref name=history />

==Features==
===Networking===
FreeBSD's TCP/IP stack is based on the [[BSD|4.2BSD]] implementation of TCP/IP which greatly contributed to the widespread adoption of these protocols.<ref>

 |first = Marshall
 |middle = Kirk
 |title = The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System
 |chapter = Section 2.13
 |year = 2005}}
</ref>
FreeBSD also supports [[IPv6]], [[SCTP]], [[IPSec]], [[IPX]], [[Apple talk|AppleTalk]] and wireless networking.

===Storage===
FreeBSD has several unique features related to storage. [[Soft updates]] maintain filesystem integrity in the event of a system crash. The [[GEOM]] framework provides features such as [[RAID]] (levels 0, 1, 3 currently), [[full disk encryption]], and concatenation of drives. Filesystem snapshots allow an image of a filesystem at an instant in time to be efficiently created. Snapshots allow reliable backup of a live filesystem. FreeBSD also provides the [[ZFS]] filesystem as an alternative to the normal [[UFS2]] file system.

===Security===
FreeBSD provides several security-related features including [[access control list]]s (ACLs), security event auditing, extended file system attributes, fine-grained [[Capability (computers)|capabilities]] and [[mandatory access control]]s (MAC). These security enhancements were developed by the '''TrustedBSD''' project. The project was founded by [[Robert Watson (computer scientist)|Robert Watson]] with the goal of implementing concepts from the [[Common Criteria]] for Information Technology Security Evaluation and the [[TCSEC|Orange Book]]. This project is ongoing and many of its extensions have been integrated into FreeBSD.

The project has also ported the [[NSA]]'s [[FLASK]]/TE implementation from [[SELinux]] to FreeBSD. Other work includes the development of [[OpenBSM]], an open source implementation of Sun's Basic Security Module (BSM) API and audit log file format, which supports an extensive security audit system. This was shipped as part of FreeBSD 6.2. Other infrastructure work in FreeBSD performed as part of the TrustedBSD Project has included [[SYN cookies]], GEOM and OpenPAM.

While most components of the TrustedBSD project are eventually folded into the main sources for FreeBSD, many features, once fully matured, find their way into other operating systems. For example, [[OpenPAM]] and [[UFS2]] have been adopted by [[NetBSD]]. Moreover, the TrustedBSD MAC Framework has been adopted by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] for [[Mac OS X]].

Much of this work was sponsored by [[DARPA]].

===Portability===
FreeBSD has been ported to a variety of processor architectures. The FreeBSD project organizes architectures into tiers that characterize the level of support provided. Tier 1 architectures are mature and fully supported. Tier 2 architectures are undergoing major development. Tier 3 architectures are experimental or are no longer under active development (as is the case of DEC Alpha) and tier 4 architectures have no support at all.

FreeBSD has been ported to the following architectures:<ref name=portability>

===Third Party Software===
{{details|FreeBSD Ports}}
[[File:FreeBSD Applications.png|thumb|FreeBSD running [[GIMP]], [[Firefox]], and [[GNOME]] installed from the ports collection.]]
FreeBSD has a [[software repository|repository]] of thousands of applications that are developed by third parties outside of the project itself. (Examples include windowing systems, Internet browsers, email programs, office suites, and so forth.) In general, the project itself does not develop this software, only the framework to allow these programs to be installed (termed the ''Ports Collection''). Applications may be installed either from source, if its licensing terms allow such redistribution (these are called ''ports''), or as compiled binaries if allowed (these are called ''packages''). The ''Ports Collection'' supports the latest release on the ''-CURRENT'' and ''-STABLE'' branches. Older releases are not supported and may or may not work correctly with an up-to-date ports collection.<ref>

| publisher = freebsd.org
| accessdate=2009-01-30 }}
</ref>

====Ports Collection====
Each package in the ''Ports Collection'' is installed from [[source code|source]]. Each port's [[make (software)|Makefile]] automatically fetches the application [[source code]], either from a local disk, CD-ROM or via [[ftp]], unpacks it on the system, applies the patches, and [[compiler|compiles]]. This method can be very time consuming as compiling large packages can take hours, but the user is able to install a customized program.<ref>

| title = 4.5 Using the Ports Collection
| publisher = freebsd.org
| accessdate=2009-01-30 }}
</ref>

====Packages system====
For most ports, precompiled binary packages also exist. This method is very quick as the whole compilation process is avoided, but the user is not able to install a program with customized compile time options.<ref>

</ref>

====Utilities for managing ports and packages====
There are many utilities available for managing ports and packages available in [[Graphical user interface|GUIs]] and [[Command-line interface|CLIs]]. These are some of them:<ref>

===Linux compatibility===
Most software that runs on [[Linux]] can run on FreeBSD without the need for any [[compatibility layer]]. FreeBSD nonetheless still provides a [[compatibility layer]] for several other [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s, including Linux. Hence, most Linux binaries can be run on FreeBSD, including some proprietary applications distributed only in binary form. Examples of applications that can use the Linux compatibility layer are [[StarOffice]], the Linux version of [[Firefox]], [[Adobe Acrobat]], [[RealPlayer]], [[Oracle Database|Oracle]], [[Mathematica]], [[Maple_(software)|Maple]], [[MATLAB]], [[WordPerfect]], [[Skype]], [[Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory]], [[Doom 3]] and [[Quake 4]] <ref name=binary>{{cite web|url=http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/linuxemu.html|title=Chapter 10 Linux Binary Compatibility|accessdate=2007-03-29|publisher=freebsd.org}}</ref> (though some of these applications also have a native version). No noticeable performance penalty over native FreeBSD programs has been noted when running Linux binaries, and, in some cases, these may even perform more smoothly than on Linux.<ref name=unleashed>{{cite book|last=Tiemann|first=Brian|title=FreeBSD 6 Unleashed|year=2006|isbn=0672328755|chapter=How FreeBSD Compares to Other Operating Systems}}</ref> However, the layer is not altogether seamless, and some Linux binaries are unusable or only partially usable on FreeBSD. This is often because the compatibility layer only supports system calls available in the historical Linux kernel 2.4.2. There is support of Linux 2.6.16 system calls, enabled by default since 8.0 and available since 7.0. However, there is currently no support for running 64-bit Linux binaries.<ref name=linux-64-bit>{{cite web|url=http://markmail.org/message/gsd3is7yz7w7sent|title=Support for 64 Bit Linux binaries on FreeBSD (Mailing List)|accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref>

==Development==
FreeBSD currently has more than 400 active developers<ref name=developers>{{cite web |url=http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/articles/contributors/staff-committers.html |work=Contributors to FreeBSD |publisher=freebsd.org |title=List of FreeBSD developers |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref> and thousands of contributors.

===Governance structure===
The FreeBSD Project is run by FreeBSD committers, or developers who have [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]]/[[Subversion (software)|SVN]] commit access. There are several kinds of committers, including source committers (base operating system), doc committers (documentation and web site authors) and ports (third party application porting and infrastructure). Every two years the FreeBSD committers select a 9-member FreeBSD Core Team who are responsible for overall project direction, setting and enforcing project rules and approving new "commit bits", or the granting of CVS/SVN commit access. A number of responsibilities are officially assigned to other development teams by the FreeBSD Core Team, including responsibility for security advisories (the Security Officer Team), [[release engineering]] (the Release Engineering Team) and managing the ports collection (the Port Manager team). Developers may give up their commit rights to retire or for "safe-keeping" after a period of a year or more of inactivity, although commit rights will generally be restored on request. Under rare circumstances commit rights may be removed by Core Team vote as a result of repeated violation of project rules and standards. The FreeBSD Project is unusual among open source projects in having developers who have worked with its source base for over 25 years, owing to the involvement of a number of past University of California developers who worked on [[BSD]] at the [[Computer Systems Research Group]].<ref>

</ref>

===Branches===
FreeBSD [[software developer|developers]] maintain at least two branches of simultaneous development. The ''-CURRENT'' branch always represents the "[[bleeding edge]]" of FreeBSD development. A ''-STABLE'' branch of FreeBSD is created for each major version number, from which releases are cut about once every 4–6 months. If a feature is sufficiently stable and mature it will likely be [[backport]]ed (''MFC'' or ''Merge from CURRENT'' in FreeBSD developer slang) to the ''-STABLE'' branch.<ref>

===Foundation===
FreeBSD development is supported in part by the FreeBSD Foundation. The foundation is a non-profit organization that accepts donations to fund FreeBSD development. Such funding has been used to sponsor developers for specific activities, purchase hardware and network infrastructure, provide travel grants to developer summits, and provide legal support to the FreeBSD project.<ref>

</ref>

==License==
FreeBSD is released under a variety of open source licenses. The kernel code and most newly created code is released under the two-clause [[BSD license]] which allows everyone to use and redistribute FreeBSD as they wish. There are parts released under three- and four-clause BSD licenses, as well as [[Beerware]] license. Some device drivers include a [[binary blob]], such as the [[Atheros]] [[Hardware abstraction layer|HAL]] of FreeBSD versions before 7.2.<ref>
{{cite web

</ref> Some of the code contributed by other projects is licensed under [[GNU General Public License|GPL]], [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]], [[ISC license|ISC]] or [[Common Development and Distribution License|CDDL]]. All the code licensed under [[GPL]] and [[CDDL]] is clearly separated from the code under liberal licenses, to make it easy for users such as embedded device manufacturers to use only [[permissive free software license]]s. ClangBSD aims to replace some [[GPL]] dependencies in the FreeBSD base system by replacing the [[GNU compiler collection]] with the BSD-licenced [[LLVM]]/[[Clang]] compiler. ClangBSD became self-hosting on April 16 2010<ref>

==Logo==
[[File:Bsd daemon.jpg|thumb|FreeBSD's mascot is the generic [[BSD daemon]], also known as ''Beastie''.]]
For many years FreeBSD's logo was the generic [[BSD daemon]], also called ''Beastie'', a slurred phonetic pronunciation of ''BSD''. First appearing in 1976 on UNIX T-shirts purchased by [[Bell Labs]], the more popular versions of the BSD daemon were drawn by animation director [[John Lasseter]] beginning in 1984.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=mckusick.com|url=http://www.mckusick.com/beastie/shirts/usenix.html|title=Usenix|accessdate=2007-12-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=minnie.tuhs.org|url=http://minnie.tuhs.org/Seminars/Saving_Unix/|title=Saving UNIX from /dev/null|accessdate=2007-12-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=frbsd.org|url=http://www.frbsd.org/fr/chuck.html|title=Chuck's Corner|accessdate=2007-12-19}}</ref> Several FreeBSD-specific versions were later drawn by Tatsumi Hosokawa.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=freebsd.org|url=http://www.freebsd.org/copyright/daemon.html|title=The BSD Daemon|accessdate=2007-12-15}}</ref> Through the years Beastie became both beloved and criticized as perhaps inappropriate for corporate and mass market exposure. Moreover it was not unique to FreeBSD. In lithographic terms, the Lasseter graphic is not [[line art]] and often requires a screened, four colour [[Offset printing#Photo offset|photo offset]] printing process for faithful reproduction on physical surfaces such as paper. Moreover, the BSD daemon was thought to be too graphically detailed for smooth size scaling and aesthetically over dependent upon multiple colour gradations, making it hard to reliably reproduce as a simple, standardized logo in only two or three colours, much less in monochrome. Because of these worries, a competition was held and a new logo designed by Anton K. Gural, still echoing the BSD daemon, was released on October 8, 2005.<ref name=logo-result>{{cite web|url=http://logo-contest.freebsd.org/result/|title=Final result for the FreeBSD logo design competition|publisher=freebsd.org|date=[[2005]]|accessdate=2007-03-01}}</ref> Meanwhile Lasseter's much known take on the BSD daemon carries forth as official mascot of the FreeBSD Project.

==Derivatives==
[[File:711-screenshot.png|thumb|[[PC-BSD]]]]
There are a number of software distributions based on FreeBSD including:
* [[DesktopBSD]] (aimed at home users and workstations)
* [[PC-BSD]] (aimed at home users and workstations)
* [[FreeSBIE]] ([[live CD]])
* Frenzy ([[live CD]])
* [[GhostBSD]] (Gnome-based live CD)
* [[m0n0wall]] (firewall)
* [[pfSense]] (firewall)
* [[FreeNAS]] (for network attached storage)
* [[AskoziaPBX]] (an embedded PBX)

All these distributions have no or only minor changes when compared with the original FreeBSD base system. The main difference to the original FreeBSD is that they come with pre-installed and pre-configured software for specific use cases. This can be compared with [[Linux]] distributions, which are all binary compatible because they use the same kernel and also use the same basic tools, compilers and libraries, while coming with different applications, configurations and branding.

Besides these distributions there is [[DragonFly BSD]], a fork from FreeBSD 4.8 aiming for a different multiprocessor synchronization strategy than the one chosen for FreeBSD 5 and development of some [[microkernel]] features. It doesn't aim to stay compatible with FreeBSD and has huge differences in the kernel and basic [[Userland (computing)|userland]].

A wide variety of products are directly or indirectly based on FreeBSD. Examples of embedded devices based on FreeBSD include:
* [[Citrix]] Netscalers
* [[F5 Networks]]'s 3DNS version 3 global traffic manager and EDGE-FX version 1 web cache (NB These are now end of life with 3DNS functionality being moved to the Linux based BIGIP Platform)
* [[Ironport]] network security appliances
* [[Juniper Networks]] routers, switches and security devices
* [[KACE Networks]]'s KBOX 1000 & 2000 Series Appliances and the Virtual KBOX Appliance
* [[NCircle Entertainment|nCircle's]] IP360
* [[NetApp]]'s Data ONTAP GX (only as a loader for proprietary kernel-space module of ONTAP GX and 8.x)
* [[Netasq]] security appliances

==Version history==
===FreeBSD 1===
Released in November 1993. 1.1.5.1 was released in July, 1994.

===FreeBSD 2===
2.0-RELEASE was announced on November 22, 1994. The last of FreeBSD 2, 2.2.8-RELEASE, was announced on November 29, 1998. First FreeBSD to be claimed legally free of AT&T UNIX code with approval of Novell.

===FreeBSD 3===
Announced on October 16, 1998. 3.5-RELEASE was announced on June 24, 2000.

===FreeBSD 4===
4.0-RELEASE appeared in March 2000 and the last 4-STABLE branch release was 4.11 in January 2005 supported until January 31, 2007.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-security/2006-October/004111.html |title=FreeBSD 4.x EoL announcement}}</ref> FreeBSD 4 was a favorite operating system for ISPs and [[web hosting service|web hosting providers]] during the first ''.com'' bubble, and is widely regarded as one of the most stable and high performance operating systems of the whole Unix lineage.
Among the new features of FreeBSD 4, [[Kqueue|<code>kqueue(2)</code>]] was introduced (which is now part of other major BSD systems).

===FreeBSD 5===
After almost three years of development, the first 5.0-RELEASE in January 2003 was widely anticipated, featuring support for advanced multiprocessor and application threading, and for the [[UltraSPARC]] and [[IA-64]] platforms. The first 5-STABLE release was 5.3 (5.0 through 5.2.1 were cut from ''-CURRENT''). The last release from the 5-STABLE branch was 5.5 in May 2006.

The largest architectural development in FreeBSD 5 was a major change in the low-level kernel locking mechanisms to enable better symmetric multi-processor (SMP) support. This released much of the kernel from the MP lock, which is sometimes called the ''[[Giant lock]]''. More than one process could now execute in kernel mode at the same time. Other major changes included an ''M'':''N'' native threading implementation called [[Kernel Scheduled Entities]]. In principle this is similar to [[Scheduler Activations]]. Starting with FreeBSD 5.3, KSE was the default threading implementation until it was replaced with a 1:1 implementation in FreeBSD 7.0.

FreeBSD 5 also significantly changed the block I/O layer by implementing the [[GEOM]] modular disk I/O request transformation framework contributed by [[Poul-Henning Kamp]]. GEOM enables the simple creation of many kinds of functionality, such as mirroring (gmirror) and encryption ([[GBDE]] and [[Geli (software)|GELI]]). This work was supported through sponsorship by [[DARPA]].

The 5.4 and 5.5 releases of FreeBSD confirmed the FreeBSD 5.x branch as a highly stable and high-performing release, although it had a long development period due to the large feature set. Earlier releases on the 5.x branch are not considered stable enough for production deployment.

===FreeBSD 6===
FreeBSD 6.0 was released on November 4, 2005. The most recent FreeBSD 6 release was 6.4, on November 11, 2008. These versions continue work on SMP and threading optimization along with more work on advanced [[IEEE 802.11|802.11]] functionality, TrustedBSD security event auditing, significant network stack performance enhancements, a fully preemptive kernel and support for hardware performance counters (HWPMC). The main accomplishments of these releases include removal of the Giant lock from [[Virtual file system|VFS]], implementation of a better-performing optional libthr library with 1:1 threading and the addition of a Basic Security Module (BSM) audit implementation called [[OpenBSM]], which was created by the TrustedBSD Project (based on the BSM implementation found in Apple's [[open source software|open source]] [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]) and released under a [[BSD licenses|BSD-style license]].

===FreeBSD 7===
FreeBSD 7.0 was released on 27 February 2008. The most recent FreeBSD 7 release was 7.3, on March 23, 2010. New features include [[SCTP]], [[Unix File System|UFS]] [[Journaling file system|journaling]], an experimental port of [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]]'s [[ZFS]] file system, [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC4]], improved support for the [[ARM architecture|ARM]] [[CPU architecture|architecture]], jemalloc (a [[malloc|memory allocator]] optimized for [[parallel computation]],<ref>{{cite web |title=A Scalable Concurrent malloc(3) Implementation for FreeBSD |first=Jason |last=Evans |url=http://people.freebsd.org/~jasone/jemalloc/bsdcan2006/jemalloc.pdf |format=PDF |date=2006-04-16 |accessdate=2008-02-13}}</ref> which was ported to [[Mozilla Firefox 3|Firefox 3]]),<ref name="FreeBSD-7-RELEASE">{{cite web|url=http://www.freebsd.org/releases/7.0R/announce.html|title=FreeBSD 7.0-RELEASE Announcement|publisher=freebsd.org|accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref> and major updates and optimizations relating to network, audio, and [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]] performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2008/02/26/whats-new-in-freebsd-70.html?page=1|title=What's New in FreeBSD 7.0|first=Federico|last=Biancuzzi|date=2008-02-26|accessdate=2008-02-26|publisher=onlamp.com}}</ref> Benchmarks have shown significant speed improvements over previous FreeBSD releases as well as Linux.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.freebsd.org/~kris/scaling/7.0%20Preview.pdf|title=Introducing FreeBSD 7.0|publisher=freebsd.org|accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref> The new [[ULE scheduler]] has seen much improvement but a decision was made to ship the 7.0 release with the older 4BSD scheduler, leaving ULE as a kernel compile-time tunable. In FreeBSD 7.1 ULE was the default for the i386 and AMD64 architectures.

Starting from version 7.1 [[DTrace]] was also integrated and FreeBSD 7.2 brought support for multi-IPv4/IPv6 [[FreeBSD jail|jails]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freebsd.org/releases/7.2R/announce.html|title=FreeBSD 7.2-RELEASE Announcement|publisher=freebsd.org|accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref>

Code supporting the [[DEC Alpha]] architecture (supported since FreeBSD 4.0) was removed in FreeBSD 7.0.<ref name=alpha-7.0>{{cite web|url=http://www.freebsd.org/releases/7.0R/relnotes.html|title=FreeBSD 7.0-RELEASE Release Notes|publisher=freebsd.org|accessdate=2009-05-03}}</ref>

===FreeBSD 8===
FreeBSD 8.1 is the latest stable release of FreeBSD, having been [[Branching (software)|branched]] from the trunk in June 2010. It features [[Page (computer memory)#Huge_pages|superpages]], [[Xen]] DomU support, network stack virtualization, [[stack-smashing protection]], TTY layer rewrite, much improved [[ZFS]] support, a new [[USB]] stack, [[multicast]] updates including [[Internet Group Management Protocol|IGMPv3]], and rewritten [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] client/server introducing [[NFSv4]]. Inclusion of improved device mmap() extensions enables implementation of a 64-bit Nvidia display driver for the x86-64 platform. FreeBSD 8.1 was formally released on July 23rd, 2010<ref name="8release">{{Cite web

|accessdate=2010-07-23}}</ref>.

===FreeBSD 9===
{{As of|2009}}, "bleeding edge" development occurs on -CURRENT, the [[Trunk (software)|trunk]] version of the operating system, which will result in a future version named FreeBSD 9. Until FreeBSD 8.0 was released, the trunk was updated with only conservative changes.<ref name="9-current">{{Cite web|url=http://wiki.freebsd.org/8.0TODO|title=Status update|work=FreeBSD wiki|last=Watson|first=Robert|date=2009-08-23|accessdate=2009-08-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wiki.freebsd.org/90todolist?highlight=%28%28FreeBSD9%29%29|title=FreeBSD 9 To Do List}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wiki.freebsd.org/FreeBSD9|title=FreeBSD 9 Brainstorming/Wishlist|accessdate=2009-10-10}}</ref>

===Timeline===
{{Timeline FreeBSD}}
The timeline shows that the span of a single release generation of FreeBSD lasts around 5 years. Since the FreeBSD project makes effort for binary backward (and limited forward) compatibility within the same release generation,<ref>[http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/current-stable.html FreeBSD Handbook information on upgrading]</ref> this allows users 5+ years of support, with trivial-to-easy upgrading within the release generation.
