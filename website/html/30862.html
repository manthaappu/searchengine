In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]], '''quasiperiodic motion''' is in rough terms the type of motion executed by a [[dynamical system]] containing a finite number (two or more) of [[commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurable]] frequencies. 

That is, if we imagine that the [[phase space]] is modelled by a [[torus]] ''T'', the trajectory of the system is modelled by a [[curve]] on ''T'' that wraps around without ever exactly coming back on itself.

A '''quasiperiodic function''' on the [[real line]] is the type of function (continuous, say) obtained from a function on ''T'', by means of a curve 

:''R'' &rarr; ''T''

which is linear (when lifted from ''T'' to its covering [[Euclidean space]]), by composition. It is therefore oscillating, with a finite number of underlying frequencies. (NB the sense in which [[theta function]]s and the [[Weierstrass zeta function]] in [[complex analysis]] are said to have [[quasi-period]]s with respect to a [[period lattice]] is something distinct from this.)

The theory of [[almost periodic function]]s is, roughly speaking, for the same situation but allowing ''T'' to be a torus with an infinite number of dimensions.
