<html> <head> <title>Machtey Award</title></head><body>The '''Machtey Award'''
is awarded at the annual IEEE [[Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science]] (FOCS) to that author(s) of the best student paper(s). A paper qualifies as a student paper if all authors are full-time students at the date of the submission. The award decision is made by the Program Committee.

The award is named after Michael Machtey, who was a researcher in the theoretical computer science community in the 1970s<ref>Michael Machtey's publications [http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Machtey:Michael.html]</ref>. The counterpart of this award at the ACM [[Symposium on Theory of Computing]] (STOC) is the [[Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award]]<ref>ACM SIGACT. [http://sigact.acm.org/prizes/student/ "Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award"]</ref>.
