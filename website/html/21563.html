==Biography==
Li graduated from the  Department of Mathematics and Mechanics, [[Beijing University]] in 1966. He then studied at the [[University of Edinburgh]] obtaining a PhD in [[computer science]] in 1983. After graduation, he was employed by the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]], [[Newcastle University]] and University of Edinburgh as Senior Programmer. He was also a visiting professor at the [[Saarland University]].
He was elected to the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] in 1997.

== Achievements ==
Li has participated in the founding, developing, and improving of the Operation Semantics of Words Structucture.
In 1981, he was the first person to successfully use this structure to describe the technique of Parallel, Sync and Communication in software, and systematically solved the problems of [[concurrent language]]s, such as [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] and [[Edison]]. Operation Semantics of Words Structucture has became one of the classical semantics of programming languages.
