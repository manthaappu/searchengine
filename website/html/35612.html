The '''state of the art''' is the highest level of development, as of a device, technique, or scientific field, achieved at a particular time. It also applies to the level of development (as of a device, procedure, process, technique, or science) reached at any particular time usually as a result of modern methods.

== Origin ==
The earliest usage of the term "state of the art" documented by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] dates back to 1910 from an engineering manual by Henry Harrison Suplee (1856-post 1943), an engineering graduate (U. Of Pennsylvania, 1876), titled ''Gas Turbine: progress in the design and construction of turbines operated by gases of combustion''.  It reads: "In the present state of the art this is all that can be done."

== Patent law ==
{{main|Prior art}}
In the context of the [[European Patent Convention|European]] and [[Australian]] [[patent]] [[law]], the term "state of the art" is a concept used in the process of assessing and asserting [[novelty (patent)|novelty]] and [[inventive step and non-obviousness|inventive step]],<ref>Under the European Patent Convention: {{EPC Article|54}} and {{EPC Article|56}}.</ref> and is a synonym of the expression "[[prior art]]".  In the [[European Patent Convention]] (EPC), "[the] state of the art shall be held to comprise everything made available to the public by means of a written or oral description, by use, or in any other way, before the date of filing of the European patent application" according to {{EPC Article|54|2}}. Due account should be taken of {{EPC Article|54|3}} as well, but merely for the examination of novelty.

The expression "background art" is also used in certain legal provisions, such as {{EPC Rule|42|1|b) and(c}} (previously {{EPC 1973 Rule|27|1|b) and (c}}), and has the same meaning.<ref>[http://legal.european-patent-office.org/dg3/biblio/t820011ep1.htm Decision T 11/82] of 15 April 1983 of the [[Appeal procedure before the European Patent Office|Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office]]</ref>
