<html> <head> <title>MIPS-X</title></head><body>'''MIPS-X''' is a [[microprocessor]] and [[instruction set architecture]] developed as a follow-on project to the [[MIPS architecture]] at [[Stanford University]] by the same team that developed MIPS. The project, supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, started in 1984, and its final form was described in a set of papers released in 1986â€“87. Unlike its older cousin, MIPS-X was never commercialized as a [[workstation]] CPU, and has mainly been seen in [[Embedded system|embedded]] designs based on chips designed by [[8x8 Inc|Integrated Information Technology]] for use in [[digital video]] applications. 

MIPS-X, while designed by the same team and architecturally very similar, is not instruction-set compatible with the mainline MIPS R-series processors. The processor is obscure enough that (as of this writing) support for it is provided only by specialist developers (such as [[Green Hills Software]]), and is notably missing from [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]].

MIPS-X has become important among [[DVD player]] [[firmware]] [[Hacker (computing)|hackers]], since many low-end DVD players use chips based on the IIT design (and produced by [[ESS Technology Inc.]]) as their central processor and [[MPEG-2]] decoder.

The Programmer's Manual described an instruction called '''hsc''', which means '''halt and spontaneously combust'''. The manual claimed that on the [[NSA]] versions of the processor, this instruction was executed when a protection violation was detected,<ref>[ftp://reports.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/csl/tr/86/289/CSL-TR-86-289.pdf  hsc instruction], MIPS-X Instruction Set and Programmer's Manual, p. 65.</ref> however this was intended as a joke. On other platforms, this type of instruction is known as [[Halt and Catch Fire]].
