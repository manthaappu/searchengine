<html> <head> <title>Spectral set</title></head><body>In operator theory, a set <math>X\subseteq\mathbb{C}</math> is said to be a '''spectral set''' for a (possibly unbounded) linear operator <math>T</math> on a Banach space if the [[Spectrum of an operator|spectrum]] of <math>T</math> is in <math>X</math> and von-Neumann's inequality holds for <math>T</math> on <math>X</math> - i.e. for all rational functions <math>r(x)</math> with no [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]] on <math>X</math>

:<math>\left\Vert r(T) \right\Vert \leq \left\Vert r \right\Vert_{X} = \sup \left\{\left\vert r(x) \right\vert : x\in X \right\}</math>

This concept is related to the topic of analytic functional calculus
of operators. In general, one want to get more details about the operators constructed form functions with the original operator as the variable.
