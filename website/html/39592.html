'''visudo''' is a [[unix]] command that allows editing of the [[sudo|''sudoers'']] file in a safe fashion, namely by preventing multiple simultaneous edits with [[Lock (computer science)|locks]], performing [[Sanity testing|sanity checks]], and checking for parse errors. The ''sudoers'' file allows listed users access to [[Execution (computers)|execute]] to a [[subset]] of commands while having the privileges of the [[root user]].

The command syntax is (using man visudo):  '''visudo''' [-c] [-q] [-s] [-V] [-f sudoers]. The name of the file is not necessary (is implied) when using -s and -q. The -f is attached to the sudoers, unlike the other flags. So, to edit as root, type: '''visudo''' -f sudoers. According to the man page, the -f flag is used only if the file sudoers is in another location (redhat 5, it is in /etc.)
