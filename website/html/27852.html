In [[computer science]], the '''ostrich algorithm''' is a strategy of ignoring potential problems on the basis that they may be exceedingly rare - "to stick your head in the sand and pretend that there is no problem".  This assumes that it is more cost-effective to allow the problem to occur than to attempt its prevention.

This approach may be used in dealing with [[deadlock]]s in [[concurrent programming]] if deadlocks are believed to be very rare, and if the cost of detection or prevention is high.

==Trade-offs==
* Convenience
* Correctness

It is one of the methods of dealing with deadlocks. Other methods are: avoidance ([[banker's algorithm]]), prevention, detection and recovery.

Some algorithms with poor worst-case performance are commonly used because they only exhibit poor performance on artificial cases that do not occur in practice; typical examples are the [[simplex algorithm]] and the type-checking algorithm for [[Standard ML]]. Issues like [[integer overflow]] in programming languages with fixed-width integers are also frequently ignored because they occur only in exceptional cases that don't arise for practical inputs.

==Hybrid Approach==

Hybrid approach to using Ostrich algorithm is determining that the exceedingly rare case does not happen, and then switching from another costly algorithm to this one.  The trade-off here is that if circumstances change or are unaccounted for, the rare problem may re-occur.

An example can be found in the Non Hard-Locking ReadWriteLocker[http://nohardlockrwlocker.codeplex.com/] site, where you have the option to determine where deadlocks might occur, and then turn off deadlock detection once you determine it doesn't need to be used.
