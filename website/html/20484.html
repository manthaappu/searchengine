'''Keith Bostic''' (born July 26, 1959) is a [[computer programmer]] from the [[United States]].

In 1986, Bostic joined the [[Computer Systems Research Group]] (CSRG) at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He was one of the principal architects of the Berkeley 4.4BSD and 4.4BSD-Lite releases.<ref name="Dougherty">{{cite web |author=Dale Dougherty |date=2000-03-24 |title=Bostic on the BSD Tradition: An interview with BSD veteran Keith Bostic |url=http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2000/03/24/bostic.html |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |work=ONLamp.com: BSD DevCenter |accessdate=2008-04-05}}</ref> Among many other tasks, he led the effort at CSRG to create a [[free software]] version of [[BSD UNIX]], which helped allow the creation of [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]] and [[OpenBSD]].

Bostic was also one of the founders of [[Berkeley Software Design Inc.]] (BSDi),<ref name="Dougherty" /> which produced [[BSD/OS]], a proprietary version of BSD.

He and wife [[Margo Seltzer]] founded [[Sleepycat Software]] in 1996 to develop and support [[Berkeley DB]], an open source database. In February 2006, the company was acquired by [[Oracle Corporation]], where Bostic worked until February 2008.

Bostic is the author of ''[[nvi]]'', a re-implementation of the classic [[text editor]] ''[[vi]]''.
