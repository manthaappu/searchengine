A generalized parallel manipulator is a closed-loop kinematic chain
mechanism whose end-effector is linked to the base by several independent
kinematic chains
A '''parallel manipulator''', also called a '''parallel robot''', consists of a fixed "base" platform, connected to an [[Industrial robot end effector|end effector]] platform by means of a number of "legs". These legs often consist of an actuated [[prismatic joint]], connected to the platforms through passive (i.e. not actuated) spherical and/or [[universal joint]]s. Hence, the links feel only traction or compression, not bending, which increases their position [[accuracy]] and allows a lighter construction.

A '''parallel robot''' is a device for performing manipulations, where the end effector is connected to the base via multiple [[kinematic chain]]s. Any two chains thus form a closed loop. This is opposed to classical open loop mechanisms such as the [[serial robot]] [[robotic arm]] (e.g. articulated robots such as jointed arms). 

The actuators for the prismatic joints can be placed in the motionless base platform, so that their mass does not have to be moved, which again makes the construction lighter.<br />
Parallel manipulators have (in principle) high structural [[stiffness]], since the end effector is supported in several places at the same time.
All these features result in manipulators with a wide range of motion capability.
Their major drawback is their limited workspace, because the legs can collide and, in addition, each leg has five passive joints that each have their own mechanical limits. Another drawback of Parallel Robots is that they lose stiffness in singular positions completely (The robot gains finite or infinite degrees of freedom which are uncontrolable; it becomes shaky or mobile). This means that the Jacobian matrix, which is the mapping from joint space to euclidian space, becomes singular (the rank decreases from six). 

==Applications==
Major industrial applications of these devices are
* [[flight simulator|airplane simulators]]
* automobile simulators
* in work processes
* photonics / fiber alignment http://www.pb.izm.fhg.de/p2sa/020_Technologies/Optik/FundE_Faserjustage.html
They also become more popular  
* in high speed, high-accuracy positioning with limited workspace, such as in assembly of [[Printed circuit board|PCBs]]
* as micro manipulators mounted on the end effector of larger but slower [[serial manipulator]]s
* as high speed/high-precision [[milling machine]]s

Parallel robots are usually faster than traditional articulated robots, since the motors can be mounted on the base, thus saving weight.  They are also stronger than serial robots because the end effector is connected to more links.  Another benefit is that the error of the end effector is less than the errors of serial robots since the errors are averaged (as opposed to being additive as in serial robots).
However, parallel robots are usually more limited in the workspace; for instance, they generally cannot reach around obstacles.  The calculations involved in performing a desired manipulation (forward kinematics) are also usually more difficult and can lead to multiple solutions.

Two examples of popular parallel robots are the [[Stewart platform]] and the [[Delta robot]].
