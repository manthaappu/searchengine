'''VTun''' is a networking application which can set up Virtual Tunnels over [[TCP/IP]] networks. It supports [[Internet Protocol]] (IP), [[Point-to-Point Protocol]] (PPP) and [[Serial Line Internet Protocol]] (SLIP) protocols. It exists as the reference implementation of the [[TUN/TAP|Tun/Tap]] user-space tunnel driver which was included in the [[Linux]] [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]] as of version 2.4, also originally developed by Maxim Krasnyansky.  Bishop Clark is the current maintainer.

==Networking==
Like most other applications of its nature, VTun creates a single connection between two machines, over which it multiplexes all traffic.  VTun connections are initiated via a TCP connection from the client to the server. The server then initiates a UDP connection to the client, if the UDP protocol is requested.

The software allows the creation of tunnels, for routing traffic in a manner similar to PPP, as well as a bridge-friendly ethertap connection.

==Authentication==
VTun uses a Private Shared Key to negotiate a handshake via a challenge and response.

==Non-SSL versions==
A continual source of concern, and the target of more than one strongly-worded security assessment, is that the VTun server and client binary applications can be completely built without [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]] support. When such binaries are used, the encryption between both endpoints is only a simple [[XOR cipher]], which is completely trivial to decode. This type of build is not supported by the developers.
