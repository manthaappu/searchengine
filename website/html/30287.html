'''''Prometheus Rising''''' is a book by [[Robert Anton Wilson]] first pusblished in [[1983]]. It is a guide book of "how to get from here to there", an amalgam of [[8-Circuit Model of Consciousness|Timothy Leary's 8-circuit model of consciousness]], [[Gurdjieff]]'s self-observation exercises, [[Alfred Korzybski]]'s [[general semantics]], [[Aleister Crowley]]'s [[thelema|magical theorems]], [[Sociobiology]], [[Yoga]], [[Christian Science]], [[principle of relativity|relativity]], and [[quantum mechanics]] amongst other approaches to understanding the world around us.

Claiming to be a short book (nearly 300 pages) about how the human mind works and how to get the most use from one, Wilson describes it as an "owner's manual for the human brain".

The book, which examines many aspects of social mind control and mental imprinting, provides mind exercises at the end of every chapter, with the goal of giving the reader more control over how one's mind works. The book, which has found many readers among followers of alternative culture,  also discusses the effect of certain [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive substances]] and how these affect the brain, [[tantra|tantric]] breathing techniques, and other methods and [[holism|holistic]] approaches to expanding consciousness.

Copyrighted and published in 1983, ''Prometheus Rising'' began as Wilson's [[Ph.D.]] dissertation called "The Evolution of Neuro-Sociological Circuits: A Contribution to the Sociobiology of Consciousness" in 1978-79 for [[Paideia University]]. In 1982, while in [[Ireland]], Wilson rewrote the manuscript for commercial publication, removing [[footnotes]], bolding up the style, adding chapters and exercises, and sketching out diagrams for the illustrations. Eventually Wilson submitted the work to [[New Falcon Publications]], which accepted it within 48 hours. Wilson received his advance 48 hours after that, according to his preface in the tenth printing of ''Prometheus Rising''.

The current edition also includes an introduction by [[Israel Regardie]].
