<html> <head> <title>NuSMV</title></head><body>'''NuSMV''' is an updated version of the [[Symbolic model verification|SMV]] symbolic [[model checker]].

NuSMV has been developed as a joint project between [[ITC-IRST]] ([http://www.itc.it/ Istituto Trentino di Cultura], [http://www.itc.it/irst/ Istituto per la Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica] in [[Trento]], [[Italy]]), [[Carnegie Mellon University]], the [[University of Genoa]] and the [[University of Trento]]. It is a reimplementation and extension of SMV, the first model checker based on [[Binary Decision Diagrams]] (BDDs). The tool has been designed as an open architecture for model checking. It is aimed at reliable verification of industrially sized designs, for use as a backend for other verification tools and as a research tool for formal verification techniques. 

'''NuSMV 2''' is [[open source]] software written in [[C (programming language)|C]]. It combines [[Binary_decision_diagram | BDD]]-based model checking with [[Boolean satisfiability problem|SAT]]-based model checking. It is maintained by [http://www.fbk.eu Fondazione Bruno Kessler], the successor organization of ITC-IRST.
