'''Universal Converter''' is a proprietary [[Conversion of units|unit  conversion]] [[Computer  software|software]] product<ref>[http://download.cnet.com/Universal-Converter/3000-2053_4-75000094.html?tag=contentMain;contentBody Universal Converter 2.1.7]</ref> which converts units across many different categories, some of which include [[acceleration]], [[speed]], [[weight]], [[length]], [[currency]], [[angles]], [[frequency]], [[temperature]], [[Fuel consumption in automobiles|fuel consumption]], [[shoe size]] and [[Roman numerals]]. Although it mainly  functions as a unit converter, it also offers categories for the conversion of [[language|languages]] and [[image  format|image formats]] among  others.<ref>[http://www.universalconverter.net/features.aspx Universal Converter  Features]</ref> Unit converters are generally [[standalone software]] products; they do not require any other  applications for them to operate. They work by converting units from one data  type to another that the user has  selected. Once the user has selected the  conversion categories and input the data  to convert, unit converters perform the  underlying task of multiplying the data entered (assuming that it is a numerical value) by the [[conversion factor]] to calculate the result. Universal Converter offers  automatic reporting, and allows users to format the result with [[Decimal separator|thousand separators]] or in [[Scientific notation|scientific  notation]].<ref>[http://www.softsea.com/review/Universal-Converter.html SoftSea - Universal Converter]</ref> Also, Universal Converter has extensive customisation options, including the  ability to change application themes and  modify how it shows the result by default.<ref>[http://www.softpedia.com/get/Others/Unit-Conversion/Anthony-Universal-Converter.shtml| Universal Converter 2.1.7 Info]</ref> Users can also download new additions to the program such as extra conversions and plugins from 'UC Online'<ref>[http://online.universalconverter.net/ UC Online]</ref>, a subsection of the Universal Converter website.
