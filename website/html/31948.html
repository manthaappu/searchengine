An [[SQL]] '''result set''' is a set of rows from a [[database]], as well as [[meta-information]] about the query such as the column names, and the types and sizes of each column.  Depending on the [[database system]], the number of rows in the result set may or may not be known.  Usually, this number is not known up front because the result set is built on-the-fly.  [[Precomputation]]s often impose undesired performance impacts.

A result set is effectively a table.  The [[order by (SQL)|<code>ORDER BY</code>]] clause can be used in a query to impose a certain sort condition on the rows.  Without that clause, there is no guarantee whatsoever on the order in which the rows are returned.
