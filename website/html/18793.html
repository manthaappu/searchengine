In [[computing]], '''inter-domain''' is a term used to describe [[interaction]] between [[domain]]s{{dn}}. It is most commonly used in the fields of [[multicast]]ing and [[routing]] between [[internet]]s, or as a substitute for the term [[inter-server]]. The term is also occasionally used in [[chemistry]], for example with regard to [[protein domains]].

Internet [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]]s that are focused on inter-domain functions include: [[Border Gateway Multicast Protocol]], [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]], [[Multicast Source Discovery Protocol]], and [[Protocol Independent Multicast]].

The opposite of inter-domain routing is ''intra-domain routing'': Routing ''within'' a domain or an [[autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous system]].
