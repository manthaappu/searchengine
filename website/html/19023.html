The '''''International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems''''' was founded in 1993 and is published bimonthly by [[World Scientific]]. It covers research on methodologies for the management of uncertainty. Topics include expositions on methods such as [[Bayesian]] and [[probabilistic method]]s, [[Non-standard model|nonstandard logic]], as well as applications, such as in [[image processing]], conflict resolution, and [[database]]s. The journal does not publish papers on pure [[fuzzy mathematics]], such as fuzzy topology or fuzzy algebra.
