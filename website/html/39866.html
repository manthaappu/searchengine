{{Modulation techniques}}

'''Wavelet modulation''', also known as '''fractal modulation''', is a [[modulation]] technique that makes use of [[Wavelet|wavelet transformations]] to represent the data being transmitted. One of the objectives of this type of modulation is to send data at multiple rates over a [[channel (communications)|channel]] that is unknown. If the channel is not clear for one specific [[bit rate]], meaning that the signal will not be received, the signal can be sent at a different bit rate where the [[signal to noise ratio]] is higher.
