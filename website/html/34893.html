<html> <head> <title>Socratic questioning</title></head><body>{{Refimprove|date=September 2010}}'''Socratic questioning''' is disciplined [[question]]ing that can be used to pursue [[thought]] in many directions and for many purposes, including: to explore complex ideas, to get to the [[truth]] of things, to open up issues and problems, to uncover assumptions, to analyze concepts, to distinguish what we know from what we don't know, and to follow out logical implications of thought. The key to distinguishing Socratic questioning from questioning per se is that Socratic questioning is systematic, disciplined, and deep, and usually focuses on foundational concepts, principles, theories, issues, or problems.

Socratic questioning is referred to in [[teaching]], and has gained currency in as a concept in [[education]] particularly in the past two decades.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

According to Paul and Elder (The Art of Socratic Questioning, 2006), teachers, students, or indeed anyone interested in probing thinking at a deep level can and should construct Socratic questions and engage in [[Socratic dialogue]].

When teachers use Socratic questioning in teaching, their purpose may be to probe student thinking, to determine the extent of student knowledge on a given topic, issue or subject, to model Socratic questioning for students, or to help students analyze a concept or line of reasoning. Students should learn the discipline of Socratic questioning so that they begin to use it in reasoning through complex issues, in understanding and assessing the thinking of others, and in following-out the implications of what they, and others think.

In teaching, then, teachers can use Socratic questioning for at least two purposes:
# To deeply probe student thinking, to help students begin to distinguish what they know or understand from what they do not know or understand (and to help them develop intellectual humility in the process).
# To foster students' abilities to ask Socratic questions, to help students acquire the powerful tools of Socratic dialogue, so that they can use these tools in everyday life (in questioning themselves and others). To this end, teachers can model the questioning strategies they want students to emulate and employ. Moreover, teachers need to directly teach students how to construct and ask deep questions. Beyond that, students need practice to improve their questioning abilities.

Socratic questioning illuminates the importance of questioning in learning (indeed [[Socrates]] himself thought that questioning was the only defensible form of teaching). It illuminates the difference between systematic and fragmented thinking. It teaches us to dig beneath the surface of our ideas. It teaches us the value of developing questioning minds in cultivating deep learning.  Stephen Cox and Andy Griffith, UK based educational trainers, argue that integrating Socratic questioning techniques in the classroom is essential to developing active, independent learners.  They identify 6 categories of questions: <ref>Cox and Griffith 'Outstanding Teaching' http://osiriseducational.co.uk/outstandingteaching/news/questions-questions-questions/</ref>


'''1. Getting Students to clarify their thinking''' 
e.g. 'Why do you say that?', 'Could you explain further?'

'''2.''' '''Challenging students about assumptions'''
e.g. 'Is this always the case?', 'Why do you think that this assumption holds here?'

'''3.''' '''Evidence as a basis for argument'''
e.g. 'Why do you say that?', 'Is there reason to doubt this evidence?'

'''4.''' '''Alternative viewpoints and perspectives'''
e.g. 'What is the counter argument for?', 'Can/did anyone see this another way?'

'''5.''' '''Implications and consequences'''
e.g. 'But if what happened, what else would result?', 'How does...affect...?'

'''6.''' '''Question the question'''
e.g.'Why do you think that I asked that question?', 'Why was that question important?', 'Which of your questions turned out to be the most useful?'


The art of Socratic questioning is intimately connected with [[critical thinking]] because the art of questioning is important to excellence of thought. What the word "Socratic" adds to the art of questioning is systematicity, depth, and an abiding interest in assessing the truth or plausibility of things.

Both critical thinking and Socratic questioning share a common end. Critical thinking provides the conceptual tools for understanding how the mind functions in its pursuit of meaning and truth; Socratic questioning employs those tools in framing questions essential to the pursuit of meaning and truth.

The goal of critical thinking is to establish an additional level of thinking to our thinking, a powerful inner voice of reason, that monitors, assesses, and reconstitutes—in a more rational direction—our thinking, feeling, and action. Socratic discussion cultivates that inner voice through an explicit focus on self-directed, disciplined questioning.

Socratic questioning has also been used in [[therapy]], most notably in [[cognitive therapy]] and [[Classical Adlerian psychotherapy]]. The purpose here is to help uncover the assumptions and evidence that underpin people's thoughts in respect of problems. Careful use of Socratic questioning enables a therapist to challenge a person's illogical thinking while maintaining an open position that respects the internal logic to even the most seemingly illogical thoughts.
