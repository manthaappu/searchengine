'''Keith Packard''' (born April 16, 1963) is a [[software developer]], best known for his work on the [[X Window System]].

Packard is responsible for many X extensions and technical papers on X. He has been heavily involved in the development of X since the late 1980s as a member of the [[MIT X Consortium]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20040414/vanderbeek_03.shtml|title=Monitoring Your Console's Memory Usage, Part One|accessdate=26 February 2010}}</ref> [[XFree86]] and the [[X.Org Foundation]].

== Career ==

Packard gained a BA in [[mathematics]] from [[Reed College]], [[Oregon]] in 1986. He worked at [[Tektronix, Inc.]] in [[Wilsonville, Oregon]] designing [[X terminal]]s and [[Unix]] [[computer workstation|workstation]]s from 1983 until 1988.

He then moved to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] to work at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] X Consortium from 1988 to 1992, developing the X Window System reference implementation and [[standardization|standard]]s as the senior member of a small team. He was responsible for X releases at this time.

In 1992 he moved to [[Portland, Oregon]] to work for [[Network Computing Devices]] on X terminals and computer graphics.

From 1999 he worked for [[SuSE]] from his home in [[Portland, Oregon]] on the [[XFree86]] implementation of X.

He worked at the Cambridge Research Labs of [[Compaq]] (and then [[Hewlett-Packard]]) from 2001 until 2005 when the lab closed down.

In 2003 he was ejected from [[XFree86]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1016-993597.html|title=Schism hits key open-source group|accessdate=26 February 2010}}</ref>  This led to the formation of the successful [[X.Org Server]] [[fork (software)|fork]].  He is now project lead on the [[X.Org Server|X.org]] project, the official [[reference implementation (computing)|reference implementation]] of the X Window System.

Packard became a [[Debian]] Developer in 2004, maintaining [[fontconfig]] (as well as being the upstream maintainer) and other packages.

Packard began working for [[Intel]] in August 2006.
