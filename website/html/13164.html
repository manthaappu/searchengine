'''FUSE Message Broker''' is an open source [[Java Message Service|JMS]] message broker that is based on [[Apache ActiveMQ]] for use in enterprise IT organizations.  It is certified, productized and fully supported by the people who wrote the code. FUSE Message Broker is the JMS platform for scalable, high-performance SOA infrastructure to connect processes across heterogeneous systems.

FUSE Message Broker delivers large amounts of data efficiently and reliably. Performance testing has shown that FUSE Message Broker exhibits the highest performance of any open source messaging platform, and has clustering and failover to ensure high availability. 

FUSE Message Broker is part of a family of open source SOA infrastructure tools that include [[FUSE ESB]] (enterprise release of [[Apache ServiceMix]]), [[FUSE Services Framework]] (enterprise release of [[Apache CXF]]) and [[FUSE Mediation Router]] (enterprise release of [[Apache Camel]]).
