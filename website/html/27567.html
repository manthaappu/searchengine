'''Open source intelligence''' ('''OSINT''') is a form of [[intelligence collection management]] that involves finding, selecting, and acquiring information from publicly available sources and analyzing it to produce actionable [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]]. In the [[Intelligence agency|intelligence community]] (IC), the term "open" refers to overt, publicly available sources (as opposed to covert or classified sources); it is not related to [[open-source software]] or public intelligence.

==Open sources for intelligence==
OSINT includes a wide variety of information and sources:
* [[Media (communication)|Media]]: newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and computer-based information.
* [[Web 2.0|Web-based communities]] and [[user generated content]]: social-networking sites, [[video hosting service|video sharing sites]], wikis, blogs, and [[folksonomies]].
* [[Public data]]: government reports, official data such as budgets, demographics, hearings, legislative debates, press conferences, speeches, marine and aeronautical safety warnings, environmental impact statements and contract awards.
* Observation and reporting: amateur airplane spotters, radio monitors and [[amateur satellite observer|satellite observer]]s among many others have provided significant information not otherwise available. The availability of worldwide satellite photography, often of high resolution, on the Web (e.g., Google Earth) has expanded open source capabilities into areas formerly available only to major intelligence services.
* Professional and academic: conferences, symposia, professional associations, academic papers, and subject matter experts.<ref>Lowenthal, Mark M. ''Intelligence: From Secrets to Policy'', 2nd Ed. (Washington, D.C.: CQ Press, 2003) p. 79.</ref>
* Most information has geospatial dimensions, but many often overlook the geospatial side of OSINT: not all open source data is unstructured text.  Examples of geospatial open source include hard and softcopy maps, atlases, gazetteers, port plans, gravity data, aeronautical data, navigation data, geodetic data, human terrain data (cultural and economic), environmental data, commercial imagery, [[LIDAR]], hyper and multi-spectral data, airborne imagery, geo-names, geo-features, urban terrain, vertical obstruction data, boundary marker data, geospatial [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashups]], [[spatial database]]s, and [[web services]]. Most of the geospatial data mentioned above is integrated, analyzed, and syndicated using geospatial software like a [[GIS|Geographic Information System]] (GIS) not a browser ''per se''.

OSINT is distinguished from research in that it applies the [[process of intelligence]] to create tailored knowledge supportive of a specific decision by a specific individual or group.<ref>{{cite web |title=Spy Agencies Turn to Newspapers, NPR, and Wikipedia for Information: The intelligence community is learning to value 'open-source' information |url=http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/national/2008/09/12/spy-agencies-turn-to-newspapers-npr-and-wikipedia-for-information.html |accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref>

==Definers for OSINT==
OSINT is defined by both the U.S. [[Director of National Intelligence]] and the U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD), as "produced from publicly available information that is collected, exploited, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience for the purpose of addressing a specific intelligence requirement."<ref>[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ163.109 As defined in Sec. 931 of Public Law 109-163, entitled, "National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006."]</ref>

OSINT is, as of 2005, defined by the U.S. [[Office of Management and Budget]] under the category of "Forces And Direct Support" and specifically for the DoD under Commercial Code M320 as<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/procurement/fair/2005_fair/2005_inv_function_codes.html  FAIR Act Inventory Commercial Activities Inventory Function Codes]</ref>
:''Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Collection/Processing''
A wide variety of vendors sell information products specifically within this category.

Open source intelligence under one name or another has been around for hundreds of years. The significance today of OSINT in the USA is the conflict between military, government and the private sector as to how the bulk of intelligence should be obtained. With the Internet, instant communications, and advanced media search the bulk of actionable and predictive intelligence can be obtained from public, unclassified sources. Government agencies have been slow to embrace OSINT, or believe they already have suitable information feeds from the media, academia and public records.

OSINT is especially helpful in addressing [[global coverage]], a term encompassing all of the countries and topics that are not considered by the secret or national security worlds to be "vital."  Until recently, that included terrorism.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Competitive intelligence==
In the private sector [[competitive intelligence]], focused and directed to specific industries still has opportunities for small and medium businesses to compete in niche markets, but that too is being consolidated by the major information providers. In the media OSINT is considered as nothing new, the everyday operation of a traditional newsroom. [[Investigative journalist]]s use searches, databases, primary interviews, sources, and leaks to write every feature.

==Risks for practitioners==
Accredited journalists have some protection in asking questions, and researching for recognized media outlets. Even so they can be imprisoned, even executed, for seeking out OSINT. Private individuals illegally collecting data for a foreign military or intelligence agency is considered [[espionage]] in most countries. Of course, espionage that is not treason (i.e. betraying one's country of citizenship) has been a tool of statecraft since ancient times, is widely engaged in by nearly all countries, and is considered an honorable trade. Most countries recognize this, and if their counterintelligence agencies capture a foreign spy, that spy is usually unceremoniously deported or traded back to their homeland (for other spies) after a hostile debriefing; actual execution or refusal to trade back foreign spies with non-official cover would result in consequences in bilateral relations of the gravest possible magnitude, being an extraordinarily hostile act, even if those consequences were unofficially and extrajudicially imposed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

==Value==
According to the [[Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction]] report submitted in March 2005, OSINT must be included in the all-source intelligence process for the following reasons (as stated in the report):

#The ever-shifting nature of our intelligence needs compels the IC to quickly and easily understand a wide range of foreign countries and cultures. - … today’s threats are rapidly changing and geographically diffuse; it is a fact of life that an intelligence analyst may be forced to shift rapidly from one topic to the next. Increasingly, IC professionals need to quickly assimilate social, economic, and cultural information about a country—information often detailed in open sources.
#Open source information provides a base for understanding classified materials. Despite large quantities of classified material produced by the IC, the amount of classified information produced on any one topic can be quite limited, and may be taken out of context if viewed only from a classified-source perspective. Perhaps the most important example today relates to terrorism, where open source information can fill gaps and create links that allow analysts to better understand fragmented intelligence, rumored terrorist plans, possible means of attack, and potential targets.
#Open source materials can protect sources and methods. Sometimes an intelligence judgment that is actually informed with sensitive, classified information can be defended on the basis of open source reporting. This can prove useful when policymakers need to explain policy decisions or communicate with foreign officials without compromising classified sources.
#Only open source can ''store history.'' A robust open source program can, in effect, gather data to monitor the world’s cultures and how they change with time. This is difficult, if not impossible, using the ''snapshots'' provided by classified collection methods.<ref>(The Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities, 378-379). [[Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction]]</ref>

==Process==
Information collection in OSINT is generally a different problem from collection in other intelligence disciplines where obtaining the raw information to be analyzed may be the major difficulty, particularly if it is to be obtained from non-cooperative targets. In OSINT, the chief difficulty is in identifying relevant, reliable sources from the vast amount of publicly available information. However, this is not as great a challenge for those who know how to access local knowledge and how to leverage human experts who can create new tailored knowledge on the fly.

==History==
The [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]] (FBIS) was created in 1941 to access and exploit OSINT in relation to World War II.  A classic example of their value and success is reflected in the price of oranges in Paris as an indicator of whether railroad bridges had been bombed successfully.

The recent history of OSINT began in 1988 when General [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.]], Commandant of the Marine Corps, called for a redirection of US intelligence away from the collapsing Soviet Union and toward non-state actors and Third World zones of instability.  Additionally, he pointed out that most of the intelligence which needs to be known could be obtained via OSINT, and recommended a substantive increase in resources for this aspect of the intelligence collection spectrum of sources.<ref>General Alfred M. Gray, "Global Intelligence Challenges in the 1990's", [[American Intelligence Journal]] (Winter 1989-1990)</ref>

In the fall of 1992, Senator [[David Boren]], then Chairman of the [[Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]], sponsored the National Security Act of 1992, attempting to achieve modest reform in the U.S. Intelligence Community.  His counterpart on the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] was Congressman [[Dave McCurdy]]. The House version of the legislation included a separate Open Source Office, at the suggestion of Larry Prior, a Marine Reservist familiar with the [[Marine Corps Intelligence Command|MCIC]] experience and then serving on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence staff.

The [[Aspin-Brown Commission]] stated in 1996 that US access to open sources was "severely deficient" and that this should be a "top priority" for both funding and DCI attention.

In issuing its July 2004 report, the [[9/11 Commission]] recommended the creation of an open-source intelligence agency, but without further detail or comment.<ref>See page 413 of the [http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_FM.pdf 9-11 Commission Report (pdf)].</ref> Subsequently, the [[Iraq Intelligence Commission|WMD Commission]] (also known as the Robb-Silberman Commission) report in March 2005 recommended the creation of an Open Source Directorate at the CIA.

Following these recommendations, in November 2005 the [[United States Director of National Intelligence|Director of National Intelligence]] announced the creation of the DNI [[Open Source Center]]. The Center was established to collect information available from "the Internet, databases, press, radio, television, video, geospatial data, photos and commercial imagery."<ref>Office of the Director of National Intelligence. "[http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/20051108_release.htm ODNI Announces Establishment of Open Source Center]". Press release, 8 November 2005.</ref> In addition to collecting openly available information, it would train analysts to make better use of this information. The Center absorbed the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s previously existing [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]] (FBIS), originally established in 1941, with FBIS head [[Douglas Naquin]] named as director of the Center.<ref>Ensor, David. "[http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/08/sr.tues/ The Situation Report: Open source intelligence center]". ''CNN'', 8 November 2005.</ref>

In December 2005, the Director of National Intelligence appointed [[Eliot A. Jardines]] as the [[Assistant Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Open Source]] to serve as the Intelligence Community's senior intelligence officer for open source and to provide strategy, guidance and oversight for the [[National Open Source Enterprise]].<ref>Office of the Director of National Intelligence "[http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/20051207_release.htm ODNI Senior Leadership Announcement]". Press release, 7 December 2005.</ref>  Mr. Jardines has established the National Open Source Enterprise<ref>[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b4/NationalOpenSourceEnterprise.pdf "National Open Source Entreprise Vision Statement"] May 2006</ref> and authored Intelligence Community Directive 301.  In 2008, Mr. Jardines returned to the private sector and was succeeded by [[Dan Butler (civil servant)|Dan Butler]] who is ADDNI/OS<ref>[http://www.dniopensource.org/Conference/Agenda.aspx DNI Open Source Conference 2008 "Decision Advantage" agenda, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, July 2008.]</ref> and previously Mr. Jardines' Senior Advisor for Policy.<ref>[http://www.dniopensource2007.com/sessions.cfm DNI Open Source Conference 2007 "Expanding the Horizons" agenda, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, July 2007.]</ref>

==OSINT Communities==
===Government===
There are a large number of open source activities taking place throughout the US Government.  Frequently, these open source activities are described as "media monitoring", "media analysis", "internet research" and "public surveys" but are open source nonetheless.

The [[Library of Congress]] sponsors the [[Federal Research Division]] (FRD) which conducts a great deal of tailored open source research on a fee-for-service basis for the executive branch.

===Intelligence===
The US Intelligence Community's open source activities (known as the [[National Open Source Enterprise]]) are dictated by Intelligence Community Directive 301 promulgated by the Director of National Intelligence.<ref>DNI Intelligence Community Directive 301 - [http://www.fas.org/irp/dni/icd/icd-301.pdf "National Open Source Enterprise"] 11 July 2006.</ref>  The Directive establishes the authorities and responsibilities of the Assistant Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Open Source (ADDNI/OS), the DNI's Open Source Center and the National Open Source Committee.

Prior to the establishment of the National Open Source Enterprise, the [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]] (FBIS), established in 1941, was the government's primary open source unit, transcribing and translating foreign broadcasts. It absorbed the Defense Department's [[Joint Publications Research Service]] (JPRS), which did a similar function with foreign printed materials, including newspapers, magazines, and technical journals.

===Military===
The former [[Under-Secretary of Defense for Intelligence]], Dr. [[Stephen Cambone]] encouraged in part by the [[Defense Science Board]] reports on [[Strategic Communication]] and [[Transition to and From Hostilities]], created the Defense Open Source Program (DOSP).  The current Under-Secretary of Defense for Intelligence assigned executive agency for this program to the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]].

U.S. military offices that engage in OSINT activities include:

*Defense Intelligence Agency
*[[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]
*[[Foreign Military Studies Office|US Army Foreign Military Studies Office]]
*US Army Asian Studies Detachment
*[http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/dod/eucom/jac/ EUCOM JAC Molesworth]
*Open Source Branch, Joint Intelligence Center, [[U.S. Special Operations Command]]
*Foreign Media Monitoring in Support of Information Operations, [[U.S. Strategic Command]]

===Homeland Security===
The [[Department of Homeland Security]] has an active open source intelligence unit. In congressional testimony before the House Homeland Security Committee's Intelligence, Information Sharing and Terrorism Risk Assessment Subcommittee the Undersecretary of Homeland Security Charles Allen indicated on February 14, 2007, that he had established the "Domestic Open Source Enterprise" to support the Department's OSINT needs and that of state, local and tribal partners.

===Law enforcement===
The law enforcement OSINT community applies open source intelligence (OSINT) to the prediction, prevention, investigation, and prosecution of criminals including terrorists.

Examples of successful law enforcement OSINT include [[Scotland Yard]] OSINT; [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) OSINT.

[[INTERPOL]] and [[EUROPOL]] experimented with OSINT units for a time, but they appear to have atrophied with the departure of their individual champions.

New York Police Department (NYPD) is known to have an OSINT unit, as does the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, housed within the Emergency Operations Bureau and affiliated with the LA Joint Regional Intelligence Center.

===Business===
Business OSINT encompasses [[Commercial Intelligence]], [[Competitor Intelligence]], and [[Business Intelligence]], and is often a chief area of practice of [[private intelligence agency|private intelligence agencies]].

Businesses may use [[information broker]]s and [[private investigator]]s  to collect and analyze relevant information for business purposes which may include the [[Mass media|media]], [[deep web]], [[web 2.0]] and commercial content.
