At the peak of its existence the botnet was responsible for 8-10% of all the [[e-mail spam|spam]] sent worldwide. <ref name=m86/>

== Dismantling and revival ==
Around early January 2010 the botnet was dismantled by [[Neustar]] employees, who contacted various [[Lethic]] [[internet service providers]] in a bid to take control of the botnet's command and control servers. <ref name=theregisterundead>http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/02/17/spam_botnet_trends/</ref><ref name=theregister>http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/01/13/lethic_botnet_takedown/</ref><ref name=darkreading>{{cite web|url=http://www.darkreading.com/insiderthreat/security/vulnerabilities/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=222300408&cid=nl_DR_DAILY_2010-01-12_h |title=More Researchers Going On The Offensive To Kill Botnets |publisher=DarkReading |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}</ref><ref name=bbc>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8570993.stm |title=Spammers survive botnet shutdowns |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-03-18 |accessdate=2010-08-28}}</ref>. This move temporarily caused the botnets' spam to decrease to a trickle of its original volume <ref name=m86takedown>{{cite web|url=http://www.m86security.com/labs/i/Lethic-botnet--The-Takedown,trace.1216~.asp |title=Lethic botnet - The Takedown |publisher=M86 Security |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}</ref>.

In February 2010 the owners of the botnet managed to re-establish control over the botnet, through the use of new command and control servers located in the [[United States]]. The takedown has decreased the spam volume of the botnet, however. As of February 2010 the botnets' amount of spam was down to a third of its original <ref name=m86back/>. As of April 2010 the botnet has an estimated 1.5% share of the spam market, sending about 2 billion spam messages a day. <ref name=messagelabs/>
