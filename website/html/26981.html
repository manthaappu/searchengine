The '''Objeck''' programming language is a modern object-oriented computing language with functional features.  The programming environment consists of a compiler, virtual machine ([[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collector]] and [[Just-in-time compilation|JIT]] compiler) along with a command-line debugger.

==Background==
The programming environment originally grew from a prototype that was created to investigate the process of translating stack instructions into register instructions and finally into machine code.  From that prototype, a small virtual machine was developed along with a simple assembler. The project adopted the name Objeck after the assembler was replaced by a much more complex object-oriented/functional front-end. 

The language itself has ties with [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] and indirectly [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]. Today the system is generally considered stable.  The current development fouces is on features that make object-oriented and functional programming lighter-weight.

==Example==
Below is an example of the [["Hello world" program]]:

<source lang="cpp">
bundle Default {
  class SayHello{
    function : Main(args : String[]) ~ Nil {
      "Hello World!"->PrintLine();
    }
  }
}
</source>
