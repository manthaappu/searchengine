== Diabetes awareness programs ==
{{advert|section|date=September 2010}}
The Diabetes Hands Foundation has developed diabetes awareness programs such as Word In Your Hand, the Big Blue Test, No-Sugar Added Poetry and Making Sense of Diabetes.

=== Word in Your Hand ===
The Word in Your Hand project invites participants to share photos showing a word in their hands describing life with diabetes. Through the project, people with diabetes along with their family, friends and caregivers describe their feelings towards diabetes.<ref>[http://diabeteshandsfoundation.org/Diabetes_Hands_Foundation/Diabetes_Hands_Foundation__|__Our_Work_|__Awareness_Initiatives___|__Word_in_Your_Hand.html  Word in Your Hand initiative]</ref> DHF licensed the Word in Your Hand trademark to [[LifeScan, Inc.]] and their [[OneTouch]] brand, for use as part of its Global Diabetes Handprint Campaign.<ref>[http://www.diabeteshealth.com/read/2008/10/27/5953/lifescan-launches-diabetes-handprint-project-/ LifeScan Launches Diabetes Handprint Project]</ref>

=== Big Blue Test ===
The Big Blue Test first took place on November 14, 2009<ref>[http://forecast.diabetes.org/magazine/only-online/big-blue-test-worldwide-diabetes-test The Big Blue Test: Worldwide Diabetes Test-In]</ref>, [[World Diabetes Day]]. During the Big Blue Test, at 14:00 hours (local time), people with diabetes test their blood sugar levels, exercise for 14 minutes, test again and share their results. The event is called The Big Blue Test because blue is the color associated with World Diabetes Day. The program aims to both unite people with diabetes and raise awareness about diabetes and the importance of exercise in diabetes management every November 14<ref>[http://www.worlddiabetesday.org/en/news/three-months-to-go-to-world-diabetes-day-1 Three months to go to World Diabetes Day!]</ref>. In 2010, the Big Blue Test was promoted through a video<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkLHgK94Z0E Do the BiG Blue Test, on World Diabetes Day]</ref> that received more than 120,000 views.

=== No-Sugar Added Poetry ===
No-Sugar Added Poetry is a book of diabetes poems<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/no-sugar-added-poetry-book-tells-diabetes-like-it-is-99754254.html No-Sugar Added Poetry Book Tells Diabetes Like It Is]</ref> written by members of TuDiabetes.org with a foreword by William H. Polonsky, founder of the [[Behavioral Diabetes Institute]].

=== Making Sense of Diabetes ===
To raise diabetes awareness and in preparation for World Diabetes Day 2009 on November 14, the foundation held the Making Sense of Diabetes video contest.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/booster_shots/2009/09/competition-whats-diabetes-like-to-live-with-make-a-movie.html What's diabetes like to live with? Make a movie.]</ref> It sought video entries about life with diabetes through one of the five senses: sight, hearing, taste, touch and smell. It produced a compilation video<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29bng1H4XTs Making Sense of Diabetes video]</ref>, showcasing footage from some of the videos for each of the senses.
