A '''Universal Interface Language''' is a language that allows for an interchange of deep information between [[Object (computer science)|objects]]. It does this by allowing an object to experiment on another object to determine what it thinks the object is capable of.

The concept was introduced by [[Alan Kay]] as early as 1997 in his keynote speech at [[OOPSLA]].

The goal of a Universal Interface Language is to achieve (automatic) interoperability beyond that provided by an [[Interface description language]] such as [[CORBA]] or a message exchange protocol such as [[Simple Object Access Protocol|SOAP]].

There are currently no known implementations of a Universal Interface Language. Based on [[Alan Kay|Kay]]'s description, we would expect each object involved in the conversation to have a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] or [[IP address]].
