The '''Great Seal of Canada''' ({{lang-fr|Grand Sceau du Canada}}) is a [[seal (device)|seal]] used for official purposes of state in [[Canada]] such as the certification of [[Acts of Parliament]] that have been granted [[Royal Assent]].

The first Great Seal of Canada was carved in [[United Kingdom]] in 1869 and sent to Canada to replace a temporary seal which had been used since [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867; it depicted [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] seated beneath a canopy.

Old seals are destroyed whenever a new [[monarch]] takes the throne. The current Great Seal was made at the [[Royal Canadian Mint]] when [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] succeeded her father in 1952 and it went into use in 1955. The seal is made of specially tempered steel, weighs 3.75 [[kilogram]]s, and is 127 millimetres in diameter. The image depicts the Queen enthroned and robed, holding the [[Sovereign's Orb|orb]] and [[Sceptre with the Cross|sceptre]], and shows her sitting on the coronation chair with the 1957 version of the [[Arms of Canada|Royal Arms of Canada]] in front, and is incribed ''REINE DU CANADA{{mdash}} ELIZABETH II{{mdash}} QUEEN OF CANADA''. The inscriptions on it are in French and English. Previous Great Seals of Canada were inscribed in Latin.

While the [[Governor General of Canada|governor general]] is the keeper of the Great Seal, the Queen's representative places it in the protection of the [[Registrar General of Canada]]. Each of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] also has its own seal for similar purposes, kept by the [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|lieutenant governor]] of each respective provinces.
