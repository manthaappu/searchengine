'''James Leonard Brierley Smith''' (26 October 1897{{ndash}}7 January 1968) was a [[South Africa]]n [[ichthyology|ichthyologist]].  He was the first to identify a taxidermied fish as a [[coelacanth]], at the time thought long extinct.

==Early life==
Born in [[Graaff Reinet]], Smith obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in Chemistry from the [[University of the Cape of Good Hope]] in 1916 and an [[Master of Science|MSc]] degree in Chemistry at [[Stellenbosch University]] in 1918. Smith went to the [[United Kingdom]], were he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] at [[Cambridge University]] in 1922. After returning to South Africa, he became Senior Lecturer and later on an Associate Professor of Organic Chemistry at [[Rhodes University]] in [[Grahamstown]]. Here he met his second wife Margaret Mary McDonald. His interest in ichthyology was sparked in childhood during a vacation in [[Knysna]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Clymer|first=Eleanor|title=Search for a Living Fossil|publisher=Scholastic|date=1966|page=15}}</ref>

==Discovery of the coelacanth==
In 1938 Smith was informed of the discovery of an unusual and unidentified fish by [[Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer]], curator of the [[East London, South Africa|East London]] Museum. When he arrived in East London in February 1939, he was able to identify it immediately as a [[coelacanth]], which was then thought to have been extinct for over 65 million years, and he named the species ''Latimeria'' after her. He was instrumental in organising the search which provided science with the second specimen of the species 14 years later.

Smith and his wife Margaret worked jointly on the popular ''Sea Fishes of South Africa'', which was first published in 1949, followed by other writings until 1968. Among these were over 500 papers on fish and the naming of some 370 new fish species.

==Death and legacy==
Smith took his own life in 1968 by [[cyanide]] poisoning, following a long illness.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1097925/Curse-fish-time-forgot-Believed-extinct-65million-years--returned-chilling-consequences.html|title=Curse of the fish that time forgot: Believed to be extinct for 65million years - it returned with chilling consequences|last=Weinberg|first=Samantha|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=2 May 2009}}</ref> His widow Margaret founded the [[South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity|Institute of Ichthyology]] in Grahamstown. His son is the renowned South African [[television]] science and mathematics teacher [[William Smith (South African)|William Smith]].
