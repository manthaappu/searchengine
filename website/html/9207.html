'''Daniel Robbins''' (US citizen, born in Montreal, Quebec<ref>{{fr}} [http://www.funtoo-quebec.org/node/19 Funtoo-Quebec.org source]</ref>) is a [[computer programmer]] and consultant best known as the founder and former chief architect of the [[Gentoo Linux]] project. In 2008, he launched the [[Funtoo|Funtoo project]], a [[free software|free]] [[GNU/Linux distribution]] based on Gentoo, and is the project's lead hacker and organizer. He also currently works at the same time in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], as engineer at [[OPNET]], and as president for [[Funtoo Technologies]].

==Biography==
=== Background ===
During his time as a system administrator at the [[University of New Mexico]] in [[Albuquerque]] Robbins first came into contact with Linux. He became a developer on [[Stampede Linux]], and later formed his own distribution ''Enoch Linux'', which was later renamed [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]] in 2002.

===Free Software===
==== Gentoo Linux ====
The [[Gentoo Linux]] distribution created enormous interest almost immediately. It remains by far{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} the most high-profile [[:Category:Source-based Linux distributions|source-based Linux distribution]], and the quality of its documentation, and friendliness of its forums have been widely praised.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

====Gentoo Foundation====
However, like many other [[free software]] projects, Gentoo struggled to create a [[business model]] which would support its key developers.<ref>{{cite web|first= Eugenia |last= Loli-Queru |authorlink= Eugenia Loli-Queru |title= Interview with Gentoo's Daniel Robbins |url= http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=1080 |archiveurl= |publisher= [[OSNews]] |doi= |date= 2002-05-14 |archivedate= |accessdate= 2009-04-17 |quote= I very much want to find a way to turn the Gentoo Linux project into a profitable enterprise. My main motivation in wanting to do this is so I can stop living from paycheck to paycheck and focus my professional efforts exclusively on Gentoo Linux development. Many of our developers would like to do the same thing. }}</ref> Robbins resigned as Chief Architect on 26 April 2004,<ref>{{cite web|first= timothy |last= Lord |title= Interview with Gentoo's Daniel Robbins |url= http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/04/26/2259211 |archiveurl= |publisher= [[Slashdot]] |doi= |date= 2004-04-26 |archivedate= |accessdate= 2009-04-17 }}</ref> citing considerable personal debt,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.nfp/65 |title=Mail To News And Back Again |publisher=Gmane |date=2004-04-26 |accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref> and a desire to spend more time with his family, formed the [[Gentoo Foundation]] and transferred all Gentoo [[intellectual property]] to it, so that Gentoo is now run as a full community-based model. He did rejoin the project for a short time from August 2006,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.funtoo.org/drobbins/blog/2006/08/working-on-gentoo-again-eek.html |title=Funtoo by Daniel Robbins |publisher=Funtoo.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145649#c0 |title=Gentoo Bug 145649 - Retire (once more): Daniel Robbins (drobbins) |publisher=Bugs.gentoo.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref> becoming a developer again in February 2007 and joining the amd64 team<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145649#c17 |title=Gentoo Bug 145649 - Retire (once more): Daniel Robbins (drobbins) |publisher=Bugs.gentoo.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref> but resigned in early March 2007.<ref>[http://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-dev/msg_143167.xml ]{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}</ref>

There have been several high-profile criticisms<ref>{{cite web|url=http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20070312#future |title=Put the fun back into computing. Use Linux, BSD |publisher=DistroWatch.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://linux.slashdot.org/linux/07/03/12/1154242.shtml |title=Slashdot &#124; Is Gentoo in crisis? |publisher=Linux.slashdot.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref> of the way Gentoo has run since Robbins left, such as: "...since the resignation of Gentoo's founder and benevolent dictator from the project in 2004, the newly established Gentoo Foundation has been battling with lack of clear directions and frequent developer conflicts...",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major |title=Put the fun back into computing. Use Linux, BSD |publisher=DistroWatch.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref> but in mid-July 2007 it emerged that Robbins was still technically the legal president of the Gentoo Foundation:<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://blog.funtoo.org/2007/07/i-am-still-president-of-gentoo.html |title=Funtoo by Daniel Robbins: I am still President of the Gentoo Foundation? |publisher=Blog.funtoo.org |date=2007-07-18 |accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref><ref>http://www.nmprc.state.nm.us/cgi-bin/prcdtl.cgi?2463313+GENTOO+FOUNDATION+INC</ref>

<blockquote>
...I would like to see more fun in Gentoo, and a lot less politics, and in my apparent role as President of the Gentoo Foundation, I may have an opportunity to change things for the better. I will need to look into this more...<ref name=autogenerated1 />
</blockquote>

====Funtoo Linux====
In 2008, Robbins began to work on [[Funtoo]], a project created to allow him to work on extending the technologies originally created for Gentoo.<ref>http://www.funtoo.org/en/funtoo/about/</ref>

===Technical writer===
He has also been a fairly prolific [[technical writer]], writing well-regarded tutorials for [[International Business Machines|IBM]] and the Gentoo project, among others.

===Professional experience===
==== Microsoft ====
Robbins' move to [[Microsoft]], on 13 June 2005, attracted attention<ref>{{cite web|url=http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/13/2137239&tid=109 |title=Slashdot &#124; Gentoo Founder on his way to Redmond |publisher=Linux.slashdot.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Marson |first=Ingrid |url=http://news.com.com/Gentoo+Linux+founder+to+educate+Microsoft/2100-7344_3-5749482.html |title=Gentoo Linux founder to 'educate' Microsoft &#124; CNET News.com |publisher=News.com.com |date=2005-06-16 |accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref> within the Linux community, which has historically had a combative relationship with Microsoft. He described his role working for [[Bill Hilf]] as "...helping Microsoft to understand Open Source and community-based projects..."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=10838 |title=Gentoo Founder Joins Microsoft |publisher=Osnews.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref>

However, Robbins resigned less than a year later on 16 January 2006 due to frustrations that he was unable to fully utilize his technical skills in this position. His new job is at [[ABC Codes|ABC Coding Solutions]] where he will be focused on building in .NET on Windows.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ingrid Marson ZDNet.co.uk |url=http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/linuxunix/0,39020390,39252292,00.htm |title=Gentoo Linux founder quits Microsoft — ZDNet UK |publisher=News.zdnet.co.uk |date=2006-02-14 |accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref>

====RTLinux====
Later in 2006, he joined [[FSMLabs]] in Socorro, New Mexico, to work on [[RTLinux]].

====Another experience====
* [[E*TRADE]] (Aug 2007 to June 2009).
* [[OPNET]] (Aug 2009–Present).

===Funtoo Technologies===
Daniel Robbins is also president of [[Funtoo Technologies]], a consulting firm founded in 2006 and located in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]].
