One of the greatest benefits brought about by ebooks software is the ability for anyone to create professional ebooks without having to fork out thousands of dollars to design and publish a book. People can easily become authors overnight and earn income from selling online ebooks<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/01/10/sunday/main6079170.shtml How ebooks are changing the printed world]</ref>. The wide circulation, availability, and [[interactivity]] of ebooks have changed the way traditional print books are consumed by the market.
