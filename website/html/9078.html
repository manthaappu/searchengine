<html> <head> <title>DRDA</title></head><body>'''Distributed Relational Database Architecture''' (DRDA) is a database interoperability standard from [[The Open Group]].

DRDA describes the architecture for [[Distributed computing|distributed]] data. It defines the rules for accessing the distributed data, but it does not provide the actual [[Application programming interface|application programming interfaces]] (APIs) to perform the [[data access|access]]. It was first used in DB2 2.3.

==Components==
* Application Requester (AR). The AR accepts [[SQL]] requests from an application and sends them to the appropriate application servers for processing. Using this function, application programs can access remote data.

* Application Server (AS). The AS receives requests from application requesters and processes them. The AS acts upon the portions that can be processed and forwards the remainder to database servers for subsequent processing. The AR and the AS communicate through a [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] called the ''Application Support Protocol'' which handles [[Data conversion|data representation conversion]].

* Database Server (DS). The DS receives requests from AS or other DS servers. The DS supports distributed requests and will forward parts of the request to collaborating DS in order to fulfill the request. The AS and the DS among themselves communicate through a [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] called the ''Database Support Protocol''.
