A '''Play bus''' (or '''playbus''' or '''learning bus''') is a [[bus]] used for providing a mobile facility for a variety of activities surrounding [[entertainment]] and [[education]], usually for [[children]] of pre-school or [[school]] age.

Play buses are usually specially converted for their purpose, usually from second hand vehicles, although occasionally are purpose built by a [[bus manufacturer]]. Play buses can be any size, from [[minibus]]es to [[double-decker bus|double-deckers]] and may be operated by [[Charitable organization|charities]], education authorities or as private businesses.

Depending on usage and fittings, play buses may provide mobile [[playground]]s, [[gym]]nasiums, [[Bookmobile|library services]], or education centres as a mobile classroom.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the National Playbus Association is a charity that provides support and advice to organisations wishing to operate play buses. Formed in 1969, it is now supported by various government departments.<ref>[http://www.playbus.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=64&Itemid=100 National Playbus Association] History page, accessed 29 September 2008</ref>
