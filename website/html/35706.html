In [[mathematics]], especially the areas of [[numerical analysis]] concentrating on the [[numerical partial differential equations|numerical solution of partial differential equations]], a '''stencil''' is a geometric arrangement of a nodal group that relate to the point of interest by using a numerical approximation routine. Stencils are the basis for many algorithms to numerically solve [[partial differential equation]]s (PDE). Two examples of stencils are the [[five-point stencil]] and the [[Crank–Nicolson method]] stencil.

Stencils are classified into two categories: [[Compact stencil|compact]] and [[Non-compact stencil|non-compact]], the difference being the layers from the point of interest that are also used for calculation.
