'''JScript''' is a scripting language based on the [[ECMAScript]] standard that is used in [[Microsoft]]'s [[Internet Explorer]].

JScript is implemented as a [[Windows Script]] engine. This means that it can be "plugged in" to any application that supports Windows Script, such as [[Internet Explorer]], [[Active Server Pages]], and [[Windows Script Host]]. It also means that any application supporting Windows Script can use multiple languages — JScript, [[VBScript]], [[Perl]], and others.

JScript was first supported in the [[Internet_Explorer#Internet_Explorer_3|Internet Explorer 3.0]] browser released in August 1996. Its most recent version is JScript 5.8, included in Internet Explorer 8.

Another dialect of JScript (as of 2004 - 2006) was [[JScript .NET]], which was based on the yet-unfinished edition 4 of the ECMAScript standard, and can be compiled for the [[Microsoft .NET]] platform. JScript.NET, which added several new features to ECMAScript ed. 3, such as optional static type annotations, appears no longer to be actively developed.

==Comparison to JavaScript==
As explained by JavaScript guru [[Douglas Crockford]] in his talk entitled ''The JavaScript Programming Language'' on [[YUI Theater]], "[Microsoft] did not want to deal with Sun about the trademark issue, and so they called their implementation JScript. A lot of people think that JScript and JavaScript are different but similar languages. That's not the case. They are just different names for the same language, and the reason the names are different was to get around trademark issues."

===Differences from JavaScript===
Unlike JavaScript, JScript supports [[Conditional comment#Conditional Comment in JScript|conditional compilation.]] This allows a programmer to selectively execute code within [[Comparison of programming languages (syntax)#Block comments|block comments.]]

==Versions==
===JScript===
The original JScript is an [[Active Scripting]] engine. Like other Active Scripting languages, it is built on the [[OLE Automation|COM/OLE Automation]] platform and provides scripting capabilities to host applications.

This is the version used when hosting JScript inside a Web page displayed by [[Internet Explorer]], in an [[HTA (programming language)|HTML application]], in [[Active Server Pages|classic ASP]], in [[Windows Script Host]] scripts and several other [[OLE Automation|Automation]] environments.

JScript is sometimes referred to as "classic JScript" or "Active Scripting JScript" to differentiate it from newer .NET-based versions.

Some versions of JScript are available for multiple versions of Internet Explorer and Windows.  For example, JScript 5.7 was introduced with [[Internet Explorer 7|Internet Explorer 7.0]] and is also installed for [[Internet Explorer 6|Internet Explorer 6.0]] with [[Windows XP]] [[Windows XP#Service_Pack_3|Service Pack 3]], while JScript 5.8 was introduced with [[Internet Explorer 8|Internet Explorer 8.0]] and is also installed with Internet Explorer 6.0 on [[Windows Mobile#Windows_Mobile_6.5|Windows Mobile 6.5]].

JScript is also available on Windows CE (included in Windows Mobile, optional in Windows Embedded CE). The Windows CE version lacks Active Debugging.

===JScript .NET===
{{Main|JScript .NET}}
JScript .NET is a [[Microsoft .NET]] implementation of JScript, it is a [[Common Language Specification|CLS]] language and thus inherits very powerful features, but lacks many features of the original JScript language, making it inappropriate for many scripting scenarios.
JScript .NET can be used for [[ASP.NET]] pages and for complete .NET applications, but the lack of support for this language in Microsoft Visual Studio place it more as an upgrade path for classic [[Active Server Pages|ASP]] using classic JScript than as a new first-class language.

JScript .NET is not supported in the [[.NET Compact Framework]].

Note: JScript .NET versions are not related to classic JScript versions. JScript .NET is a separate product. Even though JScript .NET is not supported within the Visual Studio IDE, its versions are in sync with other .NET languages versions (C#, VB.NET, VC++) that follows their corresponding Visual Studio versions.

.NET Framework 3.0 and 3.5 are built on top of 2.0 and do not include newer releases of JScript .NET.
