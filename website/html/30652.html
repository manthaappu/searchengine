'''QM''' is a free, graphical [[UML tool|UML modeling tool]] for designing and implementing [[Real-time computing|real-time]] [[Embedded software|embedded applications]] based on the [[QP (framework)|QP state machine frameworks]]. QM provides graphical [[UML state machine]] diagram editor and generates production-quality, [[Software portability|portable]], and human-readable [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[C++]] code that is 100% [[Traceability|traceable]] from the design.

The main objective of QM is to empower the software developers without standing in their way. The tool achieves this at several levels. At the high level, QM gives the users complete control over all aspects of their design, both the logical structure and physical partitioning into directories and files. The tool respects the user's design decisions and lets the user determine the generated code structure, directory names, file names, and model elements that go into every file. The users can mix their own code with the synthesized code and use QM to generate as much or as little of the overall code as they see fit. At the low level, QM respects the graphical layout as much as possible and will not re-attach or re-route connectors, resize nodes, or adjust text annotations. The users don't need to "fight" the tool.

QM is designed as a strictly forward-engineering tool without [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineering]] capabilities. This means that the code generated by QM is not to be modified in any way, because the changes won't be incorporated back into the model. However, the tool provides a simple mechanism to very quickly locate any model element from any third-party editor by copying special comments placed in the synthesized code into the [[Clipboard (software)|clipboard]] and pasting them into the tool.

QM is designed to support fast development cycle and is very friendly to [[Revision control|version control systems]] (VCS). The QM model itself is stored in [[XML]], so it is easy to maintain in a VCS. The code generator is careful not to touch files that have not changed (it always compares the generated file with the file on disk and replaces the latter only when the new file is different.) This avoids unnecessary churn of the code and avoids [[Compiler|recompilations]] to keep the [[Software development process|development cycle]] as short as possible.

== Licensing ==
The QM graphical UML modeling tool is free to download and free to use, but is not open source. During the installation you will need to accept a basic [[Software license agreement|End-User License Agreement]] (EULA), which legally protects Quantum Leaps from any warranty claims, prohibits removing any copyright notices from QM, selling it, and creating similar competitive products. The EULA also prohibits distributing QM from third-party websites. The only legitimate source of QM is the state-machine.com website.
