A '''target drone''' is an unmanned, [[remote control]]led aerial vehicle, usually used in the training of [[anti-aircraft]] crews<ref>[http://www.avonds.com/Target%20Drones.htm Avonds Scale Jets - Target Drones]</ref>.

In their simplest form, target drones often resemble radio controlled model aircraft. More modern drones may use [[countermeasures]], [[radar]], and similar systems to mimic real aircraft<ref>[http://www.vectorsite.net/twuav_02.html Vector Site - Target Drones]</ref>.

More advanced drones are made from large, old [[anti-ship missile]]s which had their warheads removed.

Obsolete jet and propeller-powered aircraft (such as the [[Fairey Firefly]], [[Gloster Meteor]] and de Havilland [[Sea Vixen]] used at RAE [[Llanbedr Airport|Llanbedr]] between the 1950s and 1990s) have also been modified into remote controlled drones, but such modifications are costly.
