A '''superorganism''' is an [[organism]] consisting of many organisms. This is usually meant to be a [[social unit]] of [[eusociality|eusocial]] animals, where [[division of labour]] is highly specialised and where individuals are not able to survive by themselves for extended periods of time.  [[Ants]] are the best-known example of such a superorganism, while the [[naked mole rat]] is a famous example of the [[eusociality|eusocial]] [[mammal]]. The technical definition of a superorganism is "a collection of agents which can act in concert to produce phenomena governed by the collective,"<ref>{{cite book |author=Kelly, Kevin |title=Out of control: the new biology of machines, social systems and the economic world |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=1994 |pages=98 |isbn=0-201-48340-8 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> phenomena being any activity "the hive wants" such as ants collecting food or bees choosing a new nest site.

The [[Gaia hypothesis]] of  [[James Lovelock]]<ref>''Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth'', James Lovelock, Oxford University Press, 1979</ref> and the work of [[James Hutton]], [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] and [[Guy Murchie]], have suggested that the [[biosphere]] can be considered a superorganism. However, strict ecological studies reveal little or no self control inside organism communities,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} and such communities usually easily go off balance or change into entirely different ones. This view is countered and balanced by [[Systems Theory]] and the dynamics of a [[complex system]].

Superorganisms are important in [[cybernetics]], particularly [[biocybernetics]].  They exhibit a form of "distributed intelligence," a system in which many individual agents with limited intelligence and information are able to pool resources to accomplish a goal beyond the capabilities of the individuals. Existence of such behavior in organisms has many implications for military and management applications, and is being actively researched.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kelly, Kevin |title=Out of control: the new biology of machines, social systems and the economic world |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=1994 |pages=251|isbn=0-201-48340-8 |oclc= |doi=}}<br><blockquote>If Col. Thorpe [of the US [[DARPA]]] has his way, the four divisions of the US military and hundreds of industrial subcontractors will become a single interconnected superorganism. The immediate step to this world of distributed intelligence is an engineering protocol developed by a consortium of defense simulation centers in Orlando Florida ...</blockquote></ref>

==Superorganic in social theory==
Nineteenth century thinker [[Herbert Spencer]] coined the term ''super-organic'' to focus on social organization (the first chapter of his ''Principles of [[Sociology]]'' is entitled "Super-organic Evolution"<ref>''The Principles of Sociology'', Vol. 1, Part 1. "The Data of Sociology", Herbert Spencer, 1876</ref>), though this was apparently a distinction between the organic and the social, ''not'' an identity: Spencer explored the [[holism in science|holistic]] nature of society as a [[social organism]] while distinguishing the ways in which society did not behave like an organism.<ref>''The Principles of Sociology'', Vol. 1, Part 2, Chapter II, "A Society Is an Organism" (sections 222 and 223), Herbert Spencer, 1876</ref> For Spencer, the super-organic was an [[emergentism|emergent]] property of interacting organisms, that is, human beings. And, as has been argued by D. C. Phillips, there is a "difference between emergence and reductionism."<ref>''Holistic Thought in Social Science'', D. C. Phillips, Stanford University Press, 1976, p. 123</ref> 

Similarly, economist [[Carl Menger]] expanded upon the evolutionary nature of much social growth, but without ever abandoning [[methodological individualism]]. Many social institutions arose, Menger argued, not as "the result of socially teleological causes, but the unintended result of innumerable efforts of economic subjects pursuing 'individual' interests."<ref>''Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences with Special Reference to Economics'', Carl Menger, Louis Schneider (translator), New York University Press, 1985</ref> 

Spencer and Menger both argued that because it is individuals who choose and act, any social whole should be considered less than an organism, though Menger emphasized this more emphatically. Spencer used the organistic idea to engage in extended analysis of [[social structure]], conceding that it was primarily an analogy. So, for Spencer, the idea of the super-organic best designated a distinct level of [[social reality]] above that of biology and psychology, and not a one-to-one identity with an organism. 

Nevertheless, Spencer also argued that "every organism of appreciable size is a society," which has suggested to some that the issue may be terminological.<ref>''The Political Philosophy of Herbert Spencer'', Tim S. Gray, 1996, p. 211</ref>

The term ''superorganic'' was adopted by anthropologist [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] in 1917<ref>''Patterns of Culture'', Ruth Benedict, Houghton Mifflin, 1934, p. 231</ref>.  Social aspects of the superorganism concept are analysed in Marshall (2002)<ref>Marshall, A. (2002).  ''[http://www.icpress.co.uk/books/histsci/p268.html The Unity of Nature]'', Imperial College Press, London.</ref>.

==Problems and criticisms==
The question remains "What is to be considered ''the [[individualism|individual]]''?" Some [[biologist]]s such as [[Richard Dawkins]] suggest that the individual selected is the [[selfish gene]].<ref>''The Selfish Gene'', Oxford University Press, 1976</ref>

It would appear{{Weasel-inline|date=January 2011}}, from computer [[simulation]]s like [[Daisyworld]] that biological [[natural selection|selection]] occurs at multiple levels simultaneously.{{Fact|date=January 2011}}

Some scientists have suggested that individual human beings can be thought of as 
"superorganisms"; as a typical human digestive system contains 10<sup>13</sup> 
to 10<sup>14</sup> microorganisms whose collective [[genome]] ("[[microbiome]]") 
contains at least 100 times as many genes as our own <ref>Gill S. R., et al. 
''Science'', ''312'', 1355-1359 ('''2006''').
