<html> <head> <title>Marcus Hutter</title></head><body>'''Marcus Hutter''' (born 1967) is a German computer scientist and professor at the [[Australian National University]].  Hutter was born and educated in [[Munich]], where he studied [[physics]] and [[computer science]]. In 2000 he joined [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s group at the Swiss [[Artificial Intelligence]] lab [[IDSIA]], where he developed the first mathematical theory of optimal Universal Artificial Intelligence, based on [[Kolmogorov complexity]] and  [[Ray Solomonoff]]'s theory of universal [[inductive inference]]. In 2006 he also accepted a professorship at the Australian National University in [[Canberra]].

Hutter's notion of universal AI describes the optimal strategy of an agent  that wants to maximize its future expected reward in some unknown dynamic environment, up to some fixed future horizon. This is the general [[reinforcement learning]] problem. Solomonoff/Hutter's only assumption is that the reactions of the environment in response to the agent's actions follow some unknown but [[Computability theory (computer science)|computable]] [[probability distribution]].

== Universal artificial intelligence ==
Hutter uses Solomonoff's [[inductive inference]] as a mathematical formalization of Occam's razor.<ref> On the existence and convergence of computable universal priors
from arxiv.org M Hutter - Algorithmic Learning Theory, 2003 - Springer</ref> Hutter adds to this formalization the expected value of an action:  shorter ([[kolmogorov complexity]]) computable theories have more weight when calculating the [[expected value]] of an action across all computable theories which perfectly describe previous observations.<ref>Universal artificial intelligence: Sequential decisions based on algorithmic probability

At any time, given the limited observation sequence so far, what is the [[Bayes estimator|Bayes-optimal]] way of selecting the next action? Hutter proved that the answer is to use Solomonoff's universal [[prior distribution|prior]] to predict the future, and execute the first action of the action sequence that will maximize the predicted reward up to the horizon. He called this universal algorithm AIXI.

This is mainly a theoretical result. To overcome the problem that Solomonoff's prior is [[incomputable]], in 2002 Hutter also published an [[asymptote|asymptotically]] fastest algorithm for all well-defined problems. Given some formal description of a problem class, the algorithm systematically generates all [[Mathematical proof|proofs]] in a sufficiently powerful [[axiomatic system]] that allows for proving time [[Upper and lower bounds|bounds]] of solution-computing programs. Simultaneously, whenever a proof has been found that shows that a particular program has a better time bound than the previous best, a clever resource allocation scheme will assign most of the remaining search time to this program. Hutter showed that his method is essentially as fast as the unknown fastest program for solving problems from the given class, save for an additive [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]] independent of the problem instance. For example, if the problem size is <math>n</math>, and there exists an initially unknown program that solves any problem in the class within <math>n^7</math> computational steps, then Hutter's method will solve it within <math>5n^7 + O(1)</math> steps. The additive constant hidden in the [[Big O notation|<math>O()</math> notation]] may be large enough to render the algorithm practically infeasible despite its useful theoretical properties.

Several algorithms approximate AIXI in order to make it run on a modern computer, at the expense of its perfect optimality. <ref>A Monte Carlo AIXI Approximation

==Hutter Prize for Lossless Compression of Human Knowledge==
On August 6, 2006, Hutter announced the '''[[Hutter Prize]] for Lossless Compression of Human Knowledge''' with an initial purse of 50,000 Euros, the intent of which is to encourage the advancement of [[artificial intelligence]] through the exploitation of Hutter's theory of optimal universal artificial intelligence.
