<html> <head> <title>Deterministic context-free grammar</title></head><body>In [[formal grammar]] theory, the '''deterministic context-free grammars''' ('''DCFGs''') are a [[proper subset]] of the [[context-free grammars]].  The deterministic context-free grammars are those a [[deterministic pushdown automaton]] can recognize. A DCFG is the finite set of rules defining the set of well-formed expressions in some [[deterministic context-free language]].

==History==
In the 1960s, theoretic research in computer science on [[regular expressions]] and [[finite automata]] led to the discovery that [[context-free grammars]] are equivalent to [[pushdown automata]]. These grammars were thought to capture the syntax of computer programming languages. The first computer programming languages were under development at the time (see [[History of programming languages]]) and writing [[compilers]] was difficult. But using [[context-free grammars]] to help automate the parsing part of the compiler simplified the task. Deterministic context-free grammars were particularly useful because they could be parsed sequentially, which was a requirement due to computer memory constraints.<ref>{{cite book | editors = [[A Salomaa]] & [[D Wood]] & [[S Yu]] | title = [[A Half-Century of Automata Theory]] | year = 2001 | publisher = World Scientific Publishing Co.

==Uses==
[[LALR]] parsers, which use a subset of DCFGs, have practical value as program code validators. Given the formal rules of a DCFG, these parsers efficiently ensure a program can be generated from those rules. In fact, this syntax validation is one of the operations a [[compiler]] performs. <!-- need to state the two restrictions for determinism, can't figure out how to express it simply-->

==Limitations==
Since DCFGs are a proper subset of CFGs, they are of less descriptive power than some CFGs.
