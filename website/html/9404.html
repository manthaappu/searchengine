In [[information processing]],a '''Data Processing System''' is a [[system]] which [[data processing|processes data]] which has been captured and [[code|encoded]] in a [[File format|format]] recognizable by the data processing system or has been created and stored by another unit of an [[information processing system]].

A data entry is a specialized component or form of an information processing (sub)system. Its chief difference is that it tends to perform a dedicated function (i.e., its [[Computer program|program]] is not readily changeable). Its dedicated function is normally to perform some (intermediate) step of converting input ('raw' or unprocessed) data, or semi-processed information, in one form into a further or final form of information through a [[Process (computing)|process]] called [[decode|decod]]ing / [[encode|encod]]ing or formatting or re-formatting or [[translation]] or [[data conversion]] before the information can be [[output]] from the data processor to a further step in the information processing system.

For the hardware data processing system, this information may be used to change the sequential states of a (hardware) machine called a [[computer]]. In all essential aspects, the hardware data processing unit is indistinguishable from a computer's [[central processing unit]] (CPU), i.e. the hardware data processing unit is just a dedicated computer.  However, the hardware data processing unit is normally dedicated to the specific [[computer application]] of format translation.

A software code [[compiler]] (e.g., for [[Fortran]] or [[ALGOL]]) is an example of a [[software]] data processing system. The software data processing system makes use of a (general purpose) computer in order to complete its functions. A software data processing system is normally a standalone unit of software, in that its output can be directed to any number of other (not necessarily as yet identified) information processing (sub)systems.
