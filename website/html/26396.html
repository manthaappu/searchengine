He has produced a number of fundamental results many of which are being widely used in the field of [[theoretical computer science]], [[database processing]] and [[compiler optimization]]. He has also achieved the rank of [[IBM Fellow]] at [[Almaden Research Center|Almaden IBM Research Center]] in [[San Jose, California]]. He has taught at the [[University of British Columbia]] in [[Vancouver, Canada]] and at [[Princeton University]] in the US. In the Fall of 2006 Pippenger joined the faculty of [[Harvey Mudd College]].

Pippenger holds a [[B.S.]] in Natural Sciences from [[Shimer College]] and a [[PhD]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. He is married to [[Maria Klawe]], President of [[Harvey Mudd College]]. In 1997 he was inducted as a [[Fellow]] of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://fellows.acm.org/fellow_citation.cfm?id=1421585&srt=all|title=ACM: Fellow Awards / Nicholas Pippenger|work=ACM Fellows|publisher=Association for Computing Machinery|accessdate=2010-01-24}}</ref>

The complexity class, [[NC (complexity)|Nick's Class]] (NC), of problems quickly solvable on a parallel computer, was named by [[Stephen Cook]] after Nick Pippenger for his research on circuits with [[polylogarithmic]] depth and polynomial size.<ref>{{cite book|authorlink = Christos Papadimitriou |first=Christos |last=Papadimitriou | year = 1993 | title = Computational Complexity | publisher = Addison Wesley | edition = 1st | isbn = 0-201-53082-1 |chapter=Section 15.3: The class '''NC''' |pages=375&ndash;381}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|authorlink =Dexter Kozen |first=Dexter |last=Kozen | year = 2006 | title = Theory of Computation | publisher = Springer | isbn = 1-84628-297-7 |chapter=Lecture 12: Relation of ''NC'' to Time-Space Classes}}</ref>
