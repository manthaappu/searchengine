<html> <head> <title>Relevance vector machine</title></head><body>'''Relevance vector machine (RVM)''' is a [[machine learning]] technique that uses [[Bayesian inference]] to obtain [[Parsimony|parsimonious]] solutions for [[Regression analysis|regression]] and [[Statistical classification|classification]]. The RVM has an identical functional form to the [[support vector machine]], but provides probabilistic classification.

It is actually equivalent to a [[Gaussian process]] model with [[covariance function]]:
:<math>k(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x'}) = \sum_{j=1}^N \frac{1}{\alpha_j} \phi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}_j)\phi(\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{x}_j) </math>
where φ is the [[kernel function]] (usually Gaussian), and '''x'''<sub>1</sub>,…,'''x'''<sub>''N''</sub> are the input vectors of the [[training set]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Compared to the SVM, the Bayesian formulation avoids the set of free parameters of the SVM (that usually require cross-validation-based post-optimizations). However RVMs use an [[Expectation Maximization]] (EM)-like learning method and are therefore at risk of local minima, unlike the standard [[Sequential Minimal Optimization|SMO]]-based algorithms employed by [[Support vector machine|SVM]]s which are guaranteed to find a global optimum.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
