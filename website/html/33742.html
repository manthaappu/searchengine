An example of self-handicapping is the student who spends the night before an important exam partying rather than studying. The student fears failing their exam and appearing incapable. In partying the night before their exam the student has engaged in self-defeating behaviour and increased the likelihood of poor exam performance. However, in the event of failure, the student can offer fatigue and a hangover, rather than lack of ability, as plausible explanations. Furthermore, should the student receive positive feedback about their exam, their achievement is enhanced by the fact that they succeeded, despite the handicap.

Researchers on self-handicapping have distinguished between ''claimed'' self-handicaps, in which the individual merely states that an obstacle to performance exists, and ''behavioral'' handicaps, in which the individual actually creates obstacles to performance.<ref name=Leary1986>Leary, M.

==Functionality of Self-Handicapping==
Previous research has established that self-handicapping is motivated by uncertainty about one's ability<ref name=JonesBerglas1978 /> or, more generally, anticipated threats to [[self-esteem]].<ref name=SynderSmith1982>Snyder, C. R., & Smith, T. W. (1982). Symptoms as self-handicapping strategies: The virtues of old wine in a new bottle. In G. Weary & H. L. Mirels (Eds.), ''Integrations of clinical and social psychology'' (pp. 104-127). New York: Oxford University Press.</ref> Self-handicapping can be exacerbated by self-presentational concerns<ref name=KolditzArkin1982 /> but also occurs in situations where such concerns are at a minimum.<ref name=JonesBerglas1978 /><ref name=RhodewaltFairfield1991>Rhodewalt, F., & Fairfield M. (1991). Claimed self-handicaps and the self-handicapper: On the relation of reductions in intended effort to performance. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 25'', 402-417.</ref>

Jones and Berglas gave people positive feedback following a problem-solving test, regardless of actual performance. Half the participants had been given fairly easy problems, while the others were given difficult problems.  Participants were then given the choice between a "performance-enhancing drug" and one which would inhibit it. Those participants who received the difficult problems were more likely to choose the impairing drug, and participants who faced easy problems were more likely to choose the enhancing drug. It is argued that the participants presented with hard problems, believing that their success had been due to chance, chose the impairing drug because they were looking for an [[Attribution theory#Internal versus external|external attribution]] (what might be called an "excuse") for expected poor performance in the future, as opposed to an [[Attribution theory#Internal versus external|internal attribution]].<ref name=JonesBerglas1978/>

More recent research has found that generally people are willing to use handicaps in order to protect their [[self-esteem]] (e.g. discounting failings) but are more reluctant to employ them for [[self-enhancement]]. (e.g. to further credit their success).
Rhodewalt, Morf, Hazlett, and Fairfield (1991)<ref name=RhodewaltFairfield1991 /> selected participants who scored high or low on the Self-Handicapping Scale (SHS) and who had high or low self-esteem. They presented participants with a handicap and then with success of failure feedback and asked participants to make attributions for their performance. The results showed that both self-protection and [[self-enhancement]] occurred, but only as a function of levels of [[self-esteem]] and the level of tendency to self-handicap. Participants who were high self-handicappers, regardless of their level of [[self-esteem]], used the handicap as a means of self-protection but only those participants with high [[self-esteem]] used the handicap to [[self-enhancement|self-enhance]]. In a further study, Rhodewalt (1991)<ref name=Rhodewaltetal1991>Rhodewalt, F., Morf, C, Hazlett, S., & Fairfield, M. (1991). Self-handicapping: The role of discounting and augmentation in the preservation of self-esteem. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 61,'' 121-131</ref> presented the handicap to only half of the participants and gave success and failure feedback. The results provided evidence for self-protection but not for self-enhancement. Participants in the failure feedback, handicap absent group, attributed their failures to their own lack of ability and reported lower self-esteem to the handicap-present, failure-feedback condition. Furthermore, the handicap-present failure group reported levels of self-esteem equal to that of the successful group. This evidence highlights the importance of self-handicaps in self-protection although it offers no support for the handicap acting to self-enhance.

==Individual Differences==
People differ in the extent to which they self-handicap<ref name=Rhodewalt1990>Rhodewalt, F. (1990) Self-handicappers: Individual differences in the preference for anticipatory self-protective acts. In R. Higgins, C. R. Snyder, & S. Berglas. ''Self-handicapping: The paradox that isn't. '' New York: Plenum Press.</ref> Although a number of characteristics have been related to self-handicapping (e.g. [[hypochondriasis]])<ref name=smithsynderperkins1983 /> most research on individual differences has used the Self-Handicapping Scale (SHS).<ref>Jones, E. E., & Rhodewalt, F. (1982). ''The Self-Handicapping Scale. '' Unpublished manuscript.</ref> The SHS was developed as a means of measuring individuals' tendency to employ excuses or create handicaps as a means to protect one's self-esteem. Research to date shows that SHS has adequate construct validity.<ref name=Rhodewalt1990 /> For example, individuals who score high on the SHS will put in less effort and practice less when concerned about their ability to perform well in a given task.<ref name=Hirt1991>Hirt, E. R., Deppe, R. K., & Gordon, L. J. (1991). Self-reported versus behavioral self-handicapping: Empirical evidence for a theoretical distinction. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 61,'' 981-991.</ref><ref name=RhodewaltFairfield1991 /> They are also more likely than those rated low self-handicappers (LSH) to mention obstacles or external factors which may hinder their success, prior to performing.<ref>Strube, M. J. (1986). An analysis of the Self-Handicapping Scale. ''Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 7,'' 211-224.</ref><ref>Rhodewalt, F., & Hill, S. K. (1995).

===Gender differences===
Gender differences are one of the most consistent findings in self-handicapping literature.<ref name=Rhodewalt1990 /><ref name=Mccrea>McCrea, S. M., Hirt, E. R., & Milner, B. J. (2008).

Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.</ref><ref name=Rhodewalt1990 /> While many studies have found that claimed self-handicaps are used by men and women alike,<ref name="ArkinOleson1998"/><ref name=Rhodewalt1990 />  the vast majority of research has found than generally only men behaviourally self-handicap.<ref name=JonesBerglas1978 /><ref name=HarrisSynder1986 /><ref name=Hirt1991 /><ref>Rhodewalt, F., & Davison, J.

==Recent studies==
===Relation to Mood===
Previous research has looked at the consequences of self-handicapping and have suggested that self-handicapping leads to a more positive mood (at least in the short term).<ref>McCrea, S. M., & Hirt, E. R. (2001). The role of ability judgments in
self-handicapping. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 27,'' 1378–1389.</ref><ref name=Zuckerman2005 /> However, based on past evidence that positive mood motivates self-protective attributions for success and failure<ref>Forgas, J. P. (1994). Sad and guilty? AVective inXuences on explanations of conXict episodes. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 66,'' 56–68.</ref> and increases the avoidance of negative feedback,<ref>Trope, Y., Ferguson, M., & Ragunanthan, R. (2001). Mood as a resource in processing self-relevant information. In J. P. Forgas (Ed.), Handbook of aVect and social cognition. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.</ref> recent research has focused on mood as an antecedent to self-handicapping; expecting positive mood to increase self-handicapping behaviour.<ref name=Alter2007>Alter, A. L., & Forgas, J. P. (2007). On being happy but fearing failure: The effects of mood on self-handicapping strategies. ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 43'', 947-954.</ref> Results have shown that people who are in positive mood are more likely to engage in self-handicapping, even at the cost of jeopardizing future performance.

===Occurrence in Sports===
Previous research,<ref name=Ommundsen2001>Ommundsen, Y. (2001). Self-handicapping strategies in physical education classes:The influence of implicit theories of the nature of ability and achievement goal orientations. ''Psychology of Sport and Exercise, 2(3),'' 139–156.</ref> has suggested that because in Physical Education (PE) students are required to overtly display their physical abilities and incompetence could be readily observed by others, PE is an ideal setting to observe self-handicapping.<ref name=Chen2008>Chen, L. H., Chen, M. Y., Lin, M. S., Kee, Y. H., Kuo, C. F., & Shui, S. H. (2008). Implicit theory of athletic ability and self-handicapping in college students. ''Psychological Reports, 103,'' 476–484.</ref> Because of its prevalence in the sporting world, self-handicapping behaviour has become of interest to sports psychologists who are interested in increasing sports performance. Recent research has examined the relationship between behavioural and claimed self-handicaps and athletic performance<ref>Coudevylle, G., Martin Ginis, K., & Famose, J-P. (in press). Determinants of self-handicapping strategies in sport and their effects on athletic performance. ''Social Behavior and Personality. International Journal (Toronto, Ont.)''</ref> as well as the effects self-handicapping has on anxiety and fear of failure before Athletic Performance.<ref name=Chen2008 />

===Longitudinal studies===
Longitudinal studies of self-handicapping have shown that while self-handicapping may protect [[self-esteem]] in the short term, it could have long-term costs for the individual. Self-handicapping has been found to lead to lower intrinsic [[motivation]], worse health and wellbeing, more frequent negative moods and higher use of various substances.<ref name=Zuckerman2005>Zuckerman, M., & Tsai, F. F. (2005). Costs of self-handicapping. ''Journal of Personality, 73(2),'' 411–442.</ref>
