'''SpiderOak''' is an online backup tool for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Apple Macintosh|Mac]] and [[Linux]] users to back up, share, sync, access and store <ref>{{cite web

SpiderOak allows the user to backup any given folder of his computer, while some services only allow to backup a specified folder (like [[Dropbox (storage provider)|DropBox]]). SpiderOak uses encrypted [[Cloud storage#Storage|cloud storage]] and [[client-side encryption]] key creation, so even employees of SpiderOak cannot access users' information, this is the 'zero-knowledge' data encryption.  SpiderOak distinguishes itself from competition in provision of encryption, in provision for syncing files and folders across multiple devices, and in automatic de-duplication of data<ref>{{cite web
