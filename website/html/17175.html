[[Image:Hyperbolic triangle.svg|thumb|250px|right|A triangle immersed in a saddle-shape plane (a [[hyperbolic paraboloid]]), as well as two diverging ultraparallel lines.]]
In [[mathematics]], '''hyperbolic geometry''' (also called '''[[Nikolai Lobachevsky|Lobachevskian]] geometry''' or '''[[János Bolyai|Bolyai]]-Lobachevskian geometry''') is a [[non-Euclidean geometry]], meaning that the [[parallel postulate]] of [[Euclidean geometry]] is replaced. The parallel postulate in Euclidean geometry is equivalent to the statement that, in two dimensional space, for any given line ''l'' and point ''P'' not on ''l'', there is exactly one line through ''P'' that does not intersect ''l''; i.e., that is parallel to ''l''. In hyperbolic geometry there are at least two distinct lines through ''P'' which do not intersect ''l'', so the parallel postulate is false. [[#Models of the hyperbolic plane|Models]] have been constructed within Euclidean geometry that obey the axioms of hyperbolic geometry, thus proving that the parallel postulate is independent of the other postulates of Euclid.

Because there is no precise hyperbolic analogue to Euclidean parallel lines, the hyperbolic use of ''parallel'' and related terms varies among writers. In this article, the two limiting lines are called ''asymptotic'' and lines sharing a common perpendicular are called ''ultraparallel''; the simple word ''parallel'' may apply to both.

A characteristic property of hyperbolic geometry is that the angles of a [[hyperbolic triangle#Hyperbolic geometry|triangle]] add to ''less'' than a [[straight angle]] (half circle). In the limit as the vertices go to infinity, there are even [[ideal triangle|ideal hyperbolic triangles]] in which all three angles are 0°.

==Non-intersecting lines==
An interesting property of hyperbolic geometry follows from the occurrence of more than one parallel line through a point ''P'': there are two classes of non-intersecting lines. Let ''B'' be the point on ''l'' such that the line ''PB'' is perpendicular to ''l''. Consider the line ''x'' through ''P'' such that ''x'' does not intersect ''l'', and the angle θ between ''PB'' and ''x'' counterclockwise from ''PB'' is as small as possible; i.e., any smaller angle will force the line to intersect ''l''. This is called an '''asymptotic line''' in hyperbolic geometry. Symmetrically, the line ''y'' that forms the same angle θ between ''PB'' and itself but clockwise from ''PB'' will also be asymptotic.  ''x'' and ''y'' are the only two lines asymptotic to ''l'' through ''P''. All other lines through ''P'' not intersecting ''l'', with angles greater than θ with ''PB'', are called '''ultraparallel''' (or '''disjointly parallel''') to ''l''. Notice that since there are an infinite number of possible angles between θ and 90 degrees, and each one will determine two lines through ''P'' and disjointly parallel to ''l'', there exist an infinite number of ultraparallel lines.

Thus we have this modified form of the parallel postulate: In hyperbolic geometry, given any line ''l'', and point ''P'' not on ''l'', there are exactly two lines through ''P'' which are asymptotic to ''l'', and infinitely many lines through ''P'' ultraparallel to ''l''.

The differences between these types of lines can also be looked at in the following way: the distance between asymptotic lines shrinks toward zero in one direction and grows without bound in the other; the distance between ultraparallel lines (eventually) increases in both directions. The [[ultraparallel theorem]] states that there is a ''unique'' line in the hyperbolic plane that is perpendicular to each of a given pair of ultraparallel lines.

In Euclidean geometry, the "angle of parallelism" is a constant; that is, any distance <math>\lVert BP \rVert</math> between parallel lines yields an angle of parallelism equal to 90°. In hyperbolic geometry, the [[angle of parallelism]] varies with the <math>\Pi(p)</math> function. This function, described by [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]], produces a unique angle of parallelism for each distance <math>p = \lVert BP \rVert</math>. As the distance gets shorter, <math>\Pi(p)</math> approaches 90°, whereas with increasing distance <math>\Pi(p)</math> approaches 0°. Thus, as distances get smaller, the hyperbolic plane behaves more and more like Euclidean geometry. Indeed, on small scales compared to <math>\frac{1}{\sqrt{-K}}</math>, where <math>K\!</math> is the (constant) [[Gaussian curvature]] of the plane, an observer would have a hard time determining whether he is in the Euclidean or the hyperbolic plane.

== Triangles ==

Distances in the hyperbolic plane can be measured in terms of a unit of length
<math>R = \frac{1}{\sqrt{-K}}</math> , analogous to the radius of the sphere in [[spherical geometry]]. Using this unit of length a theorem in hyperbolic geometry can be stated which is analogous to the [[Pythagorean theorem]].  If  <math> a, b\,</math> are the legs and <math>c\,</math> is the hypotenuse of a right triangle all measured in this unit then:

:: <math>\cosh c=\cosh a\cosh b\,.</math>

The '''cosh''' function is a [[hyperbolic function]] which is an analog of the standard cosine function.  All six of the standard [[trigonometric functions]] have hyperbolic analogs.  In trigonometric relations involving the sides and angles of a hyperbolic triangle the hyperbolic functions are applied to the sides and the standard trigonometric functions are applied to the angles.  For example the law of sines for hyperbolic triangles is:

:<math>\frac{\sin A}{\sinh a} = \frac{\sin B}{\sinh b} = \frac{\sin C}{\sinh c}.</math>

For more of these trigonometric relationships see [[hyperbolic triangle]]s.

Unlike Euclidean triangles whose angles always add up to 180 degrees or <math>\pi</math> [[radian]]s the sum of the angles of a hyperbolic triangle is always strictly less than 180 degrees. The difference is sometimes referred to as the [[Defect (geometry)|defect]]. The area of a hyperbolic triangle is given by its defect multiplied by <math>R^2</math> where <math>R = \frac{1}{\sqrt{-K}}</math> .  As a consequence all hyperbolic triangles have an area which is less than <math>\pi{R^2}</math>.  The area of an ideal hyperbolic triangle is equal to this maximum.

As in [[spherical geometry]] the only similar triangles are congruent triangles.  

== Circles, Spheres, and Balls ==

In hyperbolic geometry the circumference of a circle of radius <math>r \,</math> is greater than <math>2 \pi r \,.</math> It is in fact equal to

:<math>2\pi R \sinh \frac{r}{R} \,.</math>

The area of the enclosed disk is

:<math>2\pi R^2 (\cosh \frac{r}{R} - 1) \,.</math>

The surface area of a sphere is

:<math>4\pi R^2 \sinh^2 \frac{r}{R} \,.</math>

The volume of the enclosed ball is

:<math>\pi R^3 \sinh \frac{2r}{R} - 2\pi R^2r \,.</math>

For the measure of an [[n-sphere|''n''&minus;1 sphere]] in ''n'' dimensional space the corresponding
expression is

:<math>\Omega_{n} R^{n-1} \sinh^{n-1} \frac{r}{R} \,</math>

where the full ''n'' dimensional [[solid angle]] is

:<math> \Omega_{n}=\frac{2\pi^{n/2}}{\Gamma \left (\frac{n}{2} \right )} \,</math>

using <math>\Gamma \,</math> for the [[Gamma function]].

The measure of the enclosed ''n'' ball is:

:<math>\Omega_{n} R^{n-1} \int_0^r \sinh^{n-1} \frac{r}{R}dr \,.</math>

== History ==
A number of geometers made attempts to prove the [[parallel postulate]] by assuming its negation and trying to derive a contradiction, including [[Proclus]], [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen), [[Omar Khayyám]],<ref>See for instance, {{cite web|url=http://www.resonancepub.com/omarkhayyam.htm|title=Omar Khayyam 1048-1131|accessdate=2008-01-05}}</ref> [[Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī|Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], [[Witelo]], [[Gersonides]], [[Alfonso]], and later [[Giovanni Gerolamo Saccheri]], [[John Wallis]], [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]], and [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]].<ref>
http://www.math.columbia.edu/~pinkham/teaching/seminars/NonEuclidean.html</ref>
Their attempts failed, but their efforts gave birth to hyperbolic geometry.

The theorems of Alhacen, Khayyam and al-Tusi on [[quadrilateral]]s, including the [[Ibn al-Haytham–Lambert quadrilateral]] and [[Khayyam–Saccheri quadrilateral]], were the first theorems on hyperbolic geometry. Their works on hyperbolic geometry had a considerable influence on its development among later European geometers, including Witelo, Gersonides, Alfonso, John Wallis and Saccheri.<ref>Boris A. Rosenfeld and Adolf P. Youschkevitch (1996), "Geometry", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., ''[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]]'', Vol. 2, p. 447-494 [470], [[Routledge]], London and New York: {{quote|"Three scientists, Ibn al-Haytham, Khayyam and al-Tusi, had made the most considerable contribution to this branch of geometry whose importance came to be completely recognized only in the nineteenth century. In essence their propositions concerning the properties of quadrangles which they considered assuming that some of the angles of these figures were acute of obtuse, embodied the first few theorems of the hyperbolic and the elliptic geometries. Their other proposals showed that various geometric statements were equivalent to the Euclidean postulate V. It is extremely important that these scholars established the mutual connection between this postulate and the sum of the angles of a triangle and a quadrangle. By their works on the theory of parallel lines Arab mathematicians directly influenced the relevant investigations of their European counterparts. The first European attempt to prove the postulate on parallel lines - made by Witelo, the Polish scientists of the thirteenth century, while revising Ibn al-Haytham's ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (''Kitab al-Manazir'') - was undoubtedly prompted by Arabic sources. The proofs put forward in the fourteenth century by the Jewish scholar [[Gersonides|Levi ben Gerson]], who lived in southern France, and by the above-mentioned Alfonso from Spain directly border on Ibn al-Haytham's demonstration. Above, we have demonstrated that ''Pseudo-Tusi's Exposition of Euclid'' had stimulated both J. Wallis's and G. Saccheri's studies of the theory of parallel lines."}}</ref>

In the 18th century, [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] introduced the [[hyperbolic functions]] and computed the area of a [[hyperbolic triangle]].

In the nineteenth century, hyperbolic geometry was extensively explored by [[János Bolyai]] and [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]], after whom it sometimes is named. Lobachevsky published in 1830, while Bolyai independently discovered it and published in 1832. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] also studied hyperbolic geometry, describing in a 1824 letter to Taurinus that he had constructed it, but did not publish his work. In 1868, [[Eugenio Beltrami]] provided models of it, and used this to prove that hyperbolic geometry was consistent if Euclidean geometry was.

The term "hyperbolic geometry" was introduced by [[Felix Klein]] in 1871.<ref>F. Klein, ''Über die sogenannte Nicht-Euklidische'', Geometrie, Math. Ann. 4, 573-625 (cf. Ges. Math. Abh. 1, 244-350).</ref>

== Models of the hyperbolic plane ==
[[Image:Hyperbolic tiling omnitruncated 3-7.png|thumb|250px|'''Poincaré disc model''' of great rhombitruncated {3,7} tiling]]
[[Image:Poincare disc hyperbolic parallel lines.svg|thumb|250px|left|Lines through a given point and asymptotic to a given line, illustrated in the Poincaré disc model]]
There are four [[Mathematical model|model]]s commonly used for hyperbolic geometry: the [[Klein model]], the [[Poincaré disc model]], the [[Poincaré half-plane model]], and the Lorentz model, or [[hyperboloid model]]. These models define a real [[hyperbolic space]] which satisfies the axioms of a hyperbolic geometry.
Despite the naming, the two disc models and the half-plane model were introduced as models of hyperbolic space by Beltrami, not by Poincaré or Klein.

# The '''[[Klein model]]''', also known as the '''projective disc model''' and '''[[Eugenio Beltrami|Beltrami]]-Klein model''', uses the interior of a circle for the hyperbolic [[plane (mathematics)|plane]], and [[chord (geometry)|chord]]s of the circle as lines.
#* This model has the advantage of simplicity, but the disadvantage that [[angle]]s in the hyperbolic plane are distorted.
#* The distance in this model is the [[cross-ratio]], which was introduced by [[Arthur Cayley]] in [[projective geometry]].
# The '''[[Poincaré disc model]]''', also known as the '''conformal disc model''', also employs the interior of a circle, but lines are represented by arcs of circles that are [[orthogonal]] to the boundary circle, plus diameters of the boundary circle.
# The '''[[Poincaré half-plane model]]''' takes one-half of the Euclidean plane, as determined by a Euclidean line ''B'', to be the hyperbolic plane (''B'' itself is not included).
#* Hyperbolic lines are then either half-circles orthogonal to ''B'' or rays perpendicular to ''B''.
#* Both Poincaré models preserve hyperbolic angles, and are thereby [[conformal map|conformal]]. All isometries within these models are therefore [[Möbius transformation]]s. 
#* The half-plane model is identical (at the limit) to the Poincaré disc model at the edge of the disc
# The '''Lorentz model''' or '''[[hyperboloid model]]''' employs a 2-dimensional [[hyperboloid]] of revolution (of two sheets, but using one) embedded in 3-dimensional [[Minkowski space]]. This model is generally credited to Poincaré, but Reynolds (see below) says that [[Wilhelm Killing]] and [[Karl Weierstrass]] used this model from 1872. 
#*This model has direct application to [[special relativity]], as Minkowski 3-space is a model for [[spacetime]], suppressing one spatial dimension. One can take the hyperboloid to represent the events that various moving observers, radiating outward in a spatial plane from a single point, will reach in a fixed [[proper time]]. The hyperbolic distance between two points on the hyperboloid can then be identified with the relative [[rapidity]] between the two corresponding observers.

[[Image:Folded Coral Flynn Reef.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A coral with similar geometry on the [[Great Barrier Reef]]]]
[[M. C. Escher]]'s famous prints ''Circle Limit III'' and [http://mcescher.com/Gallery/recogn-bmp/LW436.jpg ''Circle Limit IV'']
illustrate the conformal disc model quite well. The white lines in ''III'' are not quite geodesics (they are [[hypercycle (geometry)|hypercycles]]), but are quite close to them. It is also possible to see quite plainly the negative [[curvature]] of the hyperbolic plane, through its effect on the sum of angles in triangles and squares. 

For example, in ''Circle Limit III'' every vertex belongs to three triangles and three squares. In the Euclidean plane, their angles would sum to 450°; i.e., a circle and a quarter. From this we see that the sum of angles of a triangle in the hyperbolic plane must be smaller than 180°. Another visible property is [[exponential growth]]. In ''Circle Limit III'', for example, one can see that the number of fishes within a distance of ''n'' from the center rises exponentially. The fishes have equal hyperbolic area, so the area of a ball of radius ''n'' must rise exponentially in ''n''.

There are several ways to physically realize a hyperbolic plane (or approximation thereof). A particularly well-known paper model based on the [[pseudosphere]] is due to [[William Thurston]].

==Homogeneous structure==

[[Hyperbolic space]] of dimension n is a special case of a Riemannian [[symmetric space]] of noncompact type, as it is isomorphic to the quotient 
: <math>O(1,n)/(O(1) \times O(n))</math>.
The [[orthogonal group]] O(1,n) acts by norm-preserving transformations on [[Minkowski space]] <math>\mathbb{R}^{1,n}</math>, and it acts transitively on the two-sheet hyperboloid of norm 1 vectors.  Timelike lines (i.e., those with positive-norm tangents) through the origin pass through antipodal points in the hyperboloid, so the space of such lines yields a model of hyperbolic n-space.  The stabilizer of any particular line is isomorphic to the product of the orthogonal groups O(n) and O(1), where O(n) acts on the tangent space of a point in the hyperboloid, and O(1) reflects the line through the origin.  Many of the elementary concepts in hyperbolic geometry can be described in linear algebraic terms: geodesic paths are described by intersections with planes through the origin, dihedral angles between hyperplanes can be described by inner products of normal vectors, and hyperbolic reflection groups can be given explicit matrix realizations.

In small dimensions, there are exceptional isomorphisms of Lie groups that yield additional ways to consider symmetries of hyperbolic spaces.  For example, in dimension 2, the isomorphisms <math>SO^+(1,2) \cong PSL_2(\mathbb{R}) \cong PSU(1,1)</math> allow one to interpret the upper half plane model as the quotient <math>SL_2(\mathbb{R})/SO(2)</math> and the Poincaré disc model as the quotient <math>SU(1,1)/U(1)</math>.  In both cases, the symmetry groups act by fractional linear transformations, since both groups are the orientation-preserving stabilizers in <math>PGL_2(\mathbb{C})</math> of the respective subspaces of the Riemann sphere.  The Cayley transformation not only takes one model of the hyperbolic plane to the other, but realizes the isomorphism of symmetry groups as conjugation in a larger group.  In dimension 3, the fractional linear action of <math>PGL_2(\mathbb{C})</math> on the Riemann sphere is identified with the action on the conformal boundary of hyperbolic 3-space induced by the isomorphism <math>O^+(1,3) \cong PGL_2(\mathbb{C})</math>.  This allows one to study isometries of hyperbolic 3-space by considering spectral properties of representative complex matrices.  For example, parabolic transformations are conjugate to rigid translations in the upper half-space model, and they are exactly those transformations that can be represented by unipotent upper triangular matrices.

==Vectors==

There is a notion of a [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] for hyperbolic geometry called a [[gyrovector]]. The difference between gyrovectors and euclidean vectors is that addition of gyrovectors is [[nonassociative]] and [[noncommutative]]. However this doesn't mean that A+(B+C) & (A+B)+C and A+B & B+A are totally unrelated. The exact relations are given by [[gyroassociativity]] and [[gyrocommutativity]] laws.
