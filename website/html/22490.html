The '''Location Information Server''', or LIS is a [[Node (networking)|network node]] originally defined in the [[National Emergency Number Association]] i2<ref>{{cite paper | author = NENA | title = NENA Interim VoIP Architecture for Enhanced 9-1-1 Services (i2) | version = 08-001 Issue 1 | publisher = NENA| date = 2005-12-06 | url = http://www.nena.org/media/File/08-001_20051205.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = 2008-12-17 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> [[network architecture]] that addresses the intermediate solution for providing [[e911]] service for users of [[VoIP|VoIP telephony]].  The LIS is the [[Node (networking)|node]] that determines the location of the [[Terminal (telecommunication)|VoIP terminal]].

Beyond the [[National Emergency Number Association|NENA]] architecture and [[VoIP]], the LIS is capable of providing location information to any [[Internet Protocol|IP]] device within its served [[access network]]<ref>{{cite book |last= Dawson|first= Martin|coauthors= James Winterbottom, Martin Thomson|title= IP Location|date= 2006-11-13|publisher= McGraw-Hill|isbn= 0-07-226377-6}}</ref>.

== The Role of the LIS ==

The LIS is a service that is provided by an [[access network]] provider to provide [[location information]] to users of the network.  To do this, it uses knowledge of [[network topology]] and a range of location determination techniques to locate devices that are attached to the network.  The precise methods that are used to determine location are dependent on the type of access network and the information that can be obtained from the device.

=== Location Determination ===

The method used to determine the location of a device in an access network varies between the different types of networks.  For a wired network, such as [[Ethernet]] or [[DSL]] a wiremap method is common.  In wiremap location determination, the location of a device is determined by finding which cables are used to send packets to the device.  This involves tracing data through aggregation points in the network (such as [[Ethernet]] switches, or [[DSL]] access nodes) and finding the port that packets for that device are sent to.  This information is combined with data available to the LIS (usually extracted from a [[database]]) to determine a final location.  How this tracing is done then depends on the type of network.

In wireless networks, a range of technologies can be applied to location determination, the most basic of which uses the location of the radio transmitter as an approximation.  The actual method applied is similar to the wiremap method, if a radio transmitter can be identified, then the location of the device can be given as the position of the transmitter with a region of [[measurement uncertainty|uncertainty]].

==Architecture and Protocols==

The [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] has defined an architecture and protocols for acquiring location information from a LIS.  A LIS in the immediate access network is automatically discovered<ref>{{cite web | last = Thomson | first = Martin | coauthors = James Winterbottom | title = Discovering the Local Location Information Server (LIS) (work in progress)| url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-geopriv-lis-discovery | date = 2008-12-17 | accessdate = 2008-12-17 }}</ref> and location information is retrieved using the HELD protocol<ref>{{cite web | last = Barnes (Ed.) | first = Mary | coauthors = James Winterbottom, Martin Thomson, Barbara Stark | title = HTTP Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) (work in progress)| url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery | date = 2008-12-17 | accessdate = 2008-12-17 }}</ref>.  Location information can be retrieved directly—known as by value—or the LIS can generate a temporary [[URI]] that can be used to provide location indirectly—known as a [[location URI]].

The location information provided by a LIS primarily uses the [[GEOPRIV]] format (RFC 4119), an [[XML]] representation based on the [[presence information|presence]] format defined in RFC 3863.  RFC 4119 provides a container for both geodetic position and civic address information (now updated by RFC 5139) and also defines elements for expressing a user's privacy preferences.
