A '''starbase''' is a facility, often in space, used in [[science fiction]] works such as [[Star Trek]], ''[[Babylon 5]]'', and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]''. Typically they act as [[drydock]]s, battle stations or trading outposts.

== Star Trek ==

The most prominent example of a starbase within the Star Trek universe is [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space 9]], a starbase which serves as the setting for the series of the same name. Also notable is [[Earth Spacedock]], a massive facility in Earth orbit in which vessels can berth inside the base itself rather than being docked to the outer hull. Similar facilities have also been seen within Star Trek. All of the other Star Trek series also include starbases as settings for some episode plots, with considerable portions of the episode often being shown on the starbase. Other Starbases are, however, not actual space installations and are instead built on the surface of planets or moons.  Also, many starbases have larger, more advanced medical and engineering sections than starships.

== Babylon 5 ==

The most prominent example of a starbase in Babylon 5 is the [[Babylon 5 (space station)|Babylon 5 station]] itself, as well as its four sister stations of the [[O'Neill cylinder]] configuration. The word "starbase" itself is rarely used in the series, rather the word "station" or "base" are used in place of it. Earth also employs a variety of starbases, like the [[Io (Babylon 5)|Io station]].<ref name="b5-chr">{{cite episode| episodelink=Chrysalis (Babylon 5)| title=Chrysalis| series=[[Babylon 5]]}}</ref> Also, other races such as the [[Narn]]s, the [[Centauri (Babylon 5)|Centauri]], and the [[Minbari]] also employ starbases.<ref name="b5-tcos">{{cite episode| episodelink=The Coming of Shadows| title=The Coming of Shadows| series=[[Babylon 5]]}}</ref><ref name="b5-mid" /><ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=War Without End (Babylon 5)| title=War Without End| series=[[Babylon 5]]}}</ref> Two Narn stations were seen so far: the one in Quadrant 37 and Quadrant 14, both destroyed by the [[Shadow (Babylon 5)|Shadows]].<ref name="b5-chr" /><ref name="b5-tcos" />The Centauri starbase orbiting Ragesh 3 was attacked and conquered by the Narns.<ref name="b5-mid">{{cite episode| episodelink=Midnight on the Firing Line| title=Midnight on the Firing Line| series=[[Babylon 5]]}}</ref>The [[Vorlon]]s too were seen with starbases, although it was designated by [[Lennier]] as a "Vorlon Observation post."<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Into the Fire (Babylon 5)| title=Into the Fire| series=[[Babylon 5]]}}</ref>
