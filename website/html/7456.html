'''Computed Tomography Laser [[Mammography]]''' ('''CTLM''') is the [[trademark]] of [[Imaging Diagnostic Systems, Inc.]] (IDSI, [[USA]]) for its [[Optical tomography|optical tomographic]] technique for female breast imaging.

This [[medical imaging]] technique uses [[laser]] energy in the near infrared region of the spectra, to detect [[angiogenesis]] in the breast tissue.  It is optical molecular imaging for [[hemoglobin]] both oxygenated and deoxygenated.  The technology uses laser in the same way [[computed tomography]] uses X-Rays, these beams travel through tissue and suffer attenuation. 

A laser detector measures the intensity drop and the data is collected as the laser detector moves across the breast creating a tomography image.
CTLM images show hemoglobin distribution in a tissue and can detect areas of Angiogenesis surrounding malignant tumors, that stimulate this angiogenesis to obtain nutrients for growth.
