In [[natural language processing]] a '''w-shingling''' is a set of unique "shingles"—contiguous [[subsequence]]s of [[token (parser)|tokens]] in a [[document]]—that can be used to gauge the [[document classification|similarity of two documents]].  The w denotes the number of tokens in each shingle in the set.

The document, "a rose is a rose is a rose" can be [[tokenization|tokenized]] as follows:

:(a,rose,is,a,rose,is,a,rose)

The set of all contiguous sequences of 4 tokens ([[N-gram]]s, here: 4-grams) is

:{ (a,rose,is,a), (rose,is,a,rose), (is,a,rose,is), (a,rose,is,a), (rose,is,a,rose) }

By removing duplicate elements from this set, a 4-shingling is obtained:

:{ (a,rose,is,a), (rose,is,a,rose), (is,a,rose,is) }

== Resemblance ==

For a given shingle size, the degree to which two documents ''A'' and ''B'' resemble each other can be expressed as the ratio of the magnitudes of their shinglings' [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[union (set theory)|union]], or

:<math>r(A,B)={{|S(A)\cap S(B)|}\over {|S(A)\cup S(B)|}}</math>

where |A| is the size of set A.  The resemblance is a number in the range [0,1], where 1 indicates that two documents are identical. This definition is identical with the [[Jaccard coefficient]] describing similarity and diversity of sample sets.
