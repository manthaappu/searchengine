'''BigQuery''' for Developers is a [[Restful|RESTful]] [[web service]] that enables interactive analysis of massively large datasets working in conjunction with [[Google Storage]]. It is an ''Infrastructure as a Service'' ([[Infrastructure_as_a_service#Infrastructure|IaaS]]) that may be used complementary with [[MapReduce]].

== Design ==
BigQuery (BQ) is reportedly based on Dremel<ref name="goog-dremel">{{cite web

|title=Dremel: Interactive Analysis of Web-Scale Datasets}}</ref>, a scalable, interactive ad-hoc query system for analysis of read-only nested data. To use the data in BigQuery, it first must be uploaded to [[Google Storage]] and in a second step imported using the BigQuery HTTP API. BigQuery requires all requests to be authenticated, supporting a number of Google-proprietary mechanisms as well as [[OAuth]].

== Features ==

* '''Managing data''' - create and delete tables based on a JSON-encoded schema, import data from [[Google Storage]].
* ''' Query''' - the queries are expressed in a SQL dialect and the results are returned in [[JSON]] with a maximum reply length of approximately 4MB (currently, there is no support for paging through results that exceed this limit). BigQuery does not currently support joins.
* '''Integration''' - BigQuery can be used from [http://code.google.com/googleapps/appsscript/ Google Apps Script] and [[Google Docs|Google Spreadsheets]].
* '''Access Control''' - is done via [[Google Storage]].
