The '''Deltar''' (Delta Getij Analogon Rekenmachine, [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for Delta Tide Analog Calculator) was an [[analog computer]], used from 1960 until 1984 in the design and implementation of the [[Delta Works]].

The computer was designed and built in order to make the complicated calculations required to predict the effects of [[dam]]s, [[Dike (construction)|dikes]], and [[flood gate|storm surge barrier]]s on the [[tide]]s in the [[estuary|estuaries]] of the rivers [[Rhine]], [[Meuse River|Meuse]] and [[Scheldt]].

The design of the Deltar was based on the analogy that exists between the properties and behaviour of [[water]] and [[electricity]]. Working with analogs of quantities such as water's height, rate of flow, and water storage, the design for the calculator basically used the electrical quantities [[electric charge|charge]], [[electric potential|potential]], [[inductance]] and [[capacitance]].
