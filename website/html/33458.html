A '''scroll wheel''' (or '''mouse wheel''') is a hard [[plastic]] or [[rubber]]y disc (the "[[wheel]]") on a [[computer mouse]] that is perpendicular to the mouse surface. It is normally located between the left and right mouse buttons.

== Functionality ==

It is used, as the name suggests, for [[scrolling]]. It can also be used as a third mouse button by pressing on it. Some modern mice can scroll horizontally as well as vertically, using either a [[wikt:tilt|tilt]]ing scroll-wheel (introduced by [[Microsoft]]) or a [[trackball|scroll ball]] (found on [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s [[Apple Mighty Mouse|Mighty Mouse]]). [[Logitech]] MicroGear mice (like the [[Logitech MX Revolution|MX Revolution]] and the [[Logitech VX Revolution|VX Revolution]]) use a 14 gram scroll wheel which can preserve the [[moment of inertia]] like a [[flywheel]] and can be used to quickly scroll through long pages and lists.<ref name="Logitech_MicroGear">[http://www.logitech.com/lang/pdf/ib-microgear_and_smartshift_EN.pdf Logitech.com]</ref>  The [[Orbita mouse]] by [http://www.CybereSport.com Cyber Sport] takes a new approach with its continuous scrolling capability, achieved by employing the whole round mouse as a scroll wheel which rotates on a ball bearing base.

Scroll wheels are prevalent on modern computer mice. To many users, they have become an integral part of the [[hardware interface]]. However, non-wheeled mice are still available.

Scroll wheels can also be found on such handheld devices as portable [[digital audio player]]s, [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s, or mobiles phones such as early [[Sony]] models and [[BlackBerry]] devices. On the Apple [[iPod]], the scroll wheel uses touch sensitive technologies from [[Synaptics]] (instead of being mechanical).

== History ==

The scroll wheel was invented in 1995 for the Genius EasyScroll mouse made by [[Taiwan|Taiwanese]] company [[KYE Systems]]. The man credited with inventing what we recognize as the wheel is [[Eric Michelman]].<ref name="Coding_Horror_Genius_EasyScroll">[http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000865.html Coding Horror: Meet The Inventor of the Mouse Wheel<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It first gained popularity in the late 1990s when [[operating system]]s had the feature built-in, and is notably one of the first additions to the basic two-button mouse design used for [[personal computer|PCs]] that became a [[de facto standard]]. It is also one of the first hardware elements (aside from high-speed [[modem]]s) designed directly in response to the proliferation of the [[World Wide Web]], where efficient mouse-only scrolling is most useful. Also, clicking a [[hyperlink]] with a third button or scroll wheel can create a tab in certain web browsers.

In the 21st century, scroll wheels started appearing on [[Computer keyboard|keyboards]] as well, particularly on [[Logitech]] and [[Microsoft]] models. It is usually located to the left of the [[caps lock]] key. The implementation of scroll wheels on [[laptop computer]]s has generally faded, while [[touchpad]]s are often made with the edges acting to scroll the page (rather than to move the [[cursor]]), partly making up for the lack of a scroll wheel. On laptops with multitouch capability, scrolling is usually achieved by touching and dragging two fingers on the touchpad at the same time. Many [[Linux]] distributions offer a third method of scrolling using the touchpad, where the user will first activate scroll-mode by pressing in a corner of the pad, and than dragging in a circle around the center of the pad, letting go of the touchpad will switch back to the default mouse-mode.

== Other applications ==
In many applications (e.g. [[Internet Explorer]], [[Mozilla Firefox]]<ref name="FF_shortcuts">[http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Page%20Zoom Mozilla.com]</ref>, [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] and [[Google Chrome]]), holding down the [[control key]] while rolling the scroll wheel causes the [[Plain text|text]] size to increase or decrease, or an image in an image-editing or map-viewing program to [[zoom]] in or out, if such a feature is available.

In many [[first-person shooter]] (FPS) games, the scroll wheel is usually set to change weapons. It is also sometimes used to control the zoom of scoped weapons and binoculars. FPS games with an emphasis on realism may choose to use the wheel for changing between stances. Since the introduction of tilting scroll-wheels, many FPS games use the left-right motion of the scroll wheel to cause the player to lean left and right. A less common use is to use the mouse wheel to adjust the player's speed of movement.

[[Real time strategy]] games use the mouse wheel to change the altitude of the camera. Many RTS games also allow control of the camera with the scroll wheel button held down causing the view to either tilt or pan with mouse movement.
