==In the unconscious: condensation and displacement==
In Freud's work (1900), [[Condensation (psychology)|condensation]] and [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]] (from German ''Verdichtung'' and ''Verschiebung'') are two closely linked concepts.<ref>[http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631207535_chunk_g97806312075356_ss1-35]</ref> In 1957, [[Jacques Lacan]], inspired by an article by linguist [[Roman Jakobson]], argued that the unconscious has the same structure of a language, and that condensation and displacement are equivalent to the [[poetic function]]s of [[metaphor]] and [[metonomy]].<ref name="Grigg">Grigg, Russell () ''[http://books.google.es/books?id=v4QxXp5X5mcC Lacan, language, and philosophy]'', chapter 11 ''Lacan and Jakobson - Metaphor and Metonymy'' pp.151-2, 160</ref><ref name="Jakobson56">[[Roman Jakobson]] and Halle, Morris (1956) ''Two Aspects of Language and Two Types of Aphasic Disturbances in Fundamentals of Language.''
