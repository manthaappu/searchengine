'''Stefan Andrus Burr''' is a [[mathematician]] and [[computer scientist]].  He is currently a professor of computer science at [[The City College of New York]].

Burr received his Ph.D. in 1969 from [[Princeton University]] under the supervision of [[Bernard Dwork]]; his thesis research involved the [[Waring–Goldbach problem]] in [[number theory]], which concerns the representations of integers as sums of powers of [[prime number]]s.<ref name="mg">{{mathgenealogy|name=Stefan Andrus Burr|id=28377}}.</ref>

Many of his subsequent publications involve problems from the field of [[Ramsey theory]].  He has published 27 papers with [[Paul Erdős]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/Erdos.html|title=Paul Erdõs' papers|publisher=[[Alfred Renyi Institute of Mathematics]] - http://www.renyi.hu|language=English|accessdate=8 March 2010}}</ref> The [[Erdős–Burr conjecture]], published as a conjecture by Erdős and Burr in 1975 and still unsolved, states that [[sparse graph]]s have [[linear growth|linear]] [[Ramsey number]]s.
