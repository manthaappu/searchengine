'''swingLabs''' is a [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] [[Open source]] project proposing extensions to the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[Swing (Java)|Swing]] [[Widget toolkit|GUI toolkit]]. Available components include:
* Sorting, filtering, highlighting for tables, trees, and lists
* Find/search
* [[Autocomplete|Auto-completion]]
* Login/authentication framework
* TreeTable component
* Collapsible panel component
* Date picker component
* Tip-of-the-Day component

The aim of the project is to experiment new or enhanced GUI functionalities that are required by [[Rich client]] applications. It acts as a testbed for ideas related to client side technologies.

==Integration into Java API==

Successful project components are eventually incorporated into the core [[Swing (Java)|Swing]] toolkit for future Java versions, although API compatibility is not guaranteed. Examples of these are:
* the '''{{Javadoc:SE|javax/swing|GroupLayout}}''' manager in [[Java SE 6]]<ref>GroupLayout was initially developed in conjunction with '''Matisse''', the GUI builder of [[NetBeans]].</ref>.
*  incorporation of the '''{{Javadoc:SE|java/awt|SystemTray}}''' in [[Java SE 6]].
* the new '''{{Javadoc:SE|java/awt|Desktop}}''' class in [[Java SE 6]], which allows to launch easily associated applications registered on the native desktop, as for example : launching the user-default browser, launching the user-default mail client, launching a registered application to open, edit or print a specified file.

==License==
The project is distributed under a [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]] license.

==Sub-projects==
The [https://swinglabs.dev.java.net/ swingLabs project] is divided into several sub-projects. For example :
* [https://swingx.dev.java.net/ swingX]: provides extensions to the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[Swing (Java)|Swing]] [[Widget toolkit|GUI toolkit]].
* [https://jdic.dev.java.net/ JDIC]: as for '''JD'''esktop '''I'''ntegration '''C'''omponents, a project aims to make Java applications first-class citizens of current desktop platforms without sacrificing platform independence. Its mission is to enable seamless desktop/Java integration.
* [https://nimbus.dev.java.net/ nimbus]: a [[Look and feel]] using [[Synth Look and Feel|synth]], the Java [[skinnable]] [[Look and feel#Look and Feel in Widget Toolkits|look and feel]].
* [https://swing-layout.dev.java.net/ swingLayout]: the home of the '''{{Javadoc:SE|javax/swing|GroupLayout}}''' manager, before inclusion in [[Java SE 6]].
* [https://jdnc.dev.java.net/ JDNC]: Contained components that allow to build easily [[Swing (Java)|Swing]]-based rich-client Java applications. The project is no more actively maintained. It has been replaced by [[Swing Application Framework|Swing Application Framework (JSR 296)]]
* [https://scenegraph.dev.java.net/ scenegraph]: A library that provide 2D [[Scene graph]] functionality to [[Java 2D]], including [[Swing (Java)|Swing]] widgets. This library is used internally by the [[JavaFX Script]] language.
*[https://pdf-renderer.dev.java.net/ PDFRenderer]: A 100% pure Java [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] viewer library.
