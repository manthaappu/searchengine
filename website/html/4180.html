The '''Blue Flag''' is a certification by the [[Foundation for Environmental Education]] (FEE)<ref>{{cite web|author=Bysted A/S |url=http://www.fee-international.org/ |title=FEE - Foundation for Environmental Education |publisher=Fee-international.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-21}}</ref> that a [[beach]] or [[marina]] meets its stringent standards. 

The Blue Flag is a [[trademark]] owned by FEE which is a [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit]], [[non-governmental organisation]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blueflag.org |title=Blue Flag Programme |publisher=Blueflag.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-21}}</ref> consisting of 65 organisations in 60 member countries in [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Oceania]], [[Asia]], [[North America]] and [[South America]].

FEE's Blue Flag criteria include standards for water quality, safety, environmental education and information, the provision of services and general [[environmental management]] criteria. The Blue Flag is sought for beaches and marinas as an indication of their high environmental and quality standards.

Certificates, which FEE refers to as awards, are issued on an annual basis to beaches and marinas of FEE member countries. The awards are announced yearly on 5 June for Europe, Canada, Morocco, Tunisia and other countries in a similar geographic location, and on 1 November for the Caribbean, New Zealand, South Africa and other countries in the [[southern hemisphere]].<ref>[http://www.blueflag.org/Menu/Blue+Flag+beaches%2fmarinas Blue Flag beaches/marinas]. Retrieved 11 February 2010.</ref>

In the [[European Union]], the water quality standards are incorporated in the EC [[Water Framework Directive]].

==Blue Flags awarded==
=== 2009 Awards ===
As a result of the 2009 awards, a total of 3,458 Blue Flags are waving around the world: 2,808 beaches and 650 Marinas.<ref name="blueflag1">[http://www.blueflag.org/Menu/Blue+Flag+beaches%2fmarinas Blueflag.org]</ref>

===2009 Top places===
Consistently in the past few years [[Spain]] has  topped the list for the most Blue Flags awarded, with [[Greece]] coming second (like in 2008) and [[France]] in third place.

[[Cyprus]] with 53 Blue Flag beaches has three records:

* the most Blue Flags per capita in the world
* the most dense concentration of Blue Flag Beaches
* the most Blue Flag beaches and per coastline length in the whole world.

===Table of Blue Flags in force 2009===
The table below lists the Blue Flags (both for beaches and marinas) awarded and in force today.
The table can be sorted to show the total number of Blue Flags per country and also the number of Blue Flags per population, per area or per the length of the coastline of each country.

==History==
The Blue Flag was created in France in 1985 as a pilot scheme where French coastal municipalities were awarded the Blue Flag on the basis of criteria covering sewage treatment and bathing water quality

===Blue Flag on European Community level in 1987===
1987 was the "European Year of the Environment" and the European Commission was responsible for developing the European Community activities of that year. The Foundation for Environmental Education in Europe (FEEE) presented the concept of the Blue Flag to the Commission, and it was agreed to launch the Blue Flag Programme as one of several "European Year of the Environment" activities in the Community.

The French concept of the Blue Flag was developed on European level to include other areas of environmental management, such as waste management and coastal planning and protection. Besides beaches marinas also became eligible for the Blue Flag.

In 1987, 244 beaches and 208 marinas from 10 countries were awarded the Blue Flag.

===Success===
There have been increases in the numbers of Blue Flags awarded each year. The criteria have during these years been changed to more strict criteria. As an example, in 1992 the Programme started using the restrictive guideline values in the EEC Bathing Water Directive as imperative criteria, and this was also the year where all Blue Flag criteria became the same in all participating countries

===Outside the European Union===
In 2001, FEEE rules were changed to allow non-European national organisations, sharing the objectives of FEEE, to become members, and changed its name by dropping Europe from its name, becoming the Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE).

Several organisations and authorities outside the European Union have joined FEE. FEE has been cooperating with UNEP and UN WTO on extending the Programme to areas outside Europe. South Africa, Canada, Morocco, Tunisia, New Zealand and four countries in the Caribbean region are members of FEE. Aruba, Brazil and Malta are currently in the pilot phase of the Programme and  Jordan, Macedonia, Turks & Caicos Islands, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates have started the implementation of the Blue Flag Programme.

FEE standards allow for regional variations in beach criteria to reflect specific environmental conditions of a region. As of 2006 an international set of criteria is being used with some variations.

===Present program===
In 2010 over 3450 beaches and marinas globally were awarded the Blue Flag.

41 countries are currently participating in the Blue Flag Programme: [[Aruba]], [[Bahamas]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Denmark]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Iceland]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Jamaica]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Malta]], [[Montenegro]], [[Morocco]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Russia]], [[Romania]], [[Slovenia]], [[South Africa]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Tunisia]], [[Turkey]] and [[United Kingdom]]

Eight countries are currently running the programme in the pilot phase.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}
