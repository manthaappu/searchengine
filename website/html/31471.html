She has chaired and published papers in top-tier academic conferences in these fields. Her research and expert opinion on technology have also been reported in major news media sources.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Grinter was born in [[Norwich]], [[England]], [[UK]] and attended the [[City of Norwich School]] and [[Hethersett High School]].<ref name="BekiAcademic">{{ cite web | url=http://www.grinter.org/Beki.html | last=Grinter | first=Beki | title=Beki: Academic | accessdate=2008-03-28 }}</ref> She pursued undergraduate studies at the [[University of Leeds]], graduating in 1991 with a [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] (Hons) in [[Computer Science]]. Following this, Grinter received a [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council|EPSRC]] fellowship to study at the [[University of California, Irvine]], where she earned a [[Master of Science|M.S.]] (1994) and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] (1996), both in Information and Computer Science.<ref name="BekiAcademic" /> As a graduate student, Grinter was influenced by [[David Parnas]], whose work in software engineering spoke to Grinter's burgeoning interest in the relationship between humans and software.<ref>{{ cite book | title=HCI Remixed: Essays on Works That Have Influenced the HCI Community | last=Grinter | first=Rebecca E. | chapter=The Work to Make Software Work | year=2008 | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge, MA, USA | pages=97–101 | editor=Thomas Erickson and David W.

===Research career===
Upon receiving her Ph.D. from the University of California, Irvine, Grinter worked at [[Bell Labs]] in [[Naperville, Illinois]] as a Technical Staff Member from 1996 to 2000. She then left Bell Labs to accept a position as a Research Staff Member at [[Palo Alto Research Center]] (PARC) from 2000 to 2004. At PARC, Grinter supervised a study of [[iTunes]] use in the workplace<ref>{{ cite journal | title=Listening In: Practices Surrounding iTunes Music Sharing | last=Voida | first=Amy | coauthors=Rebecca E.

==Research interests==
Grinter's research lies generally in the fields of [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI) and [[computer-supported cooperative work]] (CSCW). Her earlier work dealt with the challenges of distributed [[software engineering]], while her more recent work has focused on HCI, CSCW, and [[ubiquitous computing]] applications beyond the workplace, including [[instant messaging]] and [[short message service|SMS]] usage among teenagers, museum visitor behavior, technologies for religion, and domestic computing opportunities. Grinter is a proponent of [[qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[empirical research]] methods, often conducting interviews and [[ethnography|ethnographic studies]] to understand intersections between humans and technologies.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/directory/beki-grinter | title=Beki Grinter | publisher=[[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Computing]] | accessdate=2008-03-28 }}</ref> One of Grinter's best-known publications, "Instant Messaging in Teen Life",<ref>{{ cite journal | title=Instant Messaging in Teen Life | year=2002 | last=Grinter | first=Rebecca E. | coauthors = Leysia Palen | journal=Proceedings of the 2002 ACM conference on Computer supported cooperative work | pages=21–30 | url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/587078.587082 | publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] | doi=10.1145/587078.587082 }}</ref> coauthored with Leysia Palen, was reported as one of the 15 most-downloaded papers on the [[ACM Digital Library]] for the year of 2006.<ref>{{ cite journal | publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] | journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] | date=March 2007 | volume=50 | issue=3 | pages=101–102 | title=Top 10 Downloads from ACM's Digital Library | last=Crawford | first=Diane | doi=10.1145/1226736.1226770 }}</ref><ref>{{ cite pressrelease | url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/news/study-on-popularity-of-im-technology-with-teens-receives-top-hits-for-2006 | title=Instant Messaging in Teen Life | year=2007 | date=2007-02-28 | title=Study on Popularity of IM Technology with Teens Receives Top Hits for 2006 | accessdate=2008-03-26 | publisher=[[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Computing]] }}</ref>
