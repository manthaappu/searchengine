A '''grid network''' is a kind of [[computer network]] consisting of a number of (computer) systems connected in a grid topology.

In a regular grid topology, each node in the network is connected with two neighbors along one or more [[dimension]]s.  If the network is one-dimensional, and the chain of nodes is connected to form a circular loop, the resulting topology is known as a ring.  Network systems such as [[Fiber distributed data interface|FDDI]] use two counter-rotating [[token-passing]] rings to achieve high reliability and performance.  In general, when an ''n''-dimensional grid network is connected circularly in more than one dimension, the resulting network topology is a [[torus]], and the network is called "toroidal".  When the number of nodes along each dimension of a toroidal network is 2, the resulting network is called
a [[hypercube]].

A [[parallel computing]] cluster or [[multi-core]] processor is often connected in regular interconnection network such as a
[[de Bruijn graph]]

a [[fat tree]] network,
a [[torus]], or [[cube-connected cycles]].

Note that a grid network is not the same as a grid computer (or [[computational grid]]) (even though the nodes in a grid network are usually computers, and [[grid computing]] obviously requires some kind of [[computer network]] to interconnect the computers).
