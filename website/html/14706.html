'''Galaxy Zoo''' is an online [[astronomy]] project which invites members of the public to assist in classifying over sixty million [[galaxy|galaxies]]. It is an example of [[citizen science]] as it enlists the help of members of the public to help in scientific research.  An improved version—'''Galaxy Zoo 2'''—went live on 17 February 2009.

== Origins ==
The project is inspired by [[Stardust@home]], where the public was asked by [[NASA]] to search images obtained from a mission to a [[comet]] for [[interstellar dust]] impacts. Galaxy Zoo is a collaboration between researchers at many institutions, including [[Oxford University]], [[Portsmouth University]], [[Nottingham University]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Yale University]], [[University of California, Berkeley]] and [[Fingerprint Digital Media]], Belfast.

== Importance of volunteers ==
Computer programs have been unable to reliably classify the galaxies. According to a member of the team behind the project, [[Kevin Schawinski]], "The [[human brain]] is actually much better than a computer at these pattern-recognition tasks."Without human volunteers, it would take researchers years to process the photographs, but it is estimated that with as few as 10,000 to 20,000 people giving up time to classify the galaxies, the process could be complete in one month.

No knowledge of astronomy is required. In the site's [[tutorial]], would-be volunteers are shown spirals, ellipticals etc., and can try guessing before being shown the correct answer.  Also shown are pictures of stars and satellite trails, which the robot telescope would have recorded without being able to classify them. Volunteers are then tested on some additional pictures and signed up if they get a reasonable number of correct results.

== Previously unseen images ==
[[Chris Lintott]], another member of the team behind the project commented that, "One advantage is that you get to see parts of space that have never been seen before. These images were taken by a [[robotic telescope]] and processed automatically, so the odds are that when you log on, that first galaxy you see will be one that no human has seen before."<ref name=BBC>{{cite news | title = Scientists seek galaxy hunt help | publisher = BBC News | date = July 11, 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6289474.stm | accessdate = 2007-07-12}}</ref> This was confirmed by Schawinski, "Most of these galaxies have been photographed by a robotic telescope, and then processed by computer. So this is the first time they will have been seen by human eyes."<ref name=Nature>{{cite news | title = See new galaxies — without leaving your chair | publisher = news@nature.com | date = July 11, 2007 | url = http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070709/full/news070709-7.html | accessdate = 2007-07-12}}</ref>

== Original purpose ==
Galaxy Zoo volunteers were asked to judge from the images whether the galaxies are [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical]] or [[spiral galaxy|spiral]] and, if spiral, whether they are rotating in a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. The images were taken automatically by the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] using a [[digital camera]] mounted on a [[telescope]] at the [[Apache Point Observatory]] in [[New Mexico]], [[United States]]. It is hoped this census will provide valuable information about how different kinds of galaxies are distributed, allowing scientists to determine whether existing galactic models are correct.<ref>{{cite news | title = Galaxy Zoo opens | publisher = inthenews.com | date = July 11, 2007 | url = http://www.inthenews.co.uk/news/autocodes/countries/mexico/galaxy-zoo-opens-$1107870.htm | accessdate = 2007-07-12}}</ref> It is an example of [[citizen science]].

Theorists believe that spiral galaxies can merge and become ellipticals, and also that ellipticals can become spirals if they receive more gas or stars.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080505142547/http://www.galaxyzoo.org/Project.aspx Galaxy Zoo - The Science, page 1]</ref> In addition, Professor Michael Longo of the [[University of Michigan]] has claimed that the rotation of spiral galaxies is not random, which would force a major rethink of cosmology if it were correct. This is based on a survey of 1,660 galaxies: a much larger sample could support or disprove it.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080505142547/http://www.galaxyzoo.org/Project.aspx Galaxy Zoo - The Science, page 2]</ref>

== Progress ==
On August 2, 2007, ''Galaxy Zoo'' issued its first newsletter which explained that 80,000 volunteers had already classified more than 10 million images of galaxies, meeting the goals for the first phase of the project.  The aim now is

: To have "each and every galaxy classified by 20 separate users.  The importance of multiple classifications is that it will enable us to build an accurate and reliable database, that will meet the high standards of the scientific community.  For the first time, we'll be able to separate not only spirals from ellipticals, but obvious spirals from fainter, fuzzier things. No-one has ever been able to do this before.  (''Newsletter'').

This target was later raised to 30, in light of the continuing enthusiasm of the volunteers.  The final datasets contain 34,617,406 clicks done by 82,931 users.  Work was then done to test for bias, by presenting images in black-and-white and / or photographically reversed.  This is needed to check whether the apparent surplus of anti-clockwise spirals<ref>[http://www.galaxyzooforum.org/index.php?topic=9454.0 Why record the galaxy rotation?]</ref> was actually a bias of the human eye (as seems to be the case).<ref>[http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/01/10/aas-14-galaxy-zoo-finds-people-are-screwed-up-not-the-universe/ Galaxy zoo finds people are screwed up, not the Universe]</ref>

=== Forums and Blogs ===
There is also an active forum attached to ''Galaxy Zoo'', where volunteers post the more striking images and discuss what they are.  There are already some interesting (unofficial) results.  Ring galaxies turn out to be much more common than was believed.  Only two known galaxies were 'three legged' - possessing three well-defined spiral arms.  Many more have now been found.<ref>[http://www.galaxyzooforum.org/index.php?topic=7446.0 three legged well defined spiral galaxy]</ref>  There are many pictures of merging, colliding or interacting galaxies.<ref>[http://www.galaxyzooforum.org/index.php?topic=567.0 Biggest cosmic trainwrecks - Mergers]</ref>

There is also now a 'science blog',<ref>[http://blogs.zooniverse.org/galaxyzoo/ Official Blog of the Galaxy Zoo project]</ref> an official summary of what the 'zoo' has achieved so far.  There is a current project seeking volunteers to review a set of possible merging galaxies.

=== Galaxy Zoo 2 ===
This consists of some 250,000 of the brightest galaxies from the Galaxy Zoo.  Galaxy Zoo 2 allows for a much more detailed classification, by shape and by the intensity or dimness of the galactic core, and with a special section for oddities like mergers or ring galaxies. The sample also contains fewer optical oddities and orange blobs.

The project closed with some 60 million classficiations.   The first papers from Zoo 2 are already complete, and much science work continues.<ref>[http://zoo2.galaxyzoo.org/ Galaxy Zoo 2]</ref>  Galaxy classification by volunteers continues with ''Galaxy Zoo Hubble''.

=== Other projects in the 'Zooniverse' ===
As at December 2010, the following projects were 'live', still accepting input and available for new users to join:
:Galaxy Zoo Hubble
:Galaxy Zoo The Hunt for Supernovae
:Galaxy Zoo Understanding Cosmic Mergers
:Planethunters.org
:The Milky Way Project
:Moon Zoo
:Old Weather
:Solar Stormwatch

''Galaxy Zoo Hubble'' involves classifying hundreds of thousands of galaxies drawn from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope archive.  It includes galaxies with 'blue clumps' that may represent a stage in the maturing of galaxies into modern forms.

There are more than 350,000 volunteers.<ref>[http://www.zooniverse.org/home Zooniverse Home]</ref>

It has recently been confirmed that "spiral galaxies which share a neighbourhood (a region defined as 65 million light years
across) are likely to rotate in the same direction—but only if they formed the vast majority of their stars more than 10 billion years ago." <ref>[http://www.astronomynow.com/090611GalaxyZooputsnewspinongalaxyrotation.html Galaxy Zoo puts new spin on galaxy rotation]</ref>  (This is distinct from the idea of a bias in the much vaster area of the entire survey, which does not seem to be true.)

A November 2010 anouncement based on ''Galaxy Zoo: Bars in Disk Galaxies'' suggests that bars help to slow or stop star formation in spirals, by some unknown mechanism.<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101108191613.htm Bars Kill Spiral Galaxies, Astronomers and Volunteers Discover]</ref>  This is based on the observation that red spirals are about twice as likely to host bars as blue spirals.

A number of telescopes are being used to follow up on Galaxy Zoo object discoveries, including [[Kitt Peak National Observatory|Kitt Peak]] in Arizona and the [[Institut de radioastronomie millimétrique|IRAM millimeter dish]] in Spain.
