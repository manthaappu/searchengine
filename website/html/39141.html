'''VMware vSphere''', (formerly [[VMware Infrastructure]] 4) is [[VMware]]'s first [[cloud computing|cloud]] [[operating system]]. It is able to manage large pools of [[Platform virtualization|virtualized computing infrastructure]], including software and hardware.

==History==
[[Image:VSphere Enterprise Diagram V1.gif|thumb|250px|[VMware vSphere, a holistic view]]]
While [[VMware Infrastructure]] 3.5 was in development, vSphere was conceived as an enhanced suite of tools offering the ability to do [[cloud computing]] utilizing VMware [[VMware ESX|ESX]]/[[VMware ESXi|ESXi]] 4.<ref name="ReleaseArticle">
[http://vsphere-land.com/news/vsphere-release-date.html Release article]</ref>

The Internet-aware and [[cloud computing|cloud]]-enabled tool suite was [[spin-off product|spin off]] as '''VMware Infrastructure 4''' (for short, ''VI 4'') parallel to but distinct from VMware Infrastructure 3.5 (''VI 3.5'') that was then ready for release (March 30, 2009).<ref name="ReleaseArticle" />

VMware eventually announced '''vSphere 4''' instead of VI 4 on April 21, 2009 and released it on May 21, 2009.<ref name="ReleaseArticle" />

VMware released Update 1 for vSphere 4 November 19, 2009 to add support for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.<ref name="vSphere 4.0 Update 1 Release Notes">{{cite web|url=http://www.vmware.com/support/vsphere4/doc/vsp_esx40_u1_rel_notes.html|title=VMware ESX 4.0 Update 1 Release Notes |date=December 18, 2009}}</ref>

VMware's vSphere 4.1 began shipping in August, 2010, and delivers additional functionality, including an updated vCenter Configuration Manager as well as vCenter Application Discovery Manager. In addition, vMotion now allows customers to move more than one VM at a time from server host to server host.
