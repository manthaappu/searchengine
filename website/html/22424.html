Nick Trefethen (as he is known) gained his bachelor's degree from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in 1977 and his master's from [[Stanford University|Stanford]] in 1980. His  PhD thesis at Stanford in 1982 was entitled ''Wave Propagation and Stability for Finite Difference Schemes''. He went on to work at  the [[Courant Institute]] in New York, [[MIT]] and [[Cornell University|Cornell]], before being appointed to a chair at [[Oxford]] and a Fellowship of [[Balliol College]].<ref name="SNC">{{cite web|url=http://www.orcca.on.ca/conferences/snc2007/site/talks/talks.html|title=SNC '07 Invited Speakers|accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref>

{{As of|2009}} he has published around 125  journal papers spanning a wide range of areas within numerical analysis and applied mathematics, including non-normal [[eigenvalue]] problems and applications, spectral methods for differential equations, [[numerical linear algebra]], [[fluid mechanics]], computational [[complex analysis]], and approximation theory.<ref name="pubs">{{cite web|url=http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/people/Nick.Trefethen/publication/publication.html|title=Nick Trefethen publication list}}</ref> He is perhaps best known for his work on [[pseudospectrum|pseudospectra]] of [[normal matrix|non-normal matrices]] and operators. This work covers theoretical aspects as well as numerical  algorithms, and applications including fluid mechanics, numerical solution of partial differential equations, numerical linear algebra, shuffling of cards, random matrices, differential equations and  [[lasers]].  Trefethen is currently an [[ISI highly cited researcher]].<ref name="HCR">{{cite web|url=http://hcr3.isiknowledge.com/author.cgi?&link1=Search&link2=Search%20Results&AuthLastName=trefethen&AuthFirstName=&AuthMiddleName=&AuthMailnstName=&CountryID=-1&DisciplineID=0&id=2810|title=ISI author page}}</ref>

Trefethen has written a number of books on numerical analysis including ''Numerical Linear Algebra'' with [[David Bau]],  ''Spectral Methods in MATLAB'', ''Schwarz-Christoffel Mapping''  with [[Tobin Driscoll]] and ''Spectra and Pseudospectra: The Behavior of Nonnormal Matrices and Operators'' with [[Mark Embree]].  He has recently been heavily involved in the creation and development of the [[MATLAB]]-based [[Chebfun]] software project.

Trefethen was the first winner of the [[Leslie Fox Prize for Numerical Analysis]], and as well as being a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] he is a member of the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in the US.
