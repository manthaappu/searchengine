'''Detect and Eliminate Computer Acquired Forensics''' ('''DECAF''') is a counter intelligence tool specifically created around obstructing the well known [[Microsoft]] product [[Computer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor|COFEE]] used by law enforcement around the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/12/decaf-cofee/|title=Hackers Brew Self-Destruct Code to Counter Police Forensics|last=Zetter|first=Kim|date=14 December 2009|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=15 December 2009}}</ref> However, the tool does not prevent access by other more advanced computer forensics tools, and so computers protected with DECAF can still be examined by non-COFEE tools.

On December 18, 2009, the authors remotely disabled the software, with the aim of convincing security professionals to "band together" to offer better support to government entities.<ref name="decafme" >{{cite news|url=http://decafme.org/|title=Game Over|date=18 December 2009|publisher=decafme.org|accessdate=18 December 2009}}{{Dead link|date=December 2010}}</ref>  The tool was patched and re-enabled by a group called SOLDIERX on December 23, 2009.<ref name="Reactivated DECAF">{{cite web|url=http://www.soldierx.com/news/DECAF-hacked-and-re-enabled-SX|title=DECAF hacked and re-enabled by SX|date=23 December 2009|publisher=SOLDIERX|accessdate=23 December 2009}}</ref><ref name="Reactivating DECAF">{{cite web|url=http://praetorianprefect.com/archives/2009/12/reactivating-decaf-in-two-minutes/|title=Reactivating DECAF in Two Minutes|date=18 December 2009|publisher=Preorian Prefect|accessdate=19 December 2009}}</ref>

DECAF provides real-time monitoring of COFEE signatures on [[Universal serial bus|USB]] devices and in running applications.<ref name="decafme" /> When a COFEE signature is detected, DECAF performs numerous user-defined processes. These may include COFEE log clearing, ejecting USB devices, and contamination or spoofing of [[MAC address]]es.<ref name="Register 12-14">{{cite news|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/12/14/microsoft_cofee_vs_decaf/|title=Hackers declare war on international forensics tool|last=Goodin|first=Dan|date=14 December 2009|publisher=The Register|accessdate=15 December 2009}}</ref>
