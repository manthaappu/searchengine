Booch is best known for developing the [[Unified Modeling Language]] with [[Ivar Jacobson]] and [[James Rumbaugh]].

== Biography ==
He earned his [[bachelor's degree]] in 1977 from the [[United States Air Force Academy]] and a [[master's degree]] in electrical engineering in 1979 from the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ddj.com/java/197801612|title=Dr. Dobb's Excellence in Programming Award|date=2007-03-09|author=Michael Swaine|publisher= Dr. Dobb's Journal}}</ref>

He is former Chief Scientist of [[Rational Software]] (acquired by IBM on February 20, 2003), where he worked until March 18, 2008.  Afterwards he became Chief Scientist, Software Engineering in IBM Research, and series editor for [[Benjamin Cummings]].

In 1995 he was inducted as a Fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]].<ref>http://fellows.acm.org/fellow_citation.cfm?id=2030153&srt=all</ref> He was named an [[IBM Fellow]] in 2003, soon after his entry into IBM, and assumed his current role on March 18, 2008.  He was recognized as an [[IEEE]] Fellow in 2010.<ref>http://www.ieee.org/membership_services/membership/fellows/chronology/fellows_2010.html</ref>

== Work ==
Booch is best known for developing the [[Unified Modeling Language]] with [[Ivar Jacobson]] and [[James Rumbaugh]]. He also developed the [[Booch method]] of software development, which he presents in his book, ''Object Oriented Analysis and Design''. He advises adding more classes to simplify complex code. Booch is also an advocate of [[Design pattern (computer science)|design pattern]]s. (For instance, he wrote the [[foreword]] to  [[Design Patterns (book)|Design Patterns]], an early and highly influential book in the field.) In the 1980s, Booch wrote one of the more popular books on programming in [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]].

=== IBM 1130 ===
Booch got his first exposure to programming on an [[IBM 1130]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/i-booch/ Quote from interview | title=Grady Booch polishes his crystal ball | first=Grady |last=Booch | authorlink= | date=2003-04-03 | publisher=[[IBM]] accessdate=2007-01-16}}</ref>

<blockquote>... I pounded the doors at the local IBM sales office until a salesman took pity on me. After we chatted for a while, he handed me a Fortran [manual]. I'm sure he gave it to me thinking, "I'll never hear from this kid again." I returned the following week saying, "This is really cool. I've read the whole thing and have written a small program. Where can I find a computer?" The fellow, to my delight, found me programming time on an IBM 1130 on weekends and late-evening hours. That was my first programming experience, and I must thank that anonymous IBM salesman for launching my career. Thank you, IBM.</blockquote>

=== Booch method ===
[[Image:Booch-diagram.png|thumb|250px|Class diagram]]
The [[Booch method]] is a technique used in [[software engineering]]. It is an [[object modeling language]] and methodology that was widely used in [[object-oriented analysis and design]]. It was developed by Booch while at [[Rational Software]].

The notation aspect of the Booch method has now been superseded by the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), which features graphical elements from the Booch method along with elements from the [[object-modeling technique]] (OMT) and [[object-oriented software engineering]] (OOSE).

Methodological aspects of the Booch method have been incorporated into several methodologies and processes, the primary such methodology being the [[Rational Unified Process]] (RUP).
