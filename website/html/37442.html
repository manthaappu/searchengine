<html> <head> <title>The Reckoning of Time</title></head><body>'''The Reckoning of Time''' (Latin: ''De temporum ratione'') is an [[Anglo-Saxon|Anglo-Saxon era]] treatise written in [[Latin]] by the [[Northumbrian]] monk [[Bede]] in [[725]]. The treatise includes an introduction to the traditional ancient and medieval view of the cosmos, including an explanation of how the spherical earth influenced the changing length of daylight, of how the seasonal motion of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] influenced the changing appearance of the [[New moon]] at evening twilight, and a quantitative relation between the changes of the tides at a given place and the daily motion of the moon.<ref>Wallis (2004:82-85;307-312).</ref>

''The Reckoning of Time'' describes a variety of ancient calendars, including the [[Germanic calendar|Anglo-Saxon calendar]].<ref>[http://www.nabkal.de/beda/beda_15.html Chapter XV, De mensibus Anglorum.]</ref> The focus of ''De temporum ratione'' was calculation of the date of [[Easter]], for which Bede described the method developed by [[Dionysius Exiguus#Easter tables|Dionysius Exiguus]]. ''De temporum ratione'' also gave instructions for calculating the date of the Easter [[full moon]], for calculating the motion of the Sun and Moon through the [[zodiac]], and for many other calculations related to the calendar.
