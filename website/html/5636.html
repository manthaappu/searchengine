<html> <head> <title>Category talk:Unix software</title></head><body>== Sane Organization ==

In order to standardize the UNIX software listing with the [[:Category:Software_by_operating_system|other operating systems]], I am creating this category and moving all the previously categorized.

In a sane world, programs that compile and run on '''*two*''' or more UNIX-like operating systems (BSD, Linux, MacOS X, Solaris, etc.) would be put into this main category, followed by sub-categories for MacOS X, Linux, BSD (for programs that only work on one of those).

The tree would look like

*Windows — Stuff that only works in Windows
:: ''Why should this only be used for stuff that ''only'' works in Windows?  What about, e.g., stuff that runs natively under Unix and under Windows, but not under Mac OS?'' — [[User:Daniel Brockman|Daniel Brockman]] 03:56, 30 January 2006 (UTC)
*MacOS — Classic and OSX programs that offer '''*native*''' [[Aqua (GUI)|Aqua GUIs]] or otherwise a significantly expanded codebase for OSX support
::Presumably that's "Mac OS X", not just "Mac OS". [[User:Guy Harris|Guy Harris]] ([[User talk:Guy Harris|talk]]) 19:58, 31 October 2009 (UTC)
*UNIX — Stuff that works in '''''*two*''' or more'' of the below
**HP-UX — Stuff that '''*only*''' works in HP-UX
**Linux — Stuff that '''*only*''' works in Linux (such as the Linux kernel)
**Solaris
**SCO Unix
**Darwin — Console/daemon applications or apps that require an [[X11]] server that could run on MacOS X's underlying UNIX system but do not have native MacOS X support (e.g. ''cat'' and ''[[GTK]]'').
::...and that presumably don't run on any ''other'' UN*Xes (otherwise it'd be "Unix software"). [[User:Guy Harris|Guy Harris]] ([[User talk:Guy Harris|talk]]) 19:58, 31 October 2009 (UTC)
**BSD — Stuff that works in '''*all*''' BSD distributions
***FreeBSD — Stuff that '''*only*''' works in FreeBSD
***OpenBSD
***NetBSD
::Presumably there could be categories for other UN*Xes, such as [[AIX]], [[IRIX]], etc.. [[User:Guy Harris|Guy Harris]] ([[User talk:Guy Harris|talk]]) 19:58, 31 October 2009 (UTC)
*Cross-platform — Stuff that works on '''*all*''' the major PC operating systems (e.g. ''apache'', ''php'', etc.).
::What are "all" the major PC operating systems?  Presumably that includes Windows and Linux; does it include any of the BSDs, or Solaris?  What about OSes that don't run on standard PCs, such as Darwin/OS X (yeah, yeah, I know, [[hackintosh]]es), AIX, etc.?

== Should ''GNU project software'' be a subcategory of this one? ==
