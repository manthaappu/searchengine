In [[cryptography]], '''PKCS#11'''<ref>{{cite web
 | url = http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2133
 | title = PKCS #11: Cryptographic Token Interface Standard
}}</ref> is one of the family of standards called [[PKCS|Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)]], published by [[RSA Laboratories]], that defines a platform-independent [[Application programming interface|API]] to cryptographic tokens, such as [[Hardware Security Module]]s (HSM) and [[smart cards]]. (The PKCS#11 standard names the API "Cryptoki" which is an amalgamation of "cryptographic token interface" and is pronounced as "crypto-key", but "PKCS#11" is often used to refer to the API as well as the standard that defines it.)

Since there isn't a real standard for cryptographic tokens, this API has been developed to be an abstraction layer for the generic cryptographic token. The PKCS#11 API defines most commonly used cryptographic object types ([[RSA]] keys, [[X.509]] Certificates, [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]]/[[Triple DES]] keys, etc.) and all the functions needed to use, create/generate, modify and delete those objects.

PKCS#11 is largely adopted to access smart cards and [[Hardware Security Module|HSMs]]. Most commercial [[Certificate authority|Certification Authority]] software uses PKCS#11 to access the CA signing key or to enroll user certificates. Cross-platform software that needs to use smart cards uses PKCS#11, such as [[Mozilla Firefox]] and [[OpenSSL]] (using an extension). Software written for [[Microsoft Windows]] may use the platform specific [[Cryptographic Application Programming Interface|MS-CAPI]] API instead.

==Applications using PKCS#11==
* [[FreeOTFE]] - Disk encryption system (PKCS#11 can either be used to encrypt critical data block, or as keyfile storage)
* [[Mozilla Firefox]], a web browser
* [[Mozilla Thunderbird]], an email client
* [[OpenDNSSEC]], a [[DNSSEC]] signer
* [[OpenSSL]] - [[Transport Layer Security|TLS/SSL]] library (with engine_pkcs11)
* [[GnuTLS]] - [[Transport Layer Security|TLS/SSL]] library
* [[OpenVPN]] - [[VPN]] system
* [[StrongSwan]] - [[VPN]] system
* [[Truecrypt]] - Disk encryption system (PKCS#11 only used as trivial keyfile storage)
* [http://trousers.sourceforge.net/pkcs11.html TrouSerS] - An open-source TCG Software Stack
* [[OpenSC]] - [[smartcard]] library
* [[OpenSSH]] - a [[Secure Shell]] implementation (since [http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-announce&m=126801526410398&w=2 OpenSSH version 5.4])
* [[OpenDS]] - an open source directory server.
* [[GNOME Keyring]] - a password and cryptographic key manager.

== PKCS#11 wrappers ==
Since PKCS#11 is a complex [[C (programming language)|C]] API many wrappers exist that let the developer use the API from various languages.

* [http://www.ncryptoki.com NCryptoki] - .NET (C# and VB.NET) and Visual Basic 6 wrapper for PKCS#11 API
* [http://www.bit4id.org/trac/pykcs11 PyKCS11] - A wrapper for [[Python (programming language)|Python]]
* [http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/pkcs11 Another wrapper] for Python
* [[Java (programming language)|Java]] 5.0 includes a wrapper for PKCS#11 API
