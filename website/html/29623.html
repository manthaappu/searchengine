'''PortAudio''' is a [[computer library]] for [[sound|audio]] playback and recording. Its primary goal is to be a [[cross-platform]], [[open source]] library, so that programs that use it can run on many different computer [[operating system]]s. Like many other libraries, especially those whose primary goal is portability, PortAudio is written in the [[C programming language]].

PortAudio is part of the [[PortMusic]] project, which aims to provide a set of platform independent libraries for music software. The free [[audio editor]] [[Audacity]] uses the PortAudio library, and so does the [[JACK Audio Connection Kit]] on the Windows platform.

PortAudio is based on a callback paradigm, similar to JACK and [[Audio Stream Input/Output|ASIO]].
