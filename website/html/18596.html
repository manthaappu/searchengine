An '''instruction window''' in the field of [[superscalar]] [[CPU]] architecture is a group of [[Instruction (computer science)|instructions]] actively processed in parallel. Also the size or maximum size of either such a group or its containing facility can be meant (size being measured in number of instructions).

Instructions which, in [[out-of-order execution]], are put aside into a [[shelving buffer]] or are waiting in an [[instruction queue]] are not thought of being inside of an instruction window.

[[Instruction pipeline|Pipelined instructions]] in different states of processing are not in the same instruction window. Both concepts might be visualized as being orthogonal to each other. In more complex situations each pipeline step could be viewed as having its own instruction window, or each slot in an instruction window having its own pipeline.
