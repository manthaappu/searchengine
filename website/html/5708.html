<html> <head> <title>Cem Kaner</title></head><body>'''Cem Kaner''' [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]], [[Ph.D.]], is a [[Professor]] of [[Software Engineering]] at [[Florida Institute of Technology]], and the Director of Florida Tech's [[Center for Software Testing Education & Research]] (CSTER) since 2004.  He is perhaps best known outside academia as an advocate of [[software usability]] and [[software testing]].

Prior to his professorship, Kaner worked in the software industry beginning in 1983 in [[Silicon Valley]] "as a tester, programmer, tech writer, software development manager, product development director, and independent software development consultant." In 1988, he and his co-authors Jack Falk and Hung Quoc Nguyen published what became, at the time, "the best selling book on software testing," ''Testing Computer Software''.<ref name="asbio">{{cite web |url=http://www.badsoftware.com/alienwaresucks/2005/07/they-fail-to-give-their-advertised.html |title= They fail to give their advertised discount (Part 2). |accessdate=2006-07-27 |last=Kaner |first=Cem |date=31 August 2004 |format=Blog |work=Alienware Sucks! |publisher=[http://www.badsoftware.com/ badsoftware.com]}} See [[#Publications]] above for details on editions of ''Testing Computer Software.''</ref>  He has also worked as a [[user interface]] designer.

In 2004 he cofounded the [[non-profit]] [[Association for Software Testing]], where he serves as the Vice-President for Publications.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org/documents/ArticlesOfIncorporation04152004.pdf |title=Articles of Incorporation of Association for Software Testing, Inc |accessdate=2006-07-28 |last=Kaner |first=Cem |coauthors=Registered Agent, Association for Software Testing |date=14 April 2004 |format=pdf |publisher=[http://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org/ Association for Software Testing] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060713234825/http://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org/documents/ArticlesOfIncorporation04152004.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-07-13}}</ref>

==Education==
Kaner received a [[Bachelor's Degree]] from [[Brock University]] in 1974, having focused on mathematics and philosophy.  He went on to receive a Ph.D. in [[experimental psychology]] from [[McMaster University]] in 1984, with a dissertation in the area of [[psychophysics]] (the measurement of perceptual experiences).  He later attended [[Golden Gate University]] Law School, with a primary interest in the law of software quality, graduating with a J.D. in 1994.

==Consumer and Software Quality Advocacy==
Kaner worked as a part-time volunteer for the [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara]], [[California Department of Consumer Affairs]], investigating and mediating consumer complaints. In the 1990s, he got trial experience working as a full-time volunteer Deputy [[District Attorney]], and later counselled independent consultants, technical book writers, and independent test labs on contract and [[intellectual property]] issues as an attorney.<ref name="asbio"/>  He also did legislative work as a [[consumer protection]] advocate, including participation in the drafting of the [[Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act]] (as an advocate for customers and small software development firms), and the [[Uniform Electronic Transactions Act]], and he participated in the [[United States Department of State]]'s Advisory Committee on Private International Law: Study Group on Electronic Commerce. In 1999, he was elected to the [[American Law Institute]], after being in practice for only five years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kaner.com/resume.html |title=About Me |accessdate=2006-07-27 |last=Kaner |first=Cem |year=[2003?] |work=[http://www.kaner.com kaner.com] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060717055920/http://www.kaner.com/resume.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-07-17}}</ref>

This experience led him, in collaboration with [[David Pels]], to publish ''Bad Software: What To Do When Software Fails'' in 1997.  This book was intended "to help people who had bought a defective computer program, with advice on troubleshooting their own problems, interacting with technical support, reporting problems to consumer protection agencies, bringing a lawsuit in [[small claims court]], and if necessary, hiring a lawyer to bring a formal lawsuit."<ref name="asbio"/>
