== Background ==
Lattner studied Computer Science at the [[University of Portland]], [[Oregon]], graduating in 2000. While in Oregon, he worked as an operating systems developer, enhancing [[Sequent Computer Systems]]'s [[DYNIX/ptx]].<ref name=Resume>

== LLVM ==
In late 2000, Lattner joined the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] as a research assistant and M.Sc. student. While working with [[Vikram Adve]], he designed and began the implementation of LLVM, an innovative infrastructure for [[Compiler optimization|optimizing compilers]], which was the subject of his 2002 MSc thesis. He completed a PhD in 2005, researching new techniques for optimizing pointer-intensive programs and adding them to LLVM. In 2005, [[Apple Inc.]] hired Lattner to work with a newly-formed team of LLVM developers.

Lattner's recent work involves designing, implementing, and evangelizing the [[LLVM]] and [[Clang]] compilers, as well as a new set of assemblers and disassemblers.  This work may eventually replace the GCC compiler suite on a broad variety of systems. It is already used in Apple systems.

In June 2010, the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]'s [[Special Interest Group]] on [[programming language]]s ([[SIGPLAN]]) gave Lattner its inaugural Programming Languages Software Award "for his design and development of the Low Level Virtual Machine", noting that Professor Adve has stated "that Lattner’s talent as a compiler architect, together with his programming skills, technical vision, and leadership ability were crucial to the success of LLVM."<ref name=SIGPLAN/>
