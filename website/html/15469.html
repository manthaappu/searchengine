'''Go Bible''' is a free Bible viewer application for [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[mobile phone]]s ([[Java Platform, Micro Edition|Java ME]] [[MIDP|MIDP 1.0]] and [[MIDP 2.0]]). It was developed by Jolon Faichney in [[Surfers Paradise, Queensland|Surf City]], [[Gold Coast, Queensland]], [[Australia]], with help from several other people who assisted in making versions for other languages and translations.  Go Bible is installed like any other [[midlet]] by copying the .jar and .jad file to the [[cell phone]] by [[USB]] or [[Bluetooth]].  The English [[KJV]] Go Bible 1.1 can also be installed using [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] download.

''These lists are likely to grow as more people become involved in using the [[Go Bible#Developer application|developer application]]''.

Many of the Go Bible translations still use English for the Bible [[Table of books of Judeo-Christian Scripture|book names]], and for the [[user interface]], though that is now starting to change as developers become more familiar with the features of the developer application.

===Unicode fonts===
Go Bible uses the [[Unicode]] fonts installed by the mobile phone manufacturer. Some translations may not display correctly on all phones due to missing code pages or individual codes.  Also, there are problems with some [[Sony Ericsson]] phones with regard to displaying [[Arabic script]] and other right-to-left languages. Rendering such languages properly depends on having a correct implementation of the [[bidirectional algorithm]] as well as glyph shaping.

== Compatibility ==
=== Phones with limited memory ===
It is possible to divide Go Bible into several smaller collections so that the JAR files can be installed in mobile phones with limited memory.  For some models, splitting into [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] is sufficient.  For older models, splitting into files smaller than 1MB, 512KB, 256KB or 128KB may be necessary. Go Bible 1.0 is suitable for phones with 64KB JAR file limit.

=== Phones that check certificates ===
Go Bible applications are not digitally signed. Some phone models by default will not install unsigned applications. In many such cases, it is usually possible to find a phone setting to change to accept unsigned applications.

== Developer application ==
The author has also provided a [[Software development kit|developer kit]] called '''Go Bible Creator'''.  This enables further translations and language versions to be generated by users.  Go Bible Creator takes as data input Bible files in [[Theological Markup Language]] ('''ThML''') or [[Open Scripture Information Standard]] ('''OSIS'''). From version 2.3.2, the ability to process [http://ubs-icap.org/usfm Unified Standard Format Markers] ('''USFM''') has been added.

Go Bible Creator supports two useful additional features:
* Book name mapping &ndash; this enables translated Bible book names to be mapped to English book names.
* Translated user interface &ndash; this requires the translation of 73 words or short phrases from the English default UI.

Go Bible Creator was used successfully by the author of the [http://www.mobible.be/ Mobile Bible] site in [[Belgium]] to create several Go Bible collections in various languages.<ref>[http://www.mobible.be/download.html The Mobile Bible<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Another user has started a Go Bible Google Group<ref>[http://groups.google.com/group/go-bible Go Bible | Google Groups<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, from which several more Go Bible collections may be downloaded.

The author has subsequently started a separate Go Bible Dev Google Group<ref>[http://groups.google.com/group/go-bible-dev Go Bible Dev | Google Groups]</ref>, for discussing the Go Bible source code.

Go Bible Creator is not limited to making Bible collections. It can also be used to create other types of e-Book, such as an electronic hymn book (words only).

The [[source code]] for both '''GoBibleCore''' and '''GoBibleCreator''' is available online under the new [[BSD license]].<ref>[http://code.google.com/p/gobible/ gobible - Google Code<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

One member of the '''Theologische Initiative Freiburg'''<ref>[http://wp1066500.wp101.webpack.hosteurope.de/zef/ Zefania XML - Home<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> has written software scripts to convert [[Zefania XML]] Bible modules into the [[Theological Markup Language|ThML]] format for use with Go Bible Creator. Though the description is "Converts a [[Zefania XML]] bible modul to a SWORD -modul", the download includes a tool for Go Bible.  ''The host language is German''.

== Distribution ==
Go Bible is listed in a number of [[FOSS|free and open source]] software distributor sites, such as:
