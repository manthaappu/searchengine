<html> <head> <title>Joint Mathematical Council</title></head><body>The '''Joint Mathematical Council''' (JMC) of the [[United Kingdom]] was formed in [[1963]] to 'provide co-ordination between the Constituent Societies and generally to promote the advancement of [[mathematics]] and the improvement of the [[mathematics education|teaching of mathematics]]'.

The JMC serves as a forum for discussion between societies and for making representations to government and other bodies and responses to their enquiries. It is concerned with all aspects of mathematics at all levels from primary to higher education.

The constituent societies are

* [[Association of Teachers of Mathematics]]
* [[Association of Mathematics Education Teachers]]
* [[British Society for the History of Mathematics]]
* [[British Society for Research into Learning Mathematics]]
* [[Edinburgh Mathematical Society]]
* [[Institute of Mathematics and its Applications]]
* [[London Mathematical Society]]
* [[Mathematical Association]]
* [[National Association for Numeracy and Mathematics in Colleges]]
* [[Royal Statistical Society]]
