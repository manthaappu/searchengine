'''Pie in the Sky''' is a [[2.5D]] and [[3D computer graphics|3D]]  [[first person shooter]] [[video game engine|engine]] most popular in the mid to late [[1990s]] by Pie in the Sky Software, also known as the '''3D Game Creation''' or '''3D Game Creation System''' engine. The engine was used in two games by the company as well as many other independent games and amateur projects after it was turned into a game creator, largely due to it minimizing the amount of [[computer programming]] knowledge needed to make 3D games in its editing tools.

==History==
The company first learned to program 3D by creating a modestly popular [[Terminate and Stay Resident|TSR]] 3D [[screen saver]] called InnerMission in 1987.<ref>[http://garbo.uwasa.fi/pc/screen.html Inner Mission - Garbo]</ref> After more developments, they developed a 3D [[flight simulator]] ''[[Pie in the Sky (game engine)#Corncob 3D|Corncob 3D]]'' in [[1992 in video gaming|1992]]. The game was inspired by a flight simulator for the [[Apple II]]. The game was first released as [[shareware]] and then later commercially as ''Corncob Deluxe'' by [[MVP Software]]. After seeing ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', they wrote a new 3D engine in [[C (programming language)|C]] and used it in the first person shooter ''[[Pie in the Sky (game engine)#Lethal Tender|Lethal Tender]]'' in [[1993 in video gaming|1993]]. Based on that, they were hired by a [[Germany|German]] group to create a [[German language|German]] first person shooter.<ref>[http://pieintheskysoftware.com/menuitem-resources-history.html Historical Pie in the Sky - Pie in the Sky Software]</ref>

Pie in the Sky released ''[[Pie in the Sky (game engine)#Terminal Terror|Terminal Terror]]'', the sequel to ''Lethal Tender'', in [[1994 in video gaming|1994]]. The development of this game, to be published by [[Expert Software]], had taken precedence over the German development and thus strained the relationship. The game was relatively successful, but the company sensed they were unable to keep up and stay ahead of other first person shooter developers. To get around this and enter a [[niche market]], they decided to create the ''3D Game Creation System'' and market themselves to consumers who wanted to make their own 3D Games. It is first used by games such as ''[[Pie in the Sky (game engine)#Red Babe|Red Babe]]'' by The DaRK CaVErN Productions and ''[[Pie in the Sky (game engine)#La Cosa Nostra|La Cosa Nostra]]'' by Slade 3D Software.

In [[1995 in video gaming|1995]] it was used in [[Pie in the Sky (game engine)#Despair series|''Despair 2'' and ''3'']], ''[[Pie in the Sky (game engine)#Terror in Christmas Town|Terror in Christmas Town]]'', ''[[Pie in the Sky (game engine)#Deer Napped|Deer Napped]]'', and ''[[Pie in the Sky (game engine)#Castaway: The Ordeal Begins|Castaway: The Ordeal Begins]]''. Meanwhile, the various bugs in the program were worked out and upgrades and patches were released, partly due to the rushed development of the system in the first place.<ref>[http://pieintheskysoftware.com/menuitem-about-history-two.html History of Pie in the Sky Software Part Two]</ref> The contract with the German group changed, and instead the new game creation system was re-released in German as well as [[English language|English]].

The engine was ported to [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Direct X]] in [[1998 in video gaming|1998]], as well as updating it beyond ''Wolfenstein 3D''-like standards. The company had first detected the decline of [[MS DOS]] in 1994, and had decided to port to Windows and adopt 3D API technology using the [[Renderware]] library. This was first attempted in a [[racing game]] called ''Baja Bash'' but emphasis was switched to converting the old game creation engine due to market demands, time constraints, and some criticism of the later game - despite its attempted physics advances. Due to licensing constraints however, they eventually opted to use [[Direct3D]].<ref name="pieintheskysoftware.com">[http://pieintheskysoftware.com/menuitemtophome.html The History of Pie in the Sky Software Part 3]</ref>

In this updated form that it was used in the game ''[[Pie in the Sky (game engine)#Pencil Whipped|Pencil Whipped]]'', designed for the [[2000 in video gaming|2000]] [[Independent Games Festival]]. ''[[Pie in the Sky (game engine)#Chub Gam 3D|Chub Gam 3D]]'', an earlier [[freeware]] game, was reissued in [[director's cut]] form in 1998. In [[2001 in video gaming|2001]] the third version of the engine was released, featuring true-3D polygonal enemies and weapons, 3D terrain, super lighting effects, and other improvements. The engine ceased being sold in [[2003 in video gaming|May 2003]] and soon after the Pie in the Sky company website came down. The book ''3D Game Creation'' by Luke Ahearn for Cyberrookies has a section which examines making games using the ''Pie in the Sky'' development tools.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/dp/1584500670 3D Game Creation (Cyberrookies)] - [[Amazon.com]]</ref>

In [[2010 in video gaming|2010]] the company was restarted, and has created a [[physics engine]] demo and a [[dice]] simulation for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system, tested on the [[Motorola Droid]].<ref>[http://uk.androlib.com/android.application.bold-inventions-dice3d-nFtj.aspx Pie 3D Physics Demo v1.0 - AndroLib.com]</ref> The choice of a physics engine is likely inspired by the popularity of the ''Corncob 3D'' physics. The company's new website notes "the focus will be more about making fun stuff that being a money-producing business."<ref>[http://pieintheskysoftware.com/menuitem-about.html About - Pie in the Sky Software]</ref> The rebirth of the company was inspired by a feeling that small companies can make a better headway in the [[Mobile devices|mobile market]] than on the [[Personal Computer|PC market]], based on their struggling experience trying to keep the ''Pie in the Sky'' tools current to big name standards in the 1990s.<ref name="pieintheskysoftware.com"/>

==Games==
=== Corncob 3D===
The ''Pie in the Sky'' engine's fairly popular predecessor game.<ref>[http://www.dosgames.com/g_sim.php Corncob 3D - DOSGames.com]</ref> Instead of being a [[first person shooter]] like the later games based on ''Pie in the Sky'' it is a [[flight simulator]] game. The game takes place in a world where [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] died in childhood and [[World War II]] never happened. It its stead, [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|aliens]] have invaded the [[Earth]].<ref>[http://jeff.rainbow-100.com/?p=107 Corncob 3D - PrintStar]</ref> The player must take control of a [[F4U Corsair]], the only World War II plane that made it into this [[alternate history]], and defeat the alien invaders.<ref>[http://www.freeinfosociety.com/article.php?id=474 Corncob 3D - The Free Information Society]</ref> The game takes place in a variety of different locations and was noted for its original gameplay and presentaton.<ref>[http://www.homeoftheunderdogs.net/game.php?id=2825 Corncob 3D] - [[Home of the Underdogs]]</ref> It is also known for being one of the few [[shareware]] flight simulators.<ref>[http://www.classicdosgames.com/genre/simulation.html Corncob 3D - Classic DOS Games]</ref>

===Lethal Tender===

===Terminal Terror===
Pie in the Sky Software's sequel to ''Lethal Tender''. The game featured an expanded array of features, including early examples of the [[First person sneaker|stealth gameplay]] of later games like ''[[Thief (video game)|Thief]]''.<ref>[http://www.homeoftheunderdogs.net/game.php?id=2359 Terminal Terror] - [[Home of the Underdogs]]</ref> The player is again Nick Hunter, with a mission to take back into custody the international [[terrorist]] Bruno Riggs, who has fortified himself and his men in a captured [[U.S. Air Force|air force]] base with several hostages, including Hunter's [[fiance]]. [[Abandonia]] noted that "like [[System Shock]], it was far ahead of it’s time… too far ahead", referencing its new features such as friendly [[non-playable characters]] and damage varying based on where hit.<ref>[http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/643/Terminal+Terror.html Terminal Terror] - [[Abandonia]]</ref> The game was published by [[Expert Software]].

===Red Babe===
''Red Babe'' was one of the first games to use the ''Pie in the Sky'' engine that was not made by the engine creators themselves, being made by The DaRK CaVErN Productions. The game features the player's quest to save the beautiful Sharla, the titular "Red Babe" due to her penchant for a red [[dress]].<ref>[http://3dshootmaster.com/collection/026.php Red Babe - 3DShootMaster]</ref>

===La Cosa Nostra===

Ryker, who must stop the crime boss Girabaldi and his gang after they murdered his partner/brother-in-law and now hold his wife hostage. It was included on at least one [[shareware]] compilation containing the first episode of the game. The second level of the first episode's level track is the theme from the film ''[[The Terminator]]'', hinting the soundtrack comprises various [[MIDI]] files found on the [[Internet]], though the game's variety in terms of textures, graphics and sounds is more than most ''Pie in the Sky'' engine games. The game was developed by Tony L. Ford under the group title of Slade 3D Software.<ref>[http://sharewareshopper.com/shareware-download/obscure-shareware-game-la-cosa-nostra-1994 Obscure Shareware Game: La Cosa Nostra (1994) - Shareware Shopper]</ref>

===Despair series===
Both ''Despair 2'' and ''Despair 3'' use the ''Pie in the Sky'' engine. The games feature a battle with the aliens from the first ''Despair'' game, with the third game featuring a wind machine threatening Earth. The games were developed by U-Neek Software.<ref>[http://www.retrocpu.com/dos/games/publisher/u-neek_software U-Neek Software - RetroCPU]</ref>

===Terror in Christmas Town===
A [[Christmas]]-themed 3D shooter, featuring the player having to rescue [[Santa Claus]] from a kidnapping [[polar bear]]. The game was created by Michael Zerbo and released 1995.<ref>[http://www.dosgames.com/g_3d.php Terror in Christmas Town - DOSGAMES.COM]</ref>

===Deer Napped===
Like ''Terror in Christmas Town'', this game features a Christmas theme. The player is a [[ninja]] working for Santa and must rescue his [[reindeer]] from the [[Abominable snowman|Abominable Snowpeople]]. The game was created by Nic-Ty Entertainmentick, which consisted of Nick Fletcher and Tyler Smith of [[Smiths Falls, Ontario]] who were both only age 14 at the time of the game's release. The game was made while participating in a program called "I want to be a Millionaire". The aim of the program was to encourage young [[entrepreneur]]s to learn about business through hands on experience. The game is notably non-violent as enemies are turned into harmless [[snowmen]] rather than dying.<ref>[http://files.chatnfiles.com/Giga-Games/Giga-Games-5-1997-06/dos/arcade/00_index.htm DOS Arcade Games - Chatnfiles]</ref>

===Castaway: The Ordeal Begins===

===Chub Gam 3D===
''Chub Gam 3D'' is claimed to be one of the earliest [[freeware]] [[List of freeware first-person shooters|first person shooter games]].<ref>[http://dskgames.tripod.com/games.html Chub Gam 3D - DSK Games]</ref> The game features the adventures of a [[Harrier jet]] pilot after his plane crashes and is invited in by the eccentric creatures Chub and Rex. However, rather than settling down for the night as asked, the pilot discovers Rex's shocking secret project.<ref>Chub Gam 3D: Director's Cut - FirstPersonShooters.Net</ref> The game is claimed to have won no awards, a traceable one being its inclusion as one of MPI World's "Top 952 Free Games of '98".<ref>[http://www.mpiworld.com/freebies/freegames.htm Top 52 Free Games of '98 - MPI World]</ref> A [[director's cut]] was later released by ChubGamSoft with several improvements, including cutscenes.<ref>[http://pages.prodigy.net/wildcat30/chubweb3.htm Chub Gam 3-D: Director's Cut - ChubGamSoft]</ref> and it was supposedly sold in [[Brazil]].<ref>[http://chubgamsoft.tripod.com/brazil.htm Chub Gam 3D in Brazil CD-ROM - ChubGamSoft]</ref>

===Pencil Whipped===
''Pencil Whipped'' might be the most well known of the ''Pie in the Sky'' games and one of the only ones to utilize a later version of the engine and thus running on [[Microsoft Windows]]. The game won developer Lonnie Flickinger (aka Chiselbrain Software) a chance at the [[Independent Games Festival#Seumas McNally Grand Prize ($20,000)|$15,000 Seumas McNally Grand Prize]] and [[Independent Games Festival#Technical Excellence ($2,500)|awards for technical excellence]], game design, [[Independent Games Festival#Excellence In Visual Art ($2,500)|visual art]], and [[Independent Games Festival#Excellence In Audio ($2,500)|audio]].<ref>[http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/january02/igfpencil/ Pencil Whipped] - [[GameSpy]]</ref> Based on a strange dream Flickinger had, the game became known for its unique [[black and white]] pencil drawn world<ref>[http://www.gamedev.net/columns/interviews/chiselbrain.asp Interview with Chiselbrain Software - GameDev.net]</ref> and for its wider novelty value,<ref>[http://www.oldmanmurray.com/features/92.html Pencil Whipped - Old Man Murray]</ref> being described by [[Wired.com]] as "like being trapped inside a very disturbed child's drawing."<ref>[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.04/streetcred.html?pg=7 Pencil Whipped Review] - [[Wired.com]]</ref>
