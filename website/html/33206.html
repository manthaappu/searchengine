<html> <head> <title>Satellite Emergency Notification Device</title></head><body>A '''Satellite Emergency Notification Device''' or '''SEND''' is a portable emergency notification and locating device which uses commercial satellite systems rather than the [[Cospas|COSPAS-SARSAT]] satellite system (or any other internationally recognised [[Search_and_rescue|SAR]] agency). An example of one such device is [[SPOT_Satellite_Messenger|SPOT]].

The devices use an internal [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] chip to gather location information. When the SEND is triggered this information is sent via commercial satellite to a commercial monitoring agency whose role is to pass the information to an appropriate responding agency. The responding agency contacted depends, in part, on the location. Examples of responding agencies would be military Search and Rescue, Coast Guard, local police, voluntary Search and Rescue.

Typical users/purchasers of these devices are outdoor enthusiasts (hikers, mountain bikers, climbers, boaters, sailors) and pilots. They are also useful for those who work alone in remote areas (loggers, foresters, geologists, fisheries and wildlife staff).

Additional features are increasingly being offered: sending preprogrammed message, breadcrumb tracking via [[Google Earth]]. Some newer devices offer two-way communication via satellite. [example needed??]

One of the primary considerations when buying one of these is ensuring that the commercial monitoring agency which receives a distress call maintains an accurate and up-to-date database of response agencies to contact and can quickly determine which is appropriate to the situation/location. The potential for long delays or no response at all is very real if this is not in place. Since monitoring agencies consider their databases proprietary, there is no obvious way for a purchaser to determine if it is accurate or up-to-date.

The [[USCG|US Coast Guard]]'s National Search and Rescue Committee (NSARC) has set up a working group which includes representation from other US agencies, international organizations and device manufacturers to discuss how these "technologies can be properly reviewed and integrated with the SAR response system in the United States"<ref>[http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/cg534/nsarc/NSARC_SEND_minutes_Dec09.pdf] NSARC minutes from December 2009</ref> and to aid the [[RTCM|Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services (RTCM)]] in "development of a minimum operating and performance specification for such devices"<ref>[http://www.icao.int/icaoimojwg/meetings/jwg16/docs/JWGSAR16_wp09.pdf] Emerging technologies in commercially available alerting devices from [[International_Civil_Aviation_Organization|ICAO]]/[[International_Maritime_Organization|IMO]] JOINT WORKING GROUP, October 2009</ref>.
