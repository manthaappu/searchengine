'''Rare Book Room''' is an educational website for the repository of digitally scanned rare books made freely available to the public.

Starting around 1996 the California based company [[Octavo (company)|Octavo]] began scanning rare and important books from libraries around the world. These scans were done at extremely high resolution using high-quality equipment, with some pages at over 200MB each. They were sold by Octavo as commercial products on CD-ROM. In 2006 the "Rare Book Room" website was created which contains the complete collection in medium to medium-high resolution freely available to the public through a web browser or as a PDF file. Some high resolution versions are still being sold by Octavo through a separate website. As of 2007 over 400 books have been scanned.

The repository includes books by [[Galileo]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Copernicus]], [[Kepler]], [[Einstein]], and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]. It includes most of the [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)#Quartos|Shakespeare Quartos]] from the [[British Library]], the [[Bodleian Library]], the [[University of Edinburgh]] Library, and the [[National Library of Scotland]], as well as the [[First Folio]] from the [[Folger Library]]. It includes [[Library of Congress]] copies of ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'' by [[Benjamin Franklin]], and other rare editions: a [[Gutenberg Bible]] of 1455, [[Thomas Harvey]]'s [[Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus|book on the circulation of blood]], Galileo â€™s ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'', the first printing of the [[United States Bill of Rights]], and the [[Magna Carta]].
