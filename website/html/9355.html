In computer programming contexts, a '''data cube''' is a three- (or higher) dimensional [[Array data structure|array]] of values, commonly used to describe a [[time series]] of image data. If the images are in color, then the array is generally four-dimensional, with the dimensions representing image X and Y coordinates, time, and [[RGB]] color plane. Many high-level computer languages treat data cubes and other large arrays as single entities distinct from their contents.  These languages, of which [[APL programming language|APL]], [[IDL (programming language)|IDL]], [[NumPy]], [[Perl Data Language|PDL]], and [[S-Lang]] are examples, allow the programmer to manipulate complete [[film]] clips and other data en masse with simple expressions derived from [[linear algebra]] and [[vector (geometric)|vector]] mathematics. Some languages (such as PDL) distinguish between a [[list (computing)|list]] of images and a data cube, while many (such as IDL) do not.

A [[tensor]] of rank three may be represented as a data cube.

A '''data cube''' (or '''datacube''') is also the form of data used in the field of [[Imaging spectroscopy]], since a spectrally-resolved image is represented as a three-dimensional volume.
