}}'''Info-Mac''' is an [[online community]], [[news aggregator]] and [[shareware]] [[file hosting service]] covering [[Apple Inc.]] products, including the [[iPhone]], [[iPod]] and especially the [[Macintosh]].  Established in 1984 as an [[electronic mailing list]], Info-Mac is notable as being the first online community for Apple's then-new Macintosh computer.<ref>Rittner, Don (2000). ''iMac, iBook, and G3 Troubleshooting Pocket Reference''. McGraw-Hill. p. 267. ISBN 0072124687</ref> Info-Mac was the dominant [[Internet]] resource for [[Mac OS]] [[software]]<ref>Thomas, Brian J (1997). ''The Internet for Scientists and Engineers''. 3rd ed. Oxford University Press. p. 462. ISBN 019856547X</ref> and community-based support throughout the [[1980s]] and [[1990s]].

==Original Format==
Info-Mac consisted of two distinct services: the ''Info-Mac Archive'', a user-submitted collection of nearly all contemporary [[freeware]] and [[shareware]] available for the Macintosh, and the ''Info-Mac Digest'', an electronic mailing list open to public participation.<ref>Engst, Adam C, and David Pogue (1999). ''Crossing Platforms: a Macintosh/Windows Phrasebook''. O'Reilly Media, Inc. p. 317. ISBN 1565925394</ref> Both the Info-Mac Archive and Info-Mac Digest were operated by volunteers.<ref>Levine, John R, Arnold Reinhold and Margaret Levine Young (2000). ''The Internet for Dummies Quick Reference''. IDG Books Worldwide. p. 112. ISBN 0764506757</ref>

===Info-Mac Digest===
The Info-Mac Digest was published daily via [[Stanford University]] servers, and was itself archived on the Info-Mac Archive.<ref>Wilson, Thomas Carl (1992). ''Impact of Technology on Resource Sharing: Experimentation and Maturity''. Psychology Press. p. 124. ISBN 1560243910</ref> At its height, the Info-Mac Digest was read daily by several thousand people, and was mirrored in the [[Usenet]] group comp.sys.mac.digest.

The Info-Mac Digest was published in "volumes" that covered the period of one calendar year, with some exceptions.

===Info-Mac Archive===
The Info-Mac Archive was the centralized collection of Macintosh software with over 100 [[Mirror (computing)|mirror sites]] located around the world. At the time, disk space on a server was cost-prohibitive. Free archives such as Info-Mac were often the only means for shareware authors to deliver their product over the Internet. Some early commercial software download sites, like [[CNET|CNET's]] Shareware.com, were originally mirrors of the Info-Mac Archive.<ref>[http://www.tidbits.com/tb-issues/TidBITS-810.html#lnk4 TidBITS#810/19-Dec-05<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Info-Mac also periodically published [[CD-ROMs|CD-ROM]] containing Mac OS shareware and freeware from the archive, to be sold through Mac-related magazines and publications.<ref>''The Multimedia and Cd-ROM Directory 1998''. Waterlow New Media Information. p. 621. ISBN 0333711696</ref>

==Decline and 2007 Relaunch==
The popularity of Info-Mac services in their original format waned in the early 21st century. Unable to maintain relevance on the rapidly evolving Internet, the Info-Mac Digest was discontinued in November 2002, while the Info-Mac Archive stopped accepting new file submissions in December 2005. Info-Mac persisted in this static, archived state until coming under new ownership in 2007.

In December 2007, Info-Mac was redesigned and relaunched with a [[Web 2.0]] interface, combining previous Info-Mac Digest and Info-Mac Archive content with a modernized forum-based community and news aggregator.<ref>[http://www.lowendmac.com/ed/rlawson/rl07/1205.html Info-Mac Reloaded<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Today, Info-Mac has expanded to cover all Apple product lines. A new, [[Opt in e-mail|opt in]] Info-Mac Digest automatically generated from forum content is published daily. Info-Mac also distributes an iOS app called iForum on the [[App Store]].
