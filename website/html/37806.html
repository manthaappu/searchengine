{{cquote|
I am staying in the industry but keeping a much lower profile than I did at Troika. Instead of talking about making games or trying to convince people to play (or publish) my games, I am doing what makes me very happy - making games.<ref>[http://www.escapistmagazine.com/issue/77/13 The Escapist : The Rise and Fall of Troika<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>}}
