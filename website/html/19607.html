'''Jack Bicer''', ''Father of Uninstall''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, created the uninstall concept and wrote the first [[uninstaller]] in 1992 while working on the Norton Desktop for Windows project at Symantec.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Later, while he was at Quotron in 1993, Bicer also invented the "Automated Software Updates" concept in the pre-internet era and developed the first automatic software update/installation capability using Quotron's international data network for stock quotes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The concept was demonstrated by dropping a copy of the Microsoft Office at the main data center in New York, and installing the software on the workstations located in California without using any floppies or network drives. Bicer later became a CTO and was the founder of TechBiz Connection, one of the largest non-profit technology management associations in California.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
