The '''Apple II''' (often rendered '''Apple ][''' or '''Apple //''') was an [[8-bit]] [[home computer]], one of the first highly successful mass-produced [[microcomputer]] products,<ref>{{cite web|last=Reimer |first=Jeremy |url=http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/total-share.ars/4 |title=Total share: 30 years of personal computer market share figures |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=2005-12-14 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref> designed primarily by [[Steve Wozniak]], manufactured by Apple Computer (now [[Apple Inc.]]) and introduced in 1977. In terms of ease of use, features and expandability the Apple II was a major technological advancement over its predecessor, the [[Apple I]], a limited-production bare [[circuit board]] computer for electronics hobbyists which pioneered many features that made the Apple II a commercial success. Introduced at the [[West Coast Computer Faire]] in 1977, the Apple II was among the first successful [[personal computer]]s; it launched the Apple company into a successful business (and allowed several related companies to start). Throughout the years, a number of models were sold, with the most popular model remaining relatively little changed into the 1990s. By the end of production in 1993, somewhere between five and six million Apple II series computers (including about 1.25 million Apple II<small>GS</small> models)<!-- Cites: http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/americas/04/16/jobs/ http://lamp.a2central.com/GenieLamp_A2/Text/1993/ALMP9309.TXT http://lamp.a2central.com/GenieLamp_A2/Text/1995/ALMP9511.TXT http://lamp.a2central.com/GenieLamp_A2/Text/1993/ALMP9309.TXT - the previous entry claimed only 2 million Apple II-line machines had been produced total, which is incorrect (in fact Apple surpassed 2 million Apple II sales in 1984) --> had been produced.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite book| last=Forster|first=Winnie|authorlink=Winnie Forster|title=The encyclopedia of consoles, handhelds & home computers 1972 - 2005|year=2005|publisher=GAMEPLAN|isbn=3-00-015359-4|page=18}}</ref>

The Apple II became one of the most recognizable and successful computers during the 1980s and early 1990s. It was aggressively marketed through volume discounts and manufacturing arrangements to educational institutions which made it the first computer in widespread use in [[United States|American]] secondary schools. The effort to develop educational and business software for the Apple II, including the 1979 release of the popular [[VisiCalc]] [[spreadsheet]], made the computer especially popular with business users and families.<ref>{{cite web|title=Apple II Biography|url=http://www.allgame.com/platform.php?id=6|author=Chris Cavanaugh|date=May 2004| accessdate=2009-10-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Apple II: The World Catches On|url= http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2009/07/apple-ii-the-world-catches-on/|author=Wilson Rothman|date= 2009-07-19|accessdate=2009-10-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The First Spreadsheet|url= http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa010199.htm|author=Mary Bellis|accessdate=2009-10-07}}</ref>

The original Apple II [[operating system]] was contained in [[Read-only memory|ROM]] along with Integer [[BASIC]].  Programs were entered, then saved and loaded on cassette tape.  When the [[Disk II]] was implemented in 1978 by Steve Wozniak, a Disk Operating System or DOS was commissioned.  The final and most popular version of this software was [[Apple DOS]] 3.3.  Some commercial Apple II software booted directly and did not use standard DOS formats.  This discouraged the copying or modifying of the software on the disks and improved loading speed.  Apple DOS was superseded by [[Apple ProDOS|ProDOS]], which supported a hierarchical filesystem and larger storage devices. With an optional third-party [[Zilog Z80|Z80]]-based [[expansion card]]<ref name=z80>{{cite journal|work=[[InfoWorld]]|publisher=InfoWorld Media Group|date=6 February 1984| issue=Vol. 6, Num. 6|quote=Several manufacturers, however, make Z80 coprocessor boards that plug into the Apple II.|page=64|title=Review: Premium Softcard IIe|last=Petersen|first=Marty}}</ref> the Apple II could boot into the [[CP/M]] operating system and run [[WordStar]], [[dBase II]], and other CP/M software. At the height of its evolution, towards the late 1980s, the platform had the graphical look of a hybrid of the Apple II and [[Macintosh]] with the introduction of the Apple II<small>GS</small>. By 1992, the platform had [[16-bit]] processing capabilities, a mouse-driven [[Graphical user interface|Graphical User Interface]], and graphics and sound capabilities far beyond the original.

Despite the introduction of the Motorola 68000-based [[Apple Lisa]] system in 1983, and its more successful cousin the [[Macintosh]] in 1984, the relatively unsophisticated Apple II series was Apple's primary revenue source for most of the following decade. At its peak, it was a billion-dollar-a-year industry with its associated community of third-party developers and retailers. The Apple II<small>GS</small> was sold until the end of 1992; the last II-series Apple in production, the IIe, was discontinued on October 15, 1993.

==Design==
The Apple II was designed to look more like a [[Small appliance|home appliance]] than a piece of electronic equipment.<ref>Helmer, Carl, "An Apple to Byte," Byte, March 1978, p. 18-46.</ref> The lid popped off the beige plastic case without the use of tools, allowing access to the computer's internals, including the [[motherboard]] with eight [[expansion slot]]s, and an array of random access memory (RAM) sockets that could hold up to 48 [[kilobyte]]s worth of memory chips.

The Apple II had color and high-resolution [[Apple II graphics|graphics modes]], sound capabilities and one of two built-in [[BASIC]] programming languages (initially [[Integer BASIC]], later [[Applesoft BASIC]]). The Apple II was targeted for the masses rather than just hobbyists and engineers; it also influenced most of the microcomputers that followed it. Unlike preceding home microcomputers, it was sold as a finished consumer appliance rather than as a kit (unassembled or preassembled). ''VanLOVEs Apple Handbook'' and ''The Apple Educators Guide'' by Gerald VanDiver and Rolland Love reviewed more than 1,500 software programs that the Apple II series could use. The Apple dealer network used this book to emphasize the growing software developer base in education and personal use. <!-- What does this mean?? : "The books became part of the Apple program and became the first book on database." What Apple program? What about a database? -->

The Apple II series had a keyboard built into the motherboard shell, with the exception of  the [[Apple IIGS|Apple II<small>GS</small>]] which featured an external keyboard. An upgrade kit was sold later to house the motherboard of an Apple II<small>GS</small> in an [[Apple IIe]] case.

==Models==

Early II-series models were usually designated "Apple ]["; later models "Apple //", plus a letter suffix.

===Apple II===
[[File:Micromodem II in Apple II.jpg|thumb|250px|An Apple II computer with an external [[modem]]]]
The first Apple II computers went on sale on June 5, 1977<ref>{{cite web|title=June 5, 1977: From a Little Apple a Mighty Industry Grows|url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/06/dayintech_0605|date=June 5, 2007|accessdate=2009-06-02}}</ref> with a [[MOS Technology]] [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] microprocessor running at 1 [[Hertz|MHz]], 4 KB of [[Random-access memory|RAM]], an [[compact audio cassette#Data recording|audio cassette]] interface for loading programs and storing data, and the [[Integer BASIC]] programming language built into the [[read-only memory|ROMs]]. The video controller displayed 24 lines by 40 columns of monochrome, upper-case-only (the original character set matches ASCII characters 0x20 to 0x5F) text on the screen, with [[National Television System Committee|NTSC]] [[composite video]] output suitable for display on a TV monitor, or on a regular TV set by way of a separate [[RF modulator]]. The original retail price of the computer was [[United States dollar|US$]]1298<ref>{{cite book|last=Forster| first=Winnie|authorlink=Winnie Forster|title=The encyclopedia of consoles, handhelds & home computers 1972 - 2005|year=2005|publisher=GAMEPLAN|isbn=3-00-015359-4|page=19}}</ref> (with 4 kB of RAM) and US$2638 (with the maximum 48 kB of RAM). To reflect the computer's [[Apple II graphics|color graphics]] capability, the Apple logo on the casing was represented using rainbow stripes,<ref>{{cite web|title=Apple II History Chapter 4|url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah04.html|author=Steven Weyhrich|date=April 21, 2002|accessdate=2006-11-16}}</ref> which remained a part of Apple's corporate logo until early 1998. The earliest Apple II's were assembled in [[Silicon Valley]], and later in [[Texas]];<ref>{{cite book|first=Frank|last=Rose|title=West of Eden |publisher=Arrow Books|year=1989|page=3|isbn=0-09-976200-5}}</ref> [[printed circuit board]]s were manufactured in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Singapore]].

An external 5Â¼-inch [[floppy disk]] drive, the [[Disk II]], attached via a controller card that plugged into one of the computer's expansion slots (usually slot 6), was used for data storage and retrieval to replace cassettes. The Disk II interface, created by [[Steve Wozniak]], was regarded as an engineering masterpiece for its economy of electronic components.<ref>{{cite web| title=Apple II History Chapter 5, The Disk II|url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah05.html| author=Steven Weyhrich|date=December 28, 2001|accessdate=2006-11-16}}</ref><ref>Freiberger, Paul, and Michael Swaine. "Fire In The Valley, Part Two (Book Excerpt)", A+ Magazine, January 1985: 45.</ref> While other controllers had dozens of chips for synchronizing data I/O with disk rotation, seeking the head to the appropriate track, and encoding the data into magnetic pulses, Wozniak's controller card had few chips; instead, the [[Apple DOS]] used software to perform these functions. The [[Group Code Recording]] used by the controller was simpler and easier to implement in software than the more common [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]]. In the end, the low chip count of the controller helped make Apple's Disk II the first affordable floppy drive for personal computers. As a side effect, Wozniak's scheme made it easy for [[proprietary software]] developers to [[copy protection|copy-protect]] the media on which their software shipped by changing the low-level sector format or stepping the drive's head between the tracks; inevitably, other companies eventually sold software to foil this protection. Another Wozniak optimization allowed him to omit Shugart's Track-0 sensor. When the Operating System wants to go to track 0, the controller simply moves 40 times toward the next-lower-numbered track, relying on the mechanical stop to prevent it going any further down than track 0. This process, called "recalibration", made a loud buzzing (rapid mechanical chattering) sound that often frightened Apple novices.

The approach taken in the Disk II controller was typical of Wozniak's design sensibility. The Apple II used several engineering shortcuts to save hardware and reduce costs. For example, taking advantage of the way that 6502 instructions only access memory every other clock cycle, the video generation circuitry's memory access on the otherwise unused cycles avoided memory contention issues and also eliminated the need for a separate refresh circuit for the DRAM chips. Rather than use a complex analog-to-digital circuit to read the outputs of the game controller, Wozniak used a simple timer circuit whose period was proportional to the resistance of the game controller, and used a software loop to measure the timer.

The text and graphics screens had a complex arrangement (the scanlines were not stored in sequential areas of memory) which was reputedly due to Wozniak's realization that doing it that way would save a chip; it was less expensive to have software calculate or look up the address of the required scanline than to include the extra hardware. Similarly, in the high-resolution graphics mode, color was determined by pixel position and could thus be implemented in software, saving Wozniak the chips needed to convert bit patterns to colors. This also allowed for sub-pixel [[font]] rendering since orange and blue pixels appeared half a pixel-width further to the right on the screen than green and purple pixels.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gibson |first=Steve|title=The origins of sub-pixel font rendering|url=http://www.grc.com/ctwho.htm|accessdate=2006-08-04}}</ref>

Color on the Apple II series took advantage of a quirk of the [[National Television System Committee|NTSC]] television signal standard, which made color display relatively easy and inexpensive to implement. The original NTSC [[television]] signal specification was black-and-white. Color was tacked on later by adding a 3.58-MHz subcarrier signal that was partially ignored by B&W TV sets. Color is encoded based on the ''[[phase (waves)|phase]]'' of this signal in relation to a reference ''[[color burst]]'' signal. The result is that the position, size, and intensity of a series of pulses define color information. These pulses can translate into ''[[pixel]]s'' on the computer screen.

The Apple II display provided two pixels per subcarrier cycle. When the color burst reference signal was turned on and the computer attached to a color display, it could display green by showing one alternating pattern of pixels, magenta with an opposite pattern of alternating pixels, and white by placing two pixels next to each other. Later, blue and orange became available by tweaking the offset of the pixels by half a pixel-width in relation to the colorburst signal. The high-resolution display offered more colors simply by compressing more, narrower pixels into each subcarrier cycle. The coarse, low-resolution graphics display mode worked differently, as it could output a short burst of high-frequency signal per pixel to offer more color options.

The epitome of the Apple II design philosophy was the Apple II sound circuitry. Rather than having a dedicated sound-synthesis chip, the Apple II had a toggle circuit that could only emit a click through a built-in speaker or a line out jack; all other sounds (including two, three and, eventually, four-voice music and playback of audio samples and speech synthesis) were generated entirely by software that clicked the speaker at just the right times. Not for nearly a decade would an Apple II be released with a dedicated sound chip (though with six expansion slots, users could add sound functionality via a soundcard like the [[Mockingboard]]). Similar techniques were used for cassette storage: the cassette output worked the same as the speaker, and the input was a simple [[Zero crossing threshold detector|zero-crossing detector]] that served as a relatively crude (1-bit) audio digitizer. Routines in the ROM were used to encode and decode data in [[frequency-shift keying]] for the cassette.

Wozniak's open design and the Apple II's multiple expansion slots permitted a wide variety of third-party devices, including [[Apple II peripheral cards]] such as [[Apple II serial cards|Serial controllers]], display controllers, memory boards, hard disks, and networking components. There were plug-in [[expansion card]]s â such as the ''Z80-card''<ref name=z80/> â that permitted the Apple to use the [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] processor and run a multitude of programs developed under the [[CP/M]] operating system,<ref name="z80"/> including the [[dBase|dBase II]] database and the [[WordStar]] word processor. There was also a third-party [[Motorola 6809|6809]] card that would allow [[OS-9]] Level One to be run. The [[Mockingboard]] sound card greatly improved audio capabilities, allowing simple music synthesis and text-to-speech functions. Eventually, [[Apple II accelerators|Apple II accelerator cards]] were created to double or quadruple the computer's speed.

===Apple II Plus===
 {{Main|Apple II Plus}}
[[File:Apple II Plus.jpg|thumb|right|Apple II Plus]]
The '''Apple II Plus''', introduced in June 1979,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah06.html|title=Apple II History Chap 6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lowendmac.com/orchard/05/0509.html|title=Macintosh Prehistory: The Apple I and Apple II Era}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://applemuseum.bott.org/sections/products.html|title=Apple Products}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lrs.ed.uiuc.edu/students/madkins/timeline.html|title=EDTechTimeline}}</ref> included the [[Applesoft BASIC]] programming language in [[Read-only memory|ROM]]. This [[Microsoft]]-authored dialect of BASIC, which was previously available as an upgrade, supported floating-point arithmetic, and became the standard BASIC dialect on the Apple II series (though it ran at a noticeably slower speed than Steve Wozniak's Integer BASIC).

The Apple II Plus was otherwise identical to the original Apple II. The smaller memory sizes were no longer available, so the II Plus always had a total of 48 kB of RAM, expandable to 64 kB by means of the "language card", a 16 kB RAM expansion card that could be installed in the computer's slot 0. The Apple's 6502 microprocessor could support up to 64 kB of memory, and a machine with 48 kB RAM reached this limit because of the additional 12 kB of read-only memory and 4 kB of I/O addresses. For this reason, the extra RAM in the language card was bank-switched over the machine's built-in ROM, allowing code loaded into the additional memory to be used as if it actually were ROM. Users could thus load Integer BASIC into the language card from disk and switch between the Integer and Applesoft dialects of BASIC with DOS 3.3's INT and FP commands just as if they had the BASIC ROM expansion card. The language card was also required to use the [[UCSD Pascal]] and [[FORTRAN|FORTRAN 77]] compilers, which were released by Apple at about the same time. These ran under the [[UCSD Pascal|UCSD p-System]] operating system, which had its own disk format and emitted code for a "virtual machine" rather than the actual 6502 processor.
The UCSD P-system had a curious approach to [[memory management]], which became even more curious on the [[Apple III]].

A [[TEMPEST]] approved version of the Apple II Plus called the Microfix was developed in 1980 by the [[Georgia Tech Research Institute]] for [[U.S. Army]] [[FORSCOM]]. Fielded in 1982, the Microfix system was the first tactical system using video disk ([[Laserdisk]]) map technology providing zoom and scroll over map imagery coupled with a point database of intelligence data such as [[order of battle]], airfields, roadways, and bridges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://training.esri.com/campus/library/Bibliography/RecordDetail.cfm?ID=16159|title=The development of small computer geographic analysis systems for military applications}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.falconview.org/trac/FalconView/raw-attachment/wiki/Presentations/Moving_Maps.pdf|title= Moving Maps: Evolution in GIS}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm34_3.pdf|title=U.S. Army Field Manual 34-3, Intelligence Analysis}}</ref>

===Apple II Europlus and J-Plus===
After the success of the first Apple II in the United States, Apple expanded its market to include [[Europe]], [[Australia]] and the [[Far East]] in 1978, with the '''Apple II Europlus''' (Europe, Australia) and the '''Apple II J-Plus''' (Japan). In these models, Apple made the necessary hardware, software and [[firmware]] changes in order to comply to standards outside of the U.S. The [[power supply]] was modified to accept the local voltage, and in the European and Australian model the video output signal was changed from color [[National Television System Committee|NTSC]] to monochrome [[Phase Alternating Line|PAL]] â an extra video card was needed for color PAL graphics, since the simple tricks Wozniak had used to generate a pseudo-NTSC signal with minimal hardware did not carry over to the more complex PAL system. In the Japanese version of the international Apple, the keyboard layout was changed to allow for [[Katakana]] writing (full [[Kanji]] support was clearly beyond the capabilities of the machine), but in most other countries the international Apple was sold with an unmodified American keyboard; thus the German model still lacked the [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlauts]], for example. For the most part, the Apple II Europlus and J-Plus were identical to the Apple II Plus. Production of the Europlus ended in 1983.

===Apple IIe===
{{Main|Apple IIe}}
[[Image:Apple iie.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An Apple IIe with DuoDisk and Monitor //.]]

The Apple II Plus was followed in 1983 by the '''[[Apple IIe]]''', a cost-reduced yet more powerful machine that used newer chips to reduce the component count and add new features, such as the display of upper and lowercase letters and a standard 64 kB of RAM.

The IIe RAM was configured as if it were a 48 kB Apple II Plus with a language card; the machine had no slot 0, but instead had an auxiliary slot that for most practical purposes took the place of slot 3, the most commonly used slot for 80-column cards in the II Plus.

The auxiliary slot could accept a 1 kB memory card to enable the 80-column display. This card contained only RAM; the hardware and firmware for the 80-column display was built into the Apple IIe, remaining fairly compatible with the older Videx-style cards, even though the low-level details were very different. An "extended 80-column card" with more memory expanded the machine's RAM to 128 kB.

As with the language card, the memory in the 80-column card was bank-switched over the machine's main RAM; this made the memory better suited to data storage than to running software, and in fact the [[Apple ProDOS|ProDOS]] operating system, which was introduced with the Apple IIe, would automatically configure this memory as a [[RAM disk]] upon booting.

Third-party aux-slot memory cards later allowed expansion up to 1 [[megabyte|MB]]. The {{nowrap|1 K}} 80-column card also enabled one new graphics mode, Double Lo-Res (80Ã48 pixels). The extended 80-column card enabled two, Double Lo-Res and Double Hi-Res (560Ã192 pixels). Both modes doubled the horizontal resolution in comparison to the standard Lo-Res (40Ã48) and Hi-Res (280Ã192) Modes; in the case of Double Hi-Res, the number of available colors was increased as well, from 6 to 15. Apple IIe's from the very first production run cannot use Double Hi-Res. Neither of these modes was directly supported by the built-in BASIC, however, so the user had to resort to the use of lots of POKE and CALL commands in BASIC, or assembly language programming, or one of a number of software Toolkits to exploit these modes.

While it was possible for software to switch out the 80-column firmware, making the firmware of a card in slot 3 available with a card in the auxiliary slot, it was not a common thing to do. However, even with the 80-column firmware enabled, slot 3's I/O memory range was still usable, giving it approximately the capability of slot 0 on a II or II plus. This meant that it actually was possible to use slot 3 for things, such as coprocessor cards and language cards, that did not use slot firmware space.

Introduced with the IIe was the DuoDisk, essentially two Disk II 5.25-inch drives in a single enclosure designed to stack between the computer and the monitor, and a new controller card to run it. This controller was (by design) functionally identical to the original Disk II controller but used a different connector, allowing a single cable to control both drives in the DuoDisk. The DuoDisk was plagued by reliability problems, however, and did not catch on as well as the Apple IIe itself.

The Apple IIe was the most popular Apple II ever built and was widely considered the "workhorse" of the line. It also has the distinction of being the longest-lived Apple computer of all time â it was manufactured and sold with only minor changes for nearly eleven years. In that time, following the original, two important variations were introduced known as the [[Apple IIe#The Enhanced IIe|Enhanced IIe]] (four new replacement chips to give it some of the features of the later model [[Apple IIc]], including an upgraded processor called the 65C02) and the [[Apple IIe Platinum|Platinum IIe]] (a modernized new look for the case color to match other Apple products of the era, along with the addition of a built-in numeric keypad). An Enhanced IIe with 128 kB of RAM can be considered the minimum requirement for running most Apple II software released after about 1988.

Two and a half years before the Apple IIe, Apple had produced and marketed a computer called the ''[[Apple III]]'' for business users. This product was not a success, and Steve Wozniak has been quoted as saying that the Apple III had a 100% failure rate â every single machine manufactured had some kind of fault (a famous Apple technical bulletin recommended dropping the machine vertically onto a table to re-seat the DIP chips in their loose sockets{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}). Still, many of its features were carried over in the design of the Apple IIe, without the manufacturing flaws that led to failures in the Apple III. Among them was the ProDOS operating system, which was based on Apple III's Sophisticated Operating System (SOS).

===Apple IIc===
{{Main|Apple IIc}}
[[Image:Apple iicb.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Apple IIc was Apple's first compact and portable computer.]]

Apple released the '''[[Apple IIc]]''' in April 1984, billing it as a portable Apple II, because it could be easily carried, though unlike modern [[portable computer|portables]] it lacked a built-in display and battery. The IIc even sported a carrying handle that folded down to prop the machine up into a typing position. It was the first of three Apple II models to be made in the [[Snow White design language]], and the only one that used its unique creamy off-white color.<ref>"Kunkel, Paul, AppleDesign: The work of the Apple Industrial Design Group, with photographs by Rick English, New York: Graphis, 1997, p.30</ref> (The other Snow White computers from the Apple II series, the II<small>GS</small> and the IIc Plus, were light gray, called "Platinum" by Apple.)

The Apple IIc was the first Apple II to use the [[WDC 65C02|65C02]] low-power variant of the 6502 processor, and featured a built-in 5.25-inch floppy drive and 128 kB RAM, with a built-in disk controller that could control external drives, composite video (NTSC or PAL), serial interfaces for modem and printer, and a port usable by either a joystick or mouse. Unlike previous Apple II models, the IIc had no internal expansion slots at all, this being the means by which its compact size was attained. Third parties did eventually figure out how to wedge up to 1 MB of additional memory and a real-time clock into the machine, and a later revision of the motherboard provided an expansion slot that could accept an Apple memory card bearing up to 1 MB of RAM. The disk port, originally intended for a second 5.25-inch floppy drive, eventually was able to interface to 3Â½-inch disk drives and (via third parties) even hard disks.

To play up the portability, two different monochrome [[LCD]] displays were sold for use with the IIc's video expansion port, although both were short-lived due to high cost and poor legibility. (An Apple IIc with the smaller of these displays appeared briefly in the film ''[[2010 (film)|2010]]''.) The IIc had an external power supply that converted AC power to 12 V DC, allowing third parties to offer battery packs and automobile power adapters that connected in place of the supplied AC adapter.

The Apple IIc (in its American version) was the first microcomputer to include support for the [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard]], which was activated using a switch above the keyboard. This feature was also later found in late-model American Apple IIe computers (though the switch was inside the computer) and in the Apple II<small>GS</small> (accessible via the built-in control panel). The international models used the same mechanism to switch between the localized and the American keyboard layouts, but did not offer Dvorak.

===Apple II<small>GS</small>===
{{Main|Apple IIGS}}
[[Image:Apple IIGS.jpg|right|thumb|150|The Apple IIGS, the most powerful Apple II, featuring a true 16-bit CPU, 4096 colors, Ensoniq synthesizer, a Mac-like GUI and a mouse.]]
[[Image:Apple iigs.jpg|right|thumb|150|The Apple IIGS setup, with keyboard and mouse shown.]]

The next member of the line was the '''[[Apple IIGS|Apple II<small>GS</small>]]''' computer, released on September 15, 1986. A radical departure from the existing Apple II line, the II<small>GS</small> featured a true [[16-bit]] microprocessor, the [[WDC 65816/65802|65C816]], operating at {{nowrap|2.8 MHz}} with 24-bit addressing, allowing expansion up to 8 MB of RAM without the bank-switching hassles of the earlier machines (RAM cards with more than 4 MB were never directly supported by Apple<ref>Regan, Joe. ''A2Pro Roundtable'', October 1991, Category 16, Topic 2.</ref>). It introduced two completely new graphic modes sporting higher resolutions and a palette of 4,096 colors; however, only 4 (at 640Ã200 resolution) or 16 (at 320Ã200 resolution) colors could be used on a single line at a time, although a technique known as ''[[dither]]ing'' was often employed in software to increase the number of perceived colors.<ref name="making">Duprau, Jeanne, and Tyson, Molly. "The Making of the Apple IIGS", ''A+ Magazine'', November 1986: 57-74.</ref>

In a departure from earlier Apple II graphics modes, the new modes laid out the scanlines sequentially in memory. However, programmers in search of a graphics challenge could always turn to 3200-color mode, which involved precisely swapping in a different 16-color palette for each of the screen's 200 scanlines as the monitor's electron beam traced the screen line by line. This exotic technique did not leave many CPU cycles available for other processing, so this "mode" was best suited to displaying static images.

The Apple II<small>GS</small> stood out from any previous (or future) Apple II models, evolving and advancing the platform into the next generation of computing while still maintaining near-complete backward compatibility. The secret of the Apple II<small>GS</small>'s compatibility was a single chip called the [[Mega II]], which contained the functional equivalent of an entire Apple IIe computer (sans processor). This, combined with the flawless 65C02 emulation mode of the 65C816 processor, provided full support for legacy software.

The computer also included a 32-voice [[Ensoniq]] [[Ensoniq 5503|5503]], '[[wavetable synthesis|wavetable']] [[sample-based synthesis|sample-based music synthesizer]] chip with 64 kB dedicated RAM,<ref>{{cite web|title=Apple IIGS|url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=71|author=Old-Computers.com Museum|year=|accessdate=2006-11-16}}</ref> 256 kB of standard RAM, built-in peripheral ports (switchable between IIe-style card slots and IIc-style onboard controllers for disk drives, mouse, RGB video, and serial devices), built-in [[AppleTalk]] networking, and a ROM toolbox that supported a graphical user interface derived from the Macintosh toolbox. The computer could run existing 8-bit Apple II software (including software written for the very first Apple II in Integer BASIC), but also supported 16-bit software running under a new OS first called ProDOS 16 and later called GS/OS.<ref name="making"/> The new OS eventually included a Finder that could be used for managing disks and files and opening documents and applications, along with desk accessories â just like the Macintosh. The 16-bit operating system would automatically switch to the text display and downshift to 8-bit mode to run legacy software, while offering a consistent, Macintosh-like graphical interface for native 16-bit applications. Eventually, the II<small>GS</small> gained the ability to read and write Macintosh disks and, through third-party software, even multitasking (both cooperative and preemptive, the latter in the form of a Unix-type shell), outline TrueType font support, and in one case, even real-time 3D gaming using texture mapping.

The first 50,000 Apple II<small>GS</small> computers came with Steve Wozniak's "''Woz''" signature silkscreened on the front and were referred to as the "''Woz Limited Edition''". These machines are not functionally different from machines from the same time period without the signature.

===Apple IIc Plus===
{{Main|Apple IIc Plus}}
[[Image:Apple IIc Plus (front).jpg|thumb|right|The Apple IIc Plus, an 8-bit revision of the original portable but with faster CPU, 3.5-inch floppy and built-in power supply. It was the last introduced of the Apple II line.]]

The final Apple II model was the '''[[Apple IIc Plus]]''' introduced in 1988. It was the same size and shape as the IIc that came before it, but the 5.25-inch floppy drive had been replaced with a 3Â½-inch drive, the power supply was moved inside (gone was the IIc's "brick on a leash" power supply), and the processor was a fast {{nowrap|4 MHz}} 65C02 processor that actually ran 8-bit Apple II software faster than the II<small>GS</small>. (Third-party accelerators for other models could, however, go as fast as {{nowrap|10 MHz}}, and II<small>GS</small> accelerators would eventually reach {{nowrap|16 MHz}}.) The IIc Plus's accelerator was derived from a design licensed from Zip Technologies, a third-party maker of accelerators for the Apple II, though Apple used separate chips instead of combining the processor, cache, and supporting logic on a multi-chip module as did Zip. Like later models of the original Apple IIc, the IIc Plus included a memory expansion slot that would accept a daughter-card carrying up to a [[megabyte]] of RAM. The IIc Plus also featured a new keyboard layout that matched the Platinum IIe and II<small>GS</small>. Unlike the IIe, IIc and II<small>GS</small>, the IIc Plus came only in one version (American) and was not officially sold anywhere outside the USA.

Many perceived the IIc Plus as Apple's attempt to compete with the [[Laser 128|Laser 128EX/2]], a popular third party Apple-compatible machine that also had an accelerated processor and a built-in 3.5-inch drive. There were few other rational explanations for Apple expending resources on the continued development of a new 8-bit Apple II model rather than furthering the 16-bit Apple II<small>GS</small>. However, with its 3.5-inch drive and speedy processor, it was an excellent, compact machine for running the [[AppleWorks]] integrated productivity package, especially with the 1 MB memory upgrade.

===Apple IIe Card===
{{Main|Apple IIe Card}}

Although not an extension of the Apple II line, in 1990 the '''[[Apple IIe Card]]''', an expansion card for the [[Macintosh LC|LC]] line of [[Macintosh]] computers, was released. Essentially a miniaturized Apple IIe computer on a card (using the Mega II chip from the Apple II<small>GS</small>), it allowed the Macintosh to run 8-bit Apple IIe software through [[hardware emulation]] (although video was emulated in software and was slower at times than a IIe). Many of the LC's built-in Macintosh peripherals could be "borrowed" by the card when in Apple II mode (i.e. extra RAM, 3.5-inch floppy, AppleTalk networking, hard disk). The IIe card could not, however, run software intended for the 16-bit Apple II<small>GS</small>. The Macintosh LC with IIe Card was intended to replace the Apple II<small>GS</small> in schools and homes and was presumably the reason a new model Apple II<small>GS</small> that was confirmed by insiders to be in development at one point was cancelled and never released.

===Final years===
Apple's [[Macintosh]] product line finally eclipsed the Apple II in the early 1990s. Even after the Macintosh's introduction, the Apple II had remained the company's primary revenue source for years. The computer was the first to attract a loyal user community and many outspoken Apple II fans were bitter that the company had invested its Apple II profits into the Macintosh rather than using them to further the Apple II series.

Apple continued to sell Apple II systems alongside the Macintosh until terminating the II<small>GS</small> in December, 1992<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.applematters.com/collections/apple-iigs/ |title=Apple IIGS // Collections |publisher=Applematters.com |date=2005-05-23 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref> and the IIe in November, 1993.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steven Weyhrich |url=http://apple2history.org/history/appy/ahb5.html |title=Apple II History Timeline |publisher=Apple2history.org |date=2003-05-16 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref>

==Advertising, marketing, and packaging==
[[Mike Markkula]],<ref name="Markkula1997">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/01/business/an-unknown-co-founder-leaves-after-20-years-of-glory-and-turmoil.html|title=An 'Unknown' Co-Founder Leaves After 20 Years of Glory and Turmoil|date=1997-09-01|work=[[New York Times]] | first=John | last=Markoff | accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> a retired [[Intel]] salesman who provided early critical funding for Apple Computer, was keen on marketing. From 1977-1981, Apple used the [[Regis McKenna]] agency for its advertisements and marketing. In 1981, [[Chiat/Day|Chiat-Day]] acquired Regis McKenna's advertising operations and Apple used Chiat-Day. At Regis McKenna Advertising, the team assigned to launch the Apple II consisted of [[Rob Janoff]], art director, Chip Schafer, copywriter and Bill Kelley, account executive. Janoff came up with the Apple logo with a bite out of it. The design was originally an olive green with matching company logotype all in lower case. Steve Jobs insisted on promoting the color capability of the Apple II by putting rainbow stripes on the Apple logo. In its letterhead and business card implementation, the rounded "a" of the logotype echoed the "bite" in the logo. This logo was developed simultaneously with an advertisement and a brochure; the latter being produced for distribution initially at the first [[West Coast Computer Faire]]. Ever since the original Apple II, Apple has paid high attention to its quality of packaging, partly because of [[Steve Jobs]]' personal preferences and opinions on packaging and final product appearance.<ref>[[Michael Moritz|Moritz, Michael]]. ''The Little Kingdom''. New York, William Morrow and Company, Inc, 1984: pg. 186.</ref> All of Apple's packaging for the Apple II series looked similar, featuring lots of clean white space and showing the Apple rainbow logo prominently.<ref>[http://www.digibarn.com/collections/systems/appleIIgs-wozedition/complete-system/index.html A gallery of Apple IIGS packaging] from DigiBarn</ref> For several years up until the late 1980s, Apple used the [[Apple typography#Motter Tektura|Motter Tekkura]] font for packaging, until changing to the [[Typography and logography of Apple Computer#Apple Garamond|Apple Garamond]] font.

Apple ran the first advertisement for the Apple II in the July 1977 edition of ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'' â a two page spread ad titled "Introducing the Apple II" and followed by a third page that was an order form. The first brochure, was entitled "Simplicity" and the copy in both the ad and brochure pioneered "demystifying" language intended to make the new idea of a home computer more "personal." The Apple II introduction ad was later run in the September 1977 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]''.<ref>[http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.pyproject=Macintosh&story=1984.txt&topic=Marketing&sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref>

For the Apple IIc, Apple wanted an advertisement to demonstrate the power of the machine despite its small size; they ran a memorable television commercial featuring a high-rise office building in which they claimed with words and images that the IIc had all the power necessary to run a large building, suggesting that it had more than enough power for the home user. (This ad, along with the ''1984'' Macintosh ad, was featured in a Marketing telecourse run on PBS.<!-- Marketing is the name and the subject of the telecourse. -->)

Apple later aired eight television commercials for the Apple II<small>GS</small>, emphasizing its benefits to education and students, along with some print ads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theapplecollection.com/Collection/AppleMovies/movies9.html|title=Apple //gs Commercials Quicktime Movies @ The Apple Collection}}</ref>

Towards the end of 1982, art director Brent Thomas and Steve Hayden came up with the idea of doing an [[advertising campaign]] based on the timely tagline "Why 1984 will not be like 1984". Chiat-Day shopped it around to a number of clients, including Apple, where it was proposed to be used for a print ad in [[the Wall Street Journal]] promoting the Apple II. However, Apple did not go for it, and the idea was filed away until the spring of 1983, when they met with the Macintosh marketing team to start working on the launch, which was scheduled for January 1984. The idea eventually became the famous ''[[1984 (advertisement)|1984]]'' commercial which aired during the third quarter at [[Super Bowl XVIII]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=1984.txt&topic=Marketing&sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date|title=Folklore.org: Macintosh Stories: 1984}}</ref>

==Clones==
[[Image:Taiwanese Apple II clone Cosmo.jpg|thumb|The Jiama (åé¦¬) SPS-109, a [[Republic of China|Taiwanese]] clone of the Apple II, looks almost identical to the Apple II and II+, including an identical [[computer case|case]], color and [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] layout. The only noticeable physical difference is the label above the keyboard.]]

The Apple II was frequently cloned, both in the [[United States]] and abroad â similar cloning of the IBM PC later occurred. According to some sources (see below), more than 190 different models of [[List of Apple II clones|Apple II clones]] were manufactured. Many of these had "fruit" names (e.g. "Pineapple") to indicate to the initiated that they were Apple II clones. Well-known in the [[Soviet Bloc]] were the [[Agat computer|Agat]], an oversized Russian Apple II clone with a [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] character set, and [[Bulgaria]]n [[Pravetz series 8]], a close Apple II replica with Cyrillic support.

Basis, a German company, created the Basis 108,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=92 |title=The Museum |publisher=Old-Computers.Com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref> a clone for the Apple II that included both a 6502 processor and the Zilog Z80, allowing it to run the CP/M operating system as well as most Apple II software. This machine was unusual in that it was housed in a heavy cast aluminum chassis. The Basis 108 was equipped with built-in [[Centronics]] (parallel) and RS232c (serial) ports, as well as the standard six Apple II compatible slots. Unlike the Apple II it came with a detached full-stroke keyboard (AZERTY/QWERTY) of 100 keys plus 15 functions keys and separate numeric and editing keypads.

A [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] (at the time part of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]) company named [[IRIS Computers]] (sub company of biggest electric company in Bosnia and [[Herzegovina]] and Yugoslavia ENERGOINVEST) has produced Apple II clones since the early 1980s. Their official brand name was IRIS 8. They were very expensive and hard to obtain and were produced primarily for usage in early computerized digital telephone systems and for education. Their usage in offices of the state companies, R&D labs and in the Yugoslav army was also reported. IRIS 8 had looks of early IBM PCs â separate central unit with cooling system and two 5.25-inch disks, monitor and keyboard. Compatibility with original Apple II was complete. Elite high schools in Yugoslavia and especially Bosnia and Herzegovina were equipped with clusters of 8, 16 or 32 IRIS 8 computers connected in local network administrated by IRIS 16 PC clone. The number of IRIS 8's produced could be as many as a couple of tens of thousands{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.

An [[Australia]]n-produced clone of the Apple II was the [[Medfly computer|Medfly]], named after the [[Mediterranean fruit fly]] that attacks apples. The Medfly computer featured a faster processor, more memory, detached keyboard, lower and upper case characters and a built-in disk controller.

Unitron, a Brazilian company, produced another clone, named ApII. Unitron used a copy of the Apple's ROM translated to Portuguese. The operating system was Apple's DOS 3.3 translated to Portuguese. During this period, it was illegal to import microcomputers in Brazil, and buying those (illegal) clones was the only way to have a microcomputer. Unitron stopped manufacturing the ApII a few years after the introduction of IBM PC clones in Brazil.

The Ace clones from [[Franklin Computer Corporation]] are the best known and had the most lasting impact, as Franklin copied Apple's ROMs and software and freely admitted to doing so. Franklin's argument: a computer's ROM was simply a pattern of switches locked into a fixed position, and one cannot copyright a pattern of switches. Apple fought Franklin in court for about five years to get its clones off the market, and was ultimately successful when a court ruled that software stored in ROM was in fact copyrightable in the U.S. (See [[Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp.]]) Franklin later released non-infringing but less-compatible clones; these could run ProDOS and AppleWorks and had an Applesoft-like BASIC, but compatibility with other software was hit-or-miss.

Apple also challenged [[VTech]]'s [[Laser 128]], an enhanced clone of the Apple IIc first released in 1984, in court. This suit proved less fruitful for Apple, because VTech had [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineered]] the Monitor ROM rather than copying it and had licensed Applesoft BASIC from its creator, [[Microsoft]]. Apple had neglected to obtain exclusive rights to the Applesoft dialect of BASIC from Microsoft; VTech was the first cloner to license it. The Laser 128 proved popular and remained on the market for many years, both in its original form and in accelerated versions that ran faster than {{nowrap|1 MHz}}. Although it was not 100% compatible with the Apple II, it was close, and its popularity ensured that most major developers tested their software on a Laser as well as on genuine Apple machines. Because it was frequently sold via mail order and mass-market retailers such as [[Sears]], the Laser 128 may have cut into the sales of low-cost competitors such as [[Commodore Business Machines]] as much as it did Apple's.

While the first Apple II clones were generally exact copies of their Apple counterparts that competed mainly on price, many clones had extra capabilities too. A Franklin model, the Ace 1000, sported a numeric keypad and lower-case long before these features were added to the Apple II line. The Laser 128 series is sometimes credited with spurring Apple to release the Apple IIc Plus; the built-in 3Â½-inch drive and accelerated processor were features Laser had pioneered. The Laser 128 also had a IIe-style expansion slot on the side that could be used to add peripheral cards.

[[BÃ¶we Bell & Howell|Bell & Howell]], an audiovisual equipment manufacturer whose products (particularly film projectors) were ubiquitous in American schools, offered what appeared at first glance to be an Apple II Plus clone in a distinctive black plastic case. However, these were in fact real Apple II Plus units manufactured by Apple for B&H for a brief period of time. Many schools had a few of these Black Apple or [[Apple II Plus#Bell & Howell|Black "Darth Vader" Apples]] in their labs.

[[ITT Corporation|ITT]] created an Apple II Plus-compatible for the European market called the ITT 2020 (Europlus). This machine was built under license from Apple. It has the same shape as the Apple II but a different color (matte silver), and is not an exact copy functionally.

Syscom 2 Inc (from Carson City, NV) created the Syscom 2 Apple ][+ clone. The case looked nearly identical. They had 48 k RAM and the normal expansion capabilities. These clones also supported lower case characters, toggled with a ^O keystroke.

An unknown company produced a clone called the RX-8800. One new feature it had was a numeric keypad.

Although not technically a clone, [[Quadram]] produced an add-in [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] card, called the Quadlink, that provided hardware emulation of an Apple II+ for the [[IBM PC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classiccmp.org/pipermail/cctech/2005-January/037465.html|title=Quadlink by Quadram - put an Apple II in you PC|accessdate=2009-12-16}}</ref> The card had its own 6502 CPU and dedicated 80 K RAM (64 K for applications, plus 16 K to hold a reverse-engineered Apple ROM image, loaded at boot-time), and installed "between" the PC and its floppy drive(s), color display, and speaker, in a pass-through configuration. This allowed the PC to operate in a [[dual-boot]] fashion: when booted through the Quadlink, the PC could run the majority of II software, and read and write Apple-formatted floppies through the standard PC floppy drive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.textfiles.com/digitize/items/1984-quadram-quips/.m/1984-quadram-quips-03.jpg|title=Quadram Quips (sales flyer)|publisher=[[Quadram]]|accessdate=2009-12-16}}</ref> Because it had a dedicated processor, rather than any form of software emulation, this system ran at nearly the same speed as an equivalent Apple machine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v9n12/53_The_new_blue_Apple_Quadl.php|title=The new blue Apple; Quadlink makes your IBM think it's an Apple|publisher=[[Creative Computing]]|date=December 1983|last=Arrants|first=Stephen|accessdate= 2009-12-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=wS8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=quadram+quadlink#v=onepage&q=quadram%20quadlink&f=false|title=Review: Quadlink|publisher=[[Infoworld]]|year=1983|last=Lombardi|

==General==
===Data storage===
Originally the Apple II used [[audio cassette]] tapes for program and data storage. A dedicated tape recorder along the lines of the [[Commodore Datasette]] was never produced; Apple recommended using the [[Panasonic Corporation|Panasonic]] RQ309 in some of its early printed documentation. Apple and many third-party developers made software available on tape at first, but after the Disk II became available, tape-based Apple II software essentially disappeared from the market.

The Disk II floppy drive used 5.25-inch [[floppy disk]]s. The first [[disk operating system]]s for the Apple II were [[Apple DOS|DOS 3.1]] and DOS 3.2, which stored 113.75 kB on each disk, organized into 35 tracks of thirteen 256-byte sectors each. After about two years, DOS 3.3 was introduced, storing 140 kB thanks to a minor firmware change on the disk controller that allowed it to store 16 sectors per track. (This upgrade was user-installable on older controllers.) After the release of DOS 3.3, the user community discontinued use of DOS 3.2 except for running legacy software. Programs that required DOS 3.2 were fairly rare; however, as DOS 3.3 was not a major architectural change aside from the number of sectors per track, a program called MUFFIN was provided with DOS 3.3 to allow users to copy files from DOS 3.2 disks to DOS 3.3 disks.

On a DOS 3.x disk, tracks 0, 1, and most of track 2 were reserved to store the operating system. (It was possible, with a special utility, to reclaim most of this space for data if a disk did not need to be bootable.) A short ROM program on the disk controller had the ability to seek to track zero â which it did without regard for the read/write head's current position, resulting in the characteristic "chattering" sound of a Disk II boot, which was the read/write head hitting the rubber stop block at the end of the rail â and read and execute code from sector 0. The code contained in there would then pull in the rest of the operating system. DOS stored the disk's directory on track 17, smack in the middle of the 35-track disks, in order to reduce the average [[seek time]] to the frequently-used directory track. The directory was fixed in size and could hold a maximum of 105 files. Subdirectories were not supported.

Most game publishers did not include DOS on their floppy disks, since they needed the memory it occupied more than its capabilities; instead, they often wrote their own boot loaders and read-only file systems. This also served to discourage "crackers" from snooping around in the game's copy-protection code, since the data on the disk was not in files that could be accessed easily.

Some third-party manufacturers produced floppy drives that could write 40 tracks to most 5.25-inch disks, yielding 160 kB of storage per disk, but the format did not catch on widely, and no known software was published on 40-track media. Most drives, even Disk IIs, could write 36 tracks; simple modifications to DOS for formatting the extra track were common.

Incidentally, although the Apple Disk II stored 140 kB on single-sided, "single-density" floppy disks, it was very common for Apple II users to extend the capacity of a floppy disk to 280 kB â by cutting out a second write-protect notch on the side of the disk using a "disk notcher" (although a simple hole puncher would do) and inserting the disk flipped over. Early on, diskette manufacturers routinely warned that this technique would damage the read/write head of the drives or wear out the disk faster, and these warnings were frequently repeated in magazines of the day. In practice, however, this method was an inexpensive way to store twice as much data for the same amount of money, and was widely used for commercially released floppies as well.

Later, Apple IIs were able to use 3.5-inch disks with a total capacity of 800 kB and hard disks. DOS 3.3 did not support these drives natively; third-party software was required, and disks larger than about 400 kB had to be split up into multiple "virtual disk volumes." [[Apple ProDOS|ProDOS]], a 1983 descendent of the Apple ///'s SOS, became the Apple II operating system of choice for users with these larger disks thanks to its native support of volumes up to 32 MB in size and the fact that AppleWorks required it.

===Renditions of the "II" name===
The "II" portion of the Apple II name was rendered in a variety of creative ways using stylized characters which resembled punctuation symbols on the front lids of the computers, and most printed material followed this lead. The II and II+ were labeled <nowiki>][ and ][ plus</nowiki>. The II<small>GS</small> and II<small>c</small> Plus were rendered in [[small caps]]. The [[Apple ///]], IIc, and IIe models used slashes: ///, //c and //e. There have been some errors in the Apple II's name due to the numerous variations and forms on the "II".

===Legacy===
Today, [[Apple II emulators|emulators]] for various Apple II models are available to run Apple II software on [[Mac OS X]], [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows]], homebrew enabled [[Nintendo DS]] and other operating systems. Numerous [[disk image]]s of Apple II software are available free over the [[Internet]] for use with these emulators. [[AppleWin]] and [[Multi Emulator Super System|MESS]] are among the best emulators compatible with most Apple II images. The MESS emulator supports recording and playing back of Apple II emulation sessions. The [http://www.homeactionreplay.org/search.php?tourney=36 Home Action Replay Page] (aka HARP) allows Apple II users to archive their favorite play sessions of the Apple II system and its games. However, many emulators cannot run software on copy-protected media, or can run only software employing fairly simple protection schemes, unless it is "[[software cracking|cracked]]" (copy restrictions removed). Breaking protection on software was widely popular in the Apple II's heyday; even Apple itself apparently engaged in the practice<ref>[http://apple2history.org/2010/11/18/even-apple-used-pirate-tools/ Even Apple Used Pirate Tools]</ref> Commercial cracking software such as the popular [[Copy II+]] program were sold in stores with the purpose of creating legitimate back-ups of protected software. Although creating back-ups was legitimate under copyright law of the time, the use of such software today is of questionable legality in the U.S. (see [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]]). For those who prefer to obtain their old software legally, the [[Lost Classics Project]] has the goal of convincing copyright holders of classic Apple II software to officially allow unrestricted free distribution of their software and has "freed" a number of programs.

In addition, an active [[retrocomputing]] community of vintage Apple II collectors and users, continue to restore, maintain and develop hardware and software for daily use of these original computers. Numerous websites and support groups exist for these enthusiasts who engage in the trade and purchase for their collections, increasingly rare parts and systems. Hardly a dead platform, the Apple II has a worldwide network of kindred spirits actively engaged in preserving this otherwise outdated technology and indeed regularly attracts, new younger members who continue to keep the platform alive long after it was discontinued by Apple. There is still a small annual convention, KansasFest, dedicated to the platform.

===Industry impact===
The Apple II series of computers had an enormous impact on the technology industry and on everyday life. The Apple II was the first personal computer many people ever saw, and its price was within the reach of many middle-class families. By the end of 1980 Apple had already sold over 100,000 Apple IIs<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Sy8vejqbcocC&pg=RA1-PA19&lpg=RA1-PA19&dq=apple+IIe+educational+sales&source=bl&ots=lHKYZ64tP_&sig=oYJX4lOGlVH5_uUzP92z-CAyGLE&hl=en&ei=liX4TPvmEJGcsQPj_pSlAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CFsQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Essentials of Strategic Management By Charles Hill, Gareth Jones}}</ref> Its popularity bootstrapped the entire [[Personal computer game|computer game]] and [[educational software]] markets and began the boom in the [[word processor]] and [[computer printer]] markets. The first microcomputer "[[killer app]]" for business was [[VisiCalc]], the earliest [[spreadsheet]], and it ran first on the Apple II. Many businesses bought Apple II's just to run VisiCalc. Apple's success in the home market inspired competitive [[home computer]]s such as the [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]] (1980) and [[Commodore 64]] (1982, with estimated sales between 17 and 25 million units). Through their significantly lower price point, these models introduced the computer to several tens of millions more home users.

The success of the Apple II in business spurred [[IBM]] to create the [[IBM PC]], which was then purchased by middle managers in all lines of business to run spreadsheet and word processing software, at first ported from Apple II versions; later, whole new application software dynasties would be founded on the PC. The popularity of these PCs and their [[IBM PC compatible|clones]] then transformed business again with [[local area network|LAN]] applications such as [[e-mail]] and later Internet applications such as [[Usenet]] and the [[World Wide Web|WWW]].

One valuable lesson from the Apple II was the importance of an open architecture to the success of a computer platform. The first Apple II's shipped with an ''Apple II Reference Manual'' containing a complete schematic of the entire computer's circuitry and a complete source listing of the "Monitor" ROM firmware that served as the machine's [[BIOS]] (later this guide had to be purchased separately, and in the case of the Apple II<small>GS</small>, the full technical documentation ran to several volumes). The Apple II's slots, allowing any peripheral card to take control of the bus and directly access memory, enabled an independent industry of card manufacturers who together created a flood of hardware products that let users build systems that were far more powerful and useful (at a lower cost) than any competing system, most of which were not nearly as expandable and were universally proprietary. Even the game port was unusually powerful and could be used for digital and analog input and output; one hacker ([[Don Lancaster]]) used it to drive a [[LaserWriter]] printer.

Apple decided not to create an open architecture with the initial [[Macintosh]] models, and this is widely seen as having hobbled its success. It wasn't until the advent of the open architecture [[Macintosh II]] that the platform took off. However, the [[IBM PC]] provides an object lesson that success for the platform does not necessarily equate to success for the company that invented it. In the end, the IBM PC's off-the-shelf, open architecture allowed [[IBM PC compatible|clones]] to be manufactured by startup competitors such as [[Compaq]], [[Dell]] and [[Gateway Computers|Gateway]], leading to a [[Pyrrhic victory]] for IBM.
