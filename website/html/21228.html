'''Latrinalia''' is a type of deliberately inscribed marking made on [[latrine]]s: that is, bathrooms or lavatory ([[restroom]]) walls. It can take the form of [[art]], [[drawing]]s, or [[language|word]]s, including [[poetry]] and personal reflections. Other types of Latrinalia include Political commentary as well as Derogatory comments and pictures.  When done without the [[property]] owner's [[consent]], it constitutes [[vandalism]]. Some venues have attempted to curb such vandalism by installing in the restrooms large [[blackboard]]s and providing free [[chalk]]; it is hoped that patrons will avail themselves of the blackboard and chalk rather than applying their latrinalia directly to the walls or toilet stalls.<ref>[http://130.212.44.5/storys01.php?storyid=3407 Golden Gate [X&#93;Press Online | R.I.P.

==Etymology==
The late [[Alan Dundes]], a folklorist at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], coined the term ''latrinalia'' in 1966 to refer to [[graffiti]] found in restrooms.<ref name="Alan_Dundes">{{cite paper | author=[[Alan Dundes|Dundes, Alan]] | title=Here I Sit &mdash; A Study of American Latrinalia | publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]: Kroeber Anthropological Society Papers | date=1966 | url=http://sscl.berkeley.edu/~kas/kas_archives/vol_78/contents/volume_30-39.html}}</ref> Dundes preferred it over the term ''shithouse poetry'', as not all latrinalia is in verse or poetic form.<ref name="Alan_Dundes" />

The word is derived from the [[compound (linguistics)|compounding]] of ''latrine'' (or toilet) and the [[Affix|suffix]] ''-alia'', which signifies a worthless collection of something &mdash; in this case bathroom writings.
