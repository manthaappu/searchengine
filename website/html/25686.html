In [[computational complexity theory]], the [[complexity class]] '''NSPACE(''f''(''n''))''' is the set of [[decision problem]]s that can be solved by a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] using space ''O''(''f''(''n'')), and unlimited time.  It is the non-deterministic counterpart of [[DSPACE]].

Several important complexity classes can be defined in terms of '''NSPACE'''. These include:

* '''[[regular language|REG]]''' = '''DSPACE'''(''O''(1)) = '''NSPACE'''(''O''(1)), where '''REG''' is the class of [[regular language]]s (nondeterminism does not add power in constant space).
* '''[[NL (complexity)|NL]]''' = '''NSPACE'''(''O''(log ''n''))
* '''[[context-sensitive language|CSL]]''' = '''NSPACE'''(''O''(''n'')), where '''CSL''' is the class of [[context-sensitive language]]s.
* '''[[PSPACE]]''' = '''NPSPACE''' = <math>\bigcup_{k\in\mathbb{N}} \mbox{NSPACE}(n^k)</math>
* '''[[EXPSPACE]]''' = '''NEXPSPACE''' = <math>\bigcup_{k\in\mathbb{N}} \mbox{NSPACE}(2^{n^k})</math>

The last two results above follow from [[Savitch's theorem]], which states that for any function ''f''(''n'') ≥ log(''n''),

:'''NSPACE'''(''f''(''n'')) ⊆ '''DSPACE'''(''f''<sup>2</sup>(''n'')).

The [[Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem]] states that '''NSPACE'''(''s''(''n'')) is closed under complement for every sunction {{nowrap|''s''(''n'') ≥ log ''n''.}}

'''NSPACE''' can be related to [[DTIME]] as follows. For any [[space constructible]] function ''s''(''n''),
:<math>\mbox{NSPACE}(s(n)) \subseteq \bigcup_{k \geq 1} \mbox{DTIME}(2^{k \cdot s(n)})</math>
