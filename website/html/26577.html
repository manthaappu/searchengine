<html> <head> <title>Non-smooth mechanics</title></head><body>'''Non-smooth mechanics''' is a modeling approach in [[mechanics]] which does not require the time evolutions of the positions and of the velocities to be [[smooth function]]s anymore. Due to possible impacts, the velocities of the mechanical system are even allowed to undergo jumps at certain time instants in order to fulfill the kinematical restrictions. Consider for example a rigid model of a ball which falls on the ground. Just before the impact between ball and ground, the ball has non-vanishing pre-impact velocity. At the impact time instant, the velocity must jump to a post-impact velocity which is at least zero, as else penetration would occur. Non-smooth mechanical models are often used in [[contact dynamics]].
