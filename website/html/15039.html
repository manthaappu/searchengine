==Film/Television==
* ''[[Akira (film)|Akira]]'' (1988 anime film), the character [[Kei (Akira)|Kei]] ponders the dangerous consequences of awakening the dormant memories that are passed genetically from being to being since the beginning of the universe
* ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' films (1979–2007), [[Xenomorph (Alien)|alien species]] possess genetic memories
* ''[[Altered States]]'' (1978 book and 1980 film), incidents of ''physical regression'' of a scientist (William Hurt as Dr. Edward Jessup) based on a fictitious quality similar to genetic memory, with the difference that the ancient information is encoded not at the cellular level (DNA), but at the atomic level. There is an apparent progression of concepts implied in the film's science: individual person-based memory (neural system, or possibly even whole organism), cell-based memory (genes), and atom-based memory (matter). The implied suggestion seems that memory could be present at every scale of matter, down to the very energy, innate to it—to the universal, primordial "substance" that everything in existence is made of. This way, the film advances the seminal idea behind the concept of genetic memory to a completely new level. The story is loosely based on actual research done by Dr. [[John C. Lilly]].
* [[List of Andromeda episodes|''Andromeda'' television series episode]], "The Devil Take the Hindmost" (2001), a group of genetically engineered humans possesses genetic memory. Tiama, a Hajira, forcibly extracts [[Rev Bem]]'s genetic material and uses it to infest herself with parasitic [[Magog (Andromeda)|Magog]] larvae, resulting in her death. These "Hajira-Magog" inherit the Hajira's genetic memory, retaining Tiama's memories.
* ''[[Ben 10 (TV series)|Ben 10]]'' (2005–2008 animated series) & ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force]]'' (its 2008–2010 successor), Ectonurites such as [[List of Omnitrix aliens#Ghostfreak|Ghostfreak]] have their entire consciousness present even in a few strands of DNA
* ''[[Doctor Who and the Silurians]]'' (1970 ''Doctor Who'' serial), humanity is revealed to possess a racial memory of the (misnamed) [[Silurian (Doctor Who)|Silurian]]s, humanoid reptiles who ruled Earth in prehistoric times. Since the "Silurians" treated primitive humans as at best pets and at worst vermin, the racial memory is one of abject terror, and the sight of a "Silurian" can drive a person mad.
* ''[[The Eye (2002 film)|The Eye]]'' (2002 film), the main character receives paranormal aspects of vision due to her newly transplanted eyes via a similar concept known as [[cellular memory]]

* '' [[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' episode "[[Catspaw (TOS episode)|Catspaw]]" (1968), the idea of racial memory is central to the plot. In the [[Star Trek: Enterprise]] Episode [[Similitude (Star Trek: Enterprise)|"Similitude"]] the human clone Sim possesses genetic memory of Trip's life.
* ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' (1997–2007 television series) & [[Stargate: Continuum]] (its 2008 film successor), the [[Goa'uld]] alien race possess a genetic memory. In the sister series, ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', the whale species ''flagisalis'' also possess a genetic memory.
* ''[[The X-Files]]'' episode "[[Aubrey (The X-Files)|Aubrey]]" (1995) deals with genetic memory. A police detective has visions of crimes committed by a rapist. It turns out she was the daughter of the offspring of one of the rapist's surviving victims and in turn was his biological granddaughter. The urge to kill the surviving woman nearly overtakes her.

==Literature==
* Douglas Adams' ''[[Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', a distant descendant of [[Genghis Khan]] shows attributes of his ancestor: He likes axes, and often has visions of angry men, horses, and war when he becomes angry.
* Douglas Adams' novel ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'', an ancient series of terrible wars known as the [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Krikkit|Krikkit Wars]] manage to affect most civilizations in the universe, including the one which would eventually become Earth. Vague racial memories of the events of the war lead the humans to create the sport [[cricket]], forgetting what they're basing it on. The rest of the universe, noting how shameless it is to create a sport based on such horrible events, chose to shun Earth due to its tactlessness, which is why Earth still remains uncontacted by aliens.
* [[Jean M. Auel]]'s ''[[Earth's Children]]'' series, the primitive Neanderthal people who adopted and raised the Cro-Magnon main character had ancestral memories that they could draw upon at will as adults. Children were born with these ancestral memories and needed only a "reminder" to be able to recall this knowledge. This ability was necessary for communication and survival due to their undeveloped verbal abilities. These ancestral memories were important because they grasped new ideas only with great difficulty. It was far easier to recall what had already been done than to work out new ways.
* ''Stories of [[Dr. Zeus Inc.]]'', by [[Kage Baker]], feature a race of small humanoids who have shared memory, apparently genetic in origin.
* [[Pierre Boulle]]'s novel ''[[Planet of the Apes (novel)|Planet of the Apes]]'', important exposition is given by a primitive human who has been hypnotized into revealing subconscious racial memories.
* [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[Childhood's End]]'' incorporates genetic memory as a plot device.
* [[Frank Herbert|Frank Herbert's]] ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', genetic memory is a central driving concept. A female secret society called the [[Bene Gesserit]] are capable of accessing the memories of all their female ancestors, which gives them powerful advantages. They also run a secret multi-generational [[genetic engineering]] program to produce what they call the [[Kwisatz Haderach]], a male equivalent who can access both male and female past lives. They believe their control of this male will make them the most powerful faction in the universe.
* [[StarCraft (series)#Novelizations|''StarCraft'' novel series]] ''StarCraft: The Dark Templar Saga'' by [[Christie Golden]], the Protoss retain a racial memory of the Xel'Naga abandoning them
* [[Robert Jordan]]'s ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' fantasy book series, wolves are sentient and innately retain the memories of their wolf ancestors. [[Mat Cauthon]], even before gaining memories by passing through the'' [[ter'angreal]] ''in [[Rhuidean]], retained memories of his Manetheren ancestors and was consequently able to sometimes speak the Old Tongue.
* [[Jack London]]'s ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'' deals with a tame dog rediscovering his wolf heritage. As this occurs, he vividly remembers one of his ancestors living alongside a cave man. Interestingly, at the time the book was written, very little was understood about genetics and the idea of genetic memory did not seem to have been introduced. London appears to have been ahead of his time. In a later story, 'Before Adam', a modern man dreams the life of a stone-age youth called Big-Tooth in exquisite detail, chronicling the fears and battles of life without language in the Mid-Pleistocene. He sums up " I, the modern, am incontestably a man; yet I, Big-Tooth, the primitive, am not a man. Somewhere, and by straight line of descent, these two parties to my dual personality were connected."�
* [[Larry Niven]]'s science fiction stories, there are frequent references to memories being stored in [[RNA]], and being transferable from one person to another. This plot element was based on actual research with [[flatworm#Biochemical memory experiments|flatworm]]s, which was later discredited.
* [[Stel Pavlou]]'s novel ''[[Gene (novel)|Gene]]'' (2005) uses genetic memory as the central theme. The debate over [[nature versus nurture]] is embodied in the two central characters, whose revelations of past lives through genetic memory stretch back from the modern day to the [[Trojan War]].
* [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' book, ''[[Sourcery]]'', uses the idea of race memory when [[antihero]] [[Rincewind]] confronts the monsters of the [[Dungeon Dimensions]], where race memory (accessed by a sorcerer, Coin), tells him not to use magic against them as it only makes them stronger.
* [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] explores the idea of a linguistic race memory in ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings|The Lost Road]]'' and ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'', and speculates about the real world in ''[[English and Welsh]]''.
* The [[Superman]] villain [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] was cloned thousands of times by his father, Betron, who was trying to make him into the ultimate being. Every time the baby was killed by the vicious fauna on ancient [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]], Betron harvested the remains to make the next clone more powerful. Doomsday possesses the genetic memories of all of his deaths, causing him to hate all life.
* [[J. G. Ballard]]'s ''[[The Drowned World]]'' deals with a dystopian future in which some people, on the frontiers of earth's remaining inhabitable land, begin to devolve, psychologically, into a more primitive state of consciousness.
* [[Mark Bailey (author)|Mark Bailey]]'s novel ''Saint'' deals with a successful project to use cloned recreated genetic material, from a man believed to have been the historical [[Saint Peter]], to transfer the personality of Saint Peter to a test subject. Memory is also transplanted from the scientist to a monkey.
* [[Sheri S. Tepper]]'s ''The Maragarets'' explores the concept that the lack of a genetic/racial memory is what is fundamentally wrong with humans and that this genetic memory was stolen from humans by another species.
