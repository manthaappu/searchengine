'''Daniel S. Hirschberg''' is a full professor in [[Computer Science]] at [[University of California, Irvine]]. His research interests are in the theory of design and [[analysis of algorithms]].

He obtained his PhD in Computer Science from [[Princeton University]] in 1975.  He supervised the PhD dissertations of [[Lawrence L. Larmore]], [[James H. Hester]], [[Cheng F. Ng]], [[Debra A. (Lelewer) Brum]], [[Lynn M. Stauffer]], [[Steven S. Seiden]], and [[Jonathan Kent Martin]].

He is best known for his 1975 and 1977 work on the [[longest common subsequence problem]]: [[Hirschberg's algorithm]] for this problem and for the related string edit distance problem solves it efficiently in only linear space. He is also known for his work in several other areas, including [[Distributed computing| Distributed Algorithms]]. In [[Nancy Lynch]]'s book ''Distributed Algorithms'' she gives details of an algorithm by Hirschberg and J. B. Sinclair for leader election in a synchronous ring. Lynch named this algorithm the [[HS algorithm]], after its authors.
