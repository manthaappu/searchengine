The '''i-Opener''' was a low-cost [[internet appliance]] produced by Netpliance (now known as [[TippingPoint]]) between the years 1999 and 2002. The hardware, cheaply available, became popular among collectors who modified the appliance to run as a normal [[Personal Computer|PC]]. This made the [[Computer hardware|device]] capable of running [[Personal computer|PC]] [[operating system]]s, such as [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows]].

The original retail price was $99. The actual cost of the device was roughly estimated between $300 and $400. The devices were sold as a [[loss leader]] for monthly Internet service. However, as soon as a [[Hack (technology)|hacking]] method became available on the Internet (in 2000), many customers canceled the monthly service, which eventually made the business model unsustainable. Similar [[business model]]s and failures were also seen with the [[3Com Audrey]] and [[Virgin Webplayer]].

==Hacking==

Ken Segler, an [[engineer]] from [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]], discovered that the i-Opener was simply an x86 compatible PC inside a custom enclosure.  When he removed the back cover of the device, he found a [[Socket 7]] [[CPU socket]] with a 180 MHz [[Integrated Device Technology|IDT]] [[WinChip|WinChip C6]] CPU, a [[SO-DIMM]] socket, an [[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]] plug (which allowed adding a [[hard drive]] and [[CD drive|CD-ROM]], making the device nothing less than a $99 PC with an [[LCD screen]]), and a 16 MB [[SanDisk]] memory chip. However, the pins on the IDE connector were reversed, requiring the making or ordering of special cables and adapters to connect a hard drive to the unit. Attempts by i-Opener to thwart hacking included gluing the [[BIOS]] chip into its socket with [[epoxy]] and modifying its settings (rendering it unable to detect hard drives), limiting the type of CPU one could use to that included with the unit, and even cutting the pins on the IDE [[Electrical connector|connector]].
