[http://www.appro.com/ Appro] was awarded the contract for '''Peloton''' which includes the following machines:

All of the machines run the [[CHAOS (Linux Clustering)|CHAOS]] variant of [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] and the [[Moab Cluster Suite|Moab]] resource management system.  Under the project management of John Lee, the team at Synnex, Voltaire, Supermicro and other suppliers, the scientists were able to dramatically reduce the amount of time it took to go from starting the cluster build to actually having hardware here at Livermore in production. In particular, it went from having 4 SUs on the floor on a Thursday, to bring 2 more SUs in for that final cluster and by Saturday, had all of them wired up, burned in, and running Linpack.
