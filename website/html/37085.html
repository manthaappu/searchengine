'''Terry Craig (T.C.) Shannon''' (August 16, 1952 – May 26, 2005) was an information technology consultant, journalist and author. For over 30 years, he was involved in implementing [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]], [[VAX]], and [[DEC Alpha|Alpha computers]] with their respective [[operating systems]] [[RSX-11|RSX]], VAX/VMS; and [[OpenVMS]] & [[Windows NT]].  He was a respected journalist and analyst, paying particular attention to HP/Compaq and the [[high-performance computing]] space, writing a series of newsletters.

He has been credited with assigning [[Intel Corporation]] the nickname "[[Chipzilla]]".<ref name="chipzilla">{{cite web | url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/1999/03/15/chipzilla_becomes_gorgonzilla/ | title=Chipzilla becomes Gorgonzilla | publisher=The Register | date=1999-03-15 | accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref>

Terry Shannon participated and spoke at meetings of [[DECUS]] (the Digital Equipment Corporation Users Society), the international users group of [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]], currently known as [[Encompass]].  He also spoke as an authority at other IT and HPC conferences, and was quoted by other authors as an authority on the subject.

==Early life==
Terry C. Shannon was born in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[New York]], [[USA]].<ref name="bio">[http://www.shannonknowshpc.com/pages.php?page=About About Terry Shannon]</ref>  At the age of 17 he dropped out of high school and enlisted in the [[US Army]] in 1969.<ref name="Graham">[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/36/Tcsboston.pdf Graham, Lamar B. (1992) The Nerd Who Came In from the Cold, Boston Magazine, February 1992, 52-55, 90-91.]</ref> 

He served as a [[spook]] in [[Vietnam]] at a Radio Reconnaissance Field Station (i.e., the 330th RRFS) with the 509th Radio Research Group of the [[Army Security Agency]] (ASA), a branch of the [[National Security Agency]] (see NSA and/or [[SIGINT]] for explanation).<ref name="spooks">[http://www.oldspooksandspies.org/OSS_Memorial/oss_memorial.htm Old Spooks and Spies]</ref>. During his two years (1970-1972) of [[Vietnam War]] service,<ref name="Graham"/> Shannon was a [[computer communications]] and [[traffic analysis]] specialist. Using his training in cryptology and signal-intelligence, his job was to triangulate North Vietnamese radio signals, request an [[airstrike]], and then return to the original frequency and listen for the enemy channel to "go off the air."<ref name="Graham"/>
  
He was separated from the Army with an [[honorable discharge]] in 1972. After earning his [[GED]], Shannon received his Bachelors degree from [[SUNY Empire State College]]. He was awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]], about thirty years after separation, for his service in the [[Vietnam War]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Writing career==
In May 1983, Shannon became self-employed as a writer. He published his first brief article in the May 1983 issue of ''DEC Professional''.  About two years later, in September 1985, Shannon began working as a contributor for ''Digital Review''.  During his tenure with ''Digital Review'', Shannon began using the pseudonym "Charlie Matco".<ref name="bio"/>  

While Shannon also frequently wrote under the pseudonyms "Digital Dog" and "the notorious Belgian hacker Cedric Zool,"<ref name="Cedric Zool">[http://www.vmsone.com/~opcom/defcon9.htm Defcon meets Cedric Zool]</ref> Charlie Matco was by far his best known ''nom de plume''.<ref name="Graham"/><ref name="Matco1">[http://www.techiegroups.com/archive/index.php/t-57293.html Charlie Matco as an alias]</ref><ref name="Matco2">[http://www.spyderbyte.com/ Alias Charlie Matco]</ref>  Under the "Charlie Matco" byline, Terry Shannon combined a humorous writing style with erudite and timely prognostications about IT industry trends, product releases, and major business transactions, often well in advance of the public release of such information, in the "Rumor Roundup" feature at the end of each issue of ''Digital Review'' magazine.  This information was obtained as a result of Shannon's well-polished skills at schmoozing his vast network of friends and colleagues in the IT industry, and of astutely combining information they provided.<ref name="Graham"/>

Shannon's use of the "Charlie Matco" nom de plume is said to have originated when, after drinking with friends in Massachusetts, Shannon walked out of a bar and saw a [[Matco Tools]] truck at a service station across the street.{{fact|date=March 2007}}

"Charlie Matco" was usually depicted as a cartoonish, "private eye" sort of figure, after the fashion of [[Nick Danger (fictional character)|Nick Danger]], but without any facial features (i.e., just a fedora, a trenchcoat, and a cigarette in one hand).<ref name="Graham"/>  That logo, which appeared next to the "Charlie Matco" byline on every "Rumor Roundup" article, was also depicted on the coffee mug, which Shannon would send to anyone who (intentionally or otherwise) provided useful information. According to Jeffrey Steinberg, former Technical Editor of ''Digital Review'', the signature on the mug was in the handwriting of Deborah McDonald, the publication's managing edtior at the time. In fact, a "Charlie Matco" mug now lives in the [[Computer History Museum]].<ref name="Mug">[http://www.computerhistory.org/events/decworld/donation/ Charlie Matco mug donated to the Computer History Museum]</ref>

Over the next two decades, Shannon wrote about trends in the IT industry.  An advocate of the VMS operating system, he wrote the first version of the [[OpenVMS|VMS]] user guide, ''Introduction to VAX/VMS'' through Professional Press in May 1985 (ISBN 096147291X).  This ran for five editions. According to those associated with its original publisher, Professional Press, the first edition of the book sold more than 100,000 copies.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The latest (5th) edition was called ''Introduction to OpenVMS'' (ISBN 1878956612).  It is required reading for some Computer Science college courses.<ref name="Required Reading">[http://web.archive.org/web/20051127212030/http://www.bemidjistate.edu/bsucatalog/CS/Courses.html BSU CS required reading][http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/breutzma/CS240/index.html Watrburg CS240 required reading]</ref>

Shannon began to publish a newsletter in 1994, ''Shannon Knows DEC'', which eventually became ''Shannon Knows Compaq'', after the firm's acquisition, and then ''Shannon Knows HPC''.  His insider knowledge constantly frustrated those he wrote about, and HP pursued a love/hate relationship, occasionally citing him in [http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2002pmc/pr2002022002.html?jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN press releases].  The newsletter ran until his death in 2005.

==Analysis and citations==
As a well-known expert in the field, Shannon was also widely quoted in the independent trade press, such as in ''[[The Register]]''<ref name="chipzilla"/><ref> [http://www.theregister.co.uk/1999/03/17/shannon_declares_chipzilla_open_source/ Shannon declares Chipzilla Open Source word]</ref> as well as in ''[[Computerworld]]'',<ref name="One Year Later">{{cite web | url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;709804404;fp;;fpid;;pf;1 | title=Compaq, One Year Later | publisher=Computerworld | date=2000-03-04 | accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref><ref name="Silicon roadmaps">{{cite web | url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;1038074087 | title=Processors: Silicon roadmaps to cheaper chips | publisher=Computerworld | date=2003-07-14 | accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref> TechWeb<ref name="techweb">{{cite web | url=http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB20040120S0004 | title=VMS's Stability Prompts Move To Itanium | publisher=TechWeb | date=2004-01-20 | accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref> ITNews,<ref name="ITNews">{{cite web | url=http://www.itnews.com.au/newsstory.aspx?CIaNID=14077 | title=HP could use Opteron in ProLiant servers | publisher=ITNews | date=2004-01-30 | accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref>, and [[Cnet]]<ref name="Cnet 1">{{cite web | url=http://news.com.com/HP-Compaq+merger+Worth+the+wait/2100-1001_3-956202.html | title=HP-Compaq merger — worth the wait? | publisher=Cnet | date=2002-09-02 | accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref><ref name="Cnet 2">{{cite web | url=http://news.com.com/Compaq+finds+new+clients+for+luxury+servers/2100-1001_3-935816.html | title=Compaq finds new clients for luxury servers | publisher=CNet | date=2001-05-10 | accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref>

Shannon played an important role in the publishing industry competition between ''[[Ziff-Davis]]'' and ''[[International Data Group]]'', the two largest technology publishing firms of the 1980s.  During his tenure at Ziff's ''Digital Review'' semi-monthly, Shannon reported on unannounced products from DEC and other companies; this provided important content for ''Digital Review'' in its competitive battle with ''Digital News,'' a competition that reflected the larger rivalry between the publications' parent companies.<ref> {{cite journal|title=The war among the Digitals: Bitter competition reflects growing rivalry between Ziff, McGovern empires|journal=Boston Globe|date=1985-05-17|first=|last=|coauthors=|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=|format=|accessdate=}}</ref>

Shannon's reporting on the minicomputer industry included extensive analysis of the inroads made by IBM's AS/400 line of minicomputers against Digital's VAX line.  The competition among minicomputer vendors would prove to be a turning point in Shannon's career, as eventual mergers led to his DEC newsletter shifting its focus to Compaq (later, HP-Compaq).<ref> {{cite journal|title=Digital turns up the power in battle with IBM|journal=Boston Globe|date=1989-04-11|first=|last=|coauthors=|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=|format=|accessdate=}}</ref>

During the early 1990s, much of Shannon's focus was on DEC's development of the Alpha chip, a processor intended to replace its aging VAX CPU line.  As DEC prepared the Alpha chip for release, Shannon was widely used as a source of advance information on the new processor.<ref> {{cite journal|title=Digital ready to unwrap Alpha: Ailing computer maker will introduce new line after a year of "fantasy talk." |journal=Boston Globe|date=1992-11-09|first=|last=|coauthors=|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=|format=|accessdate=}}</ref>

Shannon also reported extensively on Digital executives and their comings and goings within the company.  Shannon analyzed the controversial departure of Robert Glorioso from DEC in terms of the struggle for control of the company as it began to founder in the 1990s.<ref> {{cite journal|title=Software executive quits Digital in power struggle|journal=Boston Globe|date=1992-11-12|first=|last=|coauthors=|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=|format=|accessdate=}}</ref>

==User groups==
Shannon was active in HPC user groups and the DEC community, including [[DECUS]] and [[Encompass]]. He served on the [[Encompass]] Board of Directors.  He gave frequent lectures and seminars.<ref name="Decus">[http://decus.tacticom.com/Presenter.html?Presenter=025309142485 DECUS bio of Shannon]</ref>,<ref name="Decus 2">[http://www.decus.be/wiki/index.php/Terry_Shannon HP Interex Belux]</ref> including the 2005 Keynote address.<ref name="Encompass1">[http://www.shannonknowshpc.com/archives/Encompass_Canada_2005_Keynote.pdf Encompass 2005 Keynote address (PDF)]</ref>
