Some issues when scanning to keep an eye out for:

* Make sure that Retina gets good "Registry" key access.  If a message stating, "Registry access not granted" appears, this means that you are not getting a thorough scan.
* Always have the machine that Retina is scanning on in the domain
* Use only "Domain Admin" credentials to scan for a successful scan
* At least 95% of machines should be successfully scanned in order to get good results
