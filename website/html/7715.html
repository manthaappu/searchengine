==About SenSys==

{{Advert|section|date=February 2009}}

'''[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] SenSys''' is a highly selective, single-track forum for the presentation of research results on [[Computer Systems|systems]] issues in the area of [[embedded networked sensors]]. This [[:wikt:conference|conference]] provides an ideal venue to address the [[research]] challenges facing the [[design]], [[System deployment|deployment]], use, and fundamental limits of these systems. [[Sensor networks]] require contributions from many fields, from [[wireless communication]] and [[Computer networking|networking]], [[embedded systems]] and [[Computer hardware|hardware]], [[distributed systems]], [[data management]], and [[Application software|applications]], so SenSys welcomes cross-disciplinary work.

==Ranking==
Although there is no official ranking of [[academic conference]]s on [[wireless sensor networks]], SenSys is widely regarded by researchers as one of the two (along with [[IPSN]]) most [[prestigious]] conferences focusing on [[sensor network]] research. SenSys focuses more on system issues while [[IPSN]] on  algorithmic and theoretical considerations. The [[acceptance rate]] for 2006 was 19.7% (24 out of 122 papers accepted for publication).
