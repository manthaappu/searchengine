'''BLIS/COBOL''' was an [[operating system]] that, unusually, was written in [[COBOL]]. It is the only such system to gain reasonably wide acceptance. It was optimised to [[compile]] business application written in COBOL.  BLIS was available on a range of [[Data General Nova]] and [[Data General Eclipse]] [[16-bit]] [[minicomputer]]s.

Originally, most operating systems were written in [[assembly language]] for a particular [[central processing unit|processor]] or family of processors.  Non-assembler operating systems were comparatively slow, but were easier for revision and repair.  One of the reasons for the [[C (programming language)|C]] programming language's low-level features, which resemble assembly language in some ways, is an early intent to use it for writing operating systems.  Similar goals led to [[IBM]]'s development of [[IBM PL/S|PL/S]].  The high-level nature of COBOL, which created some problems for operating system development, was partially addressed in BLIS, since it was deliberately optimised for COBOL.
