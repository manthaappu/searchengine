'''Ernst Tugendhat''' (born March 8, 1930) is a [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]]-born [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]]. He was born in [[Brno]], [[Czechoslovakia]], to a wealthy [[Jew]]ish family that commissioned [[Mies van der Rohe]] with the [[Villa Tugendhat]] in Brno. In 1938 the family emigrated from Czechoslovakia to [[St. Gallen]], [[Switzerland]], and in 1941 travelled on to settle in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]].

Tugendhat studied classics at [[Stanford]] from 1944 to 1949, and went on to do graduate work in philosophy and classics at the [[University of Freiburg]], receiving his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] with a work on [[Aristotle]] in 1956.  During the years 1956−1958 he did [[postdoctoral researcher|post-doctoral research]] at the [[University of Münster]]. From then until 1964 he was an assistant professor in the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Tübingen]], where, after spending 1965 lecturing at the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor]], he gained his [[Habilitation]] in 1966 analyzing the concept of [[truth]] in [[Husserl]] and [[Heidegger]].

Tugendhat became a professor at the [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg|University of Heidelberg]] (1966−1975), but as a protest against the situation at German universities in the 1970s he gave up his position and relocated to [[Starnberg]], where [[Jürgen Habermas]] was at the time.  In 1980 he moved to [[Berlin]], becoming, like his friend Michael Theunissen, a Professor of Philosophy at the [[Free University of Berlin]].  He was invited to give the 1988&ndash;89 [[John Locke lectures]] at the [[University of Oxford]], but had to withdraw because of ill health.

Tugendhat retired in 1992, but was a visiting professor in philosophy at the [[Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile]], [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] (1992−1996), a researcher at the [[Institute for Human Sciences]], [[Vienna]] (1996), and visiting professor at [[Charles University]] in Prague, [[Czech Republic]] (1997−1998).
