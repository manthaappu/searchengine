==History==
The Open Humanities Press (OHP) is a scholar-led publishing initiative founded by Paul Ashton (Australia), Gary Hall (UK), Sigi Jöttkandt (New Zealand) and David Ottina (US). Its aim is to raise faculty awareness of open access publishing in the humanities and to provide promotional and technical support to open access journals that have been invited by OHP's editorial oversight group to join the collective.

OHP launched in May 2008 with 7 open access journals and was named a [http://www.plos.org/cms/comment/reply/219/ "beacon of hope"] by the [[Public Library of Science]]. In August, 2009 OHP announced it will begin publishing open access book series edited by senior members of OHP's board. The first 5 series are:
