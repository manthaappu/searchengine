'''''Creatures 3''''' is the third game in the ''[[Creatures (artificial life program)|Creatures]]'' [[artificial life|a-life]] game series made by [[Creature Labs]]. In this installment, the [[Shee (Creatures)|Shee]] have left Albia in a spaceship, the Shee Ark, to search for a more spherical world. The Ark was abandoned by the Shee because a meteor hit the ship, but the infrastructure still remains in working order.

There are 6 main "[[Closed ecological system|metarooms]]" on the ship; the Norn Terranium, Grendel Jungle, Ettin Desert, Marine area, Bridge, and Engineering Room. The [[Norn]] Terranium is where you can safely hatch and raise your norns. The Grendel Jungle is where the [[Grendel]] mother (egg-layer) is, and it is well suited for Grendels. The Ettin Desert is where the [[Ettin]] mother is; it is a dry, harsh environment for all creatures. The Bridge is where you will find the most gadgets, and also the most Ettins. The Engineering Room is where the Agent Creator is, with which you can create objects for your world.

Grendels are now vicious, unlike the original ''Creatures'' Grendels; these Grendels enjoy hunting down, and then killing norns. The Ettins, which first appeared in ''[[Creatures 2]]'', love gathering gadgets and taking them back to the Ettin Desert.

Creatures 3 is free on the Spanish PlayStation Network.
