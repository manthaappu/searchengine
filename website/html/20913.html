'''LART''' is a [[single-board computer]] (SBC) designed by staff of the [[Delft University of Technology|University of Delft/Netherlands]].

The creators advertise complete layout by means of [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] files, [[software]] and [[Linux kernel|kernel]] patches for [[Linux]]. The software is released under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), and the [[Hardware design]] is released under the [[MIT License]]. TUDelft built some boards, some people built their own LARTs (the board can be made at home by a competent engineer), and a batch was produced and sold in 2002-2003 by [[Aleph One Ltd]] and [[Remote 12]], in an early demonstration of the viability of the [[Open Hardware]] concept (manufacture can be performed by groups other than the designers and copyright holders).

The standard LART configuration featured 32 MB DRAM and 4 MB Flash ROM. Most interesting is the low-power consumption of less than 1 W while providing ~ 250 MIPS, making it an ideal system for embedded computing.

The project also spun off an Open Hardware parallel port [[JTAG]] interface board and the [[Binary large object|Blob]] [[bootloader]].
