<html> <head> <title>Computer graphics lighting</title></head><body>'''Computer graphics lighting''' refers to the [[simulation]] of [[light]] in [[computer graphics]]. This simulation can either be extremely accurate, as is the case in an [[Application software|application]] like ''[[Radiance]]'' which attempts to track the energy flow of light interacting with materials using [[radiosity]] computational techniques. Alternatively, the simulation can simply be inspired by [[light physics]], as is the case with [[non-photorealistic rendering]]. In both cases, a [[shading model]] is used to describe how surfaces respond to light. Between these two extremes, there are many different [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] approaches which can be employed to achieve almost any desired visual result.

'''Computer graphics lighting''' can also refer to the [[employment|job]] of [[lighting]] in [[computer animation]]. A computer graphics lighter will employ many of the same methods a [[live-action]] [[lighting designer]] or [[gaffer (motion picture industry)|gaffer]] might employ. However, the computer graphics lighter will work within a computer graphics application.
