==Search Algorithm==
An admissible heuristic is used to estimate the cost of reaching the goal state in an [[informed search algorithm]]. In order for a heuristic to be admissible to the search problem, the estimated cost must always be lower than or equal to the actual cost of reaching the goal state. The search algorithm uses the admissible heuristic to find an estimated optimal path to the goal state from the current node. 
For example, in [[A* search]] the evaluation function (where <math>n</math> is the current node) is:

<math>f(n)</math> = <math>g(n)</math> + <math>h(n)</math>

where
:<math>f(n)</math> = the evaluation function.
:<math>g(n)</math> = the cost from the start node to the current node
:<math>h(n)</math> = estimated cost from current node to goal.

<math>h(n)</math> is calculated using the heuristic function. With a non-admissible heuristic, the A* algorithm would overlook the optimal solution to a search problem due to an overestimation in <math>f(n)</math>.

==Formulation==

: <math>n</math> is a node
: <math>h</math> is a heuristic
: <math>h(n)</math> is cost indicated by <math>h</math> to reach a goal from <math>n</math>
: <math>C(n)</math> is the actual cost to reach a goal from n

: <math>h</math> is admissible if

:: <math>\forall n, h(n) \leq C(n)</math>

==Construction==
An admissible heuristic can be derived from a relaxed
version of the problem, or by information from pattern databases that store exact solutions to subproblems of the problem, or by using [[Inductive transfer|inductive learning]] methods.

==Notes==
While all [[consistent heuristic]]s are admissible, not all admissible heuristics are consistent.

For tree search problems, if an admissible heuristic is used, the [[A* search algorithm]] will never return a suboptimal goal node.
