'''Adobe Illustrator Artwork''' ('''AI''') is a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[file format]] developed by [[Adobe Systems]] for representing single-page [[vector graphics|vector-based drawings]] in either the [[Encapsulated_PostScript|EPS]] or [[PDF]] formats.  The '''.ai''' [[filename extension]] is used by [[Adobe Illustrator]].

Early versions of the AI file format are true [[Encapsulated PostScript|EPS]] files with a restricted, compact syntax, with additional semantics represented by Illustrator-specific [[Document Structuring Conventions|DSC comments]] that conform to DSC's Open Structuring Conventions. These files are identical to their corresponding Illustrator EPS counterparts, but with the EPS procsets ([[library (computing)|procedure sets]]) omitted from the file and instead externally referenced using %%Include [[directive]]s.

{{Expert-subject||paragraph (below)|talk=What is the PGF that AI is supposed to be based on?}}
Recent versions of the AI file format, including the PDF-based formats and recent EPS formats, are based on a native format called [[Progressive Graphics File|PGF]] that is unrelated to both EPS and PDF. PDF compatibility is achieved not by extending the PDF format, but by embedding a complete copy of the native [[Progressive Graphics File|PGF]] data within the PDF file. The same kind of “dual path” approach is also used when recent versions of Illustrator are saving EPS-compatible files.

==Programs that support AI files==
Aside from Adobe Illustrator, the following applications can edit .ai files:
*[[CorelDRAW]] (another proprietary program) can natively edit this file format with some limitations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://corel.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/762365/related/1 |title=CorelDRAW - Supported file formats : Adobe Illustrator (AI) |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref><ref name="x3formats">{{cite web |url=http://corel.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/759188/~/coreldraw%E2%AE-graphics-suite-x3-supported-file-formats |title=CorelDRAW® Graphics Suite X3 Supported File Formats |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref>
*[[Corel Paint Shop Pro]] (another proprietary program) can natively edit this file format.
*[[Ghostscript]] (another GPL-licensed program) can convert AI postscript files into various formats, and also allows programs that use Ghostscript such as [[GIMP]] to import AI files.
*[[Inkscape]] (a free, GPL-licensed program) can import the old Postscript-based Adobe Illustrator format (up to AI ver.8) and AI files based on PDF (AI 9.0 and above).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Current_PDF_Support#Current_Adobe_Illustrator_support |title=Inkscape - Current Adobe Illustrator support |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/FAQ#What_formats_can_Inkscape_import.2Fexport.3F |title=Inkscape - What formats can Inkscape import/export?  |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref>
*[[Skencil]] (another GPL-licensed program) also claims to have some AI support.
*[[sK1 (program)|sK1]] (a free, GPL-licensed vector graphics editor) supports PostScript-based AI files up to AI ver. 9.<ref name="uniconvertor">{{cite web |url=http://sk1project.org/modules.php?name=Products&product=uniconvertor |title=sK1 - UniConvertor - universal vector graphics translator |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref>
*[[UniConvertor]] (a free, GPL-licensed vector graphics translator) supports PostScript-based AI files up to AI ver. 9.<ref name="uniconvertor" />
*[[Xara Xtreme]] has support for the format that is described as "working". Xara Xtreme for Linux has similar support.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xaraxtreme.org/Developers/what-can-xara-xtreme-for-linux-do-now.html  |title=What can Xara Xtreme for Linux do now? |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref>
*[[XnView]], a freeware graphics format converter, claims to be able to read AI file formats<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xnview.com/en/formats.html |title=XnView  - supported formats |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref>, if the AI file was saved with the PDF compatibility option. It does not support all AI subformats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsgroup.xnview.com/viewtopic.php?t=1228 |title=XnView - How to display vector formats like PDF, AI,...? GhostScript! |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref>
*[[FlexiSign]] (Vector Program used in Signmaking) Can read AI files.
*[[EnRoute]] (Vector program for routers) Can read AI files.
Viewers:
* [[Adobe Reader]] can open .ai files for viewing if they are saved with the PDF compatibility option
* [[Preview (software)|Preview]] can view .ai files
