<html> <head> <title>ALCOR</title></head><body>'''ALCOR''' is an early computer language definition created by the '''ALCOR Group''', a consortium of universitites, research institutions and manufacturers in Europe and the USA which was founded in 1959 and which had 60 members in 1966. The group had the aim of a common [[compiler]] specification for a subset of [[ALGOL 60]] after the ALGOL meeting in Copenhagen in 1958.  ALCOR is an acronym, from '''AL'''GOL '''Co'''nverte'''r'''.

In Europe, a high level machine architecture for [[ALGOL 60]] was devised which was emulated on various real computers, among them the Siemens 2002 and the [[IBM 7090]]. An ALGOL manual was published which provided a detailed introduction of all features of the language with many program snippets, and four appendixes:{{SpecialChars
| alt        = Decimal Exponent Symbol
| link       = http://mailcom.com/unicode/DecimalExponent.ttf
| special    = Unicode 5.2 "[http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2300.pdf Miscellaneous Technical]" characters
| fix        = Unicode#External_links
| characters = something like "<sub>10</sub>" ([http://mailcom.com/unicode/DecimalExponent.ttf Decimal Exponent Symbol] U+23E8)
}}
# Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60 
# Report on Subset ALGOL 60 (IFIP)
# Report on Input-Output Procedures for ALGOL 60
# an early "standard" character set for representing [[ALGOL 60]] code on paper and paper tape. 
::This character set included the unusual "&#x16ed;" <!-- "᛭" --> ([http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/16ed/index.htm iron/runic cross]) character for multiplication and the "⏨" ([http://mailcom.com/unicode/DecimalExponent.ttf Decimal Exponent Symbol]) for floating point notation.  <!-- lower 10 has no [[unicode]] 5.1 equivalent -->
