'''ALGOL 60''' (short for '''ALGO'''rithmic '''L'''anguage 1960) The name [[ALGOL]] of the family is sometimes given in mixed case ([http://www.masswerk.at/algol60/report.htm ''Algol 60'']), and sometimes in all uppercase ([http://burks.brighton.ac.uk/burks/language/other/a68rr/rrtoc.htm ''ALGOL 68'']). Gave rise to many other programming languages, including [[BCPL]], [[B (programming language)|B]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[Simula]], [[C (programming language)|C]], and many others. [[ALGOL 58]] introduced code blocks and the <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> pairs for delimiting them.  ALGOL 60 was the first language implementing [[nested function]] definitions with [[lexical scope]]. 

[[Niklaus Wirth]] based his own [[ALGOL W]] on ALGOL 60 before moving to develop [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. Algol-W was intended to be the next generation ALGOL but the [[ALGOL 68]] committee decided on a design that was more complex and advanced rather than a cleaned simplified ALGOL 60. The official ALGOL versions are named after the year they were first published.

Note: [[ALGOL 68]] is substantially different from Algol 60 but was not well received so that in general "Algol" means dialects of Algol 60.

==Standardization==
ALGOL 60 - with [[COBOL]] - were the first languages to seek standardization.
* ISO 1538:1984, Programming language Algol 60 (now withdrawn)
* ISO TR 1672:1977, Algol 60 Hardware Representation (now withdrawn)

==History==
ALGOL 60 was used mostly by research computer scientists in the United States and in Europe. Its use in commercial applications was hindered by the absence of standard input/output facilities in its description and the lack of interest in the language by large computer vendors. ALGOL 60 did however become the standard for the publication of algorithms and had a profound effect on future language development.

[[John Backus]] developed the [[Backus–Naur Form|Backus normal form]] method of describing programming languages specifically for ALGOL 58. It was revised and expanded by [[Peter Naur]] for ALGOL 60, and at [[Donald Knuth]]'s suggestion renamed [[Backus–Naur Form]].<ref>Knuth, Donald E. (1964) Backus Normal Form vs Backus Naur Form. Communications of the ACM 7(12):735-736</ref>

Peter Naur: "As editor of the ALGOL Bulletin I was drawn into the international discussions of the language and was selected to be member of the European language design group in November 1959. In this capacity I was the editor of the ALGOL 60 report, produced as the result of the ALGOL 60 meeting in Paris in January 1960."<ref name="naur_acm">[http://awards.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1024454&srt=all&aw=140&ao=AMTURING&yr=2005 ACM Award Citation / Peter Naur], 2005</ref>

The following people attended the meeting in Paris (from January 1 to 16):
* [[Friedrich L. Bauer]], [[Peter Naur]], [[Heinz Rutishauser]], [[Klaus Samelson]], [[Bernard Vauquois]], [[Adriaan van Wijngaarden]], and [[Michael Woodger]] (from Europe)
* [[John Backus|John W. Backus]], [[Julien Green (computer scientist)|Julien Green]], [[Charles Katz]], [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]], [[Alan Perlis|Alan J. Perlis]], and [[Joseph Henry Wegstein]] (from the USA).
Alan Perlis gave a vivid description of the meeting: "The meetings were exhausting, interminable, and exhilarating. One became aggravated when one's good ideas were discarded along with the bad ones of others. Nevertheless, diligence persisted during the entire period. The chemistry of the 13 was excellent."

Both John Backus and Peter Naur served on the committee which created ALGOL 60 as did [[Wally Feurzeig]], who later created [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]].

ALGOL 60 inspired many languages that followed it. [[C. A. R. Hoare]] remarked: "Here is a language so far ahead of its time that it was not only an improvement on its predecessors but also on nearly all its successors."<ref>[http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~bchandra/courses/papers/Hoare_Hints.pdf "Hints on Programming Language Design"], C.A.R. Hoare, December 1973. Page 27. (This statement is sometimes erroneously attributed to [[Edsger W. Dijkstra]], also involved in implementing the first ALGOL 60 [[compiler]].)</ref>  The [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] programming language, a variant of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] that adopted the block structure and lexical scope of ALGOL, also adopted the wording "Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme" for its standards documents in homage to ALGOL.<ref name="r3rs">{{cite web

The Burroughs dialects included special Bootstrapping dialects such as [[ESPOL]] and [[NEWP]].

==Properties==
ALGOL 60 as officially defined had no I/O facilities; implementations defined their own in ways that were rarely compatible with each other. In contrast, ALGOL 68 offered an extensive library of ''transput'' (ALGOL 68 parlance for Input/Output) facilities.

ALGOL 60 allowed for two [[evaluation strategy|evaluation strategies]] for [[Parameter (computer science)|parameter]] passing: the common call-by-value, and call-by-name. Call-by-name had certain limitations in contrast to call-by-reference, making it an undesirable feature in imperative language design. For example, it is impossible in ALGOL 60 to develop a procedure that will swap the values of two parameters if the actual parameters that are passed in are an integer variable and an array that is indexed by that same integer variable.<ref>

However, call-by-name is still beloved of ALGOL implementors for the interesting "[[thunk]]s" that are used to implement it. [[Donald Knuth]] devised the "[[man or boy test]]" to separate compilers that correctly implemented "recursion and non-local references." This test contains an example of call-by-name.

==Examples and portability issues==
===Code sample comparisons===
====ALGOL 60====
(The way the bold text has to be written depends on the implementation, e.g. 'INTEGER' (including the quotation marks) for '''integer'''; this is known as [[stropping (syntax)|stropping]].)

 '''procedure''' Absmax(a) Size:(n, m) Result:(y) Subscripts:(i, k);
     '''value''' n, m; '''array''' a; '''integer''' n, m, i, k; '''real''' y;
 '''comment''' The absolute greatest element of the matrix a, of size n by m 
 is transferred to y, and the subscripts of this element to i and k;
 '''begin''' '''integer''' p, q;
     y := 0; i := k := 1;
     '''for''' p:=1 '''step''' 1 '''until''' n '''do'''
     '''for''' q:=1 '''step''' 1 '''until''' m '''do'''
         '''if''' abs(a[p, q]) > y '''then'''
             '''begin''' y := abs(a[p, q]);
             i := p; k := q
             '''end'''
 '''end''' Absmax

Here's an example of how to produce a table using Elliott 803 ALGOL.<ref>[http://www.billp.org/ccs/A104/ "803 ALGOL"], the manual for Elliott 803 ALGOL</ref>

  FLOATING POINT ALGOL TEST'
  BEGIN REAL A,B,C,D'
 
  READ D'
 
  FOR A:= 0.0 STEP D UNTIL 6.3 DO
  BEGIN
    PRINT PUNCH(3),££L??'
    B := SIN(A)'
    C := COS(A)'
    PRINT PUNCH(3),SAMELINE,ALIGNED(1,6),A,B,C'
  END'
  END'

PUNCH(3) sends output to the teleprinter rather than the tape punch.<br>
SAMELINE suppresses the carriage return + line feed normally printed between arguments.<br>
ALIGNED(1,6) controls the format of the output with 1 digit before and 6 after the decimal point

====ALGOL 60 family====
Since ALGOL 60 had no I/O facilities, there is no portable [[hello world program]] in ALGOL.  The following program could (and still will) compile and run on an ALGOL implementation for a Unisys A-Series mainframe, and is a straightforward simplification of code taken from [http://www.engin.umd.umich.edu/CIS/course.des/cis400/index.html The Language Guide] at the [[University of Michigan]]-Dearborn Computer and Information
Science Department [http://www.engin.umd.umich.edu/CIS/course.des/cis400/algol/hworld.html Hello world! ALGOL Example Program page].

 BEGIN
   FILE F(KIND=REMOTE);
   EBCDIC ARRAY E[0:11];
   REPLACE E BY "HELLO WORLD!";
   WRITE(F, *, E);
 END.

A simpler program using an inline format:

 BEGIN
   FILE F(KIND=REMOTE);
   WRITE(F, <"HELLO WORLD!">);
 END.

An even simpler program using the Display statement:

 BEGIN DISPLAY("HELLO WORLD!") END.

An alternative example, using Elliott Algol I/O is as follows.  Elliott Algol used different characters for "open-string-quote" and "close-string-quote", represented here by ‘ and ’.

  '''program''' HiFolks;
  '''begin'''
     '''print''' ‘Hello world’;
  '''end''';

Here's a version for the Elliott 803 Algol (A104) The standard Elliott 803 used 5 hole paper tape and thus only had upper case.  The code lacked any quote characters so £ (UK Pound Sign) was used for open quote and ? (Question Mark) for close quote.  Special sequences were placed in double quotes (e.g. ££L?? produced a new line on the teleprinter).   

   HIFOLKS'
   BEGIN
      PRINT £HELLO WORLD£L??'
   END'

The [[ICT 1900]] Algol I/O version allowed input from paper tape or punched card.  Paper tape 'full' mode allowed lower case.  Output was to a line printer.
   'PROGRAM' (HELLO)
   'BEGIN'
      'COMMENT' OPEN QUOTE IS '(', CLOSE IS ')', PRINTABLE SPACE HAS TO
                BE WRITTEN AS % BECAUSE SPACES ARE IGNORED;
      WRITE TEXT('('HELLO%WORLD')');
   'END'
   'FINISH'
