'''Adobe Photoshop''' is a [[Graphics software|graphics editing program]] developed and published by [[Adobe Systems Incorporated]].

Adobe's 2003 "[[Adobe Creative Suite|Creative Suite]]" rebranding led to Adobe Photoshop 8's renaming to Adobe Photoshop CS. Thus, Adobe Photoshop CS5 is the [[Adobe Photoshop release history|12th major release]] of Adobe Photoshop. The CS rebranding also resulted in Adobe offering numerous software packages containing multiple Adobe programs for a reduced price. Adobe Photoshop is released in two editions: '''Adobe Photoshop''', and '''Adobe Photoshop Extended''', with the Extended having extra features available. Adobe Photoshop Extended is included in all of Adobe's Creative Suite offerings except Design Standard, which includes the Adobe Photoshop edition. 

Alongside Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Photoshop Extended, Adobe also publishes [[Adobe Photoshop Elements]] and [[Adobe Photoshop Lightroom]], collectively called "The Adobe Photoshop Family" by Adobe. In 2008, Adobe released [[Adobe Photoshop Express]], a free [[Web application|web-based]] image editing tool to edit photos directly on blogs and social networking sites.

=== Early history ===
In 1987, [[Thomas Knoll]], a PhD student at the [[University of Michigan]], began writing a program on his [[Macintosh Plus]] to display [[grayscale]] images on a monochrome display. This program, called Display, caught the attention of his brother [[John Knoll]], an [[Industrial Light & Magic]] employee, who recommended Thomas turn it into a fully-fledged image editing program. Thomas took a six month break from his studies in 1988 to collaborate with his brother on the program, which had been renamed ImagePro.<ref name="history">{{cite web |url=http://www.photoshopnews.com/feature-stories/photoshop-profile-thomas-john-knoll-10/ |title=Thomas & John Knoll |accessdate=2007-06-15 |author=Schewe, Jeff |year=2000 |work=PhotoshopNews }}</ref> Later that year, Thomas renamed his program Photoshop and worked out a short-term deal with scanner manufacturer Barneyscan to distribute copies of the program with a slide scanner; a "total of about 200 copies of Photoshop were shipped" this way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.storyphoto.com/multimedia/multimedia_photoshop.html |title=From Darkroom to Desktop&mdash;How Photoshop Came to Light |accessdate=2007-06-15 |author=Story, Derrick |date=2000-02-18 |work=Story Photography }}</ref>

During this time, John traveled to [[Silicon Valley]] and gave a demonstration of the program to engineers at [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and Russell Brown, art director at [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]]. Both showings were successful, and Adobe decided to purchase the license to distribute in September 1988.<ref name="history"/> While John worked on [[Plugin|plug-in]]s in California, Thomas remained in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] writing program code. ''Photoshop'' 1.0 was released in 1990 for Macintosh exclusively<!--, and could fit on a single 1.44 MB [[floppy disk]]-->.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://siliconuser.com/?q=node/10  |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011051727/http://siliconuser.com/?q=node/10  |archivedate=2007-10-11  |title=How Adobe's Photoshop Was Born |accessdate=2007-06-15 |author=Hormby, John |date=2007-06-05 |work=Story Photography }}</ref>

== Features ==
{{See|Comparison of raster graphics editors#Features}}

Photoshop has ties with other Adobe software for media editing, animation, and authoring.  The '''.PSD''' (Photoshop Document), Photoshop's native format, stores an image with support for most imaging options available in Photoshop.  These include layers with [[image mask|masks]], [[color spaces]], [[ICC profile]]s, transparency, text, [[alpha channels]] and [[spot color]]s, [[clipping path]]s, and [[duotone]] settings.  This is in contrast to many other file formats (e.g. .EPS or .GIF) that restrict content to provide streamlined, predictable functionality.

Photoshop's popularity means that the .PSD format is widely used, and it is supported to some extent by most competing software.  The .PSD file format can be exported to and from [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[Adobe Premiere Pro]], and [[Adobe After Effects|After Effects]], to make professional standard DVDs and provide non-linear editing and special effects services, such as backgrounds, textures, and so on, for television, film, and the Web. Photoshop is a [[raster graphic|pixel-based]] image editor, unlike programs such as [[Macromedia FreeHand]] (now defunct), [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[Inkscape]] or [[CorelDraw]], which are [[vector graphics|vector-based]] image editors.

Photoshop uses color models [[RGB color model|RGB]], [[Lab color model|lab]], [[CMYK color model|CMYK]], [[grayscale]], binary [[bitmap]], and [[duotone]]. Photoshop has the ability to read and write [[raster graphics|raster]] and [[vector graphics|vector]] image formats such as [[Encapsulated PostScript|.EPS]], [[Portable Network Graphics|.PNG]], [[GIF|.GIF]], [[JPEG|.JPEG]], and [[Adobe Fireworks]].

=== CS3 ===
[[Image:Photoshop CS3 Smart Layers.png|frame|right|Smart Layers display the filter without altering the original image (here on Mac OS X)]]

New productivity features include a streamlined interface, improved Camera RAW support, better control over print options, enhanced [[PDF]] support, and better management with [[Adobe Bridge]]. Editing tools new to CS3 are the Clone Source palette and nondestructive Smart Filters, and other features such as the brightness and contrast adjustment and Vanishing Point module were enhanced.  The Black and White adjustment option improves control over manual grayscale conversions with a dialog box similar to that of Channel Mixer. Compositing is assisted with Photoshop's new Quick Selection and Refine Edge tools and improved [[image stitching]] technology.<ref name="features">{{cite web |url=http://wwwimages.adobe.com/www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/photoshop/pdfs/photoshop_overview.pdf |title=Adobe Photoshop CS3 Product overview |accessdate=2007-06-17  |year=2007 |work=Adobe official site |format=PDF }}</ref>

CS3 Extended contains all features of CS3 plus tools for editing and importing some [[List of file formats#3D graphics|3D graphics file formats]], enhancing video, and comprehensive image analysis tools, utilizing [[MATLAB]] integration and [[Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine|DICOM]] file support.<ref>{{cite web | title = Adobe Photoshop CS3 Extended - Product overview | accessdate = 2007-06-17  | year = 2007 | url =

=== CS4 ===

Photoshop CS4 features a new 3D engine allowing painting directly on 3D models, wrapping 2D images around 3D shapes, converting gradient maps to 3D objects, adding depth to layers and text, getting print-quality output with the new ray-tracing rendering engine. It supports common 3D formats; the new Adjustment and Mask Panels; Content-aware scaling ([[seam carving]]<ref>[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13580_3-10048014-39.html Adobe uses graphics chip for faster Photoshop CS4] - Posted by Stephen Shankland (September 22, 2008) CNET News.</ref>); Fluid Canvas Rotation and File display options.<ref>[http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/photoshopextended/features/?view=topnew features: digital filters, image editing] - Adobe Photoshop CS4 Extended.</ref> On 30 April, Adobe released Photoshop CS4 Extended, which includes all the same features of Adobe Photoshop CS4 with the addition of capabilities for scientific imaging, 3D, and high end film and video users. The successor to Photoshop CS3, [[Adobe Creative Suite 4|Photoshop CS4]] is the first [[64-bit]] Photoshop on consumer computers (only on Windows  &ndash; the OS X version is still 32-bit only.)<ref>{{cite web|last=Haslam |first=Karen |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,144119-c,graphicsmultimedia/article.html |title=Adobe 64-Bit Photoshop Struggle |publisher=PC World |date= |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref>

===CS5===
Photoshop CS5 was launched on April 12, 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cs5launch.adobe.com/ | title=Adobe Creative Suite 5 Launch | publisher=Adobe Systems Incorporated | accessdate=2010-03-24}}</ref> In a video posted on its official [[Facebook]] page, the development team revealed the new technologies under development, including three dimensional brushes and warping tools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/video |title=Niet compatibele browser |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2010-05-29}}</ref>

A version of Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended was used for a Prerelease Beta. A large group of selected Photoshop users were invited to beta test in mid-February 2010.

==Version history==
{{main|Adobe Photoshop release history}}

==Language availabilities==
Photoshop is available in the following languages:

Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish and Ukrainian.<ref name=PhotoshopLanguages>{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/photoshop/languages/ |title=language versions &#124; Adobe Photoshop CS5 |publisher=Adobe.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-29}}</ref>

The Arabic, Greek, and Hebrew versions are available from Winsoft.<ref name=PhotoshopLanguages/>

==Plugins==
{{Main|Photoshop plugin}}

Photoshop functionality can be extended by add-on programs called [[Photoshop plugin]]s which act like mini-editors that modify the image. The most common type are filter plugins that provide various image effects. They are located in the 'Filter' menu. Photoshop plugin API has become a standard, and many other image editors also support Photoshop Plugins.

Adobe Camera Raw (also known as ACR and Camera Raw) is a special plugin, supplied free by Adobe, used primarily to read and process [[Raw image format|raw image files]] so that the resultant images can be processed by Photoshop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/cameraraw.html |title=Digital camera raw file support |publisher=Adobe.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref> It is invoked by attempting to open such a file, rather than from the 'Filter' menu, but like other plugins is listed in the 'Help > About Plug-In' menu (as "Camera Raw"). It can also be opened via the [[Adobe Bridge]] by clicking on any image and selecting 'File > Open in Adobe Camera Raw'.

== Cultural impact ==
''Photoshop'' and derivatives such as ''Photoshopped,'' ''Shopped,'' and ''Shooped'' have become verbs that are sometimes used to refer to images edited by Photoshop,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/2000/08/bc/28photoshop/|title=Photoshop through the Years|author=Macworld Staff}}</ref> or any image manipulating program. "Photoshop" is also used as a noun to refer to image editing programs [[Genericized trademark|in general]]. Such derivatives are discouraged by Adobe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/misc/trade.html#section-4|title=PROPER USE OF THE PHOTOSHOP TRADEMARK}}</ref>
