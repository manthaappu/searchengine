'''AC<sup>0</sup>''' is a [[complexity class]] used in [[circuit complexity]].  It is the smallest class in the [[AC (complexity)|AC]] hierarchy, and consists of all families of circuits of depth O(1) and polynomial size, with unlimited-[[fanin]] [[AND gate]]s and [[OR gate]]s.  (We allow [[NOT gate]]s only at the inputs).  It thus contains [[NC0|NC<sup>0</sup>]], which has only bounded-fanin AND and OR gates.

From a [[descriptive complexity]] viewpoint, [[DLOGTIME]]-[[Uniformity (complexity theory)|uniform]] AC<sup>0</sup> is equal to the descriptive class [[FO (complexity)|FO]]+BIT of all languages describable in first-order logic with the addition of the [[BIT operator]], or alternatively by FO(+, <math>\times</math>), or by Turing machine in the [[LH (complexity)|logarithmic hierarchy]]<ref>*N. Immerman ''Descriptive complexity'' (1999 Springer), page 85.</ref>. 

In 1984 Furst, Saxe, and Sipser showed that calculating the [[parity bit#Parity|parity]] of an input cannot be decided by any AC<sup>0</sup> circuits, even with non-uniformity.

It follows that AC<sup>0</sup> is not equal to [[NC1 (complexity)|NC<sup>1</sup>]], because a family of circuits in the latter class can compute parity.
