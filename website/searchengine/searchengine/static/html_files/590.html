ATI XGP (e'''X'''ternal '''G'''raphics '''P'''latform) is an external graphics solution for [[Laptop|notebook computers]]. The technology was announced on June 4, 2008 on [[Computex]] 2008 trade show, following the announcement of the codenamed ''[[AMD mobile platform#Puma platform|Puma]]'' notebook platform. 
__NOTOC__
==Development==
Originally reported by Hexus.net as a side project to the R600 series graphics cards. Codenamed ''Lasso'' <ref>[http://www.hexus.net/content/item.php?item=7995 Hexus.Net report], retrieved June 16, 2008</ref>, the project is an external graphics solution using desktop video cards, and data is sent via two cables as defined in PCI-E external cabling specification (version 1.0). The project would later fall into [[development hell]] with unknown development status. In June 2008, near Computex 2008, rumours surfaced over the Internet about AMD is preparing an external graphics solution for notebook computers, but using a proprietary connectivity solution instead. The ATI XGP was officially announced on June 4, 2008 during the course of the Computex 2008 exhibition.
