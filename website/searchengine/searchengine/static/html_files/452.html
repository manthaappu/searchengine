The '''ANSI/ISO C Specification Language '''('''ACSL''') is a specification language for [[C program]]s, using Hoare style pre- and postconditions and invariants, that follows the design by contract paradigm. Specifications are written as C annotation comments to the C program, which hence can be compiled with any C compiler.

The current verification tool for ACSL is [[Frama-C]].

== Overview ==

ACSL is a Behavioral Interface Specification Language (BISL). It aims at specifying behavioral properties of C source code. The main inspiration for this language comes from the specification language of the Caduceus tool for deductive verification of behavioral properties of [[C program]]s. The specification language of Caduceus is itself inspired from [[JML]] which aims at similar goals for Java source code.

One difference with [[JML]], is that ACSL aims at static verification and deductive verification whereas [[JML]] aims both at runtime assertion checking and static verification using for instance the [[ESC/Java]] tool.

== Syntax ==

Let us consider the following example for the prototype of a function named <code>incrstar</code>:

 /*@ requires \valid(p);
   @ assigns *p;
   @ ensures *p == \old(*p) + 1;
   @*/
 void incrstar (int *p);

The contract is given by the comment which starts with <code>/*@</code>. Its meaning is as follows:
* the first line is a precondition: it states that function <code>incrstar</code> must be called with a pointer <code>p</code> that points to a safely allocated memory location.
* Second line is a frame clause, stating that function <code>incrstar</code> does not modify any memory location but the one pointed to by <code>p</code>.
* Finally, the <code>ensures</code> clause is a postcondition, which specifies that the value <code>*p</code> is incremented by one.

== Tool support ==

Most of the features of ACSL are supported by [[Frama-C]].
