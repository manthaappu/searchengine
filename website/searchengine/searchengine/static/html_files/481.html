<html> <head> <title>APLX</title></head><body>'''APLX''' is a modern, second generation, [[cross-platform]] [[programming language dialect|dialect]] of the [[APL programming language]]. APLX is targeted at applications such as financial planning, market research, statistics, management information, and various kinds of scientific and engineering work. APLX is based on [[IBM]]'s [[APL (programming language)#APL2|APL2]], but includes a number of extensions. APLX is created by MicroAPL. Version 3 of APLX was released in April and May of 2005. It is available on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], and [[Mac OS]]. Though APLX keeps APL's extended character set, APLX is a bit more verbose, due to the prevalence of system functions with long names and the use of structured-control keywords. The use of explicit loops is a major deviation from earlier versions of APL, as well as other APL derivatives.
