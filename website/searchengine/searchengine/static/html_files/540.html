<html> <head> <title>AS9100</title></head><body>'''AS9100''' is a widely adopted and standardized [[quality management system]] for the [[aerospace]] industry.
It was released in October, 1999, by the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] and the [[European Association of Aerospace Industries]].<ref>[http://www.qualitydigest.com/may02/html/as9100.html Aerospace's AS9100 QMS Standard]</ref><ref>[http://news.thomasnet.com/IMT/archives/2001/10/aerospace_indus.html Aerospace Industry Readies for the AS9100]</ref>

AS9100 replaces the earlier [[AS9000]] and fully incorporates the entirety of the current version of [[ISO 9000]], while adding additional requirements relating to quality and safety.
Major aerospace manufacturers and suppliers worldwide require compliance and/or registration to AS9100 as a condition of doing business with them.<ref>[http://www.afnorindia.com/management-systems-certifications-services/as-9100-aerospace-quality-management-systems/ AS 9100 - Aerospace Quality]</ref><ref>[http://emea.bsi-global.com/Aerospace/Overview/TheHistoryofAS9100.xalter Aerospace AS9100, AS9110, AS9120]</ref>

==History==

Prior to the adoption of an aerospace specific quality standard, various corporations typically used ISO 9000 and their own complementary quality documentation/requirements, such as [[Boeing]]'s D1-9000 or the automotive Q standard.  This created a patchwork of competing requirements that were difficult to enforce and/or comply with.  The major American aerospace manufacturers combined their efforts to create a single, unified quality standard, resulting in AS9000.  Upon the release of AS9000, companies such as Boeing discontinued use of their previous quality supplements in preference to compliance to AS9000.

During the rewrite of ISO 9000 for the  year 2000 release, the AS group worked closely with the ISO organization.  As the year 2000 revision of ISO 9000 incorporated major organizational and philosophical changes, AS9000 underwent a rewrite as well.  It was released as AS9100 to the international aerospace industry at the same time as the new version of ISO 9000. 

AS9100 Revision C was released in January, 2009<ref>[http://www.iaqg.sae.org/servlets/productDetail?PROD_TYP=STD&PROD_CD=AS9100C SAE International Publications]</ref>.

The IAQG Sanctioned Aerospace Auditor Transition Training was released May 1, 2010.<ref>[http://www.plexusintl.com Plexus International]</ref>
