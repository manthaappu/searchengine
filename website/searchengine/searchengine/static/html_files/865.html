'''ActiveX Document''' (also known as '''DocObject''' or '''DocObj''')<ref>[http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=ActiveX+Documents&i=37473,00.asp Definition of ActiveX Documents]</ref> is a [[computer file]] in the form of a [[compound document|compound (text-based)]] document that allows{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} a container application{{Vague|date=February 2009}} to use the full capabilities of server applications.{{ambig}} This approach{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} distinguishes between a document, such as a word document or [[video clip]], and the software that can be [[Application software|applied]] (open, edit, display, save) to the document. [[ActiveX]] documents consist of two components: the 'document' itself ''and'' the 'ActiveX DLL or EXE server' that supports it.

A single [[server (computing)|server]] can support an unlimited number of documents, just as [[Microsoft Word]] can support any number of document files. The server for an ActiveX document can be an EXE or a DLL server. The document generally has the extension .VBD, though ActiveX documents can be stored within other files as well, using a mechanism{{ambig}} called [[Object Linking and Embedding|OLE]] [[structured storage]].
