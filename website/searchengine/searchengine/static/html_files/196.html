Eight-bit CPUs normally use an [[octet (computing)|8-bit]] [[data bus]] and a [[16-bit]] address bus which means that their [[address space]] is limited to 64 [[kibibyte|KiB]].  This is not a "natural law", however, so there are exceptions.

The first widely adopted 8-bit [[microprocessor]] was the [[Intel 8080]], being used in many hobbyist computers of the late 1970s and early 1980s, often running the [[CP/M]] [[operating system]].  The [[Zilog Z80]] (compatible with the 8080) and the [[Motorola 6800]] were also used in similar computers.  The Z80 and the [[MOS Technology 6502]] 8-bit CPUs were widely used in [[home computer]]s and [[game console]]s of the '70s and '80s.  Many 8-bit CPUs or [[microcontroller]]s are the basis of today's ubiquitous [[embedded systems]].  

There are 2<sup>8</sup> (256) possible values for 8 bits.

The first microprocessors had a [[4-bit]] word length and were developed around 1970. The first commercial microprocessor was the [[Binary coded decimal|BCD-based]] [[Intel 4004]] (1971), developed for calculator applications. The first commercial 8-bit processor was the [[Intel 8008]] (1972) which was originally intended for [[intelligent terminal]]s. Most competitors to Intel started off with such character oriented 8-bit microprocessors. Modernized variants of these 8-bit machines are still one of the most common types of processor in embedded systems.

==List of 8-bit CPUs==
A [[CPU]] can be classified on the basis of the [[data]] it can access in a single [[Instruction (computer science)|operation]]. An 8-bit processor can access 8 bits of data in a single operation, as opposed to a [[16-bit]] processor, which can access 16 bits of data in a single operation.
