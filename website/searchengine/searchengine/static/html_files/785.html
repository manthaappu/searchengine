<html> <head> <title>Access control vestibule</title></head><body>The '''Access Control Vestibule''' (ACV) is a [[security]] screening system for the [[detection]] of individuals carrying [[weapons]] into any facility without [[authorization]], therefore minimizing the possibility of an [[armed]] takeover. The ACV is composed of an [[aluminum]] frame, separate entrance and exit doors, a [[metal detection]] system, and [[bullet-proof glass]]. If a weapon is detected, the doors to the ACV automatically lock.<ref>http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5992094.html</ref> The ACV is typically used in [[bank]]s and other secure facilities.<ref>http://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/stories/2007/06/18/daily18.html?from_rss=1</ref>

== Patent ==
Novacomm, Inc. patented the ACV in 1994.

== Technology ==
The ACV incorporates several [[security]] [[technologies]] that security [[personnel]] can use to assist with the [[screening]] process. Included are: 1) an [[intercom]] for communications; 2) optional [[camera]] so personnel can see the individual requesting [[access]]; 3) [[metal detector]] to ferret out any [[weapons]] that may be present on the individual requesting access; and 4) [[access control]] for physical access to the business. When a customer enters the vestibule a passive [[infrared detector]] senses that someone is present within the enclosure, locking the doors behind and in front of him/her, thus forming a [[mantrap]]. The door behind the person is locked to prevent [[Piggybacking (security)|piggybacking]]. Both doors are secured using [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] locks. At no time is the person inside the entrance of the [[mantrap]] prevented from leaving through the door they first entered, but the inside door to the inner sanctum of the business cannot be opened until the [[metal detector]] has determined that no weapons are present.<ref>http://www.securitysales.com/t_news_print.aspx?action=article&storyID=3237</ref>
