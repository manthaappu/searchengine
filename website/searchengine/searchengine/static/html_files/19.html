'''10PASS-TS''' is an [[IEEE 802.3-2008]] Physical Layer ([[PHY]]) specification for a [[full-duplex]] short reach [[Point-to-point communication (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] [[Ethernet]] link over [[voice-grade copper]] wiring. 2BASE-TL is used in [[Ethernet in the first mile]] applications.

10PASS-TS PHYs deliver a minimum of 10 [[Mbit/s]] over distances of up to {{convert|750|m|ft}}, using [[ITU-T]] [[G.993.1]] ([[VDSL]]) technology over a single copper pair. These PHYs may also support an optional aggregation or bonding of multiple copper pairs, called [[PME Aggregation Function]] (PAF).

Unlike [[10BASE-T]], [[100BASE-T]] and [[1000BASE-T]] PHYs, providing a single rate of 10, 100 or 1000 Mbit/s respectively, 10PASS-TS link rate can vary, depending on the copper channel characteristics, such as length, wire diameter ([[American wire gauge|gauge]]), number of pairs if the link is aggregated etc.
