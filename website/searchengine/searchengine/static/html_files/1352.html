'''Alchemy CATALYST''' is a software [[Internationalization and localization|localisation]] suite which is developed by Alchemy Software Development Limited.

==History==
Alchemy Software Development Limited was founded by Enda McDonnell and Tony Oâ€™Dowd the original developers of Corel Catalyst. It acquired the Corel Catalyst software which was initially owned by Corel Corporation Limited, in a deal which saw Corel gain a stake of 24.9% equity interest in the newly formed company. On March 6 2008 Alchemy Software development merged with Translations.com a provider of software localisation and Globalization Management system technology . The headquarters of Alchemy Software Development Limited are located in Dublin. The company also has offices located in Japan, Germany and the USA.  Catalyst 9.0 was released late 2010.<ref>http://www.alchemysoftware.ie/company/news/pr_001130.html</ref>

==Alchemy CATALYST 8.0==
Alchemy CATALYST is a software localisation tool and was one of the first tools that contained integrated [[translation memory]] technology. The latest version of Alchemy CATALYST version 8.0 was released on the 14th of February 2009.Alchemy CATALYST 8.0  is an Object Oriented localization environment. <ref>http://www.alchemysoftware.ie/estore/order_catalyst_7.html</ref>

===Alchemy Experts===
Alchemy Experts are automation processes designed to omit repetitive tasks within the localisation process. The following are experts found in Alchemy Catalyst:
#	'''Validate Expert''': This expert detects,locates and fixes common errors that can occur in the localisation procedure such as incorrect spellings and truncated text.The Runtime Validate Expert which accompanies the Validate Expert in the Localizer Edition and Developer/Pro Editions allows the user to carry out this process while the software is running.
#	'''Pseudo-Translate Text''': This expert allows the user to pseudo-translate the [[translation]] which is the process of creating text that mimics a foreign language without the benefit of actual [[translation]] into another language.<ref>http://www.inter-locale.com/demos/pseudo.jsp</ref>
#	'''Visual Comparison Expert''': This is used to compare the changes in two application files and detect missing resources.
#	'''Leverage Expert''': This allows the user to reuse TM files using Alchemy CATALYST'S ezMatch [[translation memory]] technology.  These files are stored in .ttk, .tmx and .tmx format.
#       '''Layout Manager''': The Layout Manager allows the user to automatically create localised layouts by resizing controls,dialogs and buttons ensuring that any text that has expanded during the [[translation]] process will fit appropriately on the user interface.
#       '''QuickShip Expert''': The Quickship Expert is used to distribute files to translators. It does this by placing all project TTK files, glossary files and user instructions into a compressed executable file known as a Quickship bundle.  The QuickShip bundle which is sent to the translator extracts all constituent files and attaches any glossary files to the translators version of Alchemy CATALYST'S Translator/Lite which is then launched.  <ref>http://www.alchemysoftware.ie/products/productline.html</ref>
#       '''Analysis Expert''': This expert allows the user to perform an analysis of the project to determine the actual parts that need to be translated ensuring reduced costs.  It does this by determining the amount of fuzzy-matches which can be re-used,counting the number of words which are repeated throughout and counting the number of matching segments which occur between the TTK project files and the [[translation memory]].  All numerical data and keyword matches which are found through carrying out the analysis are omitted meaning the user only has to pay for content that needs to be translated.
#      ''' Update Expert''': This updates files by replacing application files with their revised editions.[[Translation]] leverage is also carried out during this procss.
