<html> <head> <title>Akiko (Amiga)</title></head><body>'''Akiko''' is a custom chip used in the [[Amiga CD32]] games console and forms part of the [[Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] chipset used in that system.

The Akiko chip performs '[[Packed pixel|chunky]]' to '[[Planar (computer graphics)|planar]]' graphics conversion in hardware. The Amiga's native display is a planar display which is simple and efficient to manipulate for routines like scrolling. However, chunky displays are faster and more efficient for 3D graphics manipulation. Akiko allows this conversion to be performed in hardware instead of relying on software conversion which would otherwise slow the system down. The conversion works by writing 32 chunky pixels to Akiko's registers and reading back eight 32-bit words of converted planar data which can then be copied to the display buffer.


Akiko is also responsible for implementing some of the control logic for the CD32's [[CD-ROM]] controller, as well as for controlling the serial ('AUX') port <ref>{{cite web|title=The Big Book of Amiga Hardware - Custom Chips: Akiko|url=http://bboah.amiga-resistance.info/cgi-bin/showhardware_en.cgi?HARDID=1449}}</ref>.
