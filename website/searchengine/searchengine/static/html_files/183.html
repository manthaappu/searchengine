{{N-bit|64|(8 [[octet (computing)|octets]])}}

'''64-bit''' CPUs have existed in [[supercomputers]] since the 1970s ([[Cray-1]], 1975; [[CDC 6000 series]], 1964, were 60-bit) and in [[RISC]]-based [[computer workstation|workstations]] and [[Server (computing)|server]]s since the early 1990s. In 2003 they were introduced to the (previously [[32-bit]]) mainstream [[personal computer]] arena, in the form of the [[x86-64]] and 64-bit [[PowerPC]] processor architectures.

Without further qualification, a ''64-bit'' computer architecture generally has integer and addressing [[processor register|registers]] that are 64 bits wide, allowing direct support for 64-bit data types and addresses. However, a CPU might have external [[data bus]]es or [[address bus]]es with different sizes from the registers, even larger (the 32-bit [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] had a 64-bit data bus, for instance). The term may also refer to the size of low-level data types, such as 64-bit [[Floating point|floating-point]] numbers.

==Architectural implications==
Processor registers are typically divided into several groups: ''integer'', ''floating-point'', ''[[SIMD]]'', ''control'', and often special registers for address arithmetic which may have various uses and names such as ''address'', ''index'' or ''base registers''. However, in modern designs, these functions are often performed by more general purpose ''integer'' registers. In most processors, only integer and/or address-registers can be used to address data in memory, the other types cannot. The size of these registers therefore normally limits the amount of directly addressable memory, even if there are registers, such as floating-point registers, that are wider.

Most high performance 32-bit and 64-bit processors (some notable exceptions are most [[ARM architecture|ARM]] and 32-bit [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] CPUs) have integrated floating point hardware, which is often, but not always, based on 64-bit units of data. For example, although the [[x86]]/[[x87]] architecture has instructions capable of loading and storing 64-bit (and 32-bit) floating-point values in memory, the internal data and register format is 80 bits wide. In contrast, the 64-bit [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] family uses a 64-bit floating-point data and register format (as well as 64-bit integer registers).

==History==
Most CPUs are designed so that the contents of a single integer register can store the [[memory address|address]] (location) of any datum in the computer's [[virtual memory]]. Therefore, the total number of addresses in the virtual memory &mdash; the total amount of data the computer can keep in its working area &mdash; is determined by the width of these registers. Beginning in the 1960s with the [[IBM]] [[System/360]] (which was an exception, in that it used the low order 24 bits of a word for addresses, resulting in a 16 [[megabyte|MB]] [{{nowrap|16 × 1024<sup>2</sup> bytes}}] address space size), then (amongst many others) the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[VAX]] minicomputer in the 1970s, and then with the [[Intel 80386]] in the mid-1980s, a ''de facto'' consensus developed that 32 bits was a convenient register size.  A 32-bit [[address register]] meant that 2<sup>32</sup> addresses, or 4 [[Gigabyte|GB]] of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]], could be referenced. At the time these architectures were devised, 4 GB of memory was so far beyond the typical quantities (4 MB) in installations that this was considered to be enough "headroom" for addressing. 4.29 billion addresses were considered an appropriate size to work with for another important reason: 4.29 billion integers are enough to assign unique references to most entities in applications like [[database]]s.

Some [[supercomputer]] architectures of the 1970s and 1980s used registers up to 64 bits wide. In the mid-1980s, Intel i860<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/38.31467 |title=The Intel i860 64-Bit Processor: A General-Purpose CPU with 3D Graphics Capabilities |date=July/August 1989 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=85–94|first=Jack |last=Grimes |first2=Les |last2=Kohn |first3=Rajeev |last3=Bharadhwaj|work=IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications|accessdate=2010-11-19}}</ref> development began culminating in a (too late<ref>Zachary, ''Showstopper!''</ref> for Windows NT) 1989 release.  However, 32 bits remained the norm until the early 1990s, when the continual reductions in the cost of memory led to installations with quantities of RAM approaching 4 GB, and the use of virtual memory spaces exceeding the 4 GB ceiling became desirable for handling certain types of problems. In response, MIPS and DEC developed 64-bit microprocessor architectures, initially for high-end [[workstation]] and [[Server (computing)|server]] machines. By the mid-1990s, [[HAL Computer Systems]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[IBM]], [[Silicon Graphics]], and [[Hewlett Packard]] had developed 64-bit architectures for their workstation and server systems. A notable exception to this trend were [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]] from IBM, which then used 32-bit data and 31-bit address sizes; the IBM mainframes did not include 64-bit processors until 2000. During the 1990s, several low-cost 64-bit microprocessors were used in consumer electronics and embedded applications. Notably, the [[Nintendo 64]]<ref>{{cite press release|title=NEC Offers Two High Cost Performance 64-bit RISC Microprocessors|publisher=[[NEC]]|date=1998-01-20|url=http://www.nec.co.jp/press/en/9801/2002.htm|accessdate=2011-01-09|quote=Versions of the VR4300 processor are widely used in consumer and office automation applications, including the popular Nintendo 64TM video game and advanced laser printers such as the recently announced, award-winning Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 4000 printer family.}}</ref> and the [[PlayStation 2]] had 64-bit microprocessors before their introduction in personal computers. High-end printers and network equipment, as well as industrial computers also used 64-bit microprocessors such as the [[Quantum Effect Devices]] [[R5000]]. 64-bit computing started to drift down to the personal computer desktop from 2003 onwards, when some models in [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s Macintosh lines switched to [[PowerPC 970]] processors (termed "G5" by Apple) and the launch of [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]]'s 64-bit [[x86-64]] extension to the [[x86]] architecture, itself a response to [[Intel]]'s [[Itanium]] gaining early [[operating system]]s support.

==Limitations==
{{Ref improve section|date=January 2010}}

Most 64-bit microprocessors on the market today have an artificial limit on the amount of memory they can address, considerably lower than what might be expected from 64 bits. For example, the [[x86-64|AMD64 architecture]] currently has a 52 bit limit on physical memory and only supports a 48-bit virtual address space.<ref>AMD64 Programmer's Manual Volume 2: System Programming, order number 24593, revision 3.14, September 2007, Advanced Micro Devices</ref> This is 4 [[petabyte|PB]] ({{nowrap|4 × 1024<sup>5</sup> bytes}}) and 256 [[terabyte|TB]] ({{nowrap|256 × 1024<sup>4</sup> bytes}}), respectively. A PC cannot contain 4 petabytes of memory (due to the size of current memory chips if nothing else) but AMD envisioned large servers, shared memory clusters, and other uses of physical address space that might approach this in the foreseeable future, and the 52 bit physical address provides ample room for expansion while not incurring the cost of implementing 64-bit physical addresses. Similarly, the 48-bit virtual address space was designed to provide more than 65,000 times the 32 bit limit of 4 [[gigabyte|GB]] ({{nowrap|4 × 1024<sup>3</sup> bytes}}), allowing ample room for expansion in the near future without incurring the overhead of translating full 64-bit addresses.

==32- vs 64-bit==
A change from a [[32-bit]] to a 64-bit architecture is a fundamental alteration, as most [[operating system]]s must be extensively modified to take advantage of the new architecture.{{Why?|date=November 2010}} Other software must also be [[porting|ported]] to use the new capabilities; older software is usually supported through either a ''hardware compatibility mode'' (in which the new processors support the older 32-bit version of the instruction set as well as the 64-bit version), through software [[Emulator|emulation]], or by the actual implementation of a 32-bit processor core within the 64-bit processor (as with the Itanium processors from Intel, which include an [[x86]] processor core to run 32-bit x86 applications). The operating systems for those 64-bit architectures generally support both 32-bit and 64-bit applications.<ref>{{cite web

One significant exception to this is the [[AS/400]], whose software runs on a virtual [[Instruction Set Architecture|ISA]], called TIMI (Technology Independent Machine Interface) which is translated to native machine code by low-level software before being executed. The low-level software is all that has to be rewritten to move the entire OS and all software to a new platform, such as when IBM transitioned their line from the older 32/48-bit "IMPI" instruction set to 64-bit PowerPC (IMPI wasn't anything like 32-bit PowerPC, so this was an even bigger transition than from a 32-bit version of an instruction set to a 64-bit version of the same instruction set).

While 64-bit architectures indisputably make working with large data sets in applications such as [[digital video]], scientific computing, and large [[database]]s easier, there has been considerable debate as to whether they or their 32-bit compatibility modes will be faster than comparably-priced 32-bit systems for other tasks. In [[x86-64]] architecture (AMD64), the majority of the 32-bit operating systems and applications are able to run smoothly on the 64-bit hardware.

A compiled Java program can run on a 32 bit or 64 bit Java virtual machine without modification. The lengths and precision of all the built in types are specified by the standard and are not dependent on the underlying architecture. Java programs that run on a 64 bit Java virtual machine have access to a larger address space.<ref>{{cite web

Speed is not the only factor to consider in a comparison of 32-bit and 64-bit processors. Applications such as multi-tasking, stress testing, and clustering—for HPC ([[high-performance computing]])—may be more suited to a 64-bit architecture when deployed appropriately. 64-bit clusters have been widely deployed in large organizations such as IBM, HP and Microsoft, for this reason.

==Pros and cons==
A common{{fact|date=January 2011}} misconception is that 64-bit architectures are no better than 32-bit architectures unless the computer has more than 4 GB of [[main memory]]. This is not entirely true:

*Some operating systems and certain hardware configurations limit the physical memory space to 3 GB on [[IA-32]] systems, due to much of the 3–4 GB region being reserved for hardware addressing; see [[3 GB barrier]]. This is not present in 64-bit architectures, which can use 4 GB of memory and more. However, IA-32 processors from the [[Pentium II]] onwards allow for a 36-bit ''physical'' memory address space, using [[Physical Address Extension]] (PAE), which gives a 64 GB physical address range, of which up to 62 GB may be used by main memory; operating systems that support PAE may not be limited to 4GB of physical memory, even on IA-32 processors.

*Some operating systems reserve portions of [[Process (computing)|process]] [[address space]] for OS use, effectively reducing the total address space available for mapping memory for user programs. For instance, Windows XP DLLs and other user mode OS components are mapped into each process's address space, leaving only 2 to 3 GB (depending on the settings) address space available. This limit is currently much higher on 64-bit operating systems and does not realistically restrict memory usage.

*[[Memory-mapped file]]s are becoming more difficult to implement in 32-bit architectures.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} A 4 GB file is no longer uncommon, and such large files cannot be memory mapped easily to 32-bit architectures; only a region of the file can be mapped into the address space, and to access such a file by memory mapping, those regions will have to be mapped into and out of the address space as needed. This is a problem, as memory mapping remains one of the most efficient disk-to-memory methods, when properly implemented by the OS.

*Some programs such as data encryption software can benefit greatly from 64-bit registers (if the software is 64-bit compiled) and effectively execute 3 to 5 times faster on 64-bit than on 32-bit.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

*Some 64-bit architectures, such as [[x86-64]], allow for more general purpose registers than their 32-bit counterparts. This is a significant speed increase for tight loops since the processor doesn't have to go out the second level cache or main memory to gather data if it can fit in the available registers.
:Example in [[C (programming language)|C]]:
<source lang="c">
for (a=0; a<100; a++)
{
  b = a;
  c = b;
  d = c;
  e = d;
}
</source>
:If a processor only has the ability to keep two three values/variables (registers) in fast memory it would need to stop executing and push and pop the stack to be able to process variable d and e as well. A process that takes a lot of CPU cycles. A processor that is capable of holding all the values/variables (registers) in memory can simply just loop through this without needing to halt execution for each iteration just to get the proper data in memory. This behavior can easily be compared with virtual memory, although any effects are contingent upon the compiler.

The main disadvantage of 64-bit architectures is that relative to 32-bit architectures, the same data occupies more space in memory (due to swollen pointers and possibly other types and alignment padding). This increases the memory requirements of a given process and can have implications for efficient processor cache utilization. Maintaining a partial 32-bit model is one way to handle this and is in general reasonably effective. For example, the [[z/OS]] operating system takes this approach currently, requiring program code to reside in 31-bit address spaces (the high order bit is not used in address calculation on the underlying hardware platform) while data objects can optionally reside in 64-bit regions.

Currently, most proprietary [[x86]] software is compiled into 32-bit code, with less being also compiled into 64-bit code (although the trend is rapidly equalizing {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}), so much does not take advantage of the larger 64-bit address space or wider 64-bit registers and data paths on x86 processors, or the additional registers in 64-bit mode. However, users of most RISC platforms, and users of [[free software|free]] or [[open source]] operating systems (where the [[source code]] is available for recompiling with a 64-bit compiler) have been able to use exclusive 64-bit computing environments for years due to the likelihood of the existence of someone willing to compile the code thusly. Not all such applications require a large address space nor manipulate 64-bit data items, so they wouldn't benefit from the larger address space or wider registers and data paths. The main advantage to 64-bit versions of such applications is the ability to access more registers in the [[x86-64]] architecture.

=== Software availability ===
x86-based 64-bit systems sometimes lack equivalents to [[software]] that is written for 32-bit architectures. The most severe problem in Microsoft Windows is incompatible [[device driver]]s. Most 32-bit application software can run on a 64-bit operating system in a compatibility mode, also known as an [[Emulator|emulation]] mode, e.g. Microsoft [[WoW64]] Technology for IA-64 and AMD64. The 64-bit Windows Native Mode<ref>{{cite web|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897447.aspx |title=Inside Native Applications |publisher=Technet.microsoft.com |date=2006-11-01 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}</ref> driver environment runs atop 64-bit NTDLL.DLL which cannot call 32-bit Win32 subsystem code (often devices whose actual hardware function is emulated in user mode software, like Winprinters). Because 64-bit drivers for most devices were not available until early 2007 (Vista x64), using 64-bit Microsoft Windows operating system was considered a challenge. However, the trend is changing towards 64-bit computing as most manufacturers provide both 32-bit and 64-bit drivers nowadays, so this issue is most likely to occur when attempting to use older peripherals.

This is less of a problem with open source drivers that are already available for a 32-bit OS, since they can be modified to be 64-bit compatible, if necessary. Furthermore, support for hardware made before early 2007 was equally troubling for opensource platforms due to their small market shares in desktop market.

On most Macs, [[Mac OS X]] runs with a 32-bit kernel even on 64-bit-capable processors, but the 32-bit kernel can run 64-bit user-mode code; this allows those Macs to support 64-bit processes while still supporting 32-bit device drivers - although not 64-bit drivers and performance advantages that would come with them.  On systems with 64-bit processors, both the 32-bit and 64-bit Mac OS X kernel can run 32-bit user-mode code, and all versions of Mac OS X include 32-bit versions of libraries that 32-bit applications would use, so 32-bit user-mode software for Mac OS X will run on those systems.

[[Linux]] and most other [[Unix-like]] operating systems, and the [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] toolchains for them, have supported 64-bit processors for many years: releasing 64-bit versions of their operating system before official Microsoft releases.  Many applications and libraries for those platforms are [[open source]], written in C and C++, so that, if it's 64-bit-safe, they can be compiled into 64-bit versions.  This source bade distribution model with an emphasis on frequent releases and cutting edge code makes availability of application software for those operating systems less of an issue.

==64-bit data models==
{{inappropriate tone|section|date=December 2010}}
Converting application software written in a [[high-level language]] from a 32-bit architecture to a 64-bit architecture varies in difficulty.
One common recurring problem is that some programmers assume that [[Pointer (computing)|pointers]] have the same length as some other data type. These programmers assume they can transfer quantities between these data types without losing information.
Those assumptions happen to be true on some 32-bit machines (and even some 16-bit machines), but they are no longer true on 64-bit machines.
This common mistake is often called "the heresy that 'all the world's a VAX.'".<ref>

The [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] and its descendant [[C++]] make it particularly easy to make this sort of mistake.  Differences between the [[C90 (C version)|C89]] and [[C (programming language)#C99|C99]] language standards also exacerbate the problem.<ref>{{cite web|firat=Eric |last=Sosman |url=http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.c/msg/82fdb7c12af4e6ba |title=Comp.lang.c: C89, size_t, and long |publisher=Groups.google.com |date=2007-03-14 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}</ref>

To avoid this mistake in C and C++, the <code>sizeof</code> operator can be used to determine the size of these primitive types if decisions based on their size need to be made, both at compile- and run-time. Also, the <[[limits.h]]> header in the [[C (programming language)#C99|C99]] standard, and numeric_limits class in <limits> header in the C++ standard, give more helpful info; sizeof only returns the size in ''[[Character (computing)|chars]]''. This used to be misleading, because the standards leave the definition of the <code>CHAR_BIT</code> macro, and therefore the number of bits in a ''char'', to the implementations. However, except for those compilers targeting [[Digital Signal Processor|DSP]]s, "64 bits == 8 chars of 8 bits each" has become the norm.

One needs to be careful to use the <code>ptrdiff_t</code> type (in the standard header <code><stddef.h></code>) for the result of subtracting two pointers; too much code incorrectly uses "int" or "long" instead. To represent a pointer (rather than a pointer difference) as an integer, use <code>uintptr_t</code> where available (it is only defined in C99, but some compilers otherwise conforming to an earlier version of the standard offer it as an extension).

Neither C nor C++ define the length of a pointer, int, or long to be a specific number of bits. In C99, however, [[stdint.h]] provides names for integer types with certain numbers of bits where those types are available.

===Specific C-language data models===
In most programming environments on 32-bit machines, pointers, "int" (that is, integer) types, and "long" (that is, long integer) types are all 32 bits wide.

However, in many programming environments on 64-bit machines, "int" variables are still 32 bits wide, but long integers and pointers are 64 bits wide. These are described as having an '''LP64''' [[data model]]. Another alternative is the '''ILP64''' data model in which all three data types are 64 bits wide, and even '''SILP64''' where "short" integers are also 64 bits wide{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. However, in most cases the modifications required are relatively minor and straightforward, and many well-written programs can simply be recompiled for the new environment without changes. Another alternative is the '''LLP64''' model, which maintains compatibility with 32-bit code by leaving both int and long as 32-bit. "LL" refers to the "long long integer" type, which is at least 64 bits on all platforms, including 32-bit environments.

Many 64-bit compilers today use the '''LP64''' model (including Solaris, [[AIX]], [[HP-UX]], Linux, [[Mac OS X]], [[FreeBSD]], and IBM [[z/OS]] native compilers). Microsoft's [[Visual C++]] compiler uses the '''LLP64''' model. The disadvantage of the LP64 model is that storing a long into an int may overflow. On the other hand, casting a pointer to a long will work. In the LLP model, the reverse is true. These are not problems which affect fully standard-compliant code but code is often written with implicit assumptions about the widths of integer types.

Note that a programming model is a choice made on a per-compiler basis, and several can coexist on the same OS. However, the programming model chosen as the primary model for the OS API typically dominates.

Another consideration is the data model used for [[Device driver|driver]]s. Drivers make up the majority of the operating system code in most modern operating systems (although many may not be loaded when the operating system is running). Many drivers use pointers heavily to manipulate data, and in some cases have to load pointers of a certain size into the hardware they support for [[Direct memory access|DMA]]. As an example, a driver for a 32-bit PCI device asking the device to DMA data into upper areas of a 64-bit machine's memory could not satisfy requests from the operating system to load data from the device to memory above the 4 gigabyte barrier, because the pointers for those addresses would not fit into the DMA registers of the device. This problem is solved by having the OS take the memory restrictions of the device into account when generating requests to drivers for DMA, or by using an [[IOMMU]].

Most 64-bit processor architectures can execute code for the 32-bit version of the architecture natively without any performance penalty.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} This kind of support is commonly called ''bi-arch support'' or more generally ''multi-arch support''.

==Images==
In digital imaging, 64-bit refers to [[Deep Color|48-bit images]] with a [[16-bit]] [[Alpha compositing|alpha channel]].
