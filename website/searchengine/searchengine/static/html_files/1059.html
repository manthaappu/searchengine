<html> <head> <title>Adobe Flash</title></head><body>'''Adobe Flash''' (formerly '''Macromedia Flash''') is a [[multimedia]] [[Platform (computing)|platform]] used to add [[animation]], video, and [[interactivity]] to web pages. Flash is frequently used for advertisements and games. More recently, it has been positioned as a tool for "[[Rich Internet Application]]s" ("RIAs").

Flash manipulates [[vector graphics|vector]] and [[raster graphics]] to provide animation of text, drawings, and still images. It supports bidirectional [[Streaming media|streaming]] of audio and video, and it can capture user input via mouse, keyboard, microphone, and camera. Flash contains an [[Object-oriented language]] called [[ActionScript]].

Flash content may be displayed on various computer systems and [[information appliance|devices]], using [[Adobe Flash Player]], which is available free of charge for common [[web browser]]s, some [[mobile phone]]s and a few other [[electronic device]]s (using [[Flash Lite]]).

Some users feel that Flash enriches their web experience, while others find the extensive use of Flash animation, particularly in advertising, intrusive and annoying, giving rise to a cottage industry that specializes in blocking Flash content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tnerd.com/2010/02/18/how-to-block-flash-on-chrome-firefox-opera-internet-explorer-8/ |title=How to Block Flash |accessdate=2011-01-04 }}</ref> Flash has also been criticized for adversely affecting the usability of web pages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20001029.html|title=Flash: 99% Bad |accessdate=2011-01-08 }}</ref>

==History==
Originally developed by [[Macromedia]], Flash was introduced in 1996, and is currently developed and distributed by [[Adobe Systems]]. The precursor to the Flash application was SmartSketch, a drawing application for pen computers running the [[PenPoint OS]] developed by [[Jonathan Gay]], who began working on it in college and extended the idea for [[Silicon Beach Software]] and its successors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flashmagazine.com/413.htm |title=The Flash History |accessdate=2001-06-18 |last=Waldron |first=Rick |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2006-08-27 |work= |publisher=Flashmagazine |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web

 | accessdate = 2009-10-18}}</ref> When PenPoint failed in the marketplace, SmartSketch was ported to Microsoft Windows and Mac OS. With the [[Internet]] becoming more popular, SmartSketch was re-released as FutureSplash, a [[Vector graphics|vector]]-based [[web animation]] in competition with Macromedia [[Adobe Shockwave|Shockwave]]. In 1995, SmartSketch was further modified with frame-by-frame animation features and re-released as [[FutureSplash Animator]] on multiple platforms.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://coldhardflash.com/2008/02/grandmasters-of-flash-an-interview-with-the-creators-of-flash.html | title=Grandmasters of Flash: An Interview with the Creators of Flash | accessdate=2008-02-12 | publisher=ColdHardFlash.com}}</ref> The product was offered to Adobe and used by [[Microsoft]] in its early work with the Internet ([[MSN]]). In 1996, FutureSplash was acquired by Macromedia and released as '''Flash,''' contracting "Future" and "Splash".

===Recent developments===
<!-- Notice to editors: if possible, try to get third party references which are not simple copies of Adobe press releases. The section is also prone to original research and crystal balling which quickly becomes out of date -->

'''Adobe Labs''' (previously called ''Macromedia Labs'') is a source for news and pre-release versions of emerging products and technologies from Adobe. Most innovations, such as Flash 10, [[Macromedia Flex|Flex]] 3, and ActionScript 3.0 have all been discussed and/or trialled on the site.

One area Adobe is focusing on (as of February 2009) is the deployment of [[Rich Internet Applications]] (RIAs). To this end, they released [[Adobe Integrated Runtime]] (AIR), a [[cross-platform]] [[runtime environment]] which can be used to build, using Adobe Flash, rich Internet applications that can be deployed as [[application software|desktop applications]]. It surpassed 100 million installations worldwide in February 2009.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://blogs.adobe.com/air/2009/01/air_passes_100_million_install.html?sdid=EENCL | title = AIR passes 100 million installations | accessdate = 2009-02-03}}</ref> Flash is installed silently when Acrobat Reader is installed.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/520/cpsid_52001.html | title = Adobe Download Manager FAQ &#124; Flash Player and Reader | accessdate = 2011-01-19}}</ref>{{verification failed|date=January 2011}}

Two additional components designed for large-scale implementation have been proposed by Adobe for future releases of Flash: first, the option to require an ad to be played in full before the main video piece is played; and second, the integration of [[digital rights management]] (DRM) capabilities. This way Adobe can give companies the option to link an advertisement with content and make sure that both are played and remain unchanged.<ref name="BBCVideoControl">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6558979.stm |title=Adobe unveils Flash video control |accessdate=2007-06-18 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2007-04-16 |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=BBC |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

====Open Screen Project====
On May 1, 2008 Adobe announced ''Open Screen Project'', which hopes to provide a consistent application interface across devices such as [[personal computer]]s, [[mobile device]]s and [[consumer electronics]].<ref name="osppr">{{cite web|title=Adobe and Industry Leaders Establish Open Screen Project|url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200805/050108AdobeOSP.html|accessdate=2009-02-20|date=2008-05-01}}</ref> When the project was announced, several goals were outlined: the abolition of licensing fees for Adobe Flash Player and [[Adobe Integrated Runtime]], the removal of restrictions on the use of the [[Adobe Shockwave|Shockwave]] Flash (SWF) and Flash Video (FLV) [[file format]], the publishing of [[Application Programming Interface|application programming interfaces]] for porting Flash to new devices and the publishing of The Flash Cast protocol and Action Message Format (AMF), which let Flash applications receive information from remote databases.<ref name="osppr"/>

As of February 2009, the specifications removing the restrictions on the use of SWF and FLV/F4V specs have been published.<ref name="interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.uiresourcecenter.com/rich-internet-applications/articles/inside-the-open-screen-project.html?s=2_1 |title=Inside the Open Screen Project |first=Anup| last=Murarka|accessdate=2009-02-21}}</ref> The Flash Cast protocol—now known as the Mobile Content Delivery Protocol—and AMF protocols have also been made available,<ref name="interview"/> with AMF available as an open source implementation, [[BlazeDS]]. Work on the device porting layers is in the early stages. Adobe intends to remove the licensing fees for Flash Player and Adobe AIR for devices at their release for the Open Screen Project.

The list of mobile device providers who have joined the project includes [[Palm, Inc.|Palm]], Motorola and Nokia,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.openscreenproject.org/partners/current_partners.html| title=Open Screen Project partners|accessdate=2009-02-20}}</ref> who, together with Adobe, have announced a $10 million Open Screen Project fund.<ref>{{cite web|title=Adobe and Nokia Announce $10 Million Open Screen Project Fund|url =http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200902/021609AdobeNokia.html|date=2009-02-16|accessdate=2009-02-20}}</ref>

==Format==
{{main|SWF}}
Flash files are in the ''SWF'' format, traditionally called "'''S'''hock'''W'''ave '''F'''lash" movies, "Flash movies," or "Flash applications", usually have a .swf [[file extension]], and may be used in the form of a web page plug-in, strictly "played" in a [[standalone]] Flash Player, or incorporated into a self-executing Projector movie (with the .exe extension in [[Microsoft Windows]]). [[Flash Video]] files<ref group="spec">FLV and F4V [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flv/pdf/video_file_format_spec_v9.pdf Video File Format Specification Version 9]<br />F4V is based on [[ISO base media file format]] standard:[http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c051533_ISO_IEC_14496-12_2008.zip freely available ISO standards] , and also available via subscription [http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=41828]</ref> have a .flv file extension and are either used from within .[[swf]] files or played through a flv-aware player, such as [[VLC media player|VLC]], or [[QuickTime]] and [[Windows Media Player]] with external [[codec]]s added.

The use of vector graphics combined with program code allows Flash files to be smaller — and thus for streams to use less [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] — than the corresponding bitmaps or video clips. For content in a single format (such as just text, video, or audio), other alternatives may provide better performance and consume less [[central processing unit|CPU]] power than the corresponding Flash movie, for example when using transparency or making large screen updates such as photographic or text fades.

In addition to a vector-rendering engine, the Flash Player includes a virtual machine called the ActionScript Virtual Machine (AVM) for scripting interactivity at run-time, support for video, MP3-based audio, and bitmap graphics. As of Flash Player 8, it offers two video codecs: [[On2 Technologies]] [[VP6]] and [[sorenson codec|Sorenson Spark]], and run-time support for [[JPEG]], Progressive JPEG, [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], and [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]]. In the next version, Flash is slated to use a [[Just-in-time compilation|just-in-time]] compiler for the ActionScript engine.

Flash Player is a browser plugin, and cannot run within a usual e-mail client, such as [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook]]. Instead, a link must open a browser window. A [[Gmail]] labs feature allows playback of YouTube videos linked in emails.

===Flash Video===
{{Main|Flash Video}}
Virtually all browser plugins for video are [[Gratis#Software|free of charge]] and cross-platform, including Adobe's offering of Flash Video, which was first introduced with Flash version 6. Flash Video has been a popular choice for websites due to the large [[#Installed user base|installed user base]] and programmability of Flash. In 2010, Apple [[#Criticism|publicly criticized]] Adobe Flash, including its implementation of video playback for not taking advantage of hardware acceleration, one reason Flash is not to be found on Apple's mobile devices. Soon after Apple's criticism, Adobe demoed and released a beta version of Flash 10.1, which takes advantage of GPU hardware acceleration even on a Mac. Flash 10.2 beta, released December 2010, finally adds multicore CPU hardware acceleration for h.264, three years after most other decoders.

===Flash Audio===
Flash Audio is most commonly encoded in [[MP3]] or AAC ([[Advanced Audio Coding]]) however it does also support [[ADPCM]], Nellymoser ([[Nellymoser Asao Codec]]) and [[Speex]] audio codecs. Flash allows sample rates of 11, 22 and 44.1 kHz. It does not support 48 kHz audio sample rate which is the standard TV, DVD sample rate.

On August 20, 2007, Adobe announced on its blog that with Update 3 of Flash Player 9, Flash Video will also support some parts of the [[MPEG-4]] international standards.<ref name=MP4>{{cite web
|url=http://www.kaourantin.net/2007/08/what-just-happened-to-video-on-web_20.html
|title=What just happened to video on the web
|publisher=Adobe
}}</ref> Specifically, Flash Player will have support for video compressed in [[H.264]] (MPEG-4 Part 10), audio compressed using [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] (MPEG-4 Part 3), the F4V, [[MP4]] (MPEG-4 Part 14), M4V, M4A, [[3GP]] and [[MOV]] multimedia [[Container format (digital)|container formats]], [[3GPP]] [[Timed Text]] specification (MPEG-4 Part 17) which is a standardized subtitle format and partial parsing support for the 'ilst' atom which is the [[ID3]] equivalent [[iTunes]] uses to store [[metadata]]. [[MPEG-4 Part 2]] and [[H.263]] will not be supported in F4V file format. Adobe also announced that they will be gradually moving away from the FLV format to the standard ISO base media file format ([[MPEG-4 Part 12]]) owing to functional limits with the FLV structure when streaming H.264. The final release of the Flash Player supporting some parts of MPEG-4 standards had become available in Fall 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200708/082107FlashPlayer.html |title=Adobe Press release on MPEG-4 support in Flash Player 9 |publisher=Adobe.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref>

Adobe Flash Player 10.1 does not support acoustic echo cancellation, unlike the VoIP offerings of Skype and Google Voice. This makes Flash less suitable for group calling or meetings, as use of headphones for all participants is essential, or at least highly advised.

===Scripting language===
{{See|ActionScript}}

===Proprietary restrictions===
{{See also|Proprietary software}}

The [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] nature of Flash has been a concern to advocates of [[open standard]]s and [[free software]]. Its widespread use has, according to such observers, harmed the otherwise open nature of the [[World Wide Web]].<ref>{{cite web

|accessdate=2009-01-11
|quote= ''Companies building websites should beware of proprietary rich-media technologies like Adobe's Flash and Microsoft's Silverlight, the founder of Mozilla Europe has warned.''}}</ref> A response may be seen in [[#Open Screen Project|Adobe's Open Screen Project]]: Adobe's restrictions on the use of the SWF/FLV specifications have been lifted.

Representing open standards, inventor of [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] and co-author of [[HTML5]], [[Håkon Wium Lie]] explained in a [[AtGoogleTalks|Google tech talk]] entitled "the <video> element" the proposal of [[Theora]] as the format for [[HTML5 video]]:<ref>{{cite web

<blockquote>I believe very strongly, that we need to agree on some kind of baseline video format if [the video element] is going to succeed. Flash is today the baseline format on the web. The problem with Flash is that it's not an open standard.</blockquote>

===Disclosure===
In October 1998, Macromedia disclosed the Flash Version 3 Specification to the world on its website. It did this in response to many new and often semi-open formats competing with SWF, such as Xara's [[Xara Flare|Flare]] and Sharp's [[Extended Vector Animation]] formats. Several developers quickly created a [[C (programming language)|C]] [[C library|library]] for producing SWF. In February 1999, the company introduced [[MorphInk]] 99, the first third-party program to create SWF files. Macromedia also hired [[Middlesoft]] to create a freely available [[development kit|developers' kit]] for the SWF file format versions 3 to 5.

Macromedia made the Flash Files specifications for versions 6 and later available only under a [[non-disclosure agreement]], but they are widely available from various sites.

In April 2006, the Flash SWF file format specification was released with details on the then newest version format (Flash 8). Although still lacking specific information on the incorporated video compression formats (On2, Sorenson Spark, etc.), this new documentation covered all the new features offered in Flash v8 including new ActionScript commands, expressive filter controls, and so on. The file format specification document is offered only to developers who agree to a license agreement that permits them to use the specifications only to develop programs that can export to the Flash file format. The license forbids the use of the specifications to create programs that can be used for playback of Flash files. The Flash 9 specification was made available under similar restrictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/licensing/developer/fileformat/faq/ |title=Adobe File Format Specification FAQ |accessdate=2007-11-15 |publisher=Adobe Systems |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071111094129/http://www.adobe.com/licensing/developer/fileformat/faq/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-11-11}}</ref>

In June 2009, Adobe launched the [[Open Screen Project]] ([http://www.adobe.com/openscreenproject/faq/ Adobe link]), which made the SWF specification available without restrictions. Previously, developers could not use the specification for making SWF-compatible players, but only for making SWF-exporting authoring software. The specification still omits information on codecs such as [[Sorenson codec|Sorenson Spark]], however.<ref>{{cite web| title = Free Flash community reacts to Adobe Open Screen Project | url = http://www.openmedianow.org/?q=node/21 | accessdate = 2008-11-29 }}</ref>

The Adobe Flash Professional multimedia authoring program is used to create content for the [[Adobe Engagement Platform]], such as web applications, games and movies, and content for mobile phones and other embedded devices.

====History====
Adobe Flash Professional is the successor of a software product known as '''FutureSplash Animator''', a [[vector graphics]] and vector animations program released in May 1996. FutureSplash Animator was developed by [[FutureWave Software]], a small software company whose first product, SmartSketch, was a vector-based drawing program for pen-based computers. In 1995, the company decided to add animation capabilities to their product and to create a vector-based animation platform for [[World Wide Web]]; hence FutureSplash Animator was created. Initially, the only way to deploy such animations on the web was through the use of [[Java platform]]; however, the Java platform was later replaced with the [[Netscape]]'s [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] architecture. The FutureSplash animation technology was used on several notable websites such as [[MSN]], the official ''[[The Simpsons]]'' website and ''Disney Daily Blast'' of [[The Walt Disney Company]].<ref name="SA-history-official">[http://www.adobe.com/macromedia/events/john_gay/ The History of Flash] by [[Jonathan Gay]]</ref>

In December 1996, [[Macromedia]] bought FutureWave and so re-branded and released FutureSplash Animator as ''Macromedia Flash'' v1.0. In 2005, Adobe Systems acquired Macromedia; subsequently, in 2007, ''Adobe Flash CS3 Professional'', the next version of Macromedia Flash was released.

===Third-party tools===
[[Open Source]] projects like [[Ajax framework|Ajax Animator]] and the (now defunct) [[UIRA]] aim to create a Flash development environment, complete with a graphical user environment. Alternatively, programs such as [[swfmill]], [[SWFTools]], and [[MTASC]] provide tools to create SWF files, but do so by compiling text, actionscript or XML files into [[Flash animation]]s. It is also possible to create SWF files programmatically using the [[Ming library]], which has interfaces for [[C (Programming Language)|C]], [[PHP]], [[C++]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]. [[haXe]] is an open source, high-level object-oriented programming language geared towards web-content creation that can compile Flash files.

Many [[shareware]] developers produced Flash creation tools and sold them for under US$50 between 2000 and 2002. In 2003 competition and the emergence of free Flash creation tools had driven many third-party Flash-creation tool-makers out of the market, allowing the remaining developers to raise their prices, although many of the products still cost less than US$100 and support ActionScript. As for open source tools, [[KToon]] can edit vectors and generate SWF, but its interface is very different from Macromedia's. Another, more recent example of a Flash creation tool is [[SWiSH Max]] made by an ex-employee of Macromedia. [[ToonBoom|Toon Boom]] Technologies also sells a traditional animation tool, based on Flash.

In addition, several programs create [[.swf]]-compliant files as output from their programs. Among the most famous of these are [[Screencast]] tools, which leverage the ability to do lossless compression and playback of captured screen content in order to produce demos, tutorials, or software simulations of programs. These programs are typically designed for use by non-programmers, and create Flash content quickly and easily, but cannot actually edit the underlying Flash code (i.e. the tweening and transforms, etc.) [[Screencam]] is perhaps the oldest screencasting authoring tool to adopt Flash as the preferred output format, having been developed since the mid-90s. The fact that screencasting programs have adopted Flash as the preferred output is testament to Flash's presence as a ubiquitous cross-platform animation file format.

Other tools are focused on creating specific types of Flash content. [[Anime Studio]] is a 2D animation software package specialized for character animation which creates SWF files. [[Express Animator]] is similarly aimed specifically at animators. [[Question Writer]] publishes its quizzes to Flash file format.

Users who are not programmers or web designers will also find on-line tools that allow them to build full Flash-based websites. One of the oldest services available (1998) is [http://www.flashtogo.com/ FlashToGo]. Such companies provide a wide variety of pre-built models (templates) associated to a Content Management System that empowers users to easily build, edit and publish their websites. Other sites, that allows for greater customization and design flexibility are [[Wix.com]] and [[CirclePad]].

Adobe wrote a software package called [[Adobe LiveMotion]], designed to create interactive animation content and export it to a variety of formats, including SWF. LiveMotion went through two major releases, but failed to gain any notable user base.

In February 2003, Macromedia purchased Presedia, which had developed a Flash authoring tool that automatically converted PowerPoint files into Flash. Macromedia subsequently released the new product as Breeze, which included many new enhancements. In addition, (as of version 2) [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Keynote (software)|Keynote]] presentation software also allows users to create interactive presentations and export to SWF.

==User experience==
Flash as a format has become widespread on the desktop market; one estimate is that 95% of PCs have it,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://statowl.com/plugin_overview.php |title=Web Browser Plugin Market Share |accessdate=2009-08-18 |publisher=StatOwl}}</ref> while Adobe claims that 98 percent of U.S. web users and 99.3 percent of all Internet desktop users have installed the Flash Player,<ref>98%: [[NPD Group|NPD]] [http://www.macromedia.com/software/player_census/npd/ study]</ref><ref name="Flash Player Statistics">99.3%: Millward Brown survey, conducted June 2009. {{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/products/player_census/flashplayer/ |title=Flash Player Statistics |accessdate=2009-06-04 |author= |authorlink= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher=Adobe Systems |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref><ref name="turfwar">{{cite journal

The Adobe Flash Player exists for a variety of systems and devices: Windows, [[Mac OS 9]]/[[Mac OS X|X]], [[Linux]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[HP-UX]], [[Pocket PC]]/[[Windows CE]], [[OS/2]], [[QNX]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Symbian]], [[Palm OS]], [[BeOS]], and [[IRIX]], although the performance is typically best on Windows (see [[#Performance|Performance]]). For compatibility with devices (embedded systems), see [[Macromedia Flash Lite]].

[[File:Noflash.png|thumb|Some websites rely on Flash so heavily that they are totally unusable without this plugin]]

Among mobile devices, Flash has less penetration because Apple does not bundle or allow third-party runtimes on its iPhone, which accounts for more than 60% of global smartphone web traffic, or the iPod touch, which makes up more than 95% of "mobile Internet device" traffic. This hurts Adobe's ability to market Flash as a ubiquitous mobile platform. However, Flash is enabled on competing mobile platforms, including the version 2.2 [[Android (operating system)|Android]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Posted on Tuesday, Apr 27, 2010 by Phil Nickinson <!----> |url=http://www.androidcentral.com/andy-rubin-says-flash-coming-froyo-version-android-operating-system |title=Andy Rubin says Flash is coming in Froyo version of Android operating system |publisher=Androidcentral.com |date=2010-04-27 |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref> while other O.S.s such as Symbian and Palm have versions coming.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Downloading Flash is blocked in countries that are under U.S [[economic sanction|sanctions]] (such as Syria & Sudan). Users in these countries are blocked (by Adobe) from downloading Flash plug-ins for both Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Flash content is usually embedded using the <object> [[html tag]], or the nonstandard <embed> tag<ref>http://validator.w3.org/docs/help.html#faq-flash</ref>. Software that does not support either of these tags, and users who cannot or will not install a plugin, will see the replacement text if this is supplied by the web page.

===Accessibility===
Using Flash tends to break conventions associated with normal HTML pages. Selecting text, scrolling,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20050711.html |title=Scrolling and Scrollbars (Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox) |publisher=Useit.com |date=2005-07-11 |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref> form control and right-clicking act differently than with a regular HTML webpage. Many such interface unexpectancies are fixable by the designer. Usability expert [[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]] published an Alertbox in 2000 entitled, ''Flash: 99% Bad'' which listed issues like these.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20001029.html|title=Flash: 99% Bad|last=Nielsen|first=Jakob|date=2000-10-29 |accessdate=2009-02-21}}</ref> Some problems have been improved upon since Nielsen's complaints:
* Text size can be controlled using full page zoom, found in many modern browsers.
* It has been possible for authors to include alternative text in Flash since Flash Player 6. This [[Accessibility#Telecommunications and IT access|accessibility]] feature is compatible only with certain [[screen readers]] and only under Windows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skillsforaccess.org.uk/howto.php?id=101 |title=Provide text equivalents for graphics - in Flash |accessdate=2007-06-18 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work=Skills for Access – How To |publisher= |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

===Performance===
* Any Flash player has to be able to animate on top of video renderings, which makes [[Hardware acceleration|hardware accelerated]] video rendering at least not as straightforward as with a purpose built [[Media player (application software)|multimedia player]].<ref>[http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/2010/01/solving_different_problems.html Solving Different Problems « Penguin.SWF]. Blogs.adobe.com. Retrieved on 2010-11-09.</ref> Therefore, even when only displaying video, Flash players are more resource intensive than dedicated video player software.
* Comparisons have shown Adobe Flash Player to perform better on [[Windows]] than [[Mac OSX]] and [[Linux]] with the same hardware.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/software/news/2008/10/benchmarking-flash-player-10.ars|title=Flash benchmarks on different operating systems}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Paul |first=Ryan |url=http://arstechnica.com/media/news/2009/10/hands-on-hulu-desktop-for-linux-beta-a-big-resource-hog.ars |title=Hands-on: Hulu Desktop for Linux beta a big resource hog |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=2009-10-16 |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref>

===Flash blocking in web browsers===
Some web browsers default to not play Flash content before the user clicks on it, e.g. [[Konqueror]], [[K-Meleon]]. Equivalent "Flash blocker" extensions also exist for many popular browsers: Firefox has [[NoScript]] and [[Flashblock]], and Opera versions since 10.5 feature native Flash blocking. Opera Turbo requires the user to click to play Flash content. Internet Explorer has Foxie, which contains a number of features, one of them also named Flashblock. WebKit-based browsers under Mac OS X, such as Apple's Safari, have ClickToFlash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rentzsch.github.com/clicktoflash/|title=ClickToFlash|accessdate=2009-10-18}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

===Local Shared Objects (“Flash cookies”)===
{{Main|Local Shared Object}}
Like the [[HTTP cookie]], a [[flash cookie]] (also known as a “[[Local Shared Object]]”) can be used to save application data. Flash cookies are not shared across [[Domain name|domains]]. An August 2009 study by the [[Social Science Research Network]] found that 50% of websites using Flash were also employing flash cookies, yet privacy policies rarely disclosed them, and user controls for privacy preferences were lacking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1446862|title=Soltani, Ashkan, Canty, Shannon, Mayo, Quentin, Thomas, Lauren and Hoofnagle, Chris Jay: Flash Cookies and Privacy|date=2009-08-10 |accessdate=2009-08-18}}</ref> Most browsers' cache and history suppress or delete functions do not affect Flash Player's writing Local Shared Objects to its own cache, and the user community is much less aware of the existence and function of Flash cookies than HTTP cookies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://epic.org/privacy/cookies/flash.html|title=Local Shared Objects -- "Flash Cookies"|publisher=Electronic Privacy Information Center|date=2005-07-21|accessdate=2010-03-08}}</ref> Thus, users having deleted HTTP cookies and purged browser history files and caches may believe that they have purged all tracking data from their computers when in fact Flash browsing history remains.

==64-bit support==

Adobe's 64-bit Flash player is available as a preview2 release ("Square"), which was released in September 2010. The "Square" preview is available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[MacOS X|Mac]] and [[Linux]].<ref>[http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer10.html Adobe Labs - Downloads: Flash Player "Square" Preview Release]. Labs.adobe.com (2010-09-27). Retrieved on 2010-11-09.</ref> This new version can be downloaded at the Adobe lab site.<ref name="AdobeSquare">">[http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer10.html Flash Player support on 64-bit operating systems]</ref>

The key new capabilities in the Flash Player "Square" preview are:
* 64-bit support — Native support for 64-bit operating systems and 64-bit web browsers on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows. (Hulu and Amazon which depends on RTMPE are not currently functioning because there are some 64-bit libs that need to be integrated into the branch{{cite web|url=http://forums.adobe.com/thread/738761?tstart=0|title=Adobe Forums: Flash Player "Square": 64-bit}})
* Internet Explorer 9 hardware accelerated rendering support — Enhanced support for Internet Explorer 9 Beta. It takes advantage of hardware accelerated graphics in Internet Explorer 9 Beta, utilizing hardware rendering surfaces to improve graphics performance and enable seamless composition.

The first experimental release of 64-bit builds of Adobe Flash Player was for the Linux platform,<ref name="Linux 64">{{cite web|url=http://weblogs.macromedia.com/emmy/archives/2008/11

==Usage==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2008}}
One of the uses of Adobe Flash is to create a '''flash intro''', a piece of animated content displayed at the beginning of a [[website]]. Often, the main content is loading in the background, while the animated content is displayed in the foreground. The intent is to captivate the user's attention so that he or she does not stray from the site, although it may do the opposite as it slows the user from accessing the actual site and can be tedious for users with slow internet connections. Often a "skip" or "skip intro" button is prepared to allow more immediate access to the site's homepage.

==Alternatives to Flash==
===HTML5===
{{main|HTML5 vs. Flash}}

[[HTML 5]] is gaining ground as a competitor to Flash: the [[canvas element]] assists animation, and text can be more easily synchronized with audio and video element timeupdate events. In one example of this, [[Scribd]], a 50 million user a month document sharing website, announced in May 2010 that after three years of investment in Flash, it is changing from that platform to the HTML5 standard.<ref>{{cite web|last=Metz|first=Cade|title=50 million user Scribd scraps Flash for HTML5|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/05/06/scribd_ditches_flash_for_html5/|publisher=The Register|accessdate=2010-09-17}}</ref> Youtube introduced HTML5 support in January 2010<ref>http://www.youtube.com/html5</ref>, and on Jan 11 2011, the [[Google Chromium]] Project announced on their blog that support for closed codecs (particularly H.264) would be removed from future releases of Chrome. The Chromium announcement specifically mentioned that this was an effort to increase the use of license-free HTML5 and the <video> tag, and drive web-wide adoption of the open-source codecs [[VP8]] and [[Theora]].

===Microsoft Silverlight===
In recent years, [[Microsoft Silverlight]] has emerged as a strong competitor to Flash{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}. While not yet as prevalent on websites as Flash, Silverlight has been used to provide video streaming for many high profile events, including the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://techcrunch.com/2008/01/06/microsoft-silverlight-gets-a-high-profile-win-2008-bejing-olympics/ |title=Microsoft Silverlight Gets a High Profile Win: 2008 Beijing Olympics| accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref> the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-wins-the-2010-olympics-for-silverlight-2009-3 |title=Microsoft Wins The 2010 Olympics For Silverlight| accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref> and the 2008 conventions for both major political parties in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2008/aug08/08-19conventions.mspx | title = Microsoft Working to Make Political Conventions Unconventional|accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref> Silverlight is also used by [[Netflix]] for its instant video streaming service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://netflix.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=288 |title = Netflix Begins Roll-Out of 2nd Generation Media Player for Instant Streaming on Windows PCs and Intel Macs|accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref>

===Java===
[[Java applet]]s are used both to create interactive visualisations and to present video, three dimensional objects and other media. Java applets are more appropriate for complex visualizations that require significant programming effort in high level language or communications between applet and originating server. Sun's new [[JavaFX]] is considered as another competitor for [[Rich Internet Applications]].

===Other open alternatives===
{{See also|Open format}}

There are equivalent open standards for many simple uses of Flash. Most notably the [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] and [[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language|SMIL]] file formats, the ''canvas'', ''audio'' and ''video'' HTML elements, and the [[JavaScript]] programming language. More complex use cases can be achieved by combining these.

The [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]]'s [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] and [[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language|SMIL]] standards are seen as the nearest equivalents of Flash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/09/12/svg.html |title=Picture Perfect |publisher=XML.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hofmanns.net/flash/AdobeFlash(formerlyMacromediaFlash)W3Cvalidandsearchmachine-friendlydetectingandembedding.pdf?attredirects=0&d=1 |title=xSWF: Flash W3C valid |publisher=Hofmanns.net |date= |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref> [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] has supported SVG since version 8 and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] has since version 3,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.svg.org/Opera|title=Opera |accessdate=2007-06-18|date=2006-12-27|work=Svg wiki |publisher=Svg.org}}</ref> and [[Mozilla Firefox]]'s built-in support for SVG continues to grow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://svg.org/story/2006/7/13/85643/0175|title=First Firefox 2.0 Beta Released|accessdate=2007-06-18 |last=Quint|first=Antoine|date=2006-07-13|publisher=Svg.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/SVG_improvements_in_Firefox_3|title=SVG improvements in Firefox 3 |accessdate=2008-07-20|work=Mozilla Developer Center|publisher=[[Mozilla]]|date=2008-06-17}}</ref> Adobe formerly developed and distributed the 'Adobe SVG Viewer' client plug-in for MS Internet Explorer, but discontinued support and distribution on January 1, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/svg/eol.html|title=Adobe to Discontinue Adobe SVG Viewer|accessdate=2007-06-18|publisher=[[Adobe Systems]]}}</ref> This was in a time when Adobe went from competing with Macromedia's Flash to owning the technology itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webstandards.org/2005/04/19/adobe-rich-internet-applications-and-standards/|title=Adobe, ‘Rich Internet Applications’ and Standards|accessdate=2010-02-25|date=April 19, 2005|publisher=[[Web Standards Project]]}}</ref>

[[UIRA]] was a [[free software]] project that intended to become a complete replacement for Adobe Flash. The project collapsed in mid 2007, though people are now discussing reviving or continuing it,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unfreeze.net/?page_id=52|title=UIRA, Unfreeze |accessdate=2008-04-21|date=2008-04-20|publisher=unfreeze.net}}</ref> and a few other projects like [http://osflash.org/ajaxanimator Ajax Animator] still exist.

===Third-party players===

Since Flash files do not depend on an open standard such as SVG, this reduces the incentive for non-commercial software to support the format, although there are [[SWF#External links|several]] third party tools which use and generate the SWF file format. <!-- [[IrfanView]] is capable of playing SWF files. - Yes, but this uses the Flash plugin - as is mentioned in the about section of its swf player -->[[Flash Player]] cannot ship as part of a pure [[open source]], or completely free operating system, as its distribution is bound to the [http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/open/licensing/ Macromedia Licensing Program] and subject to approval.

There is, as of late 2008, no complete free software replacement which offers all the functionality of the latest version of Adobe Flash Player.

Presenting the [[free software movement]], [[Richard Stallman]] stated in a speech in October 2004 that:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1647626314188526128&ei=LkqgSbfhIYva2gLUotGRDg&hl=un
|title=Richard Stallman on The free software movement and its challenges
|accessdate=2009-02-21
|publisher=Google Video
|location=Australian National University, Canberra, Australia}}</ref>
<blockquote>The use of Flash in websites is a major problem for our community.</blockquote>

Stallman's argument then was that no [[#Playback|free players]] were comparatively good enough. As of February 2010, [[Gnash]] and [[Swfdec]] have seen limited success in competing with Adobe's player. Many important and popular websites require users to have a Flash player, sometimes with no fallback for non-Flash web users. Therefore, the lack of a good free Flash player is arguably an obstacle to enjoying the web with free software, and the aforementioned ubiquity of Flash makes the problem very evident for anyone who tries. The continual high ranking of Gnash on the Free Software Foundation's list of high priority projects<ref>{{Cite document|url=http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority.html|publisher=Free Software Foundation|title=High Priority Free Software Projects|accessdate=2009-07-09|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> might indicate the severity of the problem, as judged by the free software community.

[[Gnash]] is an active project that aims to create a free player and browser plugin for the Adobe Flash file format and so provide a free alternative to the Adobe Flash Player under the GNU General Public License. Despite potential patent worries because of the proprietary nature of the files involved,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hudson |first=Paul |year=2008 |month=July |title=Quick as a Gnash |journal=Linux Format |issue=107 |pages=48–49 |accessdate=2008-07-20 |quote=What happened is this little thing called "software patents".
