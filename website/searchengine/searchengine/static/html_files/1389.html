Reportedly, the damages caused by the ring are in the millions of dollars range.  On October 8, 2007, Petrov, Maksakov, Stenanov were found guilty and were sentenced to eight years in prison in the [[Russian Federation]] and a 100,000 [[ruble]] penalty.<ref>{{ cite web | date=2006-10-04 |url=http://www.kommersant.com/page.asp?id=709912 | title=Eight Years for Extorting Millions | publisher = Kommersant}}</ref>
