==Biography==
Brudno developed the "mathematics/machine interface" for the [http://www.computer-museum.ru/english/m2.htm M-2] computer constructed in 1952 at the Krzhizhanovskii laboratory of the Institute of Energy of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name="LY"/><ref name="M-2"/> He was a great friend of [[Alexander Kronrod]].

Brudno's work on alpha-beta was published in 1963 in Russian and English.

The algorithm was used in computer [[chess]] program written by [[Georgy Adelson-Velsky]] and others at the [[Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics]] (ITEF or ITEP). According to Monty Newborn and the [[Computer History Museum]], the algorithm was used later in [[Kaissa]] the world computer chess champion in 1974.

==Early alpha-beta==
[[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert Simon]] who used what [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] calls an "approximation"<ref name="JMC"/> in 1958 wrote that alpha-beta "appears to have been reinvented a number of times".<ref name="NS"/> [[Arthur Samuel]] had an early version and Richards, Hart, Levine and/or Edwards found alpha-beta independently in the [[United States]].<ref name="Richard-Hart"/>{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} McCarthy proposed similar ideas during the [[Dartmouth Conference]] in 1956 and suggested it to a group of his students including [[Alan Kotok]] at MIT in 1961.<ref name="AIM41"/> [[Donald Knuth]] and Ronald W. Moore refined the algorithm In 1975<ref name="Knuth-Moore"/><ref name="Abramson"/> and it continued to be advanced.
