'''A86''' is a compact commercial [[Assembly language#Assembler|assembler]] developed for the [[Intel]] [[x86]] family of [[microprocessor]]s by [[Eric Isaacson]].  The assembler can directly produce a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]/[[DOS]] compatible [[.COM]] or [[Object file|.OBJ]] files from a simple text source file.  It uses a slightly simpler [[Syntax of programming languages|syntax]] for source code than that used by other assemblers, and it is [[Optimization (computer science)|optimize]]d for maximum speed at both assembly and [[Run time (computing)|run times]].  It comes with a [[debugger]], '''D86'''.<ref name="A86">{{cite web|url=http://eji.com/a86/|title=A86/A386 assembler and D86/D386 debugger|date=2008|accessdate=2008-07-02|author=Eric Isaacson}}</ref><ref name="WhichAsm">{{cite web|url=http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/WhichAsm.html|title=Which Assembler is the Best?|accessdate=2008-05-18|author=Randall Hyde}}</ref>

A86/D86 target [[16-bit]] x86 platforms.  The companion products '''A386''' and '''D386''' are designed for [[32-bit]] platforms.<ref name="A86"/><ref name="WhichAsm"/>

The A86 assembler was the first programming tool to automatically embed a "signature" into the code which it generated. Through its choice of instructions (many of which are functionally equivalent), it was possible to distinguish between registered and unregistered versions of the assembler, although access to the source code was required.<ref name="El-Khalil">{{cite book | last1 = El-Khalil | first1 = Rakan | last2 = Keromyti | first2 = Angelos D. | year = 2004 | chapter = Hydan: Hiding Information in Program Binaries | editors = Lopez, Javier; Qing, Sihan; Okamoto, Eiji | title = Information and communications security: 6th International Conference, ICICS 2004, Malaga, Spain, October 27-29, 2004 : Proceedings | series = Lecture notes in computer science | volume = 3269 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | location =  | isbn = 3540235639 | page = 190 }}</ref>
