<html> <head> <title>A2100</title></head><body>The '''A2100''' is a [[communications satellite]] [[spacecraft]] made by [[Lockheed Martin Space Systems]] for [[telecommunications]] in [[geosynchronous orbit]].

The [[Lockheed Martin]] A2100 geosynchronous spacecraft series is designed for a variety of telecommunications needs including [[Ka-band]] [[broadband]] and [[broadcast]] services, fixed satellite services in [[C-band]] and Ku-band payload configurations, high-power direct broadcast services using the Ku-band [[frequency spectrum]], and mobile satellite services using [[UHF]], [[L-band]] and [[S-band]] payloads.<ref>[http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sat/lockheed_a2100.htm skyrocket.de "Lockheed Martin: A2100"]</ref> 

The A2100 satellite system was developed by a [[Skunk Works]] team at the Astro Space East Windsor, New Jersey facility.  A group of design Architects, including Brian Stewart, John Close, Pete Wise and Keith Davies delivered a flexible common bus with substantially fewer components, lower spacecraft weight, and reduced customer delivery time.  Jim Wilson led a team from GE's corporate r&d lab located in Niskayuna, NY, which helped with several technology underpinnings which advanced the A2100 design.

The first A2100 satellite, AMC-1, was launched September 8, 1996. Since then, over 30 A2100 based satellites have been launched and have totalled over 200 years of on-orbit service.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2008/space-080212-lockheed-martin01.htm globalsecurity.org "Lockheed Martin-Built A2100 Satellite Fleet Achieves 200 Years In Orbit"]</ref>

Lockheed Martin's highly reliable A2100 telecommunications satellite series has received several industry awards for reliability in its history, including Frost and Sullivan's Satellite Reliability Award for excellence in the production of flexible and reliable communications satellites used in geosynchronous Earth orbit.<ref>[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Lockheed_Martin_Built_EchoStar_X_Satellite_Launched_Successfully.html www.spacedaily.com "Lockheed Martin Built EchoStar X Satellite Launched Successfully"]</ref><ref>[http://www.lockheedmartin.com/news/press_releases/2004/LockheedMartinSatelliteReliabilityH.html "Frost & Sullivan Award]</ref>

The A2100 series is modular and can be configured in different sizes: 

*A2100A = 1 to 4 [[kW]] 
*A2100AX = 4 to x kW 
*A2100AXS: enhanced A2100AX 
*A2100AXX : stretched version for mobile communications 
*Additionally there is an A2100M version, which fulfills military requirements.
