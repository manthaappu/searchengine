'''ARX''' was a [[Mach-like]] [[operating system]] written in [[Modula-2+]] developed by [[Acorn Computers Ltd]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and the Acorn Research Centre (ARC) and Software Technololgy Laboratory and later Olivetti Research Center (ORC, when Olivetti bought out Acorn) at [[Palo Alto]] for their new [[ARM architecture|ARM]] [[RISC]] [[central processing unit|processors]] based [[Acorn Archimedes|Archimedes]] computers range.

ARX was a pre-emptive [[computer multitasking|multitasking]], [[Thread (computer science)|multithreading]], multi-user operating system. Much of the OS ran in [[user mode]] and as a result suffered performance problems due to switches into [[kernel mode]] to perform [[mutex]]es, which led to the introduction of the SWP instruction to the instruction set of the ARM3 version of the ARM processor. It had support of optical ([[Write Once Read Many|WORM)]] disks file system <ref name=AppManagRCAc /> and featured a window system, a window toolkit (and a direct manipulation [[User Interface]] editor<ref name=BTLTSARC>{{Cite web

}}</ref>) and an InterScript-based text editor. The OS had to be fitted in a 512KB [[ROM image]] <ref name=FAMLA500>{{Cite web

}}</ref>. This suggests that ARX had a [[microkernel]]-type design.

It was not finished in time to be fitted to the Acorn Archimedes range of computers, which shipped in 1987 with the [[Arthur (operating system)|Arthur]] operating system, derived from the earlier [[Acorn MOS|MOS]] operating system from Acorn's earlier [[8-bit]] [[BBC Micro]] range. Arthur was later superseded by [[RISC OS]].

The Acorn Research Centre was bought out by [[Olivetti]].
