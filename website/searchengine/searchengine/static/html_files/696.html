'''''About Time''''' (ISBN 0-684-81822-1) is the second [[book]] written by [[Paul Davies]], regarding the subject of [[time]].  The intended audience is the general public, rather than science academics.

''About Time'' explores selected mysteries of [[spacetime]], following on from [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]], which Davies believes does not fully explain time as humans experience it. The author explains <blockquote>
Important though Einstein's time turned out to be, it still did not solve "the riddle of time".
</blockquote>

The book delves into the nature of [[metaphysics]], time, motion and [[gravity]], covering a wide range of aspects surrounding the current [[cosmological]] [[debate]], across 283 pages in great detail. It includes an [[Index (publishing)|index]], a [[bibliography]], and numerous [[diagram]]s.
