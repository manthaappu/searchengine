__NOTOC__ <!-- this hides the "Table of Contents", remove this as soon as there is a lot of content or many paragraphs with headings -->

'''Admon''' is a [[Zabbix]]-based [[open-source]] [[computer system]] and [[network monitoring]] [[application software]]. It watches [[node (networking)|host]]s and services specified by users, alerting them via e-mail or short-message service when issues arise.

Created under [[Zabbix]] v1.1.1 beta, Admon was modified to run under [[Linux]] only, but it also runs on other [[Unix]] variants. Admon is [[free software]] licensed under a [[GNU General Public License]], version 2, as published by the [[Free Software Foundation]].

Compared to Zabbix, most of the original functions have been shrunk, including supports for windows, multiple databases, [[simple network management protocol]], and auto-discovery; and only some core functions are reserved. Its alerting subsystem has been rewritten for easier use in large-scale networks. Admon is a smart version of Zabbix, and more reliable. {{Fact|date=January 2009}}  It is maintained by [http://admon.org/ Admon.org].
