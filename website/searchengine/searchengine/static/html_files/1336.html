'''Albatros''' is the name of a [[joystick]] produced by Alberici S.p.a. It was sold in the 1980s on the Italian market. The joystick had six [[microswitch]]es, four for the lever and two for the buttons, together with an audible feedback.

A first series was produced with a slim [[frustum]] [[cone (geometry)|cone]] lever. The second production featured a sphere on the top of a larger lever.
