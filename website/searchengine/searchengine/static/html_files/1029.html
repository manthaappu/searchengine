The '''adjoint state method''' is a [[numerical method]] for computing the [[gradient]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] or [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] in a numerical optimization problem.  It has applications in [[geophysics]] and [[seismic imaging]].

The adjoint state space is chosen to simplify the physical interpretation of equation constraints.<ref name='symes_tr94'>Alain Sei & William Symes.

Expanded Abstracts, 65th Annual [[Society of Exploration Geophysicists]] (SEG) Meeting and Exposition, pages 1351â€“1354 ([http://www.caam.rice.edu/caam/trs/94/TR94-15.pdf Available online])</ref> It may take the form of a [[Hilbert space]].

Adjoint state techniques allow the use of [[integration by parts]], resulting in a form which explicitly contains the physically interesting quantity.  An adjoint state equation is introduced, including a new unknown variable.
