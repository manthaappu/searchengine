<html> <head> <title>Access structure</title></head><body>'''Access structures''' are used in the study of security system where multiple parties need to work together to obtain a resource. Groups of parties that are granted access are called qualified. In [[set theory|set theoretic]] terms they are referred to as qualified sets. In turn, the set of all such qualified sets is called the access structure of the system. Less formally it is a description of who needs to cooperate with whom in order to access the resource. In its original use in [[cryptography]], the resource was a secret [[secret sharing|shared]] among the participants. Only subgroups of participants contained in the access structure, are able to join their shares to recompute the secret. More generally, the resource can also be a task that a group of people can complete together, such as creating a [[digital signature]], or decrypting an encrypted message.

It is reasonable to assume that access structures are [[monotone]] in the sense that, if a subset S is in the access structure, all sets that contain S as a subset should also form part of the access structure.
