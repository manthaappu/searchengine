'''Albert Gonzalez''' (born 1981) is a [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacker]] and [[computer criminal]] who is accused of masterminding the combined [[credit card theft]] and subsequent reselling of more than 170 million card and [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] [[Bank card number|numbers]] from 2005 through 2007—the biggest such fraud in history.

Gonzalez and his accomplices used [[SQL injection]] techniques to create [[malware]] [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoors]] on several corporate systems in order to launch [[packet sniffing]] (specifically, [[ARP Spoofing]]) attacks which allowed him to [[Hacker (computer security)|steal computer data]] from internal corporate networks.

During his spree he was said to have thrown himself a $75,000 birthday party and complained about having to count $340,000 by hand after his [[currency-counting machine]] broke.  Gonzalez stayed at lavish hotels but his formal homes were modest.<ref name="MiamiHerald">[http://www.miamiherald.com/460/story/1198469.html From snitch to cyberthief of the century – Miami Herald – August 22, 2009]</ref>

Gonzalez had three federal indictments:
*May 2008 in [[New York]] for the Dave & Busters case (trial schedule September 2009)
*May 2008 in [[Massachusetts]] for the TJ Maxx case (trial scheduled early 2010)
*August 2009 in [[New Jersey]] in connection with the Heartland Payment case.

On March 25, 2010, Gonzalez was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison.

==Early life==
His parents, who had immigrated to the United States from [[Cuba]] in the 1970s, bought him his first computer when he was 8.  By the age of 9 he was reported to be actively removing [[computer virus]]es.<ref name="Young">[http://www.miamiherald.com/460/story/1193994.html Miami hacker in credit card scam honed skills at early age – Miami Herald – August 20, 2009]</ref>

Gonzalez, a Cuban-American, attended [[South Miami High School]] in [[Miami, Florida]], where he was described as the "troubled" pack leader of computer nerds.<ref name="NYDN" />  In his senior year at the school he and friend used the library computer to hack into system of the government of [[India]] where they left messages about their culture. Reportedly India had to cancel government checks as a result.  Gonzalez was not charged and was warned to stay away from a computer for six months.<ref name="Young" />
In 2000 he moved to [[New York City]] where he lived for three months before moving to [[Kearny, New Jersey]].

==Shadowcrew==
{{main|ShadowCrew}}
While in Kearny he was accused of being the mastermind of a group of hackers called the  Shadowcrew group, which trafficked in 1.5 million stolen credit and ATM card numbers.<ref>[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9136787/Government_informant_is_called_kingpin_of_largest_U.S._data_breaches Government informant is called kingpin of largest U.S. data breaches – Computer World – August 18, 2009]</ref> Although considered the mastermind of the scheme (operating on the site under the screen name of "CumbaJohnny"), he was not indicted.<ref name="usdoj.gov">[http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nj/press/files/pdffiles/firewallindct1028.pdf#search=%22firewallindct1028.pdf%22 Grand jury indictment of Shadowcrew]</ref> According to the indictment there were 4,000 people who registered with the Shadowcrew.com website. Once registered they could buy stolen account numbers or counterfeit documents at auction or read  “Tutorials and How-To’s” describing the use of [[cryptography]] in magnetic strips on credit cards, debit cards and ATM cards so that the numbers could be used.<ref name="usdoj.gov" /> Moderators of the website punished members who did not abide by the site's rules including providing refunds to buyers if the stolen card numbers proved invalid.<ref name="usdoj.gov" />

In addition to the card numbers, numerous other objects of identity theft were sold at auction, including counterfeit passports, drivers’ licenses, Social Security cards, credit cards, debit cards, birth certificates, college student identification cards, and health insurance cards.<ref name="usdoj.gov" /> One member sold 18 million e-mail accounts with associated usernames, passwords, dates of birth, and other personally identifying information. Most of those indicted were members who actually sold illicit items. Members who maintained or moderated the website itself were indicted including one who attempted to [[domain registration|register]] the [[.cc]] [[domain name]] Shadowcrew.cc<ref name="usdoj.gov" />

The Secret Service dubbed their investigation "Operation Firewall" and is believed that $4.3 million was stolen as Shadowcrew shared its information with other groups entitled Carderplanet and Darkprofits.  The investigation involved units from the United States, [[Bulgaria]], [[Belarus]], [[Canada]], [[Poland]], [[Sweden]], [[the Netherlands]] and [[Ukraine]].<ref>[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/97017/Secret_Service_busts_online_organized_crime_ring Secret Service busts online organized crime ring – Computerworld – October 28, 2004]</ref> Gonzalez was initially charged with possession of 15 fake credit and debit cards<ref name="MiamiHerald"/> in [[Newark, New Jersey]], though he avoided jailtime by providing evidence to the [[United States Secret Service]] against his cohorts. 19 ShadowCrew members were indicted.<ref name="MiamiHerald"/> He then returned to Miami.<ref name="usdoj.gov" />

==TJX Companies==
While cooperating with authorities, he was said to have masterminded the hacking of [[TJX Companies]] in which 45.6 million credit and debit card numbers were stolen over an 18 month period ending in 2007 topping the 2005 breach of 40 million records at [[CardSystems Solutions]].<ref name="TJX">[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9014782/TJX_data_breach_At_45.6M_card_numbers_it_s_the_biggest_ever TJX data breach: At 45.6M card numbers, it's the biggest ever – Computerworld – March 29, 2007]</ref> Gonzalez and 10 others sought targets while [[wardriving]] and seeking vulnerabilities in [[wireless network]]s along [[U.S. Route 1]] in Miami.  They compromised cards at [[BJ's Wholesale Club]], [[DSW]], [[Office Max]], [[Boston Market]], [[Barnes & Noble]], [[Sports Authority]] and [[T.J. Maxx]].<ref name="DOJMASS">[http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/ma/Press%20Office%20-%20Press%20Release%20Files/IDTheft/Gonzalez,%20Albert%20-%20Indictment%20080508.pdf Grand jury indictment, District of Massachusetts]</ref>

The indictment referred to Gonzalez by the [[User (computing)|screen names]] "cumbajohny", "[[The Soup Nazi|soupnazi]]", "segvec", "kingchilli" and "stanozlolz."<ref name="DOJMASS" />

The hacking was an embarrassment to TJ Maxx, which discovered the breach in December 2006. The company initially believed the intrusion began in May 2006, but further investigation revealed breaches dating back to July 2005.<ref name="TJX" />

One of his co-conspirators was 7-foot-tall Stephen Watt, known in the hacker world as "Unix Terrorist" and "Jim Jones." Watt worked at [[Morgan Stanley]] in New York City and wrote the sniffer program.<ref>{{ cite news | url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/06/watt | title=TJX Hacker Was Awash in Cash; His Penniless Coder Faces Prison | date= June 18, 2009 | publisher= ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' }}</ref>

==Arrest==
Gonzalez was arrested on May 7, 2008 on charges stemming from hacking into the [[Dave & Buster's]] corporate network from a [[point of sale]] location at a restaurant in [[Islandia, New York]].  The incident occurred in September 2007. About 5,000 card numbers were stolen.  Fraudulent transactions totaling $600,000 were reported on 675 of the cards.<ref name="D&B">[http://www.csoonline.com/article/357068/Three_Charged_in_Dave_Buster_s_Hacking_Job Three Charged in Dave & Buster's Hacking Job – csoonline.com – May 24, 2008]</ref>

Authorities became suspicious after the conspirators kept returning to the restaurant to reintroduce their hack because it would not restart after the company computers shut down.<ref name="D&B" />

Gonzalez was arrested in Room 1508 at the [[National Hotel]]<ref>[http://www.suntimes.com/news/nation/1729726,CST-NWS-hack23.article No hack as a hacker – Chicago Sun Times – August 23, 2009]</ref> in [[Miami Beach, Florida]]. In various related raids authorities seized $1.6 million in cash (including $1.1 million in plastic bags in a three-foot drum buried in his parents' backyard),<ref name="MiamiHerald"/> his laptops and a compact [[Glock pistol]].<ref name="NYDN">[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/us_world/2009/08/19/2009-08-19_soupnazi_nerdy_past.html 'Soupnazi' hacker Albert Gonzalez went from nerdy past to life of sex, guns and drugs – New York Daily News – August 19, 2009]</ref>

Officials said that Gonzalez lived in a nondescript house in Miami.<ref name="NYDN" />

He was in the [[Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn|Metropolitan Detention Center]] in [[Brooklyn]] when he was indicted in the Heartland attacks.

==Heartland Payment Systems==
In August 2009 Gonzalez was indicted in Newark, New Jersey on charges dealing with hacking into the [[Heartland Payment Systems]], [[Citibank]]-branded [[7-Eleven]] ATM's and [[Hannaford Brothers]] computer systems.  Heartland bore the bulk of the attack in which 130 million card numbers were stolen.  Hannaford had 4.6 million numbers stolen.  Two other retailers were not disclosed in the indictment however Gonzalez's attorney told [[StorefrontBacktalk]] that two of the retailers were [[J.C. Penney]] and [[Target Corporation]].<ref>[http://www.storefrontbacktalk.com/securityfraud/j-c-penney-target-added-to-list-of-gonzalez-retail-victims/ J.C. Penney, Target Added To List Of Gonzalez Retail Victims – StorefontBackTalk – August 27, 2009]</ref> Heartland reported that it had lost $12.6 million in the attack including legal fees.<ref>[http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/08/tjx-hacker-charged-with-heartland/TJX Hacker Charged With Heartland, Hannaford Breaches – wired.com – August 17, 2009]</ref>  Gonzalez allegedly called the scheme "Operation Get Rich or Die Tryin."<ref name="MiamiHerald"/>

According to the indictment the attacks by Gonzalez and two unidentified hackers "in or near [[Russia]]" along with unindicted conspirator "P.T." from Miami began on December 26, 2007, at [[Heartland Payment Systems]], August 2007 against 7-Eleven and Hannaford Brothers in November 2007 and two other unidentified companies.<ref name="DOJNJ">[http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nj/press/press/files/pdffiles/GonzIndictment.pdf Grand jury indictment, District of New Jersey]</ref>
Gonzalez and his co-horts targeted large companies and studied their check out terminals and then attacked the companies from internet-connected computers in New Jersey, Illinois, [[Latvia]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Ukraine]].

They covered their attacks over the Internet using more than one messaging screen name, storing data related to their attacks on multiple Hacking Platforms, disabling programs that logged inbound and outbound traffic over the Hacking Platforms, and disguising, through the use of “[[Proxy server|proxies]],” the Internet Protocol addresses from which their attacks originated.<ref name="DOJNJ" />

The indictment said the hackers tested their program against 20 [[anti virus programs]].

Rene Palomino Jr., attorney for Gonzalez, charged in a blog on the ''New York Times'' website that the indictment arose out of squabbling among U.S. Attorney offices in New York, Massachusetts and New Jersey.  Palomino said that Gonzalez was in negotiations with New York and Massachusetts for a plea deal in connection with the T.J. Maxx case when New Jersey made its indictment.  Palomino identified the unindicted conspirator "P.T." as Damon Patrick Toey who had pled guilty in the T.J. Maxx case.  Palomino said Toey rather than Gonzalez was the ring leader of the Heartland case.  Palomino further said, “Mr. Toey has been cooperating since Day One. He was staying at (Gonzalez’s) apartment. This whole creation was Mr. Toey’s idea...It was his baby. This was not Albert Gonzalez. I know for a fact that he wasn’t involved in all of the chains that were hacked from New Jersey.”<ref>[http://www.storefrontbacktalk.com/securityfraud/gonzalez-case-raises-very-oid%E2%80%94and-very-frightening%E2%80%94retail-security-issues/ Gonzalez Case Raises Very OId Retail Security Issues – Storefrontbacktalk.com – August 23, 2009]</ref>

Palomino said one of the unnamed Russian hackers in the Heartland case was [[Maksym Yastremskiy]] who was also indicted in the T.J. Maxx but is now serving 30 years in a [[Turkey|Turkish]] prison on a charge of hacking Turkish banks in a separate matter.<ref>[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/19/accused-hackers-lawyer-criticizes-federal-prosecutors/?hpw Hacking Suspect’s Lawyer Criticizes Federal Prosecutors – nytimes.com – August 19, 2009]</ref>  Investigators said  Yastremskiy and Gonzalez exchanged 600 messages and that Gonzalez paid him $400,000 through [[e-gold]].<ref name="MiamiHerald"/>

Yastremskiy was arrested in July 2007 in Turkey on charges of hacking into 12 banks in [[Turkey]].  The Secret Service investigation into him was used to build the case against Gonzalez including a [[sneak and peek warrant|sneak and peek]] covert review of Yastremskiy's laptop in [[Dubai]] in 2006 and a review of the [[disk image]] of the Latvia computer leased from [[Cronos IT]] and alleged to have been used in the attacks.<ref>[http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/08/gonzalez-evidence/ In Gonzalez Hacking Case, a High-Stakes Fight Over a Ukrainian’s Laptop – Wired – August 20, 2009]</ref>

After the indictment Heartland issued a statement saying that it does not know how many card numbers were stolen from the company and that it does not know how the U.S. government reached the 130 million number.<ref>[http://www.storefrontbacktalk.com/securityfraud/gonzalez-the-al-capone-of-cyber-thieves/ Gonzalez: The Al Capone Of Cyber Thieves? – storefrontbacktalk.com – August 19, 2009]</ref>

==Plea bargain==
On August 28, 2009, his attorney filed papers with the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts]] in Boston indicating that he would plead guilty to all 19 charges in the U.S. v. Albert Gonzalez, 08-CR-10223, case (the TJ Maxx case).  According to reports this [[plea bargain]] would "resolve" issues with the New York case of U.S. v. Yastremskiy, 08-CR-00160 in [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York]] (the Dave and Busters case).

Gonzalez could serve a term of 15 years to 25 years. He would forfeit more than $1.65 million, a condominium in Miami, a blue 2006 [[BMW 330i]] automobile, [[IBM]] and [[Toshiba]] laptop computers, a Glock 27 firearm, a [[Nokia]] cell phone, a [[Tiffany]] diamond ring and three [[Rolex]] watches. 

His sentence would run concurrent with whatever comes out of the case in the [[United States District Court for the District of New Jersey]] (meaning that he would serve the longest of the sentences he receives).<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/29/technology/29hacker.html Man Accused of Stealing Stores’ Data Pleads Guilty – New York Times – August 29, 2009]</ref><ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aXHW5gbDC0EA Computer Hacker Gonzalez to Admit Guilt, Forfeit $1.65 Million – Bloomberg – August 29, 2009]</ref>

In March 2010, he received two concurrent 20 year terms.<ref name="NYTimesMag">{{cite news |title=The Great Cyberheist |author=James Verini |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=November 10, 2010 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/14/magazine/14Hacker-t.html |accessdate=November 14, 2010}}
