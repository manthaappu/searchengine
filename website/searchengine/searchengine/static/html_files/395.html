<html> <head> <title>ALGOL Y</title></head><body>'''ALGOL Y''' was the name given to a speculated successor for the [[ALGOL 60 programming language]] that incorporated some radical features that were rejected for [[ALGOL 68]] and [[ALGOL X]]. ALGOL Y was intended to be a "radical reconstruction" of ALGOL.

One such feature was the possibility to construct new <code>proc mode</code>'s at [[run-time]], which was criticized as the ability to ''modify its own programs at run time'' while, on the other hand, it would have brought ALGOL Y to the same level of expressiveness as [[LISP]].
