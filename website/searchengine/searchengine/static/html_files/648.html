'''A#''' (A sharp) is an [[object-oriented (programming)|object-oriented]] [[functional (programming)|functional]] [[programming language]] distributed as a separable component of Version 2 of the [[Axiom computer algebra system]]. A# types and functions are [[first-class value]]s and can be used freely in conjunction with an extensive library of [[data structure]]s and other mathematical abstractions. A key design guideline for A# was suitability of compilation to portable and efficient machine code.

Development of A# has now switched to the [[Aldor programming language]].

There is both an A# [[optimising compiler]] and an A# [[intermediate code]] interpreter. The compiler can produce any of:
* stand-alone [[executable program]]s
* [[code library|object libraries]] in native [[operating system]] formats
* portable [[bytecode]] libraries
* [[C (programming language)|C]] source code, or
* [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] [[source code]].

Ports have been made to many different architectures (16, 32, and 64 bit):
* [[RS/6000]]
* [[SPARC]]
* [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]]
* [[IA-32]]
* [[Intel 80286|Intel 286]]
* [[Motorola 680x0]]
* [[System/370]]

And to several operating systems:
* [[Linux]]
* [[AIX operating system|AIX]]
* [[SunOS]]
* [[HP-UX]]
* [[NeXTSTEP|NeXT]]
* [[Mach kernel|Mach]]
* plus a variety of other [[Unix]] systems
* [[OS/2]]
* [[DOS]]
* [[Microsoft Windows]]
* [[Virtual Memory System|VMS]]
* [[VM/CMS]]

The following C compilers are supported: [[GNU Compiler Collection|gcc]], Xlc, [[Sun Studio Compiler Suite|Sun Studio Compiler]], Borland, Metaware and MIPS C.
