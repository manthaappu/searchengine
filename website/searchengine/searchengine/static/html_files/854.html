'''ActivMedia Robotics''', former name of '''MobileRobots Inc''', is a company in [[Amherst, New Hampshire|Amherst]], [[New Hampshire]] that designs and manufactures [[autonomous robot]]s, commercial [[service robot]]s, [[robot software]] and navigation systems for robot developers and manufacturers.<ref>http://www.robots-dreams.com/2006/03/the_story_behin.html</ref>

Founded in 1995, it was an early developer of [[autonomous robots]] ubiquitous to universities and often the first serious robot used by students involved in learning to be roboticists, as evidenced by the fact that it was chosen by Microsoft as the reference platform on which to implement their new Robotics SDK and is supported by [[ROS]] and Player Stage Robot APIs.

Following in the footsteps of Cybermotion and MDARS-I, the company developed [[security robots]], but with more powerful computers and new autonomous techniques such as SLAM, Monte Carlo/Markov localization and modified value-iterated search path planning to create a new generation of [[autonomous robots]] for delivery and security purposes in hospitals, offices, labs and other buildings.<ref>* [http://search2.foxnews.com/search?access=p&getfields=*&sort=date%3AD%3AS%3Ad1&output=xml_no_dtd&ie=UTF-8&client=my_frontend&filter=0&site=video&proxystylesheet=my_frontend&q= Company Leads the Way in Robot Innovation, 2007-12-12 FOX News video]</ref> 

MobileRobots has also been a pioneer in flexible intelligent AGV applications, designing the Motivity control system used by [http://www.rmtrobotics.com RMT Robotics] to develop its ADAM iAGV (Self-Guided Vehicle), used for complex pick-n-place operations, in conjunction with gantry systems and [[industrial robot]] arms, used in first-tier auto supply factories to move products from process to process in non-linear layouts. Smaller versions also work in semi-conductor plant clean rooms, carrying product from workstation to workstation.

In 2007, the company released a unique omni-directional Seekur security rover. The omni-directional wheels let it drive sideways as well as forwards and back, to perform in tight spaces. In early 2008, Seekur demonstrated autonomous navigation in GPS-blocked spaces around buildings.

In 2009, the company expanded the capabilities of its Motivity robot autonomy to enable fleets to behave more like people, following site-specific traffic rules and varying its speech and other aspects of its "personality" in ways appropriate to its workplace.

On June 14, 2010 MobileRobots Inc. was acquired by [[Adept Technology]]<ref name="adeptacqmobrob">{{cite web| title = Adept Technology Announces Acquisition Of Leading Autonomous Mobile Robot Provider| url =http://go.adept.com/content/adeptacqmobrob06142010 | accessdate    = 2008-07-09}}</ref>. Since then the company has been testing [http://ir.adept.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=522983 mobile conveyor robots] and [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/science/05robots.html?pagewanted=all telepresence systems] for use in corporate and hospital settings.
