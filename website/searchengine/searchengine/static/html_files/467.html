'''AOL Radio powered by CBS Radio''', (formerly '''AOL Radio featuring XM'''), is an online [[radio]] service.

== History ==
AOL Radio can trace its roots to two companies it acquired on June 1, 1999, for $400 million: Spinner.com and Nullsoft.<ref>http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,666492,00.html Nullsoft and Spinner acquisition announcement</ref>  Spinner.com was formerly known as TheDJ.com.  Nullsoft was the maker of the popular [[Winamp]] and [[SHOUTcast]] products.  Both new organizations operated out of the same office in [[San Francisco]].  The Spinner.com brand was retired in July 2003, but exists today as an AOL Music blog and a series of channels on AOL Radio.

AOL Radio launched as Radio@AOL, essentially a re-branded Spinner.com, using technology from [[Real Networks]] on October 16, 2001 as part of the AOL 7.0 software announced that same day.<ref>[http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,669020,00.html] AOL Radio Announcement</ref>

In its first month of operation, AOL reported that 2.2 million members accessed Radio@AOL, making it one of AOL's most popular features.<ref>http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,669108,00.html AOL Radio Launch Announcement</ref>

Initially, Radio@AOL was available only to AOL Members.  On May 22, 2002, AOL released the free Radio@Netscape for non-members<ref>http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,669336,00.html Free AOL Radio Press Release</ref> as part of the new Netscape 7.0 browser.  On August 22, 2002, AOL released Radio@Netscape Plus.<ref>http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,669435,00.html  Radio@Netscape Plus announcement</ref>  Beginning in 2004, AOL started metering Radio@Netscape to allow only two hours of usage per day.  AOL did this to avoid paying copyright royalties and to encourage users to become AOL Members.<ref>http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=15639 AOL Metering Radio@Netscape article at The Inquirer</ref>

On 28 November 2007, AOL announced that they may shut down their web radio services after a 38 percent increase in royalties to air music. Yahoo! and AOL discontinued directing users to their radio sites after [[SoundExchange]], the non-profit performance rights organization that collects royalties on the behalf of sound recording copyright owners (SRCOs) and featured artists for non-interactive digital transmissions, began collecting the higher fees in July.<ref>http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=a0pKOrcpw6yE&refer=us Article concerning royalties issues</ref>

On April 30, 2008, XM and AOL Radio ended their partnership due to the change in Internet royalty rates.<ref>http://journals.aol.com/theradioblog/aolradio/entries/2008/04/30/aol-radio--xm-update-430/1681 04-30-2008 AOL Radio announces end of partnership with XM</ref> On June 10, 2008, a new AOL Radio player debuted with 150 streaming [[CBS Radio]] stations.

On February 4, 2010, AOL Radio banned users outside the U.S. from streaming online radio. An error message points to Last FM. "We're sorry, this station is unavailable from your current location. Instead, enjoy listening to...."<ref>http://www.aolradioblog.com/2010/02/01/a-message-for-international-radio-listeners Announcement concerning international radio listeners</ref>

== Marketing ==

On November 18, 2002, AOL introduced Broadband Radio@AOL.<ref>http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,669580,00.html Broadband Radio@AOL Announcement</ref>  Broadband Radio@AOL was built into the AOL 8.0 software, and was the first AOL Radio offering based on the AOL streaming technology [[Ultravox (software)|Ultravox]].  By 2003, AOL had migrated most of its AOL Radio products to Ultravox.<ref>http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,669962,00.html Ultravox Technology press release</ref> It was released in the UK on October 20, 2003.<ref>http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,670097,00.html UK Release Announcement</ref>

On April 11, 2005, AOL and [[XM Satellite Radio]] joined together to create Radio@AOL featuring XM.<ref>http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,1047989,00.html Radio@AOL featuring AM Announcement</ref>  At the same time, AOL consolidated Radio@AOL and Radio@Netscape as "Radio@AOL featuring XM."  This service was available to AOL members and non-members alike, with twenty XM channels offered (fifty more XM channels require a paying AOL subscription).  Later in 2005, AOL changed the name of Radio@AOL to AOL Radio to align itself with the AOL Music branding.  In July 2005, a web version of AOL Radio was introduced for non-members with unlimited listening.  At the end of 2005, Radio@Netscape was officially retired, with AOL Radio being the official brand.

On April 30, 2008, AOL and [[XM Satellite Radio]] announced the end of their partnership<ref>[http://journals.aol.com/theradioblog/aolradio/entries/2008/04/30/aol-radio--xm-update-430/1681 AOL Radio & XM Update: 4/30<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and the beginning of the new partnership between [[AOL]] and [[CBS Radio]]. The partnership between AOL and CBS Radio would give AOL access to over 150 of CBS Radio's terrestrial stations.

On June 10, 2008 the AOL CBS player for AIM was released. On June 11, 2008, the new AOL CBS Radio player for the web was released.
